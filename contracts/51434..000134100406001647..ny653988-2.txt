Buyer as a capital contribution (who may, in turn, transfer such assets to one
or more subsidiaries). To facilitate these transfers, if and as requested by
Parent, in lieu of transferring an undivided interest in the Acquired Assets to
Parent, Seller shall convey such assets directly to Buyer (or to one or more
subsidiaries of Buyer).

                  Section 2.4 The Purchase Price. Subject to Section 2.9 and
Section 2.10, upon the terms and the satisfaction or, if permissible, waiver, of
the conditions of this Agreement, in consideration of the aforesaid sale,
conveyance, assignment, transfer and delivery to Acquirors of the Assets and the
agreements of Seller set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing, Buyer shall
assume and undertake to pay, perform and discharge the Assumed Liabilities and
the Acquirors shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Seller (or its
designee) for:

                  (a) from Buyer, an amount in cash equal to $1.4 billion less
the Equity Value (the "Base Cash Purchase Price"), as adjusted pursuant to
Section 2.5(b) by the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount and the Estimated
Assumed Indebtedness and less any applicable withholding tax (the "Estimated
Cash Purchase Price"); the Estimated Cash Purchase Price is subject to
adjustment following the Closing pursuant to Section 2.5 and, as so adjusted, is
the Cash Purchase Price, as set forth in Section 2.5(j);

                  (b) from Parent, such number of Units representing 10% of the
outstanding Units of Parent on a fully diluted basis on the Closing Date and the
other rights and obligations set forth in the Amended and Restated Limited
Partnership Agreement (collectively, the "Equity Consideration"); and

                  (c) From Parent, the Profits Interest (together with the Cash
Purchase Price and the Equity Consideration, the "Consideration").

                  Section 2.5 Purchase Price Adjustment.

                  (a) At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer its good faith estimate of (i)
the Net Working Capital as of the Closing Date (the "Estimated Net Working
Capital Amount"), (ii) the Inventories as of the Closing Date (the "Estimated
Inventory Amount"), (iii) the Indebtedness of the Business to be assumed by
Buyer (the "Assumed Indebtedness") as of the Closing Date (the "Estimated
Assumed Indebtedness") and (iv) the Excess Amount and the Schedule of Consigned
Inventory and the components of each such item prepared in accordance with GAAP,
on a basis consistent with the Financial Statements and the Accounting
Methodologies and, in the case of the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount and
Estimated Inventory Amount, subject to Section 2.5(e). Seller's calculation of
the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount and Estimated Assumed Indebtedness
shall be used in determining the Estimated Cash Purchase Price for purposes of
Section 2.4.

                  (b) The Base Cash Purchase Price shall be (i) (x) increased,
if the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount exceeds the Benchmark, by an amount
equal to such excess, or (y) decreased, if the Benchmark exceeds the Estimated
Net Working Capital Amount, by an amount equal to such excess and (ii) decreased
by any amount of the Estimated Assumed Indebtedness (to the extent not included
in the calculation of the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount).

                  (c) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall
prepare and deliver to Seller a statement (the "Adjustment Statement") which
sets forth in reasonable detail the calculation of (i) the Net Working Capital
as of the Closing Date (the "Preliminary Net Working Capital Amount"), (ii) the
Inventories of the Business as of the Closing Date (the "Preliminary Inventory
Amount"), (iii) the Assumed Indebtedness as of the Closing Date (the
"Preliminary Assumed Indebtedness"), and (iv) the Excess Amount and a Schedule
of Consigned Inventory as of the Closing Date (the "Preliminary Consignment
Items"), in each case, from the books and records of the Business. The
Adjustment Statement shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP, on a basis
consistent with the Financial Statements, and the Accounting Methodologies and,
in the case of the Preliminary Net Working Capital Amount and the Preliminary
Inventory Amount, subject to Section 2.5(e). Seller agrees to cooperate with
Buyer in connection with the preparation of the Adjustment Statement and related
information, and shall provide to Buyer such books, records and information as
may be reasonably requested by Buyer from time to time in connection with its
preparation of the Adjustment Statement.

                  (d) The amount of Inventory as of the Closing Date set forth
in the Adjustment Statement shall be based on the Inventory set forth in the
Closing Inventory Report to the extent such items of Inventory are covered by
the Physical Inventory Count, together with changes in Inventory from the date
of the Physical Inventory Count referred to in Section 2.6 below in relation to
the Closing Date and net of any required inventory reserves (with such reserves
being calculated on the same bases as the Adjustment Statement).

                  (e) The amount of Inventories used in the calculation of the
Current Assets, Estimated Net Working Capital, Preliminary Net Working Capital,
Final Net Working Capital, Estimated Inventory Amount, Preliminary Inventory
Amount and the Final Inventory Amount shall not exceed the Inventory Benchmark
applicable for the time period in which the Closing Date occurs.

                  (f) If Seller disagrees with the determination of the
Preliminary Net Working Capital Amount, Preliminary Inventory Amount, the
Preliminary Assumed Indebtedness or the Preliminary Consignment Items, Seller
shall notify Buyer in writing of such disagreement within the thirty (30)
Business Day period immediately following the delivery of the Adjustment
Statement, which notice shall describe the specific nature of any such
disagreement and provide reasonable supporting documentation for such
disagreement. During the thirty (30) Business Day period of its review, Seller
shall have reasonable access to any documents, schedules or work papers used in
the preparation of the Adjustment Statement. Seller agrees that any failure by
it to notify Buyer in writing of any such disagreement prior to end of the
thirty (30) Business Day period immediately following the delivery of the
Adjustment Statement shall be deemed to be an acceptance by Seller of the
Adjustment Statement and shall constitute a complete waiver of any right of
Seller to dispute such Adjustment Statement and Buyer's calculation of the
Preliminary Net Working Capital Amount, Preliminary Inventory Amount, the
Preliminary Assumed Indebtedness and the Preliminary Consignment Items for
purposes of this Agreement.

                  (g) Buyer and Seller agree to negotiate to resolve any such
disagreement regarding the determination of the Preliminary Net Working Capital
Amount, Preliminary Inventory Amount, the Preliminary Assumed Indebtedness or
the Preliminary Consignment Items, and any resolution of such disagreement
agreed to in writing by Buyer and Seller shall be final and binding upon the
parties and their successors and assigns. If Buyer and Seller are unable to
resolve such disagreement identified by Seller pursuant to Section 2.5(f) within
the thirty (30) Business Day period after delivery to Buyer of written notice of
such disagreement by Seller, then the disputed matters shall be referred for
final determination to the Settlement Accountant.

                  (h) Each of Buyer and Seller shall provide a written
submission of their positions on each item in dispute within fifteen (15) days
of the appointment of the Settlement Accountant, with a copy to the other party.
The Settlement Accountant shall consider only those items and amounts as to
which Buyer and Seller have disagreed within the time periods and on the terms
specified above and shall resolve the matter in accordance with the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, including Section 2.5(e). The Settlement
Accountant shall consider only the written submissions provided by Buyer and
Seller pursuant to this paragraph (f) and shall not conduct any independent
investigation or review. The Settlement Accountant is expressly limited to the
selection of either Seller's or Buyer's position on a disputed item or a
position in between the positions of Seller or Buyer based upon written
submissions of Buyer and Seller and it shall thus select as a resolution for
each disputed matter the position of either Buyer or Seller or a position in
between the positions of Seller or Buyer, and the Settlement Accountant may not
impose an alternative resolution outside those bounds. The Settlement Accountant
shall deliver to Buyer and Seller, as promptly as practicable and in any event
within forty-five (45) days after its appointment, a written report setting
forth the resolution of each disputed matter and its determination of the
Preliminary Net Working Capital Amount, Preliminary Inventory Amount, the
Preliminary Assumed Indebtedness and/or the Preliminary Consignment Items
determined in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Such report shall be
final, non-appealable and binding upon the parties to the fullest extent
permitted by Applicable Law and may be enforced in any court having competent
jurisdiction. The forty-five (45) day period for delivering the written report
may be extended by the mutual written consent of the parties or for good cause
shown by the Settlement Accountant at its sole discretion. The fees, expenses
and costs of the Settlement Accountant shall be borne one-half by Buyer and
one-half by Seller.

                  (i) (i) (a) If no dispute notice has been timely delivered by
Seller pursuant to Section 2.5(f), the Preliminary Net Working Capital Amount,
as originally submitted by Buyer, or (b) if a dispute notice has been timely
delivered by Seller pursuant to Section 2.5(f), the Preliminary Net Working
Capital Amount, as determined pursuant to the resolution of such dispute in
accordance with Section 2.5(g) or (h), shall be the "Final Net Working Capital
Amount", (ii) (a) if no dispute notice has been timely delivered by Seller
pursuant to Section 2.5(f), the Preliminary Inventory Amount, as originally
submitted by Buyer, or (b) if a dispute notice has been timely delivered by
Seller pursuant to Section 2.5(f), the Preliminary Inventory Amount, as
determined pursuant to the resolution of such dispute in accordance with Section
2.5(g) or (h), shall be the "Final Inventory Amount", (iii) (a) if no dispute
notice has been timely delivered by Seller pursuant to Section 2.5(f), the
Preliminary Assumed Indebtedness, as originally submitted by Buyer, or (b) if a
dispute notice has been timely delivered by Seller pursuant to Section 2.5(f),
the Preliminary Assumed Indebtedness, as determined pursuant to the resolution
of such dispute in accordance with Section 2.5(g) or (h), shall be the "Final
Assumed Indebtedness", and (iv) (a) if no dispute notice has been timely
delivered by Seller pursuant to Section 2.5(f), the Preliminary Consignment
Items, as originally submitted by Buyer, or (b) if a dispute notice has been
timely delivered by Seller pursuant to Section 2.5(f), the Preliminary
Consignment Items, as determined pursuant to resolution of such dispute in
accordance with Section 2.5(g) or (h), shall be the "Final Consignment Items".

                  (j) The "Final Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount" shall be
the amount equal to (i) the Final Net Working Capital Amount minus (ii) the
Estimated Net Working Capital Amount (it being understood that the Final
Adjustment Amount may be either a positive or negative number).

                  (k) The "Final Assumed Indebtedness Amount" shall be the
amount equal to (i) the Final Assumed Indebtedness minus (ii) the Estimated
Assumed Indebtedness (it being understood that the Final Assumed Indebtedness
Amount may be either a positive or negative number).

                  (l) The "Cash Purchase Price" shall be equal to (i) the
Estimated Cash Purchase Price plus (ii) the Final Net Working Capital Adjustment
Amount (it being understood that the Final Adjustment Amount may be either a
positive or negative number) minus (iii) the Final Assumed Indebtedness Amount
(to the extent not included in the calculation of the Final Net Working Capital
Adjustment Amount; it being understood that the Final Assumed Indebtedness
Amount may be either a positive or negative number).

                  (m) If the Cash Purchase Price exceeds the Estimated Cash
Purchase Price, Buyer shall pay the amount of such excess to Seller. If the
Estimated Cash Purchase Price exceeds the Cash Purchase Price, Seller shall pay
the amount of such excess to Buyer. Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, shall,
within five (5) Business Days after the determination of the Cash Purchase Price
pursuant to this Section 2.5, make payment to the other by wire transfer in
immediately available funds of the amount payable by Buyer or Seller, as the
case may be, in respect of the difference between the Cash Purchase Price and
Estimated Cash Purchase Price, together with interest thereon from the Closing
Date to the date of payment, at a floating rate equal to the U.S. dollar prime
rate per annum, as quoted by The Wall Street Journal from time to time during
such period. Such interest shall be calculated based on a year of 365 days and
the number of days elapsed since the Closing Date.

                  Section 2.6 Inventory. During the period commencing ten (10)
days prior to and ending ten (10) days following the Closing Date, Seller and
Buyer shall conduct a physical count of the Inventory (the "Physical Inventory
Count") as set forth in this Section 2.6. The Inventory to be included in the
Physical Inventory Count shall consist of finished goods, work in progress and
raw materials (excluding wood and stores) at (i) the warehouses of the Business
that contain the five (5) largest quantities of such Inventory and (ii) each of
the Mills, as set forth in greater detail in the Accounting Methodologies under
heading of "Inventories." The results of the Physical Inventory Count shall be
set forth in an inventory report, which shall set forth the aggregate value of
such Inventories as of the Closing Date, including appropriate roll-forward and
roll-back adjustments to physical counts made during such period (the "Closing
Inventory Report"). The Physical Inventory Count shall be conducted by Seller or
representatives of Seller prior to the Closing, and any remaining physical
counts shall be conducted by Buyer or representatives of Buyer after the
Closing, and, at the option of each, shall be observed by and calculated in
consultation with one or more of the other's representatives. The Physical
Inventory Count and valuation of the Inventory shall be conducted on a basis
consistent with the Financial Statements and the Accounting Methodologies.

                  Section 2.7 Consigned Inventory. From and after the Closing
Date, Buyer and Seller covenant and agree as set forth below:

                  (a) In the event that any Consigned Inventory exists as of the
Closing Date, Seller shall retain title to such Consigned Inventory following
the Closing until sold or transferred to Buyer pursuant to the terms of this
Section 2.7. The Consigned Inventory shall be consistent with the Final
Consignment Items.

                  (b) Unless and until any Consignment Inventory is sold
pursuant to this Section 2.7 or transferred by Buyer to a third party in
connection with a sale of Inventory or to a third party service provider for the
provision of services to Buyer, Consigned Inventory shall remain in the
possession and control of Buyer and Buyer shall maintain and insure the
Consigned Inventory in the ordinary course of business consistent with the
manner in which Buyer maintains and insures its own Inventory. In the event of
any loss of or damages to the Consigned Inventory, all insurance proceeds
payable in respect of such Consigned Inventory shall be paid to Seller, net of
any applicable deductibles.

                  (c) Each Schedule of Consigned Inventory shall set forth a
list of each item of Consigned Inventory identified by (i) roll or other
applicable unit and (ii) as to each such roll or unit, the weight in tons, the
Total Cost and the Consigned Price. Buyer shall track sales of such Consigned
Inventory and shall produce a monthly report (the "Consignment Report") setting
forth each roll or unit that was sold during such month and the applicable
Consigned Price.

                  (d) In the event that Buyer sells any Consigned Inventory,
then within ten (10) Business Days following the end of each month in which
sales of Consigned Inventory occurred, Buyer shall remit to Seller in cash an
aggregate dollar amount equal to the sum of the Consigned Prices of all rolls or
units of Consigned Inventory sold by Buyer in such month. Such remittance shall
be accompanied by a Consignment Report for such month.

                  (e) In the event Buyer must deliver additional Consigned
Inventory or Inventory that is not Consigned Inventory to any customer to
replace previously sold Consigned Inventory that is subject to warranty claims
(such previously sold Consigned Inventory, "Warranty Inventory"), then Seller
shall not be entitled to any payment with respect to such Warranty Inventory.
Appropriate adjustment shall be made in respect of any amounts previously
remitted by Buyer to Seller in respect of such Warranty Inventory. In the event
that Buyer delivers to a customer additional Consigned Inventory to replace
Warranty Inventory, such additional Consigned Inventory shall be deemed sold for
purposes of this Section 2.7.

                  (f) Seller and its representatives and advisors shall have the
right to audit the Consignment Report and related remittance provided pursuant
to clauses (b) and (c) above and, upon reasonable notice during normal business
hours, to conduct a physical inventory of the Consigned Inventory, provided
Buyer shall only be required to provide access for one such physical inventory
during any six-month period.

                  (g) If, after the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the
Closing Date, any Consigned Inventory remains in Buyer's possession, title to
such remaining Consigned Inventory shall be transferred to Buyer, at no cost to
Buyer, and Buyer shall have no further obligations pursuant to this Section 2.7,
other than to remit any amounts due to Seller for sales or transfers of
Consigned Inventory that occur prior to the eighteen (18) month anniversary of
the Closing Date.

                  Section 2.8 Allocation of Consideration.

                  (a) Seller and Buyer agree to allocate the Consideration and
the Assumed Liabilities in the manner set forth in Schedule VII hereto
consistent with Section 1060 of the Code. Within 15 days of determination of the
difference between the Base Cash Purchase Price and the Cash Purchase Price
pursuant to Section 2.5 hereof, Buyer shall prepare a revised Consideration
allocation to provide for the allocation of the difference between the Base Cash
Purchase Price and the Cash Purchase Price in a manner that is consistent with
the Consideration allocation set forth in Schedule VII and shall deliver such
revised allocation to Seller for its review and comment.

                  (b) Neither Seller, Buyer nor any of their respective
Affiliates shall file any Tax Return or other document relating to Taxes or
otherwise take any position or agree to take any position relating to Taxes
which is inconsistent with the allocation (including any revision under this
Section 2.8) determined pursuant to this Section 2.8 unless required to do so
pursuant to a Final Determination.

                  Section 2.9 Post-Purchase Price Adjustment Working Capital
Allocations. If, within eighteen (18) months following the determination of the
Final Net Working Capital Amount, (a) Buyer receives or becomes aware that it is
in possession of a payment or other asset that constituted a Current Asset as of
the Closing Date but was not reflected on the statement of Net Working Capital
used to determine the Final Net Working Capital Amount, then Buyer shall
promptly remit such asset to Seller or (b) Buyer becomes aware that it is liable
for an obligation that constituted a Current Liability as of the Closing Date
but was not reflected on the statement of Net Working Capital used to determine
the Final Net Working Capital Amount, then, upon reasonable demonstration of the
foregoing by Buyer, such liability shall be assumed by Seller. If the parties
are unable to reach an agreement as to whether the disputed asset or liability
constituted a Current Asset or Current Liability to be remitted or assumed in
accordance with the foregoing clauses (a) and (b), the parties shall submit the
dispute to the Settlement Accountant for resolution in accordance, mutatis
mutandis, with the provisions set forth in Section 2.5(f).

                  Section 2.10 Proceeds from Right of First Refusal; ARCo
Qualifying Facility Status

                  (a) In the event that Androscoggin Reservoir Company ("ARCo")
or a stockholder of ARCo other than Seller exercises its right of first refusal
pursuant to Article VII of the bylaws of ARCo ("ARCo ROFR") to purchase Seller's
equity interest in ARCo (the "ARCo Shares"), then (a) the Transferred Equity
Interests shall be deemed to exclude the ARCo Shares for all purposes of this
Agreement and (b) the proceeds paid to Seller in connection with the exercise of
such right of first refusal and sale of the ARCo Shares shall be transferred to
Buyer at Closing. The price of the ARCo Shares offered to a transferee pursuant
to the foregoing right of first refusal shall be mutually agreed upon by Buyer
and Seller.

                  (b) In the event the ARCo ROFR is not exercised then:

                           (i) Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to
         cause ARCo to file pursuant to FERC's regulations at 18 CFR Part 292
         prior to Closing a self recertification for qualifying facility status
         of the hydroelectric generating facility owned by ARCo ("ARCo QF
         Recertification") to clarify that the certain transmission line lease
         entered into between ARCo and Central Maine Power Company on March 11,
         2004 ("ARCo Transmission Lease"), is a part of the qualifying facility
         owned by ARCo. Seller shall keep Buyer informed of the status of the
         ARCo QF Recertification application in accordance with Section 6.3.

                           (ii) If the ARCo QF Recertification shall not have
         been filed as of the Closing Date, or if the ARCo QF Recertification is
         filed but does not clarify to the reasonable satisfaction of Buyer that
         the ARCo Transmission Lease is a part of the ARCo qualifying facility,
         the ARCo Shares shall not be transferred to Buyer and the parties agree
         that until such time as the ARCo QF Recertification is filed, the QF
         Recertification clarifies to the reasonable satisfaction of Buyer that
         the ARCo Transmission Lease is a part of the ARCo qualifying Facility
         and the ARCo Shares are transferred to Buyer as set forth in clause
         (iii) below, Buyer shall reimburse Seller for documented expenses
         arising from Seller's ownership of the ARCo Shares and Seller shall
         deliver to Buyer any dividends or other proceeds or benefits arising
         from its ownership of the ARCo Shares.

                           (iii) If the Closing shall have occurred and the ARCo
         QF Recertification shall not yet have been filed or if the ARCo
         Recertification filed does not clarify to the reasonable satisfaction
         of Buyer that the ARCo Transmission Lease is a part of the ARCo
         qualifying facility, then (x) Seller shall continue to use its

                    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER

                  Except as disclosed in a separate disclosure letter, a copy of
which is being delivered by Seller to the Acquirors with this Agreement (the
"Seller Disclosure Letter"), Seller hereby represents and warrants to the
Acquirors as follows:

                  Section 4.1 Organization. Each Seller Participant is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws
of its State of incorporation and each of the Seller Participants has all
requisite corporate power and corporate authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and assets used in the Business and to carry on the Business as it is
now being conducted. The Seller Participants are duly qualified or licensed to
do business in each jurisdiction in which the property owned, leased or operated
by the Seller Participants in the conduct of the Business makes such
qualification necessary, except in any such jurisdictions where the failure to
be duly qualified or licensed would not have or be reasonably likely to have,
either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

                  Section 4.2 Authorization. Seller has the corporate power and
corporate authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements and consummate or cause to be consummated the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby have been duly and validly authorized by the Board of
Directors of Seller and no other corporate proceeding on the part of Seller is
necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby. This Agreement has been, and the Ancillary
Agreements will be, duly executed and delivered by Seller and, assuming the
valid execution and delivery by all counterparties thereto, will constitute a
valid and binding agreement of Seller enforceable against Seller in accordance
with its terms, except to the extent that enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization and other laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity.

                  Section 4.3 Title to Personal Property; Transferred Equity
Interests.

                  (a) Subject to the receipt of any consents or approvals
contemplated by Section 4.4, Seller has good and valid title to all tangible
personal property included in the Acquired Assets, free and clear of all Liens
except for Permitted Liens.

                  (b) Except as set forth in Section 4.3(b) of the Seller
Disclosure Letter, Seller owns of record and beneficially all of the Transferred
Equity Interests, free and clear of all Liens. The Transferred Equity Interests
of the Transferred Subsidiaries are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable and constitute all of the outstanding capital stock of the
Transferred Subsidiaries. Except as set forth in Section 4.3(b) of the Seller
Disclosure Letter, there are no warrants, options, agreements, calls, conversion
rights, exchange rights, preemptive rights or other rights or commitments or
understandings which call for the repurchase or redemption, or issuance, sale,
pledge or other disposition of any shares of capital stock of the Transferred
Subsidiaries or any securities convertible into or other rights to acquire, any
shares of capital stock of the Transferred Subsidiaries. Except as set forth in
Section 4.3(b) of the Seller Disclosure Letter, none of the shares of capital
stock of the Transferred Entities owned by Seller is subject to any voting
trust, transfer restrictions or other similar arrangements that relates to the
voting or control of such capital stock. Upon consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement Seller will deliver to Buyer all the issued and
outstanding capital stock of each Transferred Subsidiary free and clear of all
Liens, other than any Liens arising as a result of action by Buyer.

                  (c) Section 4.3(c) of the Seller Disclosure Letter sets forth
the jurisdiction, date of incorporation, authorized capital stock and capital
stock issued and outstanding for each Transferred Subsidiary.

Disclosure Letter, none of the Transferred Subsidiaries has any Subsidiaries or
holds any equity, partnership, joint venture or similar ownership interest, of
record or beneficially, or has any right or obligation, contingent or otherwise,
to purchase any similar ownership interest.

                  Section 4.4 Consents and Approvals; No Violations;
Governmental Filings.

                  (a) Except as set forth in Section 4.4(a) of the Seller
Disclosure Letter, neither the execution, delivery or performance by Seller of
this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements nor the consummation by the Seller of
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby will (i) conflict with or result
in any breach or violation of any provision of the certificate of incorporation
or by-laws of any Seller Participant; (ii) violate, conflict with or result in a
default (or any event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default) under, or result in any termination, cancellation or

acceleration under, or require any consent under, any bond, note, mortgage or
indenture, contract, agreement, lease, sublease, license, permit, franchise or
other instrument to which any Seller Participant is a party; (iii) violate any
order, injunction, decree, statute, rule or regulation applicable to Seller or
any of the assets or properties of the Business, or (iv) result in the creation
or imposition of any Lien upon any of the assets or properties of the Business,
excluding from the foregoing clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv), such violations,
conflicts, defaults, rights or Liens that would not have or be reasonably likely
to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect or

of any acts or omissions by, or the status of or any facts pertaining to, the
Acquirors.

                  (b) Except as set forth in Section 4.4(b) of the Seller
Disclosure Letter, no filings or registrations with, notifications to, or
authorizations, consents or approvals of, a Governmental Entity (collectively,
"Governmental Filings") are required to be obtained or made by any Seller
Participant in connection with the execution, delivery or performance by Seller
of this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or the consummation by Seller of
the transactions contemplated hereby, except (i) Governmental Filings under the

a result of any acts or omissions by, or the status of or any facts pertaining
to, the Acquirors, and (e) such other Governmental Filings, the failure of which
to be obtained or made would not have or be reasonably likely to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, mortgage, other evidence
of indebtedness, guarantee, license, agreement, lease or other instrument or

conflicts, defaults, rights, security interests, Liens or violations that would
not adversely affect the ability of, or timing for, either of the Acquirors, as
applicable, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements.

                  (b) No Governmental Filings are required to be obtained or

other Governmental Filings, the failure of which to be obtained or made would

Ancillary Agreements.

                  Section 5.4 Capitalization.

                  (a) As of the date hereof, the authorized Equity Interests of
Parent consist of $1,000 of capital, all of which represent General Partner
interests. Except as contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements, there are no outstanding Equity Interests, agreements or other
commitments pursuant to which Parent is or may become obligated to issue any
Equity Interests. All of the outstanding Equity Interests of Parent have been
duly authorized and validly issued. The Profits Interest and the Units to be
issued to Seller pursuant to this Agreement and under the terms of the Amended
and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement will be duly authorized and validly
issued. Other than as set forth above, Parent has no other Equity Interests

trusts or other agreements or understandings to which Parent is bound with
respect to the Equity Interests of Parent.

                  (b) At Closing, Seller will hold Units representing ten
percent of the Equity Interests of Parent, and the Apollo Partners (as such term
is defined in the Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement) will hold
ninety percent of the Equity Interests of Parent, in each case, on a fully
diluted basis.

                  Section 5.5 Availability of Funds. Buyer has or will have

Buyer has received the executed commitment letters attached to Section 5.5 of
the Buyer Disclosure Letter (the "Commitment Letters") with respect to the debt
and equity financing arrangements for the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements (the "Financing"). As of the date of this
Agreement, each of the Commitment Letters is in full force and effect and has
not been amended or rescinded. The aggregate proceeds of the Financing provided
for in the Commitment Letters, together with cash available to Buyer, will be
sufficient to pay the Cash Purchase Price and satisfy the other obligations of
Buyer and its Affiliates necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

                  Section 5.6 Litigation. As of the date hereof, there is no (i)
claim, action, suit, inquiry, judicial or administrative proceeding, arbitration
or investigation pending, or, to Knowledge of the Acquirors, threatened, against
either of the Acquirors or any of their Affiliates by or before any Governmental
Entity or (ii) any order, judgment, writ, injunction or decree of any
Governmental Entity against either of the Acquirors or their Affiliates, or any
of its properties, assets or business operations, in each case, which has
resulted or which could be reasonably likely to result in a prohibition against,
or a material delay in completing, all or any part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements.

                  Section 5.7 Brokers or Finders. No broker, investment banker,
financial advisor or other person, is entitled to any broker's, finder's,
financial advisor's or other similar fee, expenses or commission in connection
with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, except for any such
fee, expense or commission for which the Acquirors will be responsible.

                  Section 5.8 Investment Representations.

                  (a) Buyer is acquiring the Transferred Equity Interests to be
acquired by it hereunder for its own account, solely for the purpose of
investment and not with a view to, or for sale in connection with, any
distribution thereof in violation of the federal securities laws or any
applicable foreign or state securities law.

                  (b) Each of the Acquirors is an "accredited investor" as
defined in Rule 501(a) promulgated under the Securities Act.

                  (c) Each of the Acquirors understands that the acquisition of
the Transferred Equity Interests to be acquired by Buyer pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement involves substantial risk. The Acquirors and their officers
have experience as an investor in securities and equity interests of companies
such as the ones being transferred pursuant to this Agreement and acknowledges
that it can bear the economic risk of its investment and has such knowledge and
experience in financial or business matters that each of the Acquirors is
capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its investment in the Transferred
Equity Interests to be acquired by it pursuant to the transactions contemplated
hereby.

                  (d) Each of the Acquirors understands that the Transferred
Equity Interests to be acquired by Buyer hereunder have not been registered
under the Securities Act on the basis that the sale provided for in this
Agreement is exempt from the registration provisions thereof. Each of the
Acquirors acknowledges that such securities may not be transferred or sold
except pursuant to the registration and other provisions of applicable
securities laws or pursuant to an applicable exemption therefrom.

                  (e) Each of the Acquirors acknowledges that the offer and sale
of the Transferred Equity Interests to be acquired by it in the transactions
contemplated hereby has not been accomplished by the publication of any
advertisement.

                  Section 5.9 Solvency. As of the Closing, assuming satisfaction
or, if permissible, waiver of the conditions of this Agreement, and after giving
effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Financing and the payment of the Consideration, and payment of all related fees
and expenses, each of the Acquirors will be Solvent.

                  Section 5.10 FERC Regulations. Neither Acquiror is (a) a
"public utility," or (b)(i) a "holding company," or (ii) a "holding company" in
a "holding company system" that includes a "transmitting utility" or an
"electric utility," as each of the foregoing terms is defined in the Federal
Power Act, as amended, or the regulations of the FERC promulgated thereunder.

                  Section 5.11 No Implied Representations. Notwithstanding
anything contained in Article IV or any other provision of this Agreement or the
Seller Disclosure Letter, each of the Acquirors acknowledges and agrees that
neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates is making any representation or
warranty whatsoever, express or implied, beyond those expressly given in Article
IV of this Agreement, including no implied warranty of merchantability or
suitability as to the properties or assets of the Business, and it is understood
that, except as otherwise provided in Article IV, each of the Acquirors
acknowledges that the Business is being sold "as is" and "where is." In
addition, each of the Acquirors acknowledges and agrees that any cost estimates,
projections, forecasts and predictions contained or referred to in any materials
that have been provided to either Acquiror are not and shall not be deemed to be
representations or warranties of Seller or its Affiliates.

                  Section 5.12 Private Offering. No form of general solicitation
or general advertising was used by Parent or its representatives in connection
with the offer or sale of the Profits Interest. Subject in part to the truth and
accuracy of each of Parent's representations and warranties set forth in Article
V hereof, no registration of the Profits Interest pursuant to the Securities Act
or any state securities or "blue sky" laws will be required by the offer, sale
or issuance of the Profits Interest. Parent agrees that neither it, nor anyone
acting on its behalf, shall offer to sell the Profits Interest or any other
securities of Parent so as to require the registration of the Profits Interest
pursuant to the provisions of the Securities Act or any state securities or
"blue sky" laws, unless such Profit Interests or other securities are so
registered.

                  Section 5.13 Qualifications for Certain Wastewater Permit
Transfers. To the Knowledge of the Acquirors, there is no reason (related to any
fact or circumstance concerning any of the Acquirors or their Affiliates) that
would cause the Acquirors to believe that any governmental authority would not
permit the transfer of any of the Wastewater Permits to the Acquirors in order
to satisfy the condition contained in Section 7.2(h).

                                   ARTICLE VI

that such entities may take such actions without the consent of Seller):

                           (i) sell, lease, transfer or dispose of any of the

                  Section 6.2 Access to Information.

                  (a) Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date,
Seller shall, and shall cause the Transferred Subsidiaries to, subject to
applicable law, and subject to any applicable restrictions as to confidentiality
(as to which Buyer does not provide indemnification, or the waiver of which
Seller shall not have obtained after using reasonable best efforts): (i) give
Buyer and its authorized representatives reasonable access to books, records,
offices and other facilities and properties and personnel of the Business as
Buyer may reasonably request; (ii) permit Buyer and its authorized
representatives to make such inspections thereof as Buyer may reasonably request
(except that Buyer and its representatives shall specifically be prohibited from
conducting any environmental testing at any property of the Business); (iii)
furnish Buyer and its authorized representatives with such financial and
operating data and other information with respect to the Business as Buyer may
from time to time reasonably request, including such data and benefits
information as is reasonably necessary for Buyer to comply with the provisions
of Section 6.8; and (iv) provide such information and support to Buyer and its
insurance company or broker as is reasonable and customarily required by
insurance companies to conduct analysis and investigation for the purpose of
underwriting insurance policies and binders substantially similar to the
Insurance Policies; provided, however, that any such access shall be provided
after reasonable notice during normal business hours under the supervision of
Seller's personnel and in such a manner as to not interfere unreasonably with
the operations of the Business or the other businesses of Seller or its
Affiliates; and provided, further, that neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates
shall be required to furnish or make available (A) such books, records or data
to the extent that they are subject to a legal privilege that, in the good faith
judgment of Seller, may be lost or impaired by virtue of such disclosure or (B)
any of its Income Tax Returns (including any combined or consolidated Income Tax
Return or any combined or consolidated Tax Returns that include any income or
other Tax items from assets or activities that are not exclusively related to
the Business). In an effort to prevent any interference or disruption caused by
such access, Seller may reasonably limit the number of individuals and the
frequency of visits to its facilities. Buyer shall coordinate all such access
with a Seller employee who will be identified to Buyer promptly after the
execution of this Agreement, and shall not directly or indirectly contact any
other employee of Seller or its Affiliates without the prior approval of the
designated employee. Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall provide to Buyer
accurate and complete information necessary for Buyer to make actuarial
calculations and otherwise assess its liabilities under Section 6.8 of this
Agreement.

                  (b) Subject to applicable law and, subject to any applicable
restrictions as to confidentiality (as to which Buyer does not provide
indemnification, or the waiver of which Seller shall not have obtained after
using reasonable best efforts), any books and records relating to the Business
(which shall include the insurance information described in clause (iv) of
Section 6.2(a)) that are not delivered to Buyer hereunder shall be preserved by
Seller for a period no less than seven (7) years after the Closing Date
(including any legal holds placed on books and records relating to litigated
matters), and will be made available (for review and copying) to Buyer and its
authorized representatives following the Closing at Buyer's expense upon
reasonable notice during normal business hours, and in a manner as to not
unreasonably interfere with the Seller's business to the extent reasonably
required by Buyer, except (A) to the extent that such books and records are
subject to a legal privilege that, upon advice of Seller's counsel and after
taking all reasonable measures to preserve privilege, may be lost or impaired by
virtue of such disclosure or (B) for any of its Tax Returns. During such period,
Seller shall permit, to the extent permitted by law and upon request of Buyer,
Buyer and any of its agents, representatives, advisors or consultants reasonable
access to Employees of Seller related to the Business for information related to
periods up to and including the Closing. In an effort to prevent any
interference or disruption caused by such access, Seller may reasonably limit
the number of individuals and the frequency of visits to its facilities;
provided that Buyer must reasonably be able to accomplish its purposes within a
reasonable amount of time.

                  Section 6.3 Reasonable Best Efforts.

                  (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and
regulations to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements as promptly as practicable
including, without limitation, (i) the preparation and filing of all forms,
registrations and notices required to be filed to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and the taking of
such actions as are necessary to obtain any requisite approvals, consents,
orders, exemptions or waivers by any third party or Governmental Entity,
including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the preparation and
filing of the applications under the Federal Power Act and the regulations of
FERC thereunder jointly seeking FERC approval of the transfer of each of the
FERC Licenses from Seller to Buyer and (ii) using their reasonable best efforts
to cause the satisfaction of all conditions to Closing. Each party shall
promptly consult with the other with respect to, provide any necessary
information with respect to, and provide copies of all filings made by such
party with any Governmental Entity or any other information supplied by such
party to a Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

                  (b) Each party hereto shall promptly inform the other of any
communication from any Governmental Entity regarding any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. If any party or
Affiliate thereof receives a request for additional information or documentary
material from any such Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, then such party shall use its reasonable best
efforts to make, or cause to be made, as soon as practicable and after
consultation with the other party, an appropriate response in compliance with
such request.

                  Section 6.4 Antitrust Consents and Approvals.

                  (a) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings
pursuant to Section 6.3, each of Seller and the Acquirors shall use their
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary under the applicable U.S. and foreign
antitrust or competition laws and regulations ("Competition Laws") to consummate
and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements, including, without limitation, furnishing all information
required by applicable law in connection with approvals of or filings with any
Governmental Entities, including filing, or causing to be filed, as promptly as
practicable, any required notification and report forms (x) under the HSR Act
with the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the United
States Department of Justice or (y) under other applicable non-U.S. laws with
the applicable non-U.S. Governmental Antitrust Entities.

                  (b) If any objections are asserted with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements under
any Competition Law or if any suit or proceeding is instituted or threatened by
any Governmental Entity or any private party challenging any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements as violative of any
Competition Law, each of Seller, Parent and Buyer shall use its reasonable best
efforts to promptly resolve such objections; provided, however, that
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of Seller or
any of its Affiliates shall have any obligation to hold separate or divest any
property or assets of Seller or any of its Affiliates, or to defend against any
lawsuit, action or proceeding, judicial or administrative, challenging this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Acquirors shall, and shall cause
their Affiliates to, take all action, including agreeing to hold separate or to
divest any of the businesses or properties or assets of the Acquirors or any of
their Affiliates (including any Acquired Assets and the Transferred Equity
Interests) and to terminate any existing relationships and contractual rights
and obligations, as may be required (i) by the applicable Governmental Entity in
order to resolve such objections as such Governmental Entity may have to such
transactions under any Competition Law or (ii) by any domestic or foreign court
or other tribunal, in any action or proceeding brought by a private party or
Governmental Entity challenging such transactions as violative of any
Competition Law, in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution,
vacating, lifting, altering or reversal of, any order that has the effect of
restricting, preventing or prohibiting the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements. In addition, the
Acquirors shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, vigorously defend any
action or proceeding brought by a private party or Governmental Entity
challenging the transactions contemplated hereby or by the Ancillary Agreements
as violative of any Competition Law, in order to avoid the entry of, or to
effect the dissolution, vacating, lifting, altering or reversal of, any order
that has the effect of restricting, preventing or prohibiting the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements
(including by pursuing any available appeal process).

                  Section 6.5 Further Assurances.

                  (a) Subject to Sections 6.5(b) and 6.5(c), on and after the
Closing Date, each of Seller, Buyer and Parent shall cooperate and use their
respective reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all appropriate
actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary or appropriate to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the execution of any additional documents or instruments of any kind, the
obtaining of consents which may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to carry
out any of the provisions hereof (including the third party consents pursuant to
the Contracts set forth on Section 4.4 of the Seller Disclosure Letter) and the
taking of all such other actions as such party may reasonably be requested to
take by the other party hereto from time to time, consistent with the terms of
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, in order to effectuate the
provisions and purposes of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

                  (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to require the conveyance, assignment
or transfer of any Asset that by its terms or by operation of applicable law
cannot be conveyed, assigned, transferred or assumed. To the extent a party
hereto has been unable to obtain any governmental or any third party consents or
approvals required under applicable law for the transfer of any Asset and to the
extent not otherwise prohibited by the terms of any Assumed Contract or
Partially Assumed Contract, Seller and its Affiliates shall continue to be bound
by the terms of such applicable Assumed Contract or Partially Assumed Contract,
as the case may be, and Buyer shall pay, perform and discharge fully all of the
obligations of Seller and its Affiliates thereunder (but as to any Partially
Assumed Contract, only to the extent provided in the Partial Contract
Assignment) from and after the Closing to the extent that the corresponding
benefit is received. Seller shall, without consideration therefor, pay, assign
and remit to Buyer promptly all monies, rights and other consideration received
in respect of such performance. To the extent permitted by law, Seller and its
Affiliates shall exercise or exploit their rights in respect of such Assets only
as reasonably directed by Buyer and at Buyer's expense. Each party hereto shall
continue to use reasonable best efforts to obtain at the earliest practicable
date all unobtained consents or approvals required to be obtained by it in
connection with the transfer of the Assets or performance of any Ancillary
Agreement; provided, that, except as set forth in Section 6.13, neither Seller,
Buyer nor any of their Affiliates shall be required to pay any consideration,
other than a de minimis amount, in connection with such consents or approvals
unless Buyer agrees to pay such amounts. If and when any such consents or
approvals shall be obtained, then Seller and its Affiliates shall promptly (i)
assign their rights and obligations thereunder to Buyer without payment of
consideration and Buyer shall, without the payment of any consideration
therefor, assume such rights and obligations or (ii) perform under the Ancillary
Agreement, as applicable. Each party shall execute such good and sufficient
instruments as may be necessary to evidence such assignment and assumption.

                  (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with each other and use reasonable best efforts
to obtain any consents from vendors that are necessary in order to provide the
services contemplated by the Transition Services Agreement. In the event that
Seller is unable to obtain any such consent, the parties will work together to
agree upon a commercially reasonable alternative arrangement. Any costs and
expenses incurred by Seller (i) in connection with obtaining and implementing
such consents and (ii) in connection with the implementation of any such
commercially reasonable alternative arrangement shall be borne 50% by Buyer and
50% by Seller, provided that Buyer shall continue to be responsible for paying
the ongoing fees, if any, that are specified in the Transition Services
Agreement for the associated services. Except as set forth in this Section
6.5(c), all costs and expenses associated with services provided pursuant to the
Transition Services Agreement shall be borne by the parties in accordance with
the provisions of the Transition Services Agreement.

                  (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to require the conveyance, assignment
or transfer of any Asset that would result in the loss of the attorney-client or
work product privilege by Seller with respect to any Retained Asset or Excluded
Liability. To the extent that any such privileged Assets are inadvertently
transferred to Buyer, Buyer and Seller hereby agree that such transfer will not
result in the loss of Seller's privilege, and each party shall take all
reasonable actions necessary to prevent the loss of Seller's privilege.

                  (e) Should Seller, in its reasonable discretion, determine
after the Closing that books, records or other materials constituting Acquired
Assets are still in the possession of Seller or any of its Affiliates, Seller
shall or shall cause such Affiliates to promptly deliver them to Buyer at no
cost to Buyer. Should Seller or Buyer, in its reasonable discretion, determine
after the Closing that books, records or other documents constituting Excluded
Assets were delivered to Buyer, Buyer shall promptly return them to Seller at no
cost to Seller.

                  Section 6.6 Communications with Customers and Suppliers. Prior
to the Closing, the Acquirors shall not, and shall cause their Affiliates and
representatives not to, contact, or engage in any discussions or otherwise
communicate with, any of the Business' customers, suppliers and others with whom
it has material commercial dealings without obtaining the prior written consent
of Seller (which will not be unreasonably withheld but, if given, may be
conditioned on Seller having the right to participate in any meetings or
discussion with any such customers, suppliers or others).

                  Section 6.7 Publicity. Neither Seller nor the Acquirors shall
issue any press release or otherwise make any public announcement with respect
to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior
consent of the other (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), except as may be required by applicable law or stock exchange
regulation. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.7 to the contrary, Seller
and the Acquirors shall, to the extent practicable, consult with each other
before issuing, and provide the other the opportunity to review and comment
upon, any such press release or other public statements with respect to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, whether or not required by
law or stock exchange requirements.

                  Section 6.8 Employees and Employee Benefits.

                  (a) Employment. Prior to the Closing, Buyer shall offer, or
cause a Subsidiary of Buyer to offer, employment to each person who is a full
time or part time employee of the Seller employed in the Business immediately
prior to the Closing who is listed in Section 6.8(a)(i) of the Seller Disclosure
Letter, including, without limitation, those certain employees of the Seller
whose principal place of business is Memphis, Tennessee, whose primary function
is to support the Business and who are listed on Section 6.8(a)(i) of the Seller
Disclosure Letter in the categories marked "Business Staff Group" or "HR" and
identified as being located in the Memphis office (the "Headquarters Business
Employees") and those certain other employees of the Seller who provide services
in support of the Business, who are listed in the categories marked "Business
Staff Group," "Fiber Procurement/Woodyards," "IT Employees," and
"Communications" of Section 6.8(a)(i) of the Seller Disclosure Letter and are
not identified as being located in the Memphis office (the "Additional
Administrative Employees"). Section 6.8(a)(i) of the Seller Disclosure Letter
lists the date of hire, position, base compensation, bonus opportunity, hourly
or salaried status of each such employee, and whether such employee is a
Represented Employee or a Non-Represented Employee (as defined below) which
shall be updated as of the Closing Date. Section 6.8(a)(ii) of the Seller
Disclosure Letter separately identifies the number of Inactive Employees (as set
forth below) by location and position and shall set forth the general reason for
the individual's inactive status (including, without limitation, short term
disability, an approved leave of absence or layoff) and the expected dates of
return to work (where available). Those employees who accept such offer shall be
referred to herein as "Affected Employees". Each such offer to any employee
listed in Section 6.8(a)(i) of the Seller Disclosure Letter whose terms and
conditions of employment are not governed by a collective bargaining agreement
shall (i) be on terms and conditions substantially comparable in the aggregate
(including with respect to position, duties, responsibilities, compensation and
incentives) to those provided to such employee immediately prior to the Closing;
(ii) other than with respect to the Headquarters Business Employees, provide for
such employee to continue working at the same work location at which such
employee customarily provided services prior to the Closing, except that an
Additional Administrative Employee may be required to work at a new work
location, provided that any increase in the distance from such employee's
residence to the new work location over the distance from such employee's
residence to the employee's pre-Closing work location is less than fifty (50)
miles; and (iii) provide a base rate of pay or salary not less than the rate in
effect for such Affected Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date. Each
such employee whose terms and conditions of employment are not governed by a
collective bargaining agreement who accepts such offer shall be referred to
herein as a "Non-Represented Employee". Notwithstanding the foregoing, any offer
of employment to an Affected Employee who is on short-term disability leave or
any approved leave of absence (each an "Inactive Employee") shall be conditioned
on such Inactive Employee being ready and able to return to work within six
months following the Closing Date.

                  (b) Substantially Comparable Benefits; Non-Represented
Employees. With respect to any Non-Represented Employee, for a period of one
year following Closing, Buyer shall provide, or cause to be provided, (i)
employee benefits (other than equity compensation) to each Non-Represented
Employee that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those benefits
provided to or maintained for such Non-Represented Employee prior to the Closing
(other than benefits under a defined benefit plan) and (ii) a defined benefit
plan that is comparable to the defined benefit plan provided to or maintained
for such Non-Represented Employee prior to the Closing or, if Buyer does not
provide such a comparable defined benefit plan, Buyer must replace such defined
benefit plan with a defined contribution plan or include a defined contribution
plan feature in a plan provided under (i) above that requires an annual Buyer
contribution of at least 2.75% of the aggregate base pay of all such
Non-Represented Employees. If the Buyer chooses to satisfy its obligations under
Section 6.8(b)(ii) with a comparable defined benefit plan, a defined
contribution plan or defined contribution plan feature, such plan or such
feature, as the case may be, shall not be taken into account in determining
whether Buyer has satisfied its obligations under Section 6.8(b)(i).
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.8, the Buyer's
obligation to provide substantially comparable benefits in the aggregate
pursuant to Section 6.8(b)(i) shall take into account any decrease to
Non-Represented Employee benefits announced by the Seller or its Affiliates on
or prior to the Closing.

                  (c) Assumption of Collective Bargaining Agreements;
Represented Employees. With respect to any Affected Employee whose terms and
conditions of employment are governed by any of the collective bargaining
agreements listed on Section 6.8(c) of the Seller Disclosure Letter (each a
"Represented Employee"), Buyer agrees to assume the collective bargaining
agreements listed on Section 6.8(c) of the Seller Disclosure Letter as of the
Closing and to continue all terms and conditions of employment under such
collective bargaining agreements through the expiration, modification or
termination of such agreements in conformity with applicable law. For purposes
of this Section 6.8(c) only, the United Steelworkers of America will have
third-party beneficiary rights with respect to the obligations and covenants of
Buyer under this Section 6.8(c) with respect to such collective bargaining
agreements to which the United Steelworkers of America is a party. Except as set
forth in the immediately preceding sentence, no employee or collective
bargaining representative thereof shall have any third party beneficiary rights
with respect to this Agreement.

                  (d) Service Credit, Deductibles, and Preexisting Conditions.
Buyer agrees that, for purposes of all employee benefit plans (including, but
not limited to, all "employee benefit plans" within the meaning of Section 3(3)
of ERISA, and all policies, arrangements and employee fringe benefit programs,
including vacation policies) of Buyer and its Subsidiaries (such plans,
programs, policies and arrangements, the "Buyer Plans") in which Affected
Employees may participate following the Closing, full credit will be given to
the Affected Employees for service previously credited with Seller prior to the
Closing; provided, however, that such crediting of service shall not result in a
duplication of benefits; and provided, further, that such crediting of service
need not be given for benefit accrual purposes under any Buyer Plan that is a
"defined benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA). The Buyer shall
use reasonable best efforts to provide that Affected Employees shall also be
given full credit for any deductible or co-payment amounts paid in respect of
the plan year in which the Closing occurs, to the extent that, following the
Closing, they participate in any corresponding Buyer Plan for which deductibles
or co-payments are required. Buyer shall also cause each Buyer Plan to waive any
pre-existing condition exclusion or restriction, any waiting period limitation,
or any evidence of insurability requirements for the Affected Employees to the
extent such exclusions, restrictions, limitations or requirements had been
waived or satisfied under the terms of any corresponding Seller Plan immediately
prior to the Closing.

                  (e) Savings Plan. As soon as practicable following the Closing
Date:

                           (i) Buyer shall provide Seller with such documents
         and other information as Seller shall reasonably request to assure
         itself that the savings plan that Buyer will establish prior to (or as
         soon as reasonably practicable following) Closing (the "Buyer Savings
         Plan") provides for the receipt of eligible rollover distributions (as
         such term is defined under Section 402 of the Code) from the Affected
         Employees;

                           (ii) Buyer shall provide Seller with such documents
         and other information as Seller shall reasonably request to assure
         itself that the Buyer Savings Plan and the trust established in
         connection therewith are qualified and tax-exempt under Sections 401(a)
         and 501(a) of the Code; and

                           (iii) Seller shall provide Buyer with such documents
         as Buyer shall reasonably request to assure itself that the accounts of
         the Affected Employees under the International Paper Salaried Savings
         Plan (the "SSP") and the International Paper Hourly Savings Plan (the
         "HSP") (each, a "Seller Savings Plan"), if distributed to such Affected
         Employees, would be eligible rollover distributions.


Seller shall 100% vest or cause to be 100% vested, as of the Closing Date, the
accounts under the SSP and HSP for each Affected Employee. Each Affected
Employee who is a participant in a Seller Savings Plan shall be given the
opportunity to "roll over" such account balance by way of an eligible rollover
distribution to the Buyer Savings Plan, subject to and in accordance with the
provisions of such Plan and applicable law. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, each Affected Employee who is eligible to participate
in a Seller Savings Plan will become eligible to participate in the Buyer
Savings Plan as soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date.

                  (f) Retirement Plan. Neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates
shall become sponsoring employers of the Retirement plan of International Paper
Company (the "Seller Retirement Plan"). Affected Employees who are participants
in the Seller Retirement Plan shall be entitled to the payment of benefits under
the Seller Retirement Plan solely in accordance with its terms.

                  (g) Subsequent Terminations or Lay-offs; Severance Pay. In the
event that any Non-Represented Employee who participates in Seller's Salaried
Employee Severance Plan (the "SESP") immediately prior to the Closing is
discharged by Buyer or any Subsidiary of Buyer within twelve (12) months after
the Closing Date (other than for "cause" or because of such Non-Represented
Employee's voluntary termination or retirement), then Buyer shall treat such
Non-Represented Employee, and shall be responsible for severance and six (6)
months medical and dental continuation coverage at no cost to such
Non-Represented Employee (but not outplacement services and the continued
Employee Assistance Program), in accordance with provisions of the SESP and the
SESP Benefits Exhibit, as referenced in Section 6.8(g) of the Seller Disclosure
Letter. Buyer will maintain such severance and benefits for at least twelve (12)
months after the Closing Date. Buyer shall be responsible and assume all
liability for all notices or payments due to any Affected Employee, and all
notices, payments or assessments due to any Government Entity, pursuant to any
applicable federal, state or local law, common law, statute, rule or regulation
with respect to the employment, discharge or layoff of employees by the Business
after the Closing, including but not limited to the WARN Act, and any rules or
regulations as have been issued in connection with the foregoing. For a period
of ninety (90) days following the Closing, Buyer shall not cause or permit any
Affected Employee to suffer an "employment loss" (as defined under the WARN Act)
if such employment loss would trigger the requirements of, or any liability
under, the WARN Act when aggregated with any "employment losses" experienced by
employees of the Business on or prior to the Closing. On or prior to the
Closing, Seller shall provide Buyer with a written list of all employees of the
Business by facility and operating unit who have experienced an "employment
loss" in the ninety (90) days on or prior to the Closing.

                  (h) Vacation. As of the Closing, Buyer will assume all
obligations of Seller to Affected Employees for any accrued vacation entitlement
and vacation pay entitlement. Subject to applicable law, Seller will have no
obligation to make any payment to Affected Employees after the Closing with
respect to any such accrued vacation entitlement and vacation pay entitlement.
Buyer will give the Affected Employees full credit for their respective service
with Seller prior to the Closing Date for purposes of entitlement and accrual of
vacation and vacation pay from and after the Closing Date (to the extent Buyer
gives credit to its similarly situated employees for such purposes).

                  (i) Pre-Closing Claims. Except as otherwise provided in this
Section 6.8(i) with respect to sickness and disability claims, Seller shall
remain responsible for all claims under the applicable Plans for health,
accident, injury, sickness, and disability benefits that are deemed incurred
prior to the Closing Date by Affected Employees. For all purposes under such
Plans, such employees shall be considered to have terminated employment with
Seller as of the Closing Date. For purposes of this Agreement: (i) a claim for
health benefits (including, without limitation, claims for medical, prescription
drug and dental expenses) shall be deemed to have been incurred on the date on
which the related medical service or material was rendered to or received by the
Affected Employee claiming any such benefits, (ii) a claim for injury, sickness
or disability benefits based on an injury or illness occurring on or prior to
the Closing Date shall be deemed to have been incurred prior to the Closing Date
if, but only if, a claim relating to any such injury is made within two (2)
years after the Closing Date, and (iii) in the case of any claim for benefits
other than health benefits and sickness and disability benefits (e.g., life
insurance benefits), a claim will be deemed to have been incurred upon the
occurrence of the event giving rise thereto. As of the Closing, any Affected
Employee who is receiving benefits under Seller's short-term disability program
shall be deemed to be an employee of Seller until such time as such employee is
no longer eligible for Seller's short-term disability program. If at such time
such Affected Employee will be returning to work, such employee shall be
employed by Buyer in accordance with the terms of Sections 6.8(a) or 6.8(c)
hereof, as applicable. If at such time such employee will be eligible for
long-term disability benefits or disability retirement, such employee shall
receive such benefits under Seller's long-term disability program or pension
plan.

                  (j) Disabled Employees. Seller shall remain responsible for
(i) all benefits payable to employees of the Business who, as of the close of
business on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, were determined to
be totally and permanently disabled in accordance with the applicable provisions
of Seller's health, accident, sickness, salary continuation, or short-term or
long-term disability benefits plans or programs, and (ii) all workers
compensation claims based on injuries occurring on or prior to the Closing Date;
provided, however, that a workers compensation claim relating to any such injury
is made within two (2) years after the Closing Date.

                  (k) Retiree Life and Health. Seller shall provide retiree life
insurance and health benefits as required under the provisions of any applicable
Plan to any Affected Employee who was eligible for such benefits (i.e., who met
the applicable age and service requirements but has not yet retired) as of the
close of business on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date. For the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement shall obligate Buyer to provide
retiree medical insurance, retiree life insurance or other retiree welfare
benefits to any Non-Represented Employee.

                  (l) No Right of Employment. Nothing contained herein, express
or implied, is intended to confer upon any Affected Employee any right to
continued employment for any period by reason of this Agreement. Nothing
contained herein is intended to confer upon any Affected Employee any particular
term or condition of employment other than with respect to the particular
employee benefit plans or severance plans, policies or arrangements expressly
referred to in this Agreement.

                  Section 6.9 Tax Matters.

                  (a) Return Filings, Refunds and Credits.

                           (i) Seller shall prepare, or cause to be prepared,
         and file, or cause to be filed, on a timely basis, all Tax Returns with
         respect to the Business (including any Tax Returns of the Transferred
         Entities or the Transferred Subsidiaries for which Seller currently has
         filing responsibility) for taxable periods ending on or prior to the
         Closing Date, and pay or cause to be paid the amounts shown as due and
         payable on such Tax Returns.

                           (ii) Buyer shall prepare, or cause to be prepared,
         file, or cause to be filed, on a timely basis, all other Tax Returns
         with respect to the Business and pay or cause to be paid the amounts
         shown as due and payable on such Tax Returns. Except as otherwise
         required by Applicable Law, the computation of Taxes and the reporting
         of items for a Straddle Period shall be in a manner consistent with the
         manner in which such Taxes were computed and such items were reported
         in preceding taxable periods. Before filing any Tax Return with respect
         to any Straddle Period, Buyer shall provide Seller with a copy of such
         Tax Return at least ten (10) days prior to the earlier of (x) the last
         date for timely filing such Tax Return (giving effect to any valid
         extensions thereof) and (y) the date of actual filing of such Tax
         Return, accompanied by a statement calculating in reasonable detail
         Seller's indemnification obligation pursuant to Section 6.9(c)(i).
         Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if Buyer
         fails to provide Seller with either a copy of such Tax Return or such
         statement within the time frame described above, Seller's
         indemnification obligation under Section 6.9(c)(i) shall be reduced to
         the extent of any liability incurred as a result of the failure of
         Buyer to timely provide Seller a copy of such Tax Return or such
         statement. If for any reason Seller does not agree with Buyer's
         calculation of its indemnification obligation, Seller shall notify
         Buyer of its disagreement within five (5) days of receiving a copy of
         the Tax Return and Buyer's calculation, and such dispute shall be
         resolved pursuant to the Tax Dispute Resolution Mechanism. If Seller
         agrees with Buyer's calculation of its indemnification obligation,
         Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount of Seller's indemnification
         obligation at least one business day prior to the last date for timely
         filing such Tax Return (including any valid extensions thereof).

                           (iii) Seller and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate,
         and shall cause their respective affiliates, officers, employees,
         agents, auditors and representatives reasonably to cooperate, in
         preparing and filing all Tax Returns (including claims for refund),
         including maintaining and making available to each other all records
         necessary in connection with Taxes and in resolving all disputes and
         audits with respect to all taxable periods relating to Taxes. Buyer and
         Seller recognize that Seller and its affiliates will need access, from
         time to time, after the Closing Date, to certain accounting and Tax
         records and information relating to the Business to the extent such
         records and information pertain to events occurring prior to the
         Closing Date; therefore, Buyer agrees that (A) from and after the
         Closing Date, Buyer shall, or shall cause the Transferred Subsidiaries
         and their successors to (1) retain and maintain such records until the
         earlier of (x) the expiration of the statute of limitations for the Tax
         periods to which the Tax Returns and other documents relate to or (y)
         such time as the other party agrees in writing that such retention and
         maintenance is no longer necessary and (2) allow Seller and its agents
         and representatives (and agents and representatives of any of its
         affiliates), at Seller's expense and during regular business hours, to
         inspect, review and make copies of such records as Seller may
         reasonably deem necessary or appropriate from time to time.

                           (iv) Any refunds or credits of Taxes of the Business
         received by Buyer or the Transferred Subsidiaries plus any interest
         received with respect thereto from the applicable taxing authority for
         any Pre-Closing Tax Period (including, without limitation, refunds or
         credits arising by reason of amended Tax Returns filed after the
         Closing Date) shall be for the account of Seller other than (a) any
         refunds or credits that were included in the calculation of the Final
         Net Working Capital Amount, (b) any refund or credit of property tax
         which is directly attributable to a capital expenditure or similar
         action of Buyer, the Transferred Subsidiaries, the Transferred Entities
         or any Affiliate taken after the Closing and (c) any refund or credit
         that arises as a result of a carryback of a loss or other Tax benefit
         from a Post-Closing Tax Period, which shall be for the account of
         Buyer, provided, however, that Buyer shall indemnify Seller for any
         loss or reduction in any credit or other Tax attribute for any
         Pre-Closing Tax Period as a result of the carryback of such loss or
         other Tax benefit. All other refunds or credits of Taxes of the
         Business plus any interest received with respect thereto from the
         applicable taxing authority shall be for the account of Buyer. If one
         party receives a refund or credit to which the other party is entitled
         pursuant to this Section 6.9(a)(iv), it shall pay to the other party
         within 10 days of receipt thereof. To the extent a refund or credit
         relates to a Tax that is prorated pursuant to Section 6.9(b), such
         refund or credit shall be prorated using the principles set forth in
         Section 6.9(b).

                           (v) If an audit adjustment, amended Tax Return or
         amended assessment (an "Adjustment") after the date hereof shall both
         increase a Tax liability which is allocated to Seller under this
         Section 6.9 (or reduce losses or credits otherwise available to Seller)
         for a period ending on or before the Closing Date (treating such date
         as the end of a short taxable year for this purpose) and decrease a Tax
         liability of (or increase losses or credits otherwise available to)
         Buyer or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries for a period ending after
         the Closing Date (treating such date as the end of a short taxable year
         for this purpose), then Buyer shall promptly pay to Seller an amount
         equal to the present value amount of such refund, reduction, credit or
         adjustment, which present value amount shall be determined by using a
         discount rate equal to the mid-term applicable federal rate in effect
         on the date on which the Adjustment is made. Similarly, if an
         Adjustment shall both decrease a Tax liability which is allocated to
         Seller under this Section 6.9 (or increase losses or credits of Seller)
         for a period ending on or before the Closing Date and increase the Tax
         liability of Buyer, the Company or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries
         (or reduce losses or credits otherwise available to any such
         corporation after taking into account this Agreement) for a period
         ending after the Closing Date (treating such date as the end of a short
         taxable year for this purpose), then Seller shall promptly pay to Buyer
         an amount equal to the present value amount of such refund, reduction,
         credit or adjustment, which present value amount shall be determined by
         using a discount rate equal to the mid-term applicable federal rate in
         effect on the date on which the Adjustment is made. This Section
         6.9(a)(vi) shall be effective with respect to increases and decreases
         in Tax liability as long as permitted under applicable law.

                           (vi) At Seller's request and expense, Buyer shall, or
         shall cause the Transferred Subsidiaries to file for and obtain any
         refunds or credits to which Seller is entitled under this Section
         6.9(a)(vi). In connection therewith Buyer will, or will cause the
         Transferred Subsidiaries to forward to Seller any such refund within
         ten (10) days after the refund is received (or reimburse Seller for any
         such credit within ten (10) days after the relevant Tax Return is filed
         in which the credit is actually applied against the Transferred
         Subsidiaries, any of their affiliates or any of their successors'
         liability for Taxes.

                  (b) Proration. Buyer and Seller agree that personal property,
real estate, occupancy, intangibles, and any other similar ad valorem Taxes,
assessments and other charges, if any, on or with respect to the ownership, use
or business and operation of the Acquired Assets will be prorated as of the
Closing Date, with Seller liable to the extent such items relate to any time
period through and including the Closing Date, and Buyer liable to the extent
such items relate to periods subsequent to the Closing Date. Such apportionments
shall be made as of the Closing Date and in the case of real property, personal
property, intangibles and other similar ad valorem Taxes, shall be based upon
the fiscal year for which the same are assessed and shall be apportioned in
accordance with the principles of Section 164(d) of the Code. In connection with
such proration, in the event that actual amounts are not available at the
Closing Date, the proration shall be based upon the actual amount of such Taxes
or fees for the preceding year (or appropriate period) for which such actual
Taxes or fees are available and such Taxes or fees shall be reprorated upon
request of either Seller or Buyer made within sixty (60) days of the date that
the actual amounts become available. Seller shall not be responsible for any
increased assessments for Post-Closing Tax Periods resulting from the
transactions contemplated hereby. Seller and Buyer agree to furnish each other
with such documents and other records as may be reasonably requested in order to
confirm all adjustment and proration calculations made pursuant to this Section
6.9(b).

                  (c) Tax Indemnification.

                           (i) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
         contrary, Seller shall indemnify Buyer and hold it harmless from and
         against (A) any liability for Taxes (other than Buyer's share of
         Transfer Taxes pursuant to Section 6.9(c)(iv)) with respect to the
         Acquired Assets, Taxes of the Transferred Subsidiaries and any Taxes of
         Seller imposed with respect to the Transferred Entities, in each case
         for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods, (B) all Tax liability resulting by
         reason of the several liability of the Transferred Subsidiaries
         pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 or any similar
         provision of foreign state or local law or by reason of the Transferred
         Subsidiaries ever having been a member of any consolidated, combined or
         unitary group on or prior to the Closing Date, (C) all Taxes payable as
         a result of a breach of any representation or warranty contained in
         Section 4.10 and (D) any liability for its share of Transfer Taxes
         pursuant to Section 6.9(c)(iv).

                           (ii) The Acquirors shall indemnify Seller and hold it
         harmless from and against (A) any liability for Taxes with respect to
         the Acquired Assets, the Transferred Entities and the Transferred
         Subsidiaries for all Post-Closing Tax Periods, (B) any liability for
         its share of Transfer Taxes pursuant to Section 6.9(c)(iv) and (C) any
         liability for Taxes directly attributable to a breach by Buyer of its
         obligations under the Agreement.

                           (iii) In the case of a Straddle Period, Buyer and
         Seller shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, elect with the
         relevant taxing authority to treat such taxable period for all purposes
         as a short taxable period ending as of the close of the Closing Date.
         In any case where applicable law does not permit such an election to be
         made, Taxes of the Business for the Straddle Period shall be allocated
         to the Pre-Closing Tax Period using an interim closing-of-the-books
         method assuming that such taxable period ended at the close of the
         Closing Date, except that (A) exemptions, allowances or deductions that
         are calculated on an annual basis (such as the deduction for
         depreciation) shall be apportioned on a per-diem basis and (B) real
         property, personal property, intangibles and other similar ad valorem
         taxes shall be allocated in accordance with the principles of Section
         164(d) of the Code.

                           (iv) The parties hereto agree that, notwithstanding
         any provision to the contrary herein or in the Ancillary Agreements,
         Seller shall bear all Transfer Taxes up to $5,000,000 in the aggregate
         and all Transfer Taxes in excess of $5,000,000 shall be borne 50% by
         Buyer and 50% by Seller. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if and to the
         extent that the Transfer Taxes actually incurred exceed the Transfer
         Taxes that would have been incurred if the Assets were sold to Buyer
         entirely for cash, Seller shall bear the amount of such excess Transfer
         Taxes. Seller shall prepare and timely file all Tax Returns relating to
         such Taxes except for such returns that are legally required to be
         filed by Buyer, in which case Buyer will prepare and file such returns.

                           (v) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
         contrary, Seller shall have no liability under this Agreement in
         respect of Taxes of the Business which are attributable to any action
         of the Transferred Subsidiaries and Transferred Entities, the Acquirors
         or any of their respective affiliates with respect to any Straddle
         Period that occurs after the Closing.

                           (vi) The parties hereto agree that any payments made
         pursuant to the indemnification provisions in this Section 6.9 or in
         Article IX are intended to be deemed to be an adjustment to the Cash
         Purchase Price and shall take no position to the contrary for any Tax
         purpose; provided however, that to the extent that any taxing authority
         successfully characterizes, in a Final Determination, that any
         indemnification payments shall be deemed to be income to the party
         receiving such payments, then the party making such payments shall pay
         an additional amount to the party receiving such payments to cover
         appropriate Taxes thereon, and provided, further, that Seller in no
         event be liable to indemnify or reimburse for any adjustment to the
         basis of any asset as a result of an adjustment to the Cash Purchase
         Price under this Section 6.9.

                  (d)      Procedures Relating to Tax Indemnification.

                           (i) If a Tax Claim is made, which, if successful,
         could result in an indemnity payment pursuant to this Section 6.9, the
         Tax Indemnified Party shall notify the Tax Indemnifying Party in
         writing of the Tax Claim within twenty (20) Business Days of receipt of
         such Tax Claim. If notice of a Tax Claim is not given to the Tax
         Indemnifying Party within such twenty (20) Business Days or in detail
         sufficient to apprise the Tax Indemnifying Party of the nature of the
         Tax Claim, the Tax Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Tax
         Indemnified Party to the extent that the Tax Indemnifying Party's
         position is prejudiced as a result thereof.

                           (ii) With respect to any Tax Claim which could result
         in an indemnity payment to Buyer pursuant to Section 6.9(c)(i), Seller
         shall control all proceedings taken in connection with such Tax Claim
         (including, without limitation, selection of counsel) and, without
         limiting the foregoing, may in its sole discretion and at its sole
         expense pursue or forego any and all administrative appeals,
         proceedings, hearings and conferences with any taxing authority with
         respect thereto; provided that Seller shall not settle any Tax Claim
         without Buyer's prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld,
         and Buyer shall have the right, at its sole expense, to participate in
         any appeals, proceedings, hearings or conferences with any taxing
         authority. In no case shall the Transferred Subsidiaries, Buyer or any
         of their respective affiliates or successors, settle or otherwise
         compromise any Tax Claim referred to in the preceding sentence without
         Seller's prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld. Buyer,
         the Transferred Subsidiaries and their respective affiliates and
         successors shall cooperate with Seller at Seller's expense in
         contesting such Tax Claim, which cooperation shall include, without
         limitation, the retention and (upon Seller's request) the provision to
         Seller of records and information which are relevant to such Tax Claim
         and making employees available during normal business hours to provide
         additional information or explanation of any material provided
         hereunder or to testify at proceedings relating to such Tax Claim.
         Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.9(d)(ii) to the contrary,
         with respect to any Tax Claim relating to a United States federal
         income consolidated Tax Return of the affiliated group of corporations
         that includes the Transferred Subsidiaries and Seller, Seller shall
         have the sole right to control and settle all appeals, proceedings,
         hearings and conferences with the Internal Revenue Service with respect
         thereto and may, in its sole discretion, either pay the Tax Claim and
         sue for a refund where applicable law permits such refund suits or
         contest such Tax Claim in any permissible manner.

                  (e) Tax Dispute Resolution Mechanism. Wherever in this Section
6.9 it is provided that a dispute shall be resolved pursuant to the "Tax Dispute
Resolution Mechanism," such dispute shall be resolved as follows: The parties
shall submit the dispute to the Settlement Accountant for resolution, which
resolution shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the fees and
expenses of the Settlement Accountant in resolving a dispute shall be paid by
Buyer and Seller in proportion to each party's respective liability for Taxes as
determined by the Settlement Accountant. The award of the Settlement Accountant
shall be rendered as expeditiously as possible, and if practicable, no later
than sixty (60) days after the submission of the tax dispute to the Settlement
Accountant, unless the parties agree to extend such time period or the
Settlement Accountant, at his sole discretion, extends such time period for good
cause shown. The determination of the Settlement Accountant shall be final and
binding on the parties and may be entered and enforced in any court having
jurisdiction.

                  (f) Elections. Except as otherwise specifically provided in
this Agreement, Buyer shall not, and shall cause the Transferred Subsidiaries
not to, make, amend or revoke any election with respect to Taxes, if such action
would adversely affect the tax liability or refund of Seller or any of its
affiliates in any taxable period or cause Seller to have an indemnification
obligation pursuant to Section 6.9(c)(i).

                  (g) Exclusivity. This Section 6.9 shall be the sole provision
governing the retention of records of the Transferred Subsidiaries and the
procedures for all indemnification claims, in each case with respect to Taxes.

                  (h) Tax Sharing Agreements. Other than pursuant to this
Agreement, any and all existing agreements relating to the allocation and
sharing of Taxes (the "Tax Sharing Agreements") between the Business and Seller
or any of its affiliates shall be terminated as of the Closing Date. After the
Closing Date, none of the Transferred Subsidiaries, Seller or any of its
Affiliates shall have any further rights or obligations under any such Tax
Sharing Agreements.

                  (i) Sales and Use Tax. Buyer shall deliver to Seller any
documentation that is reasonably requested by Seller, that Buyer is legally able
to deliver and that is necessary to qualify the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement for an exemption from sales and use tax.

                  Section 6.10 No Solicitation and No Hire of Employees. None of
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries shall at any time prior to eighteen (18)
months from the Closing Date, directly or indirectly, solicit the employment or
services of, or hire in any capacity (whether as an employee, consultant,
independent contractor or otherwise), any employee of the Business as of the
date hereof without Buyer's prior written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. None of Buyer or any of its Affiliates shall
at any time prior to one year from the Closing Date, directly or indirectly,
solicit the employment or services of, or hire in any capacity (whether as an
employee, consultant, independent contractor or otherwise), any employee of
Seller (other than Affected Employees) or its Subsidiaries without Seller's
prior written consent. For purposes of this Section 6.10, the term "solicit the
employment or services" shall not be deemed to include generalized searches for
employees through media advertisements of general circulation, employment firms,
open job fairs or otherwise provided that such searches are not focused or
targeted on Affected Employees or employees of Seller or its Subsidiaries, as
the case may be. For the avoidance of doubt, the first sentence of this Section
6.10 shall restrict only the hiring and solicitation activities of Seller and
the Subsidiaries owned by it and nothing in this Agreement shall restrict such
activities of any Person or any of its Affiliates who engages in a transaction
resulting in the acquisition of a majority of the outstanding shares or all or
substantially all of the assets of Seller.

                  Section 6.11 Non-Competition Agreement. During the period
beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the third anniversary thereof,
neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries shall directly or indirectly engage
in the manufacture and sale of coated groundwood paper, coated freesheet C2S
paper rolls or uncoated groundwood supercalendered paper (collectively, the
"Competitive Products"), in each case, for sale to customers in North America in
the catalog, magazine, or commercial print markets or inserts for the catalog,
magazine, retail, commercial print, or newspaper markets (collectively, a
"Competitive Business"); provided, however, that nothing in this Section 6.11
shall:

                           (i) prohibit or prevent Seller or any of its
         Subsidiaries from acquiring as an investment in the ordinary course of
         business (including investments by any trust of any of its employee
         benefit plans) any securities required to be registered under the
         Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, of any Person engaged in a
         Competitive Business to the extent that such acquisitions do not result
         in Seller or any of its Subsidiaries owning in the aggregate 10% or
         more of any class of such securities;

                           (ii) prohibit or prevent another Person (or its
         successor) or business from directly or indirectly engaging in a
         Competitive Business from and after the time at which Seller or any of
         its Subsidiaries acquires (through merger, stock purchase or
         acquisition of assets or otherwise) ownership of or any interest in
         such Person or business, provided that (A) the annual revenues of such
         Person or business from the Competitive Business are not more than 20%
         of its total annual revenues (based on the most recent full fiscal year
         revenues of such Person or business), or (B) if its annual revenues
         from the Competitive Business are more than 20% of such Person's or
         business' total annual revenues (based upon its most recent full fiscal
         year revenues), Seller shall or shall cause its relevant Subsidiary to
         dispose of such Competitive Business within twelve (12) months of its
         acquisition by Seller or such Subsidiary;

                           (iii) prohibit or prevent Seller or any of its
         Subsidiaries from engaging and continuing to engage directly or
         indirectly in (A) the design, manufacture, marketing, sale and
         distribution in any market of Competitive Products at the Pine Bluff
         Mill or the conduct of a Competitive Business at the Pine Bluff Mill,
         in each case, so long as such Competitive Products are manufactured
         using the paper machine currently existing at the Pine Bluff Mill
         (including any subsequent upgrades thereto), (B) any marketing, sale,
         procuring, sourcing, design, private labeling, converting, or
         distribution of Competitive Products in any market by Seller's global
         distribution business, including its xpedx and Bulkley Dunton business
         groups; (C) any manufacture, marketing and sale in any market of (1)
         all Coated Freesheet Coated One Side products; (2) Specialty Coated
         Freesheet products whether C2S or C1S sold in rolls or sheets, limited
         to the following applications: all label applications whether glue
         applied, or pressure sensitive, such as wet strength, metallizing and
         pizza label; all specialty coating base, release base and liner
         applications; all food grade packaging applications; all envelope, bag
         and kraft specialty applications; all packaging applications such as
         pharmaceutical, cosmetic and tobacco packaging; book jacket; off
         quality production for gift wrap; litholam; imaging papers (coated
         cut-size); decor overlays and surface papers; photographic papers; and
         security, electrical, medical, tape backing, flame retardant, tobacco
         onsert coupon and fragrance papers applications, and (D) any activities
         that are incidental to or derived from such business or activities
         described in clauses (A) through (C) (other than a Competitive Business
         not included in clauses (A) through (C); or

                           (iv) be deemed to apply to any business of a Person
         (or its Affiliates) that acquires control of Seller or any of its
         Subsidiaries or that merges with or acquires all or substantially all
         of the assets of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries.


For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6.11 shall restrict only the business
activities of Seller and the Subsidiaries owned by it and nothing in this
Agreement shall restrict such activities of (x) any Person or any of its
Affiliates that acquires any Subsidiary or business from Seller or its
Affiliates, including its Beverage Packaging Division and Inpacel, Brazil
operations, or (y) any such Subsidiary or business following such acquisition.

                  Section 6.12 Sartell Sublease. Seller has exercised its option
to purchase the Land and the Improvements pursuant to paragraph 14(a) of the
Sublease Agreement, dated as of August 1, 1983, between Sartell Leasing Joint
Venture and St. Regis Corporation (the "Master Sublease"), and shall purchase
such Land and Improvements in accordance with the terms set forth therein and in
accordance with the terms of the Sartell Sublease. Seller shall comply with the
provisions of paragraph 15 of the Master Sublease and the terms of the Sartell
Sublease to effect the purchase of the Land and Improvements and to cause the
conveyance of such Land and Improvements to be made to Buyer or one of its
Affiliates as promptly as practicable. All costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the exercise of the option by Seller, including the purchase
price and any Transfer Taxes, shall be paid by Seller, provided the Transfer
Taxes relating to the transfer of fee title to the Sartell Real Property from
Master Lessor to Buyer shall be paid 50% by Buyer and 50% by Seller, subject to
the provisions of Section 6.9(c)(iv). Seller and Buyer agree to cooperate to
minimize any such Transfer Tax. Pursuant to the Master Sublease, Seller shall
use its reasonable best efforts to deliver to Buyer a certificate from the
Master Sublessor indicating the date through which rent payments made pursuant
to the Master Sublease are current. As used in this Section 6.12, the terms
"Land," "Improvements," "Master Lease," and "Master Lessor" shall have the
respective meanings ascribed to them in the Sartell Sublease.

                  Section 6.13 Other Intellectual Property and Transaction.

                  (a) License to Use Seller's Name. Buyer and its Affiliates
shall have the right to resell any and all of the Inventories included in the
Acquired Assets or conveyed with the Transferred Subsidiaries. As soon as
practicable but not later than three (3) months after the Closing, Buyer shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates to, institute a procedure whereby a stamp or
other indelible identifying mark is affixed to products sold by the Business in
order to distinguish such products from products sold by the Business prior to
the Closing. Seller hereby grants to Buyer and its Affiliates a limited,
non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use Seller's name on forms, marketing
materials and signage included in the Acquired Assets or conveyed with the
Transferred Subsidiaries only to the extent that the use thereof cannot be
commercially reasonably avoided in the conduct of the Business following the
Closing; provided, that Buyer shall in any event cease all such uses not more
than nine (9) months following the Closing. During the term of the license as
described herein, Buyer shall ensure that all Inventories sold in connection
with Seller's name are of a quality at least as high as the quality of such
goods immediately prior to the Closing.

                  (b) At Closing, Seller and Buyer shall enter into the
Intellectual Property Agreement, pursuant to which Seller shall license to Buyer
all Intellectual Property owned by Seller and its Subsidiaries and used or held
for use in the Business (other than the Equity Intellectual Property,
Transferred Intellectual Property, the Brightstar Technology, trademarks, domain
names and certain other Intellectual Property identified in a Schedule C
thereto), including the Intellectual Property set forth in Section 6.13(b) of
the Seller Disclosure Letter, on the terms and conditions set forth therein.

                  (c) Upon completion of the Abbottsfield Deliverables, at
Seller's request, and pursuant to an agreement to be entered into by the
parties, Buyer shall (i) deliver a complete copy of the Abbottsfield
Deliverables to Seller and (ii) grant to Seller a non-exclusive, royalty-free,
perpetual, sublicensable right and license to use, publish, display, reproduce,
copy, create derivative works of enhance and otherwise exploit the Abbottsfield
Deliverables. In consideration thereof, Seller shall pay to Buyer $356,000. For
the avoidance of doubt, if Seller does not request such copy and license,
neither party shall have any obligation whatsoever pursuant to this Section
6.13(c). Any license in and to the Abbottsfield Deliverables shall be on an
as-is basis, and Buyer shall make no warranties whatsoever with respect to the
Abbottsfield Deliverables including, without limitation, any warranties of
merchantability for a particular purpose or non-infringement of third party
rights. In addition, Buyer shall have no obligation to provide Seller with
support, maintenance, revisions, updates, upgrades, bug fixes or any other
assistance of any kind in connection with the Abbottsfield Deliverables. In
addition, any license in and to the Abbottsfield Deliverables may include other
customary terms and conditions for a license of its type, provided that such
terms and conditions shall not limit the scope of the license set forth herein.

                  Section 6.14 Connectivity. In order to enable Seller to
provide services pursuant to the Transition Service Agreement, Seller and Buyer
shall cooperate between the date hereof and Closing to design, develop and
implement as of Closing certain system security and connectivity software,
hardware, policies and processes ("Secured Systems Connectivity"). Seller and
Buyer each shall bear responsibility for establishing Secured Systems
Connectivity. Except as otherwise set forth in the Transition Services
Agreement, each party shall bear all of its own costs and expenses associated
with such design, development and implementation.

                  (a) Financial Information

                           (i) Upon request of Buyer, Seller shall, and shall

         cooperate with and assist, and shall request its independent
         accountants to cooperate with and assist, Buyer in preparing such
         information packages and offering materials as the parties to the
         Commitment Letters may reasonably request (collectively, the "Offering
         Materials") for use in connection with the offering and/or syndication
         of debt securities, loan participation and other matters contemplated
         by the commitment letters (the "Offerings"), including, without

         information and assistance as the parties to such Commitment Letters
         may reasonably request in connection therewith. Buyer shall reimburse
         Seller for all documented reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses
         (including accountants' fees) incurred by Seller in complying with this
         Section 6.15(a)(i) promptly upon request therefor.

                           (ii) As soon as practicable, but in any event no
         later than twenty (20) days after each calendar month-end following the
         date hereof that occurs prior to the Closing Date, Seller will deliver
         to Buyer a copy of the internal operating balance sheet and internal
         profit and loss statement of the Business (as such internal reports are
         currently generated in the Business and delivered to management,
         including projections and forecasts) (the "Subsequent Financial
         Statements").

                           (iii) Seller shall furnish, for each quarterly period
         completed at least forty-five (45) days prior to the Closing Date, the
         following financial statements for the Business, on a combined basis,
         each in a form meeting the requirements of Regulation S-X as follows
         (collectively referred to herein as the "Stub Period Combined Financial
         Statements") as soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event later
         than forty-five (45) days following the close of such quarter: the

         period then ended, and together with comparable financial statements
         for the corresponding period of the preceding year. For each of the
         financial statements for a quarterly period completed following the
         Closing Date through and including the quarterly period ended September
         30, 2006, Seller shall furnish, in a form meeting the requirements of
         Regulation S-X, comparable financial statements for the Business for
         the corresponding period of the preceding year.

                           (iv) In addition, as soon as reasonably practicable
         upon reasonable request, Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts
         to provide to Buyer such other financial data as may be reasonably
         requested by Buyer, including reasonably requested financial data on a
         combined basis for the Business in connection with the debt financing
         contemplated by the Financing Commitments, and unaudited selected
         financial information for the Business for 2001 and 2002, to be
         included in any offering memorandum, prospectus, or registration
         statement required to be delivered or filed in connection therewith
         (collectively, the "Additional Financial Data").

                           (v) The Financial Statements, the Stub Period Combine
         Financial Statements and the financial data in this Section 6.15 (other
         than the Subsequent Financial Statements) are collectively known as the
         "Regulation S-X Financial Statements." Seller will prepare, or cause
         the Regulation S-X Financial Statements to be prepared, in accordance
         with GAAP and on a basis consistent with the requirements of Regulation
         S-X for Buyer's or its Subsidiaries' offering memorandum, prospectus,
         registration statement and any amendments thereto in connection with
         the debt financing contemplated by the Financing Commitments and any
         updated filings. Seller shall furnish to Buyer any information or
         documents requested by Buyer, which is in Seller's possession or to
         which Seller has access, constituting, or necessary for the completion
         of, the Regulation S-X Financial Statements or any updated filings or
         amendments thereto, and Seller agrees to execute any reasonably
         necessary management representation letters to permit Buyer or its
         Subsidiaries' independent accountants to issue unqualified reports with
         respect to the Regulation S-X Financial Statements to be included in
         the offering memorandum, prospectus, registration statement any updated
         filings or amendments thereto. Seller shall furnish to Buyer any
         available drafts of the Regulation S-X Financial Statements as they
         become available and shall consider in good faith any reasonable
         suggestions Buyer may have regarding the Regulation S-X Financial
         Statements. Seller shall also cooperate with Buyer and its accountants
         in the preparation of the pro forma financial statements for the
         acquisition and Financing required under Regulation S-X as well as in
         the determination of EBITDA adjustments.

                           (vi) Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to
         obtain prior to the Closing, the consent of Deloitte & Touche LLP to
         permit the use of the Regulation S-X Financial Statements in connection
         with offerings of securities by Buyer and/or one or more of its
         Subsidiaries as contemplated by the Financing Commitments. In addition,
         Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause Deloitte & Touche
         LLP to provide a comfort letter in accordance with SAS 72 for any such
         offering.

                  (b) Except as provided herein, Buyer acknowledges and agrees
that Seller and its Affiliates have no responsibility for any financing that
Buyer may raise in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby,
including with respect to any Offering Materials prepared by or on behalf of or
utilized by Buyer or its Affiliates, or Buyer's financing sources, in connection
with Buyer's financing activities in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, regardless of whether such Offering Materials include any
information provided by Seller or any of its Affiliates (including the
Business). Any Offering Materials in connection with any debt offering or other
such Buyer financing shall include a conspicuous disclaimer to the effect that
neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates nor any employees thereof have any
responsibility for the content of such document and disclaim all responsibility
therefore and shall further include a disclaimer with respect to Seller and its
Affiliates in any oral disclosure with respect to such financing.

                  (c) Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to (i) maintain in effect the Financing and the
Commitment Letters, (ii) enter into definitive financing agreements with respect
to the Financing, so that such agreements are in effect as promptly as
practicable but in any event no later than the Closing Date and (iii) consummate
the Financing at or prior to Closing (including, if necessary, closing under the
bridge commitments included in the Financing). Buyer shall provide to Seller
copies of all documents relating to the Financing and shall keep Seller
reasonably informed of material developments in respect of the financing process
relating thereto. Prior to the Closing, Buyer shall not agree to, or permit, any
amendment or modification of, or waiver under, the Commitment Letters or other
documentation relating to the Financing that adds any conditions to the
Financing or otherwise materially adversely affects the likelihood of the
consummation of the Financing at or prior to Closing without the prior written
consent of Seller. In the period between the date hereof and the Closing Date,
upon request of Buyer, Seller shall, and shall use reasonable best efforts to
cause its Affiliates and representatives to, reasonably cooperate with Buyer in
connection with the Financing. Buyer shall promptly, upon request by Seller,
reimburse Seller for all documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Seller or
its Affiliates or representatives in connection with such cooperation.

                  (d) If, notwithstanding the use of reasonable best efforts by
Buyer to satisfy its obligations under Section 6.15(c), any of the Financing or
the Commitment Letters (or any definitive financing agreement relating thereto)
expire or are terminated prior to the Closing, in whole or in part, for any
reason, Buyer shall (i) promptly notify Seller of such expiration or termination
and the reasons therefor and (ii) use its reasonable best efforts promptly to
arrange for alternative financing (which shall not contain any conditions in
addition to those contained in such expired or terminated commitments or
agreements) to replace the financing contemplated by such expired or terminated
commitments or agreements in an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements; provided that such
reasonable effort shall in no event require Buyer to secure such substitute
financing on terms that are either (i) less favorable with respect to economic
terms (taking into account flex terms and bridge loans contained in the
Financing) or (ii) less favorable in the aggregate with respect to non-economic
terms, in each case as compared to the Financing.

                  Section 6.16 Certain Transactions.

                  (a) The Acquirors shall not, and shall not permit any of their
Affiliates, a majority of whose voting stock is owned or voted by, or a majority
of whose board of directors or analogous governing body is elected or appointed
by, in either case, directly or indirectly, funds managed by the Acquirors or
their Affiliates, to, acquire or agree to acquire by merging or consolidating
with, or by purchasing a substantial portion of the assets of or equity in, or
by any other manner, any business or any corporation, partnership, association
or other business organization or division thereof, or otherwise acquire or
agree to acquire any assets if the entering into of a definitive agreement
relating to or the consummation of such acquisition, merger or consolidation
would reasonably be expected to (i) impose any material delay in the obtaining
of, or significantly increase the risk of not obtaining, any authorizations,
consents, orders, declarations or approvals of any Governmental Entity necessary
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements or the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period,
(ii) significantly increase the risk of any Governmental Entity entering an
order prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, (iii) significantly increase the risk of
not being able to remove any such order on appeal or otherwise or (iv)
materially delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements.

                  (b) Prior to Closing, Buyer shall not, and shall not permit
any of its Affiliates to negotiate the disposition of, agree to divest or
otherwise dispose of, or cause the divestiture or disposition of, any of the
assets of or equity in, or by any other manner, the Business, except as set
forth in Section 6.4 hereof.

                  Section 6.17 Solvency Opinion. In the event that, in
connection with the Financing, either or both of the Acquirors is required to
provide to their lenders an opinion of a third party appraisal firm that,
following consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, such Acquiror(s)
and its Subsidiaries will be Solvent and that such transactions do not otherwise
"impair the capital of the corporation" within the meaning of Section 160(a) of
the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "Solvency Opinion"), it or they shall
deliver to Seller such Solvency Opinion, dated as of the Closing Date and
addressed to Seller. In the event that either or both of the Acquirors is not
required to provide such a Solvency Opinion to their lenders in connection with
the Financing, such Acquiror(s) shall deliver to Seller a certificate of an
authorized officer of such Acquiror, dated as of the Closing Date, certifying
that, following consummation of transactions contemplated hereby, such Acquiror
will be Solvent and that such transactions do not otherwise "impair the capital
of the corporation" within the meaning of Section 160(a) of the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the "Solvency Certificate").

                  Section 6.18 Access to Records; Confidentiality.

                  (a) Buyer shall preserve for a period of no less than seven

Seller and its authorized representatives following the Closing upon reasonable
notice during normal business hours the records transferred by Seller and, with
respect to records that may be relevant to any actual Tax audits or proceedings,
such additional period as is reasonably required by Seller; provided, however,
that Buyer shall notify Seller prior to destroying any such record during such
period and, provided, further, that Buyer shall maintain in the CHAMP system any
records transferred by Seller as part of such system, and Buyer shall run
reports with respect to such records upon Seller's reasonable request,
consistent with past practice. In the event that, during such seven (7) year
period, Buyer intends to cease use of the CHAMP system for its own purposes or
transfer the CHAMP system to a third party (other than in a sale of the Business
in which the transferee assumes all obligations of Buyer relating to the CHAMP
system and the applicable records), Buyer shall so notify Seller and, upon
Seller's request, shall (i) provide to Seller a copy of the then-current source
code for the CHAMP software; and (ii) grant to Seller a perpetual,
non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully-paid, irrevocable license to use and make
derivative works of such software. Buyer shall permit, to the extent permitted
by law, Seller, and any of its agents, representatives, advisors and
consultants, to have reasonable access to the employees of the Business for
information relating to periods up to and including the Closing which is
reasonably requested by Seller, subject to the same types of conditions and
limitations as set forth in Section 6.2(a).

                  (b) Any information regarding the Business or Assets
heretofore or hereafter obtained from Seller or its Affiliates by the Acquirors
or their Affiliates or representatives shall be subject to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement and such information shall be held in confidence by
the Acquirors and their Affiliates and representatives in accordance with the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. The terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement are hereby incorporated by reference and shall continue in full force
and effect until the Closing, at which time such Confidentiality Agreement shall
terminate. If this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to the
Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect
as provided in Section 8.2 hereof in accordance with its terms.

                  (c) From and after the Closing, the Acquirors shall, and shall
cause each of their Affiliates and the Business to, keep confidential and not
use for any purpose all nonpublic information regarding Seller or its Affiliates
(other than the Transferred Subsidiaries and the Business) of which the
Acquirors, their Subsidiaries, the Business or the Affected Employees may be
aware.

                  Section 6.19 Intercompany Accounts. As of 11:59 PM on the day
prior to the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause all Seller Participants to,
settle intercompany accounts payable and accounts receivable, except to the
extent arising under or in connection with the Assumed Contracts. Seller shall
determine the method by which such intercompany accounts are eliminated
including, but not limited to, by means of setoff, settlement or capital
contribution.

                  Section 6.20 Post-Closing Litigation. Other than with respect
to the matters set forth in Schedule VII, in the event and for so long as Buyer
actively is contesting or defending against any action, investigation, charge,
claim, or demand by a third party (other than Seller or its Affiliates) in
connection with (i) any transaction contemplated under this Agreement or (ii)
any practice, occurrence, event, incident, action or failure to act involving
the Business prior to the Closing Date upon the request of Buyer, Seller will
reasonably cooperate with Buyer and its counsel in the contest or defense, make
available its personnel, and provide such testimony and access to its books and
records as shall be reasonably necessary in connection with the contest or
defense, all at the sole cost and expense of Buyer (unless Buyer is entitled to
indemnification therefor under Article IX).

                  Section 6.21 Bulk Sales Law. Buyer hereby waives compliance by
Seller, in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, with the
provisions of any applicable bulk sales law; provided that, Seller shall
indemnify Buyer for any Losses arising from such non-compliance under Article
IX.

                  Section 6.22 Disclosure Supplement. Each party shall have the
right from time to time prior to the Closing to supplement or amend its
Disclosure Letter with respect to any matter hereafter arising that, if existing
or known at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth
or described in such Disclosure Letter. Any such supplemental or amended
disclosure shall not be deemed to have cured any breach of any representation or
warranty made in this Agreement for purposes of Article IX, and will not be
deemed to have cured any such breach made in this Agreement nor to have been
disclosed as of the date of this Agreement for purposes of determining whether
or not the conditions set forth in Article VII hereof have been satisfied.

                  Section 6.23 Release of Indemnity Obligations. The Seller
covenants and agrees, on or prior the Closing, to execute and deliver to each of
the Transferred Subsidiaries, for the benefit of each Transferred Subsidiary, a
general release and discharge, in form and substance satisfactory to Buyer,

to any agreement or other arrangement entered into prior to the Closing.

                  Section 6.24 Release of Liens. Seller shall release or cause
to be released all Liens on any of the Acquired Assets other than Permitted

                  Section 6.25 Insurance Matters and Contractual Indemnities.

                  (a) Seller shall assist Buyer with claims under Occurrence
Based Insurance Policies and for recovery of damages for breaches of
representations, warranties or covenants contained in contracts related to the
Business that have not been assigned to Buyer (the "Contract Indemnities") with
respect to claims arising out of pre-Closing events or occurrences in the
Business, and shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer and take commercially
reasonable actions as may be necessary to assist Buyer in submitting claims for
occurrences or damages in the Business, but only occurrences or damages arising
out of the portion of operations of the Business to which such policies or
Contractual Indemnities apply; provided that Buyer shall be responsible for any
deductibles, co-payments and assessments on retrospectively rated policies
relating to such claims and provided, further, that Seller shall not be required
to maintain any such policies or coverage relating to the Business beyond the
current respective terms of such policies. Seller will pay such Occurrence Based
Insurance Policy or Contractual Indemnities proceeds to Buyer net of deduction
and reasonable expense of recovery.

                  (b) As necessary to enable Buyer to exercise its rights under
subsection (a), Seller shall (i) assign to Buyer applicable rights in respect of
its Occurrence Based Insurance Policies as permitted under Applicable Law, (ii)
provide timely written notice of claims (following receipt of notice from Buyer)
(iii) provide information in its possession regarding any such claim under
applicable insurance policy or contract or reasonably requested by the
applicable insurer or required under the applicable contract and (iv) provide
any and all further assistance in connection with prosecution of claims. Buyer
shall provide Seller prompt written notice of any claims that it desires to
submit pursuant to clause (a) above and shall provide to Seller all information
as may be required by the applicable insurance policy or contract or reasonably
requested by the applicable insurer or required under the applicable contract in
connection with such claim.

                  (c) Following the Closing, Seller agrees to use its reasonable
best efforts to maintain coverage, and to make premium payments for Worker's
Compensation and Commercial General Liability coverage, under the Owner
Contractor Insurance Program that is currently in place to insure SW&B
Construction ("Contractor") performing construction work on the new Woodyard
Project at the Bucksport Mill ("OCIP") As of the date hereof, OCIP is insured
and claims are administered by Zurich North America (the "Insurance Company")
and the coverage and safety management is coordinated by HRH of Atlanta
("Broker"). Provided that the Insurance Company continues to provide coverage
under OCIP following Closing, Seller agrees to make premium payments for the
duration of such construction, but in no event shall Seller make any premium
payments after December 31, 2006. Buyer shall reimburse Seller at a rate of
6.48% of the final payroll of the Contractor (including all payroll classes
working under the contract) for the period starting on the Closing through the
end of such coverage, plus any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Seller
pursuant to this Section 6.25(c). In consideration for providing this coverage,
Buyer shall:

                           (i) ensure that Contractor continues to report
         payroll and other exposure information to Broker or other designated
         party as required under the OCIP guidelines that Contractor has agreed
         to under the OCIP program;

                           (ii) ensure that Contractor reports any and all
         claims or circumstances which might lead to a claim under this OCIP
         program as soon as possible, but no later than the earlier of thirty
         (30) days after the project is completed or January 31, 2007;

                           (iii) not change the scope, size or design which has
         any impact on the risk insured, including

                           (iv) maintain safety standards equal to or above the
         standards currently in place at the Bucksport Mill relating to
         construction; and

                           (v) to allow reasonable access to appropriate
         employees of Seller, Insurance Company and Broker for the purposes of
         safety audits, bookkeeping audits, or other activities to monitor and
         maintain the OCIP program.

                  Seller acknowledges that failure to meet these requirements
may result in the immediate cancellation of the OCIP program by the Insurance
Company.

                  Section 6.26 Title Insurance and Surveys.

                  (a) Title Insurance. Seller has obtained from First American
Title Insurance Company ("Title Company") and has made or will make available to
Buyer commitments (the "Title Commitments") to insure title to each of the Owned
Real Property. The commitments, any policies of title insurance, and other title
costs or charges, including search and exam fees, shall be at Buyer's expense.
At Closing, Title Company will insure good and marketable title to the Owned
Real Property and any Leased Property requested by Buyer, subject only to the
Permitted Encumbrances, and without exception for (i) survey matters (except as
shown on the survey furnished pursuant to subsection (b) below), (ii) mechanics'
or materialmen's liens, or (iii) "parties in possession," for an amount equal to
the amount allocated to the Owned Real Property and any Leased Property
requested by Buyer, under an ALTA Owner's Policy Form B-1970 (or the equivalent
thereof) (the "Title Insurance"). The Title Commitment shall include extended
coverage and all customary owners and lender's endorsements. On the Closing
Date, the Seller shall have delivered the Title Insurance to the Buyer.

                  (b) Survey. Seller, at Buyer's cost, shall procure and cause
to be delivered to Buyer on or prior to the Closing Date for each Owned Real
Property and any Leased Property reasonably requested by Buyer on which any of
the Mills is located (collectively, the "Mill Sites"), a survey (collectively,
the "Surveys"). Such Surveys shall be certified to Buyer, Buyer's lender and the
Title Company, and shall (i) meet minimum standard detail requirements for
ALTA/ACSM Land Title Surveys for the land at each Mill Site where an actual Mill
is located and the remainder of the such Mill Site, and (ii) for the remainder
of the property at each Mill Site and for any property that does not constitute
a Mill Site, shall be sufficient and satisfactory to Title Company so as to
enable Title Company to issue coverage over all general survey exceptions and to
issue all endorsements requested by Buyer and Buyer's lender. Such Surveys shall
show no matters which materially adversely affect the use or value of the Owned
Real Property or such Leased Property and shall show (i) no encroachments that
materially impair the value or use of the Owned Real Property or Leased Property
requested by Buyer, (ii) that the improvements (including without limitation all
buildings and loading docks and the parking lots appurtenant thereto) are
entirely located (except for de minimus encroachments) on the Owned Real
Property or Leased Property requested by Buyer and (iii) that the Owned Real
Property or Leased Property has access to an adjacent road (which may be over an
easement running with the Owned Real Property). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Seller has delivered to Buyer certain surveys pertaining to the Owned Real
Property. On the Closing Date, the Seller shall have delivered the Surveys to
the Buyer.

                  (c) Seller shall deliver, to the extent in its possession on
the Closing Date, to Buyer upon Closing (or, if such documents come into
Seller's possession within six (6) months following Closing, upon receipt
thereof), all original warranties, guarantees and certificates of occupancy,
licenses and permits affecting the Owned Real Property, its use or any part
thereof, together with an Assignment of Contracts, Contract Rights and Permits
and an Assignment of Additional Contracts and Contract Rights to Buyer of those
specified by Buyer.

                  Section 6.27 Transition Services; Further Action.

                  (a) Following the Closing, Seller shall provide, or cause to
be provided, to the Business certain services that are currently provided by
Seller and its Affiliates to the Business, including access to certain Retained
Assets that are currently used on a non-exclusive basis in the conduct of the
Business, subject to and on the terms set forth in the Transition Services
Agreement and other Ancillary Agreements to be entered into by the Seller and
the Buyer as of the Closing.

                  (b) If, following the Closing, the parties determine that any
property or asset used exclusively in the Business was not transferred to Buyer
or its designee pursuant to this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements (assuming
that such property or asset is not a Retained Asset set forth in Section
2.2(b)(i)-(xii)), then Seller shall, without further consideration, promptly
transfer or cause the transfer of such asset or property to the Buyer or its
designee.

                  (c) If, within five (5) months following the Closing, the
parties determine that any Critical Non-Exclusive Asset was not provided to
Buyer or its designee pursuant to the Ancillary Agreements, then Seller shall
provide to Buyer, at cost, (subject to appropriate transitional arrangements not
to exceed one year following Closing) the right to use such Critical
Non-Exclusive Asset on terms substantially similar to how such Critical
Non-Exclusive Asset was used in the Business prior to Closing; provided,
however, that the foregoing shall not apply to (A) the properties and assets set
forth in Section 6.27(c) of the Seller Disclosure Letter, (B) the properties and
assets used to provide services under the Ancillary Agreements and (C)
properties and assets the provision of which would result in (x) a breach of
contract (in which case, Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain a waiver or consent, if appropriate, the costs of which shall be borne by
the parties in accordance with Section 6.5(c)), (y) a violation of law or (z) a
waiver of the attorney-client privilege, attorney work product doctrine or any
other privilege or immunity.

                  As used herein, a "Critical Non-Exclusive Asset" means any
property or asset that is not subject to paragraph (b) above, but (i) is owned
by Seller (or to which Seller otherwise has rights), (ii) was used by the
Business on a non-exclusive basis prior to the date hereof and is necessary for
the operation of the Business as conducted as of the date hereof and (iii) is
not readily available from a third party at a comparable cost.

                  Section 6.28 CRC Facility. In the event that, following the
Closing, Seller, in its sole discretion, determines to shut down its research
and development facility located in Tuxedo Park, New York (the "CRC Facility"),
Seller shall notify Buyer of such proposed shut down at least 90 days prior to
the date on which the CRC Facility will be shut down (the "Shut Down Date").
Buyer shall have the right, within 60 days following the Shut Down Date, to
remove, at its sole cost and expense, the assets set forth in Section 6.28 of
the Seller Disclosure Letter (the "CRC Assets"). If Buyer elects to remove the
CRC Assets, it shall provide notice to Seller no later than 60 days prior to the
Shut Down Date. Buyer's removal shall be undertaken in a careful and workmanlike
manner and the premises shall be left broom clean after such removal. Buyer will
indemnify and hold Seller harmless against any (a) damage to the remaining
assets at the CRC Facility, (b) unsafe or unreliable condition caused as a
result of the removal of the CRC Assets, (c) any personal injury claims arising
from the removal of the CRC Assets or (d) any mechanics or materialmen or other
claims that are caused by or result from Buyer or its contractors undertaking
removal of the CRC Assets. For the avoidance of doubt, a sale of the CRC
Facility will not be considered a shut-down of such facility.

                  Section 6.29 Transferred Subsidiaries.

                  Prior to the Closing, Seller shall convert Bucksport Leasing
Company into a Delaware limited liability company in accordance with Section 266
of the Delaware General Corporation Law; provided, however, that Buyer shall
bear the filing fees and legal expenses incurred by Seller associated with such
conversions. Seller shall not make an election pursuant to Treasury Regulation
Section 301.7701-3 with respect to Bucksport Leasing Company to be classified as
an association taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal Income Tax purposes.

                  Section 6.30 Confidentiality by Seller.

                  From and after the date of this Agreement, unless required by
Applicable Law and except as contemplated by this Agreement, each Seller
Participant shall, and shall cause each of their respective Affiliates,
including, prior to Closing, the Business, to keep confidential all proprietary
or nonpublic information regarding the Business.

                  Section 6.31 Release of Letters of Credit.

                  Prior to the Closing, the Acquirors shall use their reasonable
best efforts to, effective on the Closing Date, either (a) arrange for
substitute letters of credit to replace the existing letters of credit of Seller
or its Affiliates (collectively, the "Released Parties") posted in favor of the
Business set forth in Section 6.31 of the Seller Disclosure Letter
(collectively, "Letters of Credit") or (b) assume all obligations under each
such Letters of Credit, obtaining from the creditor or other counter-party a
full release of the Released Parties. Following the Closing, the Acquirors shall
continue to use their reasonable best efforts to terminate, or cause Buyer or
one of its Affiliates to be substituted in all respects for the Released Parties
in respect of, all obligations of the Released Parties under any such Letters of
Credit. The Acquirors shall, to the extent the beneficiary or counter-party
under any Letter of Credit refuses to accept such a substitute letter of credit,
(i) obtain a letter of credit on behalf of Parent or Buyer and (ii) indemnify
and hold harmless the Released Parties for any Losses arising from payments
under such Letters of Credit which relate to events or circumstances arising
after the Closing. To the extent that any Released Party has performance
obligations under any such Letter of Credit, the Acquirors shall use its
reasonable best efforts to (i) perform such obligations on behalf of such
Released Party or (ii) otherwise take such action as reasonably requested by
Seller so as to put such Released Party in the same position as if the
Acquirors, and not such Released Party, had performed or was performing such
obligations.

                  Section 6.32 Transfer of Certain Wastewater Permits. Subject
to compliance by Seller with its obligations under this Section 6.32, the
Acquirors shall file with the appropriate Governmental Entity prior to the tenth
Business Day after the date of this Agreement a complete application for
transfer of each of the Wastewater Permits meeting all of the requirements of
Applicable Law for such request to transfer and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to promptly thereafter obtain from such Governmental Entity an
acknowledgement that such application is complete. Seller shall cooperate and
assist Buyer in preparing these filings, including by promptly filing any
documentation necessary to be filed by Seller in connection with the transfer of
such Wastewater Permits.

                  Section 6.33 Office Relocation. Seller will separate the
Affected Employees and Acquired Assets located at Seller's Memphis, Tennessee
facilities and Seller's Loveland, Ohio facilities (the "Business Offices") and
will relocate such offices to another Seller location (the "Relocated Business
Offices") such that, at Closing or within one (1) month after Closing, Buyer
shall be able conduct the Business from the Relocated Business Offices in
substantially the same manner as the Business was conducted prior to Closing. If
such separation and relocation shall not have occurred as of the Closing, such
Affected Employees and Acquired Assets will remain in the Business Offices and
such offices will be leased or subleased (as applicable) to the Buyer on
substantially the same terms as the Business Offices were provided to prior to
Closing until such time as such separation and relocation have occurred.

                  Section 6.34 Migration of Data and Systems. Seller will use
commercially reasonable efforts to separate and segregate the data and systems
that support the Business as necessary to perform the transition services as
contemplated by the Transition Services Agreement on or prior to the Closing. If
Seller, after using such commercially reasonable efforts, is unable to
accomplish the separation and segregation described above on or prior to the
Closing, Seller will complete such separation and segregation as soon as
reasonably practicable thereafter; provided that such segregation and separation
shall be completed no later three (3) months after the Closing Date.

                  Section 6.35 Third Party Arrangements. Prior to or at Closing,
Buyer will execute the following agreements to the extent necessary for the
Seller's provision of transition services to Buyer under the Transition Services
Agreement: (1) necessary license agreements with CINCOM, H&W Software and GT
Software; (2) services agreements with EDS and ADP; and (3) a transitional
services agreement with SAP.

                  Section 6.36 Transition Services Arrangement. Each of Seller
and Buyer shall keep reasonably detailed records of the following one-time costs
incurred by it: (i) Seller's one-time costs set forth in the schedules to the
Transition Services Agreement; and (ii) Buyer's one-time costs incurred in
connection with preparations to receive the services under the Transition
Services Agreement, including without limitation the activities contemplated by
Section 6.35 hereof (collectively, the "One Time Costs"). Seller shall bear all
One-Time Costs until such time as the One-Time Costs of both parties in the
aggregate reaches Four Million Dollars ($4,000,000), after which each party
shall bear its own One-Time Costs.

                  (a) all representations and warranties of the Acquirors in
this Agreement (without taking into account any materiality qualification

as though such representations and warranties had been made as of the Closing

or time, which shall be true and correct only as of such date or time), except
(x) for changes specifically contemplated or permitted by this Agreement and (y)

                                   TERMINATION

                  Section 8.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at
any time prior to the Closing by:

                  (a) mutual written consent of Seller, Buyer and Parent;

                  (b) either Seller or the Acquirors, upon written notice to the
other, if the Closing shall not have occurred on or prior to the six-month
anniversary of the date of this Agreement; provided, however, that if (i) the
Closing has not occurred by such date by reason of nonsatisfaction of any of the
conditions set forth in Section 7.1(a), (c) and 7.2(h) and (ii) all other
conditions set forth in Article VII have heretofore been satisfied or waived or
are then capable of being satisfied, then such date shall automatically be
extended to the date that is the eight-month anniversary of this Agreement;
provided, further, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
8.1(b) shall not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill in any
material respect any obligation under this Agreement has caused or resulted in
the failure of the Closing to occur on or before such date, whether or not such
date has been so extended; or

                  (c) either Seller or the Acquirors, upon written notice to the
other, if any court of competent jurisdiction or other competent Governmental
Entity shall have issued a statute, rule, regulation, order, decree or
injunction or taken any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such
statute, rule, regulation, order, decree or injunction or other action shall
have become final and non-appealable, unless the failure to consummate the
Closing because of such action by a Governmental Entity shall be due to the
failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to have fulfilled any
of its obligations under Section 6.3 or Section 6.4.

                  Section 8.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 hereof, (i) this Agreement
(except for Section 6.18, this Section 8.2 and Article X) shall forthwith become

or its Affiliates and (ii) all filings, applications and other submissions made
pursuant to this Agreement, to the extent practicable, shall be withdrawn from
the agency or other Person to which they were made or appropriately amended to
reflect the termination of the transactions contemplated hereby; provided,
however, that nothing contained in this Section 8.2 shall relieve any party from
liability for any intentional or willful breach of this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                            SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION

                  Section 9.1 Survival of Representations. All representations
and warranties contained herein shall survive for a period of eighteen (18)
months following the Closing Date, except for representations and warranties
contained in (i) Section 4.1 (Organization), Section 4.2 (Authorization),
Section 4.3 (Title to Personal Property; Transferred Equity Interests), Section
5.1 (Organization), and Section 5.2 (Authority), which shall survive
indefinitely, (ii) Section 4.9(c) which shall survive for a period of five years
following the Closing Date, (iii) Section 4.10 (Taxes), which shall survive
until 30 days following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
(including any applicable extensions) and (iv) Section 4.14 (Environmental
Matters), which shall survive for the period set forth in Section 9.5 (such
period set forth in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) or such eighteen (18) month
period, as applicable, the "Indemnity Period"). If a written notice of claim for
indemnification is made during the Indemnity Period, such claim shall survive
until its resolution. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no representation or
warranty shall survive any termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article
VIII. The parties intend to shorten the statute of limitations and agree that no
claims or causes of action may be brought against Seller, Buyer or any of their
respective directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, controlling persons,
agents or representatives based upon, directly or indirectly, any of the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement after the Indemnity
Period or, except as provided in Section 8.2, any termination of this Agreement.
This Section 9.1 shall not limit any covenant or agreement of the parties.

                  Section 9.2 Seller's Agreement to Indemnify.

                  (a) Subject to the terms of this Article IX, from and after
the Closing, Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer, Parent and each of
their respective Affiliates (other than Seller), directors, officers and
successors (to the extent set forth in Section 10.9) (each, a "Buyer Indemnified
Party") from and against all out of pocket liabilities, claims, assessments,
losses, judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, damages, costs and expenses
(including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses)
(collectively, the "Buyer Damages") incurred by a Buyer Indemnified Party as a
result of or arising out of (i) the Excluded Liabilities or the Retained Assets
(other then Consigned Inventory), (ii) a breach of any representation or
warranty contained in Article IV of this Agreement, in each case, when made, and
it being understood that such representations and warranties shall be
interpreted without giving effect to any limitations or qualifications as to
"materiality" (including the word "material") or Material Adverse Effect set
forth therein (other than Section 4.10 and Section 4.14 which shall be governed
by Section 6.9 and Sections 9.5, 9.8 and 9.9 respectively) or (iii) a breach in
any material respect of any agreement or covenant of Seller in this Agreement
(other than agreements and covenants relating to Taxes and environmental
matters, which shall be governed by Section 6.9 and Sections 9.5, 9.8 and 9.9
respectively). Buyer agrees that, except as contemplated by the immediately
preceding sentence, from and after the Closing, the indemnification provided in
this Section 9.2 is the exclusive remedy for a breach by Seller of any
representation, warranty, agreement or covenant contained in this Agreement.

                  (b) Seller's obligations to indemnify Buyer Indemnified
Parties pursuant to Sections 9.2(a) and 9.5 hereof are subject to the following
limitations (other than as specifically set forth in Section 9.5):

                           (i) No indemnification shall be made by Seller with
         respect to any claim for breach of any representation or warranty
         pursuant to Sections 9.2(a)(ii) or 9.5 ("Buyer Claim") unless (a) the
         aggregate amount of Buyer Damages incurred by a Buyer Indemnified Party
         with respect to such Buyer Claim exceeds $100,000 (the "Minimum Claim
         Amount") and (b) the amount of (1) aggregate Buyer Damages, under all
         Buyer Claims, and (2) payments made by Buyer pursuant to Section 9.9(b)
         exceeds an amount equal to $20,000,000 (twenty million dollars) (the
         "Basket Amount") and, in such event, indemnification shall be made by
         Seller only for the amount by which such Buyer Damages exceed, in the
         aggregate, the Basket Amount;

                           (ii) In no event shall Seller's aggregate obligation
         to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties with respect to any claim
         for breach of representation or warranty pursuant to Section
         9.2(a)(ii), together with any indemnification pursuant to Sections 9.5,
         exceed an amount equal to twenty percent (20%) of the Cash Purchase
         Price (the "Cap");

                           (iii) In calculating amounts payable to a Buyer
         Indemnified Party, the amount of any indemnified Buyer Damages shall be
         determined without duplication of any other Buyer Damages for which a
         Buyer Claim has been made or could be made under any other
         representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement included herein;

                           (iv) The amount of any Buyer Damages with respect to
         any claim for breach of representation or warranty pursuant to Section
         9.2(a)(ii) shall be reduced by any amount (A) that is reserved for sums
         held in reserve in respect of the indemnifiable event on the balance
         sheet of the Business as of December 31, 2005 or reflected in the
         statement of Net Working Capital used to determine the Final Net
         Working Capital Amount or (B) actually received by a Buyer Indemnified
         Party with respect thereto under any third party insurance coverage or
         from any other party alleged to be responsible therefor. If a Buyer
         Indemnified Party makes a claim for indemnification under Sections
         9.2(a)(ii) or 9.5, the Buyer Indemnified Party shall use its reasonable
         best efforts to collect any amounts available under such insurance
         coverage and from such other party alleged to have responsibility. If a
         Buyer Indemnified Party receives an amount under insurance coverage or
         from such other party with respect to Buyer Damages at any time
         subsequent to any indemnification provided by Seller pursuant to
         Sections 9.2(a)(ii) or 9.5, then such Buyer Indemnified Party shall
         promptly reimburse Seller for any payment made or expense incurred by
         Seller in connection with providing such indemnification up to such
         amount received by the Buyer Indemnified Party, but net of any expenses
         incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Party in collecting such amount. To
         the extent Seller makes any indemnification payment pursuant to
         Sections 9.2(a)(ii) or 9.5 in respect of Buyer Damages for which a
         Buyer Indemnified Party has a right to recover against a third party
         (including an insurance company), Seller shall be subrogated to the
         right of the Buyer Indemnified Party to seek and obtain recovery from
         such third party; provided, however, that if Seller shall be prohibited
         from such subrogation, the Buyer Indemnified Party shall seek recovery
         from such third party on Seller's behalf and pay any such recovery to
         Seller net of expenses;

                           (v) Seller shall be obligated to indemnify, subject
         to the terms and conditions of this Article IX, a Buyer Indemnified
         Party for breach of representation or warranty only for those Buyer
         Claims as to which the Buyer Indemnified Party has given Seller written
         notice prior to the end of the Indemnity Period;

                           (vi) Any written notice delivered by a Buyer
         Indemnified Party to Seller seeking indemnification pursuant to this
         Agreement with respect to Buyer Damages shall set forth, with as much
         specificity as is reasonably practicable, the basis of the Buyer Claim,
         the sections of this Agreement which form the basis for the Claim,
         copies of material written materials relating to such Claim and, to the
         extent reasonably practicable, a reasonable estimate of the amount of
         the Buyer Damages that have been or may be sustained by the Buyer
         Indemnified Party;

                           (vii) Any indemnity amounts payable by Seller to or
         on behalf of the Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to this Agreement
         (including, without limitation, any indemnity payment made under this
         Article IX) shall be reduced by any Tax Benefit arising from the claim,
         loss or damage actually received in cash in the current year for which
         the indemnity is being paid; and

                           (viii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this
         Agreement, in no event shall Buyer be entitled to indemnification
         pursuant to this Agreement to the extent of the Buyer Damages
         attributable to Buyer's own gross negligence or willful misconduct.

                  Section 9.3 The Acquirors' Agreement to Indemnify.

                  (a) Subject to the terms of this Article IX, from and after
the Closing, each of the Acquirors, severally and not jointly, shall indemnify
and hold harmless Seller, its Affiliates and each of their respective directors,
officers and successors (to the extent set forth in Section 10.9) (each, a
"Seller Indemnified Party") from and against all out of pocket liabilities,
claims, assessments, losses, judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, damages,
costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees
and expenses) (collectively, the "Seller Damages") incurred by a Seller
Indemnified Party as a result of or arising out of (i) the Assumed Liabilities,
the Acquired Assets and the Consigned Inventory, (ii) a breach of any
representation or warranty contained in Article V of this Agreement, in each
case when made, and it being understood that such representations and warranties
shall be interpreted without giving effect to any limitations or qualifications
as to "materiality" (including the word "material") or Material Adverse Effect
set forth therein, (iii) a breach of any agreement or covenant in any material
respect of an Acquiror contained herein including any covenant concerning
Affected Employees set forth in Section 6.8 (other than agreements and covenants
relating to Taxes, which shall be governed exclusively by Section 6.9) or (iv)
the use, operation or ownership of the Business or any of the Acquired Assets
(excluding the Excluded Liabilities and Retained Assets (other than the
Consigned Inventory)) after the Closing. Seller agrees that, except as
contemplated by the immediately preceding sentence, from and after the Closing,
the indemnification provided in this Section 9.3 is the exclusive remedy for a
breach by an Acquiror of any representation, warranty, agreement or covenant
contained in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall not,
with respect to the preceding clauses (i) and (iv), indemnify the Seller
Indemnified Parties for Seller Damages related to the Consigned Inventory not
incurred as a result of or arising out of third-party claims.

                  (b) The Acquirors' obligations to indemnify Seller Indemnified
Parties pursuant to Section 9.3(a) are subject to the following limitations:

                           (i) No indemnification shall be made by either of the
         Acquirors with respect to any claim for breach of representation or
         warranty pursuant to Section 9.3(a)(ii) ("Seller Claim") unless (a) the
         aggregate amount of Seller Damages incurred by a Seller Indemnified
         Party with respect to such Seller Claim exceeds the Minimum Claim
         Amount and (b) the aggregate amount of Seller Damages, under all Seller
         Claims, exceeds the Basket Amount and, in such event, indemnification
         shall be made by the Acquirors only for the amount by which such Seller
         Damages exceed, in the aggregate, the Basket Amount;

                           (ii) In no event shall the Acquirors' aggregate
         obligation to indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties with respect to
         any claim for breach of representation or warranty pursuant to Section
         9.3(a)(ii) exceed an amount equal to the Cap;

                           (iii) In calculating amounts payable to a Seller
         Indemnified Party, the amount of any indemnified Seller Damages shall
         be determined without duplication of any other Seller Damages for which
         a Seller Claim has been made or could be made under any other
         representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement included herein;

                           (iv) The amount of any Seller Damages shall be
         reduced by any amount that was actually received by a Seller
         Indemnified Party with respect thereto under any third party insurance
         coverage or from any other party alleged to be responsible therefor. If
         a Seller Indemnified Party makes a claim for indemnification under
         Section 9.3, the Seller Indemnified Party shall use its reasonable best
         efforts to collect any amounts available under such insurance coverage
         and from such other party alleged to have responsibility. If the Seller
         Indemnified Party receives an amount under insurance coverage or from
         such other party with respect to the Seller Damages at any time
         subsequent to any indemnification provided by an Acquiror pursuant to
         Section 9.3, then Seller shall promptly reimburse such Acquiror for any
         payment made or expense incurred by such Acquiror in connection with
         providing such indemnification up to such amount received by a Seller
         Indemnified Party, but net of any expenses incurred by the Seller
         Indemnified Party in collecting such amount. To the extent an Acquiror
         makes any indemnification payment pursuant to Section 9.3 in respect of
         the Seller Indemnified Party Damages for which a Seller Indemnified
         Party has a right to recover against a third party (including an
         insurance company, such Acquiror shall be subrogated to the right of
         the Seller Indemnified Party to seek and obtain recovery from such
         third party; provided, however, that if such Acquiror shall be
         prohibited from such subrogation, the Seller Indemnified Party shall
         seek recovery from such third party on such Acquiror's behalf and pay
         any such recovery to such Acquiror, net of expenses;

                           (v) The Acquirors shall be obligated to indemnify,
         subject to the terms and conditions of this Article IX, a Seller
         Indemnified Party for breach of any representation or warranty only for
         those Seller Claims as to which a Seller Indemnified Party has given
         either of the Acquirors written notice prior to the end of the
         Indemnity Period;

                           (vi) Any written notice delivered by a Seller
         Indemnified Party to either of the Acquirors seeking indemnification
         pursuant to this Agreement with respect to Seller Damages shall set
         forth, with as much specificity as is reasonably practicable, the basis
         of the Seller Claim, the sections of this Agreement which form the
         basis for the Seller Claim, copies of material written materials
         relating to such Seller Claim and, to the extent reasonably
         practicable, a reasonable estimate of the amount of the Seller Damages
         that have been or may be sustained by the Seller Indemnified Party;

                           (vii) Any indemnity amounts payable by Buyer to or on
         behalf of Seller pursuant to this Agreement (including, without
         limitation, any indemnity payment made under this Article IX) shall be
         reduced by any Tax Benefit arising from the claim, loss or damage
         actually received in cash in the current year or a previous year for
         which the indemnity is being paid; and

                           (viii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this
         Agreement, in no event shall Seller be entitled to indemnification
         pursuant to this Agreement to the extent of the Seller Damages
         attributable to Seller's own gross negligence or willful misconduct.

                  Section 9.4 Third Party Indemnification. The obligations of
any indemnifying party to indemnify any indemnified party under this Article IX
with respect to Buyer Damages or Seller Damages, as the case may be, resulting
from the assertion of a Buyer Claim or of a claim under Section 9.10,
respectively, by third parties (including Governmental Entities) (a "Claim"),
shall be subject to the following terms and conditions:

                  (a) Any party against whom any Claim is asserted shall give
the party required to provide indemnity hereunder written notice of any such
Claim promptly after learning of such Claim (with such notice satisfying the
requirements of Section 9.2(b)(vi) or 9.3(b)(vi), as the case may be), and the
indemnifying party may at its option undertake the defense thereof by
representatives of its own choosing and shall provide written notice of any such
undertaking to the indemnified party. Failure to give prompt written notice of a
Claim hereunder shall not affect the indemnifying party's obligations under this
Article IX, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is actually
prejudiced by such failure to give prompt written notice. The indemnified party
shall, and shall cause its employees and representatives to, cooperate with the
indemnifying party in connection with the settlement or defense of such Claim
and shall provide the indemnifying party with all available information and
documents concerning such Claim. The indemnifying party shall provide the
indemnified party with copies of all non-privileged communications and other
information in respect of the Claim. If the indemnifying party, within thirty
(30) days after written notice of any such Claim, fails to assume the defense of
such Claim, or, after assuming defense, negligently fails to defend and fails to
call after reasonable written notice of the same, the indemnified party against
whom such claim has been made shall (upon further written notice to the
indemnifying party) have the right to undertake the defense, compromise or
settlement of such claim on behalf of and for the account and risk, and at the
expense, of the indemnifying party, subject to the right of the indemnifying
party to assume the defense of such Claim at any time prior to settlement,
compromise or final determination thereof upon written notice to the indemnified
party.

                  (b) Anything in this Section 9.4 to the contrary
notwithstanding, (i) the indemnified party shall not settle a claim for which it
is indemnified without the prior written consent of the indemnifying party,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed and
(ii) the indemnifying party shall not enter into any settlement or compromise of
any action, suit or proceeding, or consent to the entry of any judgment for
relief other than monetary damages to be borne by the indemnifying party,
without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

                  Section 9.5 Environmental Liability.

                  (a) If the Closing occurs, subject to the provisions of
Section 9.2(b) (except that the Minimum Claim Amount and Basket Amount in
Section 9.2(b)(i) shall not apply in connection with clauses (ii), (iii) and (v)
below and the Cap in Section 9.2(b)(ii) shall not apply to clause (v) below),
Section 9.4 and Section 9.6, Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
the Buyer Indemnified Parties from and against any Buyer Damages incurred or
suffered by Buyer (i) as a result of or arising out of a breach of any
representation or warranty set forth in Section 4.14, it being understood that
such representations and warranties shall be interpreted without giving effect
to any limitations or qualifications as to materiality (including the word
"material") or Material Adverse Effect, (ii) as a consequence of Hazardous
Substances that are present or released on or before the Closing at, on, under,
about or migrating from any of the Real Property subject to special limitations
provided in Section 9.5(c); (iii) in connection with claims or proceedings by
third parties in respect of personal injury or property damage as a result of
Hazardous Substances that were present or released, on or before the Closing,
at, on, under, about or migrating from, any of the Real Property; subject to
special limitations set forth in Section 9.5(c); (iv) in connection with
violations by Seller (in respect of the Business) of any applicable
Environmental Law (including any Permits issued pursuant to such applicable
Environmental Law) prior to the Closing and (v) as a result of or arising out of
the breach of any agreement or covenant in this Agreement relating to
environmental matters, other than with respect to Section 9.8 or Section 9.9.

                  (b) Limitations as to Dams and Landfills Indemnity. Anything
in this Agreement notwithstanding, the indemnification provided by Seller in
Section 9.5(a) hereof shall not include (i) the cost of operation, opening,
closure, or maintenance of any landfills at, or associated with the operation
of, any of the Real Property and which landfills are disclosed in Section 4.14
of the Seller Disclosure Letter, or compliance with the requirements imposed by
or agreed to with any Governmental Entity as of the Closing Date at any such
landfill, except to the extent that Buyer can demonstrate that such costs, as
well as any increase in such costs subsequent to the Closing Date, result from
(A) a Release of Hazardous Substances from or at such landfill prior to the
Closing Date and (B) a requirement imposed by Environmental Law, a Governmental
Entity (pursuant to Environmental Law), or agreement with any Governmental
Entity or third person (entered pursuant to the requirements of Section 9.4
hereof and pursuant to Environmental Law), other than any such requirement or
agreement existing as of the Closing Date, and which is otherwise eligible for
the indemnification provided in Section 9.5(a) hereof; and (ii) the cost of
operation, opening, closure, or maintenance of dams and all appurtenant
structures such as fish ladders, at, or associated with the operation of, any of
the Real Property, other than as set forth in Section 9.8, and which dams and
appurtenant structures disclosed in Section 4.14 of the Seller Disclosure
Letter, including compliance with any conditions of any Permits applicable
thereto (regardless of whether issued, expired, or renewed before or after the
Closing Date), except to the extent that such costs or an increase in such costs
subsequent to the Closing Date, result from (A) a Release of Hazardous
Substances in connection with such dam prior to the Closing Date and (B)
provided that such indemnification shall include any violation of Environmental
Law arising from the existence or operation of such dams and structures to the
extent provided in Section 9.5(a)(iv) hereof.

                  (c) Survival. Seller's obligation to indemnify, defend and
hold harmless Buyer for the matters addressed in Section 9.5(a) shall be limited
to those matters as to which Buyer provides Seller with written notice (such
notice to be in conformance with Section 9.2(b)(iv)) within two (2) years after
the Closing, provided that, such two-year period shall not expire until four
years after the Closing for any matter as to which Buyer can demonstrate the
presence of a release of Hazardous Substances for which Seller is providing an
indemnification to Buyer in this Agreement occurred before the Closing and the
concentration of any such Hazardous Substance resulting from the presence of or
a release in any environmental medium first exceeded a Remediation Standard
subsequent to the Closing Date but before the fourth anniversary of the Closing
Date, provided that Seller's obligation to indemnify the Buyer in such instances
shall be limited to the extent of Seller's pre-Closing contribution to the
contamination which is the subject of remediation.

                  (d) General Limitations. With respect to claims to defend,
indemnify and hold harmless Buyer pursuant to Section 9.5(a):

                           (i) Seller shall only be required to defend,
         indemnify and hold harmless Buyer to the extent that: (A) the
         investigation, containment, remediation or liability for damages as to
         Hazardous Substances is pursuant to an Environmental Law that is in
         effect as of and is enforceable as of the Closing; (B) the Remediation
         Standards, if any, that must be met in order to satisfy the
         requirements of Environmental Law: (1) are no more stringent than the
         Remediation Standards that were in effect (if any) as of the Closing
         Date under the applicable Environmental Law that is the source of the
         obligation to conduct a remediation, or, where no such Remediation
         Standards had been promulgated and were enforceable as of the Closing
         Date, Remediation Standards that were applied by a Governmental Entity,
         within one (1) year prior to the Closing Date, on a case-by-case basis,
         to properties that are most similar to the property that is subject to
         a remediation in the same jurisdiction and (2) are those Remediation
         Standards that would be the least stringent Remediation Standards
         acceptable to a Governmental Entity, taking into account that the
         normal operating condition at the affected facility shall be maintained
         at all times, that would be applicable given the use of the property as
         of the Closing Date; and (C) investigation, containment and/or
         remediation is conducted using the most cost effective methods, taking
         into account that the normal operating condition at the affected
         facility shall be maintained at all times, for investigation,
         remediation and/or containment consistent with applicable Environmental
         Law. To the extent that the Buyer Damages incurred in connection with
         an investigation, containment or remediation are in excess of the Buyer
         Damages that would be incurred for an investigation, containment or
         remediation meeting the conditions set forth in this subsection, Seller
         shall have no obligation to indemnify Buyer for such excess Buyer
         Damages. If Seller is undertaking investigative or remedial action,
         Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to minimize, to the extent
         practicable, interference with Buyer's business operations.

                           (ii) If the costs of an investigation, containment or
         remediation at any of the Real Property that is subject to an indemnity
         by Seller hereunder are increased due to an act or omission (after the
         Closing) by a Person other than Seller, a Subsidiary of Seller, or an
         agent, representative or contractor of Seller, Seller shall not be
         responsible for any such increase in costs incurred. Seller shall not
         be responsible for any increased costs or increased Buyer Damages under
         this subsection to the extent they arise by reason of (A) the voluntary
         closure of operations at the Owned Real Property or (B) a material
         change in use of any of said property from the use of said property as
         of the Closing.

                  (e) Limitation as to Remediation Projects. Anything in this
Agreement notwithstanding, the indemnification provided by Seller in Section
9.5(a) hereof shall be subject to the following conditions: (i) To the extent
necessary to achieve the purposes set forth in Sections 9.5 and 9.6 hereof,
Buyer shall not unreasonably withhold consent to a deed restriction or other
institutional controls required by and acceptable to a Governmental Entity under
Environmental Law on the relevant facility that is subject to such
indemnification, provided that such deed restriction or other institutional
controls shall not restrict or limit the industrial activities which were being
performed at such facility as of the Closing Date.

                           (ii) Buyer agrees that it shall and shall cause any
         of the Subsidiaries to, in good faith, seek to enter, when necessary,
         into an agreement with the Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over
         the investigation or remedial action, or other action, which is the
         subject of this Section 9.5 or of Section 9.6 to allow the Seller to
         use the most commercially reasonable method and least stringent
         Remediation Standard acceptable to a Governmental Entity and affected
         parties in connection with such investigation or remediation under such
         circumstances and use.

                           (iii) Seller and Buyer agree that the issuance of a
         "no further action" letter or the equivalent indicia of completion
         issued by any Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over remediation
         shall constitute completion of Seller's obligations under this Section
         9.5 or Section 9.6 which is subject to approval by a Governmental
         Entity, regardless of any language in such document allowing the matter
         to be reopened for non-material conditions.

                           (iv) Buyer shall not, and shall not cause any other
         Person to, provide or disclose to any Person or Governmental Entity,
         any information in any form including reports, analyses, sampling
         results or data, relating to any of the conditions which this Section
         9.5 or Section 9.6 requires Seller to investigate or remediate, except
         to the extent that such disclosure is required by Environmental Laws or
         by a Governmental Entity, or in connection with a sale of the Business
         (subject to appropriate confidentiality obligations).

                  (f) Indemnity as to Oversight Costs. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein, with respect to claims arising pursuant to Section 9.5,
the parties shall not be obligated to indemnify for the costs and expenses
associated with oversight of performance of defense and indemnity obligations,
including, but not limited to, the costs and expenses of overseeing legal
counsel, consultants, or employees, and the parties shall not be obligated to
indemnify each other for any costs or expenses for management and employee time
costs.

                  (g) Indemnity for Breach of Environmental Representation or
Covenant. If Buyer may seek indemnification for a claim pursuant to Section
9.5(a) and either Section 9.8 or Section 9.9, then the provisions of Section 9.8
or Section 9.9, as the case may be, shall govern. For the avoidance of doubt,
Buyer's right to indemnity under Section 9.5(a) shall be without duplication for
claims that Buyer may make under more than one clause of Section 9.5(a) and
Buyer's right to indemnification under either Section 9.8 or Section 9.9 shall
be without duplication for claims that Buyer may make under Section 9.5.

                  (h) Indemnity Procedures to Apply. Except as otherwise noted,
Claims brought pursuant to this Section 9.5 that constitute "Claims" as defined
in Section 9.4 shall be subject to the procedures for indemnification set forth
in Section 9.4 if such claims are third party claims. Claims that involve or
also involve the investigation, containment and/or remediation of Hazardous
Substances at the Real Property shall also be subject to the procedures of
Section 9.6.

                  Section 9.6 Additional Procedures for Remedial Actions on the
Real Property.

                  (a) Seller shall have the right to control the management of
an investigation, containment or remediation of Hazardous Substances at the Real
Property that is subject to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement. Buyer
hereby grants Seller reasonable continued access to the Real Property consistent
with such right to control the management of an investigation, containment or
remediation provided Seller's entry onto the Buyer's property shall be at
reasonable times, and on reasonable advance notice and Seller shall use its
reasonable best efforts so that such entry is without unreasonable interference
to Buyer's business operations. Seller must notify Buyer, within sixty (60) days
of receipt of notice of Buyer's claim for indemnification for such matter, that
(i) it intends to undertake said responsibility or (ii) more information is
needed from Buyer before Seller can reasonably determine that Buyer's claim is
subject to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement. Buyer shall promptly
respond to such requests for information (to the extent such information is
reasonably available to Buyer) and, within thirty (30) days of receipt of such
information, Seller shall notify Buyer as to whether it shall undertake the
investigation, containment and/or remediation. Prior to a determination by
Seller that it will undertake investigation, containment and/or remediation
pursuant to this Section, Buyer shall take only those actions necessary to
comply with applicable Environmental Laws, the requirements of Governmental
Authorities or address conditions that pose a substantial imminent endangerment
to health, safety or the environment.

                  (b) In undertaking an investigation, containment and/or
remediation pursuant to this Section 9.6, Seller shall retain a qualified
independent environmental consultant, which consultant shall be subject to
Buyer's approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). Seller shall undertake such investigation, containment and/or
remediation in a prompt and expeditious fashion in accordance with applicable
Environmental Laws and shall not cause, through its own inaction, any undue
delay in obtaining written approvals from appropriate regulatory bodies as to
investigation, containment or remediation necessary with respect to the matter
that is the subject of the indemnification claim, or, if no regulatory body is
involved in such matter, a good faith determination from its independent
environmental consultant that no further investigation, containment or
remediation is required to bring the property that is the subject of the
remedial action into conformance with applicable Environmental Laws. Seller
shall comply with all Applicable Laws, including all applicable Environmental
Laws, with respect to its performance pursuant to this Section 9.6. In the event
that Seller undertakes the performance of an investigation, containment and/or
remediation pursuant to this Section 9.6, Seller shall have primary
responsibility to interact and negotiate with any Governmental Authorities
having jurisdiction over such investigation, containment and/or remediation.
Seller shall promptly provide copies to Buyer of all notices, correspondence,
draft reports, submissions, work plans, and final reports and shall give Buyer a
reasonable opportunity (at Buyer's own expense) to comment on any submissions
Seller intends to deliver or submit to the appropriate regulatory body prior to
said submission. Buyer may, at its own expense, hire its own consultants,
attorneys or other professionals to monitor the investigation, containment
and/or remediation, including any field work undertaken by Seller, and Seller
shall provide Buyer with copies of the results of all such field work.
Notwithstanding the above, Buyer shall not take any actions that shall
unreasonably interfere with Seller's performance of the investigation,
remediation and/or containment. Seller shall undertake any such work required
hereby in a manner designed to minimize any disruption, to the extent reasonably
possible, with the conduct of operations at the applicable property. Buyer shall
allow Seller reasonable access to conduct any of the work contemplated herein
and shall fully cooperate with Seller in the performance of the investigation,
remediation or containment, including, but not limited to, providing Seller with
reasonable access to employees and documents as Seller reasonably deems
necessary.

                  (c) If Seller declines to undertake the performance of an
investigation, containment and/or remediation hereunder or wrongfully fails to
perform and fails to cure the same after reasonable notice, Buyer shall be
entitled to control the investigation, containment and/or remediation. Buyer
shall promptly provide copies to Seller of all notices, correspondence, draft
reports, submissions, work plans, and final reports and shall give Seller a
reasonable opportunity (at Seller's own expense) to comment on any submissions
Buyer intends to deliver or submit to the appropriate regulatory body prior to
said submission. Seller may, at its own expense, hire its own consultants,
attorneys or other professionals to monitor the investigation containment and/or
remediation, including any field work undertaken by Buyer, and Buyer shall
provide Seller with copies of the results of all such field work.
Notwithstanding the above, Seller shall not take any actions that shall
unreasonably interfere with Buyer's performance of the investigation,
containment and/or remediation. Seller's decision to allow Buyer to undertake
investigation and remediation hereunder shall not limit or affect Seller's
obligation to indemnify Buyer for said investigation, containment and/or
remediation as otherwise provided in this Agreement.

                  Section 9.7 Exclusive Remedy for Environmental Matters;
Indemnification by Buyer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, Buyer hereby agrees that its sole and exclusive remedy against
Seller, with respect to any and all matters arising under or related to
Environmental Law or Hazardous Substances and with respect to the Business and
the Owned Real Property, shall be the indemnification rights set forth in
Section 9.5, Section 9.8 and Section 9.9. Except with respect to the remedy
referred to in the preceding sentence, Buyer hereby waives, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable law, and forever release Seller (with respect
to the Business) and the Owned Real Property, from, and indemnify and hold
harmless the Seller Indemnities against, any and all Claims or Seller Damages
arising under Environmental Laws or relating to Hazardous Substances or the
environment.

                  Section 9.8 Riley Dam Indemnity.

                  (a) If the Closing occurs, then subject to the procedures set
forth in clause (b) below, Seller shall indemnity, defend and hold harmless the
Buyer Indemnified Parties from and against any Buyer Damages, including
investigation and remediation costs, incurred by Buyer in excess of $2 million
prior to the later of (i) two (2) years from the Closing Date (it being the
present intention of the parties that an investigation shall be completed in the
fall of 2006 and remediation shall be completed in 2007) or (ii) such later date
as may reasonably be required in consideration of river conditions relevant to
such investigation and remediation, reasonable agreement of the parties on final
remedy as provided in clause (b) below, and necessary approvals from
Governmental Entities and third parties, in connection with restoration or
replacement of the Riley Dam for the purpose of abating subsidence occurring at,
and repairing deterioration causing such subsidence of the Riley Dam, but only
to the extent such damage or deterioration to the Riley Dam is not caused by
Buyer (other than the operation of the Riley Dam in the ordinary course of
business).

                  (b) For purposes of this section, indemnified costs shall be
limited to the lowest reasonable cost applicable to accomplish restoration or
replacement, taking into account: (i) the normal operating conditions at the
affected facilities and (ii) applicable law. Seller shall have the right to
control all investigation and remediation actions, including communication with
affected parties and Governmental Entities having jurisdiction over such
actions, provided that Seller shall take all reasonable measures, to the extent
practical, to prevent disruption of normal business operations at the affected
facilities. Buyer also shall provide Seller reasonable access to the Real
Property and affected facilities to conduct any of the work contemplated herein
and shall fully cooperate with Seller in the performance of such work. Seller
shall promptly provide copies to Buyer of all notices, correspondence, draft and
final reports, draft and final designs, pleadings, submissions, and work plans,
and shall give Buyer reasonable opportunity (at Buyer's sole expense) to provide
advance comment on any material designs as well as any administrative or
judicial submissions (including communications to Governmental Entities or third
parties), and Seller shall give reasonable consideration to the same. Any final
restoration or replacement plan shall be subject to approval of Buyer, such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Buyer may, at its own
expense, hire its own consultants, attorney or other professionals to monitor
the investigation and remediation without unreasonable interference or delay to
Seller's performance of the investigation and remediation. If Seller negligently
fails to perform the investigation or remediation as provided in clause (a) and
fails to cure after reasonable written notice of the same, Buyer shall have the
right to undertake the investigation and remediation.

                  Section 9.9 Androscoggin Wastewater Indemnity.

                  (a) If the Closing occurs, and if the terms and conditions of
the Androscoggin Wastewater Permits in existence as of the date hereof (the
"Existing Androscoggin Wastewater Permit") are made more stringent in
resolution of the challenges and allegations made in the proceedings listed on
Section 9.9 of the Seller Disclosure Letter, including amendments to such
permit, or replacement of such permit with a new permit, including pursuant to
any judicial, administrative, or consented to resolution of such proceedings
(such amended permit or new permit, as applicable, the "Replacement
Androscoggin Wastewater Permits"), Seller shall, subject to the limitations set
forth in Section 9.9(b) and (c) below, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Buyer Indemnified Parties for: (i) any capital expenditures required to be
incurred by a Buyer Indemnified Party for the purpose of complying with the
terms and conditions of the Replacement Androscoggin Wastewater Permit
("Androscoggin Cap Ex Costs"), (ii) any operational and maintenance costs
required to be incurred by Buyer for the purpose of complying with the terms
and conditions of the Replacement Androscoggin Wastewater Permits
("Androscoggin O&M Costs") and (iii) fines, penalties and third-party damages
arising from civil and administrative challenges to and claims in respect of
the Existing Androscoggin Wastewater Permits, in each case, including all out
of pocket liabilities, losses, costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorney's fees) ("Androscoggin Fines"); provided, however, that Seller's
indemnification obligations pursuant to this Section 9.9(a) shall terminate on
the earlier of (A) the expiration of the Replacement Androscoggin Wastewater
Permit (or the expiration of the Existing Androscoggin Wastewater Permit, if
such Existing Androscoggin Wastewater Permit is amended to resolve the
challenges and allegations described in this Section 9.9(a) or the challenges

notice, to comment on any proposed judicial and administrative settlement and
provide its consent to the same, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.

                  Section 9.10 BELLC Indemnity. If the Closing occurs, Seller
shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified Parties from and

Operating & Mutual Sales Agreement, between Seller (as successor by merger to
Champion International Corporation) and BELLC, dated as of July 27, 1999, as
amended on July 27, 1999, Seller's obligation to indemnify Buyer therefore shall

effect as of the Closing Date.

Transferred Business continued to be owned by Buyer to the extent related to
indemnification claims brought by such Person against Buyer.

                  Section 10.7 Governing Law. THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING ALL
MATTERS OF CONSTRUCTION, VALIDITY AND PERFORMANCE, SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT REGARD

IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL ACTION,

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) Acquirors may assign this Agreement and the

Agreement), in whole or in part, to any of their Affiliates but in no event
shall such assignment release the Acquirors from their obligations hereunder,

connection with the assignment of this Agreement to such Affiliate pursuant to
clause (i) above, (iii) any party may assign this Agreement and the Ancillary

may collaterally assign its rights under this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements (including the Transition Services Agreement) to any Person providing

transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated, each party shall
bear its own fees and expenses incurred in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except Seller shall bear all Transfer Taxes up
to $5,000,000 in the aggregate and all Transfer Taxes in excess of $5,000,000
shall be borne 50% by Buyer and 50% by Seller. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate

rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement.

                  Section 10.12 Severability. This Agreement shall be deemed
severable; the invalidity or unenforceability of any term or provision of this
Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of this Agreement or
of any other term hereof, which shall remain in full force and effect, for so
long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. The
parties hereby acknowledge and agree that the covenants set forth in Section
6.10 and Section 6.11 are reasonable in scope and in all other respects. If it
is ever held that any restriction hereunder is too broad to permit enforcement
of such restriction to its fullest extent, each party agrees that such
restriction may be enforced to the maximum extent permitted by law, and each
party hereby consents and agrees that such scope may be judicially modified
accordingly in any proceeding brought to enforce such restriction.

                  Section 10.13 No Right of Setoff. Neither party hereto nor any
Affiliate thereof may deduct from, set off, holdback or otherwise reduce in any
manner whatsoever any amount owed to it hereunder or pursuant to any Ancillary
Agreement against any amounts owed hereunder or pursuant to any Ancillary
Agreement by such Persons to the other party hereto or any of such other party's
Affiliates.

                  Section 10.14 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree
that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any provision of this
Agreement was not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the
parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, in
addition to any other remedy at law or equity.

                  Section 10.15 Construction.

                  (a) Information disclosed in any section of the Seller
Disclosure Letter or the Buyer Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to be disclosed
with respect to such other sections of this Agreement or the Seller Disclosure
Letter to which such disclosure would reasonably pertain in light of the form
and substance of the disclosure made.

                  (b) The parties have participated jointly in the negotiation
and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent
or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted
jointly by the parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provisions
of this Agreement.
