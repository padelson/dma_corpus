investigation.

 

This Agreement has been reviewed, negotiated and accepted by all parties and

and conditions of employment (including the compensation) of any Transferring
Employee, subject to applicable Law.

accrued benefits of all Business Employees under its defined benefit pension
plan (the " _Seller Pension Plan_ ") and defined contribution pension plan
(the " _Seller 401(k) Plan_ ") to become fully vested. As soon as reasonably
practical following the Closing Date, Seller Parent will cause the accounts of
each Transferring Employee under the Seller 401(k) Plan to be transferred to
the qualified 401(k) plan of the Buyer (the " _Buyer 401(k) Plan_ "). Such
transfer will include a transfer of the corresponding assets from the trust
forming part of the Seller 401(k) Plan to the trust forming part of the Buyer
401(k) Plan, which shall consist of cash and, to the extent permitted by the
plan, any promissory notes or other evidences of indebtedness with respect to
outstanding plan loans to the Transferring Employees who are participants in
such Seller 401(k) Plan. On the transfer date of such accounts and assets,

balances of the Transferring Employees and the details of any outstanding
plan loans from the Seller 401(k) Plan to such Transferring Employees.

Agreement to be treated as a "Divestiture of a Business Segment" for all
purposes under its 2005 Executive Incentive Compensation Plan as applied to

Employees, so that any outstanding unvested stock options or restricted stock
units granted to such Transferring Employees will become fully vested and
(with respect to stock options) exercisable in accordance with their terms on
the Closing Date.

 

(i) Seller Parent shall pay to any Business Employee owed a bonus, incentive,
payment, or other benefit or acceleration pursuant to a Sale Bonus Agreement

Buyer with a list of the Transferring Employees and the amount of each
Transferring Employees unused vacation benefits included in the Current
Liabilities set forth in the Preliminary Statement.

 



\- 49 -  7.4 _UK Employees_.

transfer of the Business and Assets located in England shall constitute a

agreement. The terminating partys rights to pursue all legal remedies due to

(the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") under this _Article 12_ , then the Indemnified
Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party thereof in writing;

of Laws or any violation of the rights of any Person; and (C) the sole relief
provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party,
which such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

 

(iii) In the event that the Indemnifying Party timely defends, contests or
otherwise protects the Indemnified Party against a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall nevertheless have the right to, but shall not be
obligated to, participate at its own expense in the defense of the Third Party
Claim with counsel of its own choosing; provided that if the Indemnified
Party reasonably concludes that counsel to the Indemnifying Party has a
conflict of interest, the Indemnifying Party will be responsible for the fees
and expenses of the Indemnified Partys counsel (but not more than one law
firm per jurisdiction).

or otherwise protect against any Third Party Claim in a timely matter, the
Indemnified Party may, but shall not be obligated to, defend, contest or
otherwise protect against the same, and make any compromise or settlement
thereof and shall be entitled to recover the entire cost thereof from the
Indemnifying Party, including reasonable attorneys fees, disbursements and
all amounts paid as a result of such Claim or suit or the compromise or
settlement thereof; _provided, however,_ that if the Indemnifying Party
subsequently undertakes the defense of such matter, the Indemnified Party
shall not be entitled to recover from the Indemnifying Party its costs
thereafter incurred in the defense thereof other than the reasonable cost
of investigation undertaken by the Indemnified Party and reasonable cost of
providing assistance.

(v) Regardless of whether the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of a
Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall
cooperate in the defense of such Claim. Such cooperation shall include the
provision and access to the defending party of documents, information, books
and records reasonably requested by the defending party and material to such
Claim; and making available employees as may be reasonably requested by the
defending party and as shall be reasonably required in connection with the
defense of such Claim and Proceeding resulting therefrom.

(b) _Other Claims_. In the event that the Buyer or Seller Parent should have
a Claim for indemnification under this _Article 12_ against the other party
that does not involve a Third Party Claim, the party seeking indemnification
shall promptly deliver to the party from whom indemnification is sought
written notice of such Claim detailing the basis for such Claim.

(c) _Defense of the Neology Lawsuits_. Notwithstanding the procedures set
forth in _Section 12.4_, in the event that the Neology Lawsuits are not fully
and finally resolved by the Sellers prior to the Closing Date (subject to the
covenant of  _Section 5.1(k)_), the Buyer shall defend, control and/or
settle the Neology Lawsuits; provided, however, that the Buyer will not enter
into any settlement with respect to either of the Neology Lawsuits without the
prior written consent of the Seller Parent, which such consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Sellers shall cooperate in and provide
reasonable assistance to the Buyer in so conducting such defense. The Buyer
shall have the right to make Claims against the Escrowed Proceeds for any and
all Buyer Losses as they are incurred arising from the Neology Lawsuits to be
paid in accordance with the Escrow Agreement.

12.5 _Mitigation of Losses; Adjustment to Purchase Price; No Consequential
Damages_.

(a) The amount of any Buyers Loss subject to indemnification hereunder or of
any Claim therefor shall be calculated net of (i) any accruals or reserves on
the Final Closing Date Statement that specifically relate to the matter(s)
for which indemnification is claimed, (ii) any amounts actually recovered by
the Buyer, any FS Tech Entities or any of their Affiliates pursuant to any
indemnification by or indemnification agreement with any non-affiliated third
party (net of all direct collection expenses), and (iii) any insurance
proceeds or other cash receipts or sources of reimbursement received as an
offset against such Buyers Loss (net of all direct collection expenses and
premium increases) actually received by the Buyer or any FS Tech Entity or any
of their Affiliates on account of such loss.

(b) No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to double recovery (or recovery
more than once) for the amount of any losses indemnified by the Indemnifying
Party under this _Article 12_  (" _Losses_ ") suffered by such party to the
extent such party has otherwise been compensated for such Losses (even if such
Losses may have resulted from the breach or inaccuracy of more than one of the
representations and warranties or covenants herein). For the avoidance of
doubt, no Buyer Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover for any breach
by Seller Parent of any of the representations or warranties contained in
_Article 3_ that are also Claims of Neology (or any Affiliate or successor
thereof) in the Neology Lawsuits.

 



\- 63 -  (c) Each Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall take reasonable
steps to mitigate all Losses, costs, expenses and damages.

(d) All indemnification payments made hereunder shall be treated by
the parties hereto as adjustments to the Purchase Price.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, no
party hereto (or its Affiliates or any director, officer, employee or agent of
such party or Affiliate) shall, in any event, be liable to any other party (or
its Affiliates or any director, officer, employee or agent of such party
or Affiliate) for any indirect or consequential damages (except those
incurred with respect to Third Party Claims), including, but not limited to,
loss of revenue or income, cost of capital, or loss of business reputation or
opportunity relating to the breach or alleged breach of this Agreement.

12.6 _Payment of Buyer s Loss_. Except with respect to Buyers Losses under
_Section 12.2(a)(i)(F)_ and any related Claims made under Section 12.2(a)(ii)
and subject to the applicable limitations set forth in this _Article 12_ , all
liabilities of Seller Parent under this _Article 12_ : (i) shall first be
paid or reimbursed out of the Escrowed Proceeds in accordance with the terms
of the Escrow Agreement and (ii) after exhaustion of the Escrowed Proceeds or
upon the release of the Escrowed Proceeds in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement, any Claim for indemnification by the Buyer Indemnified
Parties shall be satisfied by Seller Parent. With respect to Buyers Losses
under _Section 12.2(a)(i)(F)_ and any related Claims made under Section
12.2(a)(ii), all liabilities of Seller Parent shall be paid solely and
exclusively out of the Escrowed Proceeds in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement.

12.7 _Exclusive Remedy_. The Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing
indemnification provisions in this _Article 12_ shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Buyer for money damages (but not for injunctive or
other non-monetary equitable relief) of any Buyer Indemnified Party with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except with
respect to fraud or intentional misrepresentation, as to which the parties
shall have, in addition to the indemnification provisions of this _Article 12_
, all of their rights and remedies at Law.

null and void.

this Agreement, and (d) waive or modify performance of any of the obligations

subsequent insistence upon such strict compliance other than with respect to
the matter so waived or modified.

 

13.7 _Press Releases and Public Announcements_. Except as required by
applicable Law, including the U.S. federal securities Laws or listing
agreement with any securities exchange, no party to this Agreement shall, nor
permit its Affiliates to, make any public announcement or press release with
respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby;
_provided, however_ , that such a public announcement or press release may be
issued at such time and in such manner as Buyer Parent and Seller Parent shall
mutually agree and determine.

 

13.8 _Headings_. The headings in the sections and subsections of this
Agreement and in the Schedules are inserted for convenience only and in no
way alter, amend, modify, limit or restrict the meaning or interpretation of
contractual obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

13.9 _Supplemental Information; List of Schedules and Exhibits_.

(a) Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing, Seller Parent shall
give prompt notice to Buyer Parent upon becoming aware of any and all facts,
conditions, occurrences, changes, and other matters in each case occurring
after the date hereof that will cause the representations and warranties of
Seller Parent contained herein (including the Schedules) not to be true and
correct in all material respects on and as of the Closing Date with the same
effect as though made on and as of the Closing Date. Such notice shall
specifically refer to this _Section 13.9_, shall be true, complete and
correct and in reasonable detail, and shall specifically identify each
representation or warranty so affected and the specific manner in which it
is so affected. Any such notice or additional disclosure related thereto
shall have no effect on the determination of the satisfaction of any
conditions to the obligation of the other parties to consummate the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement set forth in _Article 8_ ("Buyers

 



\- 66 -   Conditions to Closing") or on the determination of the presence of a breach
of any representation or warranty in this Agreement or the Buyers right to
indemnification under this Agreement. Seller Parent shall promptly provide
the Buyer with such additional information in its possession as the Buyer may
reasonably request relating to any such notice provided in accordance with the

other than those expressly set forth herein or in a Schedule delivered
pursuant hereto, except as modified in writing concurrently herewith or

resolved in the manner provided in this _Section 13.18_. Should there

\- 69 -   request that such Dispute be referred to the Vice President and General
Manager of the Traffic Safety Systems Division, 3M Company and the General
Counsel of the Seller Parent, or to such other person as the General Counsel
shall so designate (the _"_ _Principals __"_ ), who shall negotiate in good
faith to attempt to resolve the Dispute. No settlement reached under this
_Section 13.18(a)_ shall be binding on the parties until reduced to a
writing signed on behalf of the parties by the Principals.

(b) Should the procedure outlined in _Section 13.18(a)_ fail to bring about
a resolution of each outstanding Dispute within 30 days following the giving
of the notice referred to therein, then either party may initiate a voluntary,

12.2(a)(i)(E)_, the Buyer and the Sellers hereby waive compliance by the Buyer
and the Sellers with the bulk sales Law and any other similar Laws in any
applicable jurisdiction in respect of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

terminated pursuant to _Article 11_ hereof, it shall become null and void and
have no further force and effect, except as provided in _Section 11.5_ and
_Article 13_ which shall survive termination and except that nothing herein
shall relieve any party hereto for a breach by such party of the terms of this
Agreement. Upon any termination of this Agreement, each party hereto will
return or destroy all documents, work papers and all other material of the
other party relating to the transactions contemplated hereby and all copies of
