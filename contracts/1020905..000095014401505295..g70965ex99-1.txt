From the Effective Date through the Closing Date, Sellers and Purchaser shall
jointly manage and direct the conduct of the Purchased Entities\' respective
businesses (other than with respect to Louisville Joint Venture, which shall
be subject to SECTION 2.7 hereof) ("JOINT MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL") and,
subject to the satisfaction of the requirements outlined below, Sellers shall
cause the Purchased Entities to take such actions as are reasonably requested
by a Representative (as defined below) in respect of the business of the
Purchased Entities. In furtherance of the foregoing, Sellers and Purchaser
shall each designate and identify to the other a representative (each, a
"REPRESENTATIVE") who shall have sole authority on behalf of his principal
to exercise the Joint Management and Control. Either party shall have the
right to appoint a successor Representative and an alternate who may serve as
an acting Representative upon the non-availability of such Representative. In
the conduct of Joint Management and Control, a Representative shall be free
to suggest that Sellers cause a Purchased Entity to take (1) a Major Decision
(as defined below) or (2) an Ordinary Course Decision (as defined below). A
request by a Representative that a Purchased Entity take actions to implement
a Major Decision or an Ordinary Course Decision shall be hereinafter referred
to as a "REQUESTED ACTION." Sellers shall have no obligation to cause the
Purchased Entities to take a Requested Action unless the other Representative
shall have consented to such Requested Action. If both Representatives
concur, then Sellers shall cause the Purchased Entities to take the Requested
Action as soon as reasonably practical under the circumstances. If both
Representatives cannot agree upon the Requested Action, then Sellers and
Purchaser shall undertake the deadlock settlement procedures set forth in
Section 6.2(d) below. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "ORDINARY
COURSE DECISION" shall mean all operating, management and business decisions
and actions of a Purchased Entity other than decisions defined as a Major
Decision. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "MAJOR DECISION" shall
mean any of the following actions:   (i) a sale, transfer or conveyance of
any material Assets of the Purchased Entities;   (ii) entering into or
making any material amendment to any Contract;   (iii) amending any
Employee Plan to materially increase benefits, or creating any new Employee

(vi) taking any action which would result in any of Sellers\' representations
and warranties herein not being true and correct; and   (vii) determining
Hockey Club Ltd.\'s player budget and making decisions with respect to Hockey
Club Ltd.\'s roster of players, whether or not such determination and
decisions increase Hockey Club Ltd.\'s overall player obligations.   (b)
NOTICE. Each of the parties shall promptly notify the other, in writing, of
the occurrence or existence of any event or circumstance of which Purchaser,
any Seller or any Purchased Entity, as the case may be, is aware and which
would (i) violate this SECTION 6.2, or (ii) make the satisfaction of any
condition in SECTION 8.1 impossible or unlikely.   (c) REPRESENTATIVES\'
CONSENT. Any Representative desiring that a Purchased Entity take a Requested
Action shall provide written notice to the other Representative of such
request and the Representatives shall confer at the earliest practical
opportunity to discuss such request. On the other hand, a Representative
whose consent is needed to a Requested Action shall be deemed to have given
his consent, if such Representative shall not have responded to any request
for consent made pursuant to this SECTION 6.2 within three (3) business days
after receipt by such Representative of such request in the case of
an Ordinary Course Decision or within five (5) business days after receipt by
such Representative of such request in the case of a Major Decision.   (d)
AGREED STANDARDS FOR CONSENT. A Representative shall not unreasonably
withhold or delay his consent to any Requested Action that is an Ordinary
Course Decision. However, no Representative shall be required to consent to
any Major Decision if in such Representative\'s reasonable business judgment
the Requested Action will not be in the best interests of the
Purchased Entity affected by such action or its shareholders, officers,
directors or employees.   (e) DEADLOCK SETTLEMENT PROCEDURES. If in the
conduct of the Joint Management and Control, the Representatives are unable
to jointly agree upon a Requested Action and despite their good faith efforts
the Representatives are unable to resolve their deadlock concerning a
Requested Action then Sellers and Purchaser agree that the sole remedy for
either party shall be to request that the Commissioner of the NHL resolve the
deadlock and determine on behalf of the parties whether the Requested Action
be taken or not. Any request for a determination of the Commissioner of the
NHL shall be in writing and in a form jointly signed by each of the
Representatives. In connection with a decision rendered by the Commissioner
of the NHL, each of Sellers and Purchaser agree that the decision of the
Commissioner of the NHL shall be final and binding upon them with respect to
the Requested Action.   (f) PROHIBITED ACTIONS. Notwithstanding the
agreement to have Joint Management and Control of the Purchased Entities,
neither party shall have the right to request or seek to cause any of the
Purchased Entities to take any of the following actions:   (i) incurring

business pursuant to Contracts now in effect or entered into in accordance

Purchased Entity, or extending the term of any employment or amending the

action that will result in or cause a violation or breach of any Contract or
Applicable Law to which any Seller or Purchased Entity shall be subject or
bound.   (g) ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF FAIR DISCLOSURE OBLIGATIONS.

Management and Control it may learn or become aware of confidential
information that will be subject to the disclosure limitations contained in

LIABILITIES. Any expenses and liabilities which the Purchased Entities incur

responsibility and obligation of such party.   6.3 PRESERVATION OF BUSINESS

the case may be, would adversely affect the applicability, prior to the
Closing Date, of any of the Insurance Policies.   6.5 CURRENT INFORMATION.

notice of any Tax matter with respect to a Purchased Entity that could affect
Purchaser, the party receiving such written notice shall notify in writing
the potentially affected party within five Business Days after receipt of
such notice. The failure of any party to give the notice required by this
SECTION 7.7(F) shall not impair that party\'s rights under this Agreement
except to the extent that the other party demonstrates that it has been
damaged or prejudiced thereby.   (g) COOPERATION. After the Closing, Sellers
and Purchaser shall, each at its own expense, cooperate with each other and
with each other\'s agents, including accounting firms and legal counsel, in
connection with the preparation or audit of any Return, refund claim or Tax
controversy matter with respect to any Purchased Entity or its activities.
Such cooperation shall include making available any information, records and
documents in their possession or under their control related to any Purchased
Entity that is relevant to the preparation or audit of any Return, refund
claim or Tax controversy matter with respect to any Purchased Entity or its
activities. Any information provided or obtained under this paragraph shall
be kept confidential, except as may otherwise be necessary in connection with
the filing of a Return, refund claims, tax audits, tax claims or tax
litigation or as required by law.   (h) RECORD RETENTION. Sellers and
Purchaser shall retain and provide to each other upon reasonable request any
records or other information (including accounting work papers) that is in
their possession or readily obtainable and may be relevant to any Return,
audit or examination, proceeding, or determination that affects any amount
required to be shown on any Return of a Purchased Entity for any period.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Sellers and Purchaser shall
retain, until the applicable statutes of limitations (including any
extensions) have expired, copies of all Returns, supporting work papers, and
other records or information that may be relevant to such Returns of a
Purchased Entity and shall not destroy or otherwise dispose of any such
records without first providing the other party with a reasonable opportunity
to review and copy the same.   (i) TREATMENT OF PURCHASE. For federal income
tax purposes, the parties agree that Purchaser shall treat the purchase of
the Equity Interests as the purchase of the Assets of the Purchased Entities
in accordance with Revenue Ruling 99-6 and other applicable authority,
provided, however, that the Partnership Entities and Ice Ventures LLC remain
in existence for non-income tax purposes.   (j) ALLOCATION OF PURCHASE
PRICE. Within 75 days after the Closing Date, Purchaser will deliver to
Sellers proposed SCHEDULE 7.7(J) (the "ALLOCATION SCHEDULE"), which shall set
forth an allocation of the total amount of the consideration paid by
Purchaser to Sellers in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The allocation shall take into account an
appraisal prepared by a nationally recognized appraiser chosen by Purchaser.
The costs and expenses of the appraisal shall be the responsibility of
Purchaser. Sellers shall reasonably cooperate in providing information and
assistance to any such appraiser. Within ten (10) Business Days after
delivery of the Allocation Schedule by Purchaser to Sellers, Sellers
will notify Purchaser in writing whether Sellers approve or disapprove the
Allocation Schedule; provided, however, that Sellers will not disapprove the
Allocation Schedule unless Sellers determine in their reasonable judgment
that either the appraisal is not reasonably supportable or the allocation
proposed by Purchaser on the Allocation Schedule is not reasonably consistent
with the appraisal. Unless Sellers disapprove the Allocation Schedule
pursuant to the immediately     47  52  preceding sentence, the
Allocation Schedule will be attached to and incorporated as part of this
Agreement within 90 days after the Closing Date, and all parties to this
Agreement shall prepare and file all applicable Returns in a
manner consistent with the allocation set forth on the Allocation
Schedule.   7.8 NOTICE. Purchaser shall promptly notify Sellers, in writing,
of the occurrence or existence of any event or circumstance of which
Purchaser is aware and which would make the satisfaction of any condition in
SECTION 8.2 impossible or unlikely.   7.9 401(K) PLAN. As soon as
reasonably possible after the Closing, Boca will prepare at its expense a
401(k) plan (the "NEW 401(K) PLAN") that has substantially similar provisions
to the Boca Resorts, Inc. 401(k) Plan and will transfer by spinoff to the New
401(k) Plan the account balances under the Boca Resorts, Inc. 401(k) Plan for
all employees of Hockey Club Inc. and Ice Ventures LLC who have, or are
entitled to, account balances under such plan as of the Closing Date (the
"TRANSFERRED PARTICIPANTS") and who continue employment with the Purchased
Entities after the Closing Date. Purchaser agrees to become the plan sponsor
for the New 401(k) Plan as soon as Purchaser has had the opportunity to
review and approve such plan after the Closing. Boca hereby agrees for a
period of six (6) years after the Closing to indemnify and hold Purchaser and
the Purchased Entities harmless from any and all Losses which Purchaser is
required to pay as a direct result of serving as the plan sponsor for the New
401(k) Plan provided such Losses are a result of the operation
or administration of the Boca Resorts, Inc. 401(k) Plan for all periods prior
to the Closing and for periods prior to the date that the New 401(k) Plan
is assumed by Purchaser. This indemnity will not be subject to the provisions
of SECTION 10.2(D).   7.10 RELEASE FROM SURETY BOND OBLIGATIONS. Purchaser
shall cooperate with Boca and use its reasonable commercial efforts to cause
Boca to receive an unconditional and absolute release, in form and substance
acceptable to Boca in its reasonable discretion, from any and all obligations
and liability under and in respect of: (i) that certain General Indemnity
Agreement by and among Arena Operating Ltd., Arena Development Ltd., Boca and
Great American Insurance Company and its Affiliates dated November 3, 2000
(the "INDEMNITY AGREEMENT"), (ii) that certain Surety Bond number 1350664
issued by Arena Operating Ltd. and Arena Development Ltd., as principal, and
Great American Insurance Company, as Surety, in the amount of $10,723,388,
dated November 3, 2000 (the "SURETY BOND") and (iii) that certain Turnpike
Sawgrass Arena Ramps/Right of Way Agreement dated August 12, 1997 by and
among the State of Florida, Broward County, Arena Operating Ltd. and Arena
Development Ltd. (the "TURNPIKE RAMP AGREEMENT"). In the event that such a
release is not received by Boca, then, on or before the date which is six (6)
months after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall post a letter of credit,
surety bond or similar instrument in an amount that is sufficient to (a)
secure the obligations secured by the Indemnity Agreement and Surety Bond or
(b) satisfy the requirements of the Turnpike Ramp Agreement. Purchaser shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless Boca from and against any and all Losses
it may incur from and after the Closing Date arising from the Indemnity
Agreement, the Surety Bond or the Turnpike Ramp Agreement, including, without
limitation, any fees and other reasonable costs and expenses Boca may incur
in connection with any extension of the Surety Bond beyond its
current expiration date which is necessitated by Purchaser\'s failure to
secure the contemplated release of Boca from its obligations under the Surety
Bond. Purchaser\'s obligations under this SECTION 7.10 shall be secured by a
grant of a security interest in the Assets of each of the Purchased Entities.
Purchaser covenants and agrees that it will not procure or cause to be issued
any additional bonds which would be secured by Boca\'s obligations under
the Indemnity Agreement. Purchaser further covenants and agrees that if and
to the extent required under the terms of the Turnpike Ramp Agreement, it
shall cause an appropriate assumption agreement to be executed and delivered
in a form reasonably required by the State of Florida, which assumption
agreement shall be subject to the provisions of SECTION 8.1(I) and 8.2(F) as
if it were a Required Governmental Approval.     48  53   ARTICLE

Purchased Entities as security under the Indenture, any guaranty by any of
the Purchased Entities, and any Lien upon the Purchased Entities, the Equity
Interests or the assets of the Purchased Entities and (ii) UCC-3 termination
statements evidencing the release of all Liens upon the Purchased Entities,

of Sellers in this Agreement is not true and correct in all material respects
or that there is a breach by any Seller with respect to     51  56  any

Purchaser with respect to any material covenant or obligation of Purchaser in
this Agreement and such breach is not cured by the earlier of 30 days after
the above-referenced breach or the Drop Dead Date.   9.4 FAILURE TO CLOSE.
This Agreement may be terminated by either Purchaser or Sellers if the
Closing shall not have been consummated by the Drop Dead Date; provided,
however, that neither Sellers nor Purchaser may terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this SECTION 9.4 if the Closing shall not have been consummated
within such time period by reason of the failure of such party or any of its
Affiliates to perform in all material respects any of its or their respective
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement. The parties also agree
that Purchaser shall be entitled, in addition to its right of
termination provided in SECTIONS 9.2 AND 9.4, to the remedy of specific
performance in the event that any Seller or Purchased Entity breaches this
Agreement prior to Closing   9.5 EFFECT OF TERMINATION. In the event of
termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Article IX, this Agreement
forthwith shall become void and of no further force or effect, and no party

by Purchaser or any Purchased Entity in connection with or resulting

Agent, pursuant to a mutually agreeable escrow agreement, the amount of
$500,000 which will be held in escrow until such time as the Ciccarelli
matter is finally adjudicated and the Losses relating thereto are finally

Losses shall be paid by Sellers from the escrowed funds and the balance of
the escrowed funds, if any, shall be paid to Sellers. If such Losses
are greater than $1,000,000, $500,000 shall be paid by Sellers from the

directly by Sellers.   (B) Regarding the Centex Rooney matter described on
SCHEDULE 10.2(A)(V), Sellers\' indemnification obligation shall be limited to
the sum of (1) 50% of the first $250,000 of Losses arising out of such matter
plus (2) 100% of all Losses in excess of $250,000 arising out of such matter.
Upon consummation of an Extraordinary Seller Transaction, if the Centex
Rooney matter has not yet been finally adjudicated, Sellers shall
deposit into escrow with the Escrow Agent, pursuant to a mutually agreeable
escrow agreement, the amount of $125,000 which will be held in escrow until

liabilities relating to the Ciccarelli and Centex Rooney matters for which
Purchaser is responsible pursuant to SECTION 10.2(A)(V).   (c) A party
entitled to indemnification hereunder shall herein be referred to as an
"INDEMNITEE." A party obligated to indemnify an Indemnitee hereunder shall
herein be referred to as an "INDEMNITOR." As soon as is reasonably
practicable, but in no event more than 30 days after an Indemnitee either (a)
receives notice of any claim or the commencement of any action by any third
party which such Indemnitee reasonably believes may give rise to a claim for
indemnification from an Indemnitor hereunder or (b) sustains any Loss
not involving a third-party claim or action which such Indemnitee
reasonably believes may give rise to a claim for indemnification from an
Indemnitor hereunder, such Indemnitee shall notify such Indemnitor in writing
of such claim, action or Loss, as the case may be. Any such notification must
be in writing, must state in reasonable detail the nature and basis of the
claim, action or Loss and a reference to this Agreement and Section. Such
notice must be accompanied by all available information and documentation
supporting and verifying the actual or anticipated claim, action or Loss that
may be subject to indemnification hereunder. In the event that any Indemnitee
fails to provide the notice contemplated by this SECTION 10.2 to an
Indemnitor in a timely fashion or fails to include all available information
and documentation with such notice, the Indemnitor shall be relieved of its
obligation to indemnify the Indemnitee to the extent, but only to the extent,
that the Indemnitor has been actually prejudiced by the Indemnitee\'s failure
to provide notice in the manner contemplated by this SECTION 10.2. Except as
provided in this SECTION 10.2, Indemnitor shall have the right, using counsel
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee, to contest, defend, litigate or
settle any such third-party claim which involves (and continues to involve)
solely monetary damages; PROVIDED that the Indemnitor shall have notified the
Indemnitee in writing of its intention to do so within thirty (30) days of
the Indemnitee having given notice of the third-party claim to the Indemnitor
and; PROVIDED, FURTHER, that (1) the third-party claim does not, in the
reasonable judgment of the Indemnitee, involve any actual or potential
criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation of any
officer or employee of the Indemnitee, AND     54  59  (2) the
Indemnitor shall diligently contest the third-party claim (the conditions set
forth in clauses (1) and (2) being collectively referred to as the
"LITIGATION CONDITIONS"). The Indemnitee shall have the right to
participate in, and to be represented by counsel (at its own cost and
expense) in any such contest, defense, litigation or settlement conducted by
the Indemnitor; PROVIDED, that the Indemnitee shall be entitled to treat as
Losses the cost and expenses therefor if (x) the Indemnitor shall lose its
right to contest, defend, litigate and settle the third-party claim or (y)
the Indemnitee shall be advised in writing by reputable legal counsel that it
may have defenses available to it which are inconsistent with or contrary to
the defenses available to the Indemnitor in connection with the third party
claim which advice is not unreasonably objected to by the Indemnitor. The
Indemnitor shall not be entitled, or shall lose its right, to contest,
defend, litigate and settle the third-party claim if the Indemnitee shall, in
the exercise of reasonable judgment and in good faith, give written notice to
the Indemnitor of any objection thereto based upon the Litigation Conditions
which is not disputed by the Indemnitor.   (i) The Indemnitor, if it shall
have assumed the defense of any third-party claim as provided in this
Agreement, shall not consent to a settlement of, or the entry of any judgment
arising from, any such third-party claim without the prior written consent of
the Indemnitee (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).
The Indemnitor shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnitee, enter into any compromise or settlement which commits the
Indemnitee to take, or to forbear to take, any action or which does not
provide for a complete release by such third party of the Indemnitee. The
Indemnitee shall have the sole and exclusive right to settle any third-party
claim, on such terms and conditions as are reasonably appropriate, to the
extent such third-party claim involves equitable or other non-monetary
relief. All costs and expenses (including without limitation attorneys\'
fees) incurred by the Indemnitor in connection with the foregoing shall be
paid by the Indemnitor.   (ii) If an Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification against a third-party claim, and the Indemnitor fails to
accept a tender of, or assume the defense of, a third-party claim pursuant to
this SECTION 10.2, the Indemnitor shall not be entitled, or shall lose its
right, to contest, defend, litigate and settle such a third-party claim, and
the Indemnitee shall have the right, without prejudice to its right of
indemnification hereunder, in its discretion exercised in good faith, to
contest, defend and litigate such third-party claim, and may settle such
third-party claim either before or after the initiation of litigation, at
such time and upon such terms as the Indemnitee deems fair and reasonable,
PROVIDED that at least thirty (30) days prior to any such settlement, written
notice of its intention to settle is given to the Indemnitor. If, pursuant to
this SECTION 10.2, the Indemnitee so contests, defends, litigates or settles
a third-party claim for which it is entitled to indemnification hereunder,
the Indemnitee shall be entitled to treat as Losses the cost for the
reasonable attorneys\' fees and other expenses of contesting, defending,
litigating and/or settling the third-party claim which are incurred from time
to time.   (d) Notwithstanding the provisions of this SECTION 10.2, (other
than SECTIONS 10.2(A)(IV) and (A)(V)) Sellers shall not be liable
to Purchaser for any Losses in respect of SECTION 10.2 unless (i) the
Losses therefrom resulting from any single inaccuracy of any representation
or warranty or breach of any covenant are equal to or in excess of $25,000,
and (ii) the Losses therefrom exceed $2,500,000, in the aggregate, (in which
case, Sellers shall only be responsible for Losses in excess of such
$2,500,000) and in no event shall Sellers be liable to Purchaser for Losses
in excess of $30,000,000.   10.3 INSURANCE. The amount due as
