any and all of the outstanding shares of the common stock, par value $0.001
per share, of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") for $38.50 per share
(such amount, or any other amount per share paid in such offer in accordance
with this Agreement, the " _Offer Price_ "), net to the seller in cash,
without interest (such offer, as may be extended and amended from time to time
as permitted under, or required by, this Agreement, the " _Offer_ ");

  


 

  

WHEREAS, following the consummation of the Offer, upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with Section
251(h) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_
"), Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "),
with the Company surviving the Merger, and pursuant to the Merger each share
of Company Common Stock that is not validly tendered and irrevocably accepted
for payment pursuant to the Offer (except as otherwise provided herein) will
be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price, net to the seller in
cash, without interest;

  


 

  

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company acknowledge and agree that the
Merger shall be effected under Section 251(h) of the DGCL and, subject to the
terms of this Agreement, effected as soon as practicable following the
consummation of the Offer;

  


 

  

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has (i) duly authorized and
approved the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this
Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the Transactions, and (ii)
declared this Agreement advisable and (iii) recommended that the Company's

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of Parent and Merger Sub has duly
authorized and approved the execution, delivery and performance by each of

WHEREAS, Parent, in its capacity as sole stockholder of Merger Sub, will adopt
this Agreement by written consent immediately following its execution;

 

  

  

  

 

1  

  

  

 

  

WHEREAS, Koninklijke Philips N.V., a corporation organized under the laws of

WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,

intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:

  


 

  

ARTICLE I

  


 

  

 _The Transactions_

  


 

  

SECTION 1.01. _The Offer._

  


 

  

(a) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement but in no
event more than ten Business Days after the date of this Agreement, Merger Sub
shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) commence (within the meaning of
Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer.

  


 

  

(b) In accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and subject
only to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent such waiver is permitted by
applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in Annex I (collectively, the "
_Offer Conditions_ "), Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub
to), at or as promptly as practicable following the Expiration Time,
irrevocably accept for payment (the time of acceptance for payment, the "
_Offer Acceptance Time_ ") and, at or as promptly as practicable following the
Offer Acceptance Time (but in any event within three Business Days (calculated
as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) thereafter) pay for
all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not properly withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer. Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger
Sub, at the Offer Acceptance Time and on a timely basis at all times
thereafter, the funds necessary to purchase any shares of Company Common Stock
that Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer.

  


 

  

(c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to
Purchase_ ") in accordance with the terms set forth in this Agreement and
subject only to the Minimum Condition and the other Offer Conditions. Merger
Sub expressly reserves the right to (i) increase the Offer Price, (ii) waive
any Offer Condition other than the Minimum Condition and (iii) make any other
changes to the terms and conditions of the Offer not inconsistent with the
terms of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that unless otherwise
expressly provided by this Agreement, without the prior written consent of the
Company, Merger Sub shall not, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub not to, (A)
decrease the Offer Price, (B) change the form of consideration payable in the
Offer,

  


 

  


 

  


 

  

 

2  

 

  

  

  

 

(C) decrease the maximum number of shares of Company Common Stock sought to be
purchased in the Offer, (D) impose any conditions to the Offer other than the
Offer Conditions, (E) amend, modify or supplement any of the Offer Conditions
in a manner that makes such Offer Condition more difficult to satisfy, (F)
amend, modify or waive the Minimum Condition, (G) except as otherwise required
or expressly permitted by Section 1.01(e), extend or otherwise change the
Expiration Time, (H) provide for any "subsequent offering period" within the
meaning of Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act or (I) otherwise amend, modify
or supplement any of the other material terms of the Offer in a manner that
makes the Offer Conditions more difficult to satisfy, except for actions
described in any of clauses (A) through (I) that are (1) expressly required by
this Agreement, (2) required by Law or (3) taken in response to written
comments or questions received from the SEC. The Offer may not be terminated
prior to its scheduled Expiration Time, unless this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with Article VII.

  


 

  

(d) The Offer shall expire at midnight (New York City time) (i.e., one minute
after 11:59 p.m., New York City time) on the date that is 20 Business Days
(calculated in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act)
following the commencement (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the
Exchange Act) of the Offer (such initial expiration date and time of the
Offer, the " _Initial Expiration Time_ ") or, if the Offer has been extended
pursuant to and in accordance with Section 1.01(e), the date and time to which
the Offer has been so extended (the Initial Expiration Time, or such later
expiration date and time to which the Offer has been so extended, the "
_Expiration Time_ ").

  


 

  

(e) Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, extend the Offer
from time to time as follows:

  


 

  

(i) If, at the then-scheduled Expiration Time, any of the Offer Conditions has
not been satisfied or waived by Parent and Merger Sub (to the extent such
waiver is permitted under this Agreement and applicable Law), then Merger Sub
shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, extend the Offer on one or more
occasions in consecutive increments of up to 10 Business Days each (each such
increment to end at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the last Business Day of
such increment) in order to permit the satisfaction of such Offer
Condition(s); and

  


 

  

(ii) Merger Sub shall extend the Offer for the minimum period required by
applicable Law, interpretation or position of the SEC or its staff or The
NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (" _NASDAQ_ ") or its staff;

  


 

  

 _provided_ , _however_ , that, in each case, in no event shall Merger Sub be
required to extend the Offer beyond the earliest to occur of (x) the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VII and (y) the End Date.

  


 

  

(f) The Offer Price shall be adjusted appropriately and proportionately to
reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend
(including any dividend or other distribution of securities convertible into
Company Common Stock),

 

  

  

  

 

3  

  

  

 

  

reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock occurring on
or after the date hereof and at or prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, and
such adjustment to the Offer Price shall provide to the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such action; _provided_ that nothing in this Section
1.01(f) shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action with
respect to its securities that is prohibited by this Agreement.

  


 

  

(g) In the event that this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Article
VII, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) as promptly as
practicable (and in any event within 24 hours of such termination) irrevocably
and unconditionally terminate the Offer, shall not acquire any shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and shall cause any depository
acting on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub to return, in accordance with
applicable Law, all tendered shares of Company Common Stock to the registered
holders thereof.

  


 

  

(h) As promptly as practicable on the date of commencement of the Offer
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act), Parent and Merger
Sub shall (i) file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with
respect to the Offer (together with all exhibits, amendments and supplements
thereto, the " _Schedule TO_") that will contain or incorporate by reference
the Offer to Purchase and form of the related letter of transmittal (the
Schedule TO, together with all documents included therein pursuant to which
the Offer will be made, the " _Offer Documents_ ") and (ii) cause the Offer
Documents to be disseminated to holders of shares of Company Common Stock.
Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent
that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect, and Parent shall use all reasonable efforts to promptly cause the
Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to promptly be
disseminated to holders of shares of Company Common Stock, in each case as and
to the extent required by applicable Law. The Company shall promptly furnish
or otherwise make available to Parent, Merger Sub or Parent's legal counsel
any information concerning the Company and the Company's Subsidiaries that is
required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Offer Documents. The
Company and its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the Offer Documents prior to the filing thereof with the SEC.
Parent and Merger Sub agree to provide the Company and its counsel with any
comments (including a summary of any oral comments) that Parent, Merger Sub or
their counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer
Documents promptly after receipt of such comments. Each of Parent and Merger
Sub shall give the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to
participate in the response to any comments of the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Offer Documents and shall respond promptly to any such
comments.

  


 

  

(i) Parent, Merger Sub and the Paying Agent with respect to the Offer shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the Offer Price payable pursuant to the
Offer such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to
the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the

 

  

  

  

 

4  

  

  

 

  

" _Code_ "), the U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, or any
provision of state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law. To the extent amounts are so
withheld and paid over to the appropriate Taxing Authority, the withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

  


 

  

SECTION 1.02. _Company Actions._

  


 

  

(a) As promptly as practicable on the day that the Offer is commenced, the
Company shall, concurrently with or following the filing of the Schedule TO,
file with the SEC and disseminate to holders of shares of Company Common Stock
a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9
(together with any exhibits, amendments or supplements thereto, the "
_Schedule 14D-9_ ") that, subject to Section 5.02, shall contain the Company
Board Recommendation. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall
promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9
if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect, and the Company shall use all reasonable
efforts to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to promptly be filed with
the SEC and to promptly be disseminated to holders of shares of Company Common
Stock, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable Law. Parent
and Merger Sub shall promptly furnish or otherwise make available to the
Company or its legal counsel any information concerning Parent, Merger Sub or
any Parent Related Parties that is required by the Exchange Act to be set
forth in the Schedule 14D-9. Unless the Board of Directors of the Company has
made an Adverse Recommendation Change, Parent and its counsel shall be given
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 and any
amendment thereto prior to the filing thereof with the SEC. Unless the Board
of Directors of the Company has made an Adverse Recommendation Change, the
Company shall provide Parent and its counsel with any comments (including a
summary of any oral comments) the Company or its counsel may receive from the
SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of
such comments. The Company shall give Parent and its counsel a reasonable
opportunity to participate in the response to any comments of the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9, except if the Board of Directors of
the Company has made an Adverse Recommendation Change or in connection
therewith, and the Company shall respond promptly to any such comments.

  


 

  

(b) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall (or shall cause its
transfer agent to) promptly furnish Parent with a list of its stockholders,
mailing labels and any available listing or computer file containing the names
and addresses of all record holders of shares of Company Common Stock and
lists of securities positions of shares of Company Common Stock held in stock
depositories as of the most recent practicable date, to the extent known by
the Company after making timely inquiries to the Company's transfer agent for
such lists (including lists of non-objecting beneficial owners), and shall
provide to Parent such additional information (including updated lists of

ARTICLE II

  


 

  

 _Effect of the Merger on the Capital Stock;_

  

 _Exchange of Certificates_

  


 

  

SECTION 2.01. _Effect on Capital Stock._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger
Sub or the holder of any shares of Company Common Stock or any shares of
capital stock of Parent or Merger Sub:

  


 

  

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub._ Each issued and outstanding share of
capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.001,
of the Surviving Corporation. 
 

 

  

  

 

7  

 

  

  

  

 

(b) _Cancelation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock; Treatment of Stock
Owned by Company Subsidiaries._ Each share of Company Common Stock that is
owned by the Company as treasury stock immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor. Each share of Company Common Stock then held
by Parent or Merger Sub that was accepted for payment by Merger Sub in the
Offer shall be canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

  


 

  

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock._ Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i)
Company Restricted Shares to be treated in accordance with Section 2.03, (ii)
Appraisal Shares to be treated in accordance with Section 2.01(d) and (iii)
shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled in accordance with Section
2.01(b)) shall be converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent
only the right to receive the Offer Price, net to the seller in cash, without
interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all such
shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such
shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") or non-certificated
shares of Company Common Stock held in book entry form (each, a " _Book Entry
Share_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest, to be paid in
consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate or Book Entry Share
in accordance with Section 2.02(b).

  


 

  

(d) _Appraisal Rights._ Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by holders who are
(i) entitled to demand and have properly demanded their rights to be paid the
fair value of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section
262 of the DGCL (the " _Appraisal Shares_ ") and (ii) have neither effectively
withdrawn nor lost (through failure to perfect or otherwise) their rights to
such appraisal and payment under the DGCL, shall not be canceled and converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section
2.01(c), and the holders of Appraisal Shares shall be entitled to only such
rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if any holder of Appraisal Shares (A) under the circumstances permitted
by and in accordance with the DGCL, affirmatively withdraws or loses (through
failure to perfect or otherwise) its right to appraisal of such Appraisal
Shares, (B) fails to establish its entitlement to appraisal rights as provided
in the DGCL or (C) takes or fails to take any action, the consequence of which
is that such holder is not entitled to payment for its shares under the DGCL,
then in each such case, such holder or holders (as the case may be) shall
forfeit the right to appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock and such
shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon cease to constitute Appraisal
Shares, and each such share of Company Common Stock shall, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, thereafter be deemed to have been
converted into and to have become, as of the Effective Time, the right to
receive, without interest thereon, the Merger Consideration. The Company shall
promptly notify Parent of any written demands received by the Company for
appraisal of any shares of Company Common

 

  

  

  

 

8  

  

  

 

  

Stock and attempted withdrawals of such demands, and Parent shall have the
right to participate in and direct negotiations and proceedings with respect
to such demands for appraisal. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
not, without the prior written consent of Parent or as otherwise required by
an Order, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any
such demands or waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for
appraisal in accordance with the DGCL.

  


 

  

SECTION 2.02. _Exchange of Shares._

  


 

  

(a) _Paying Agent._ Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall designate a bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the "
_Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration in accordance
with this Article II and, in connection therewith, shall prior to the Closing
Date enter into an agreement with the Paying Agent in a form reasonably
acceptable to the Company. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent an amount in cash
sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration (such cash being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). Pending its disbursement
to the holders of Company Common Stock, the Exchange Fund shall be invested by
the Paying Agent as directed by Parent in (i) short-term direct obligations of
the United States of America, (ii) short-term obligations for which the full
faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide for the
payment of principal and interest, (iii) short-term commercial paper rated the
highest quality by each of Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and Standard and
Poor's Ratings Services or (iv) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or banker's acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$10 billion. Parent shall promptly replace or cause to be replaced any funds
deposited with the Paying Agent lost through any investment made pursuant to
this Section 2.02(a). The Paying Agent shall be required to hold the Exchange
Fund for the benefit of holders of Company Common Stock, and to promptly make
the payments provided for in this Article II. The Exchange Fund shall not be
used for any purpose not expressly provided for in this Agreement. Nothing
contained in this Section 2.02(a) and no investment losses resulting from
investment of the funds deposited with the Paying Agent shall diminish the
rights of any holder of Company Common Stock to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided herein.

  


 

  

(b) _Payment Procedures._ As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (but in no event more than three business days thereafter),
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to
each person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of Company
Common Stock (other than the Company Common Stock to be canceled or converted
in accordance with Section 2.01(b)) (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates or Book Entry Shares, as applicable, shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and which shall be in such
form and shall have such other customary provisions (including customary
provisions regarding delivery of an "agent's message" with respect to Book
Entry Shares) as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree prior to the
Closing Date) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates or Book Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c).

 

  

  

  

 

9  

  

  

 

  

Upon surrender of a Certificate or a Book Entry Share for cancelation to the
Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with such letter's instructions (and such other
customary documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent), the
holder of such Certificate or Book Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common
Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or Book Entry Share, and the
Certificate or Book Entry Share so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. If
payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a person other than the
person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or Book Entry Share is
registered, it shall be a condition of payment that (x) the Certificate or
Book Entry Share so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise
be in proper form for transfer and (y) the person requesting such payment
shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment
of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of
such Certificate or Book Entry Share surrendered and shall have established to
the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax either
has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 2.02, each Certificate and Book Entry Share shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Article II, without interest.

  


 

  

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock._ The Merger
Consideration paid in respect of shares of Company Common Stock upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book Entry Shares in accordance with
the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock
previously represented by such Certificates or Book Entry Shares, and at the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and
after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates that represented
ownership of shares of Company Common Stock and Book Entry Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such shares, except as otherwise provided for herein or by
applicable Law. Subject to the last sentence of Section 2.02(d), if, at any
time after the Effective Time, Certificates and Book Entry Shares are
presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled
and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

  


 

  

(d) _Termination of the Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for 180 days
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any
holder of Certificates who has not theretofore complied with this Article II
shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for, and the Surviving
Corporation shall remain liable for, payment of its claim for Merger
Consideration (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar Laws).
Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders immediately prior to such time
at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent

 

  

  

  

 

10  

  

  

 

  

permitted by applicable Law, the property of the Surviving Corporation, free
and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

  


 

  

(e) _No Liability._ None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of
any portion of the Merger Consideration delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  


 

  

(f) _Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the
Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable
amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent
shall pay and deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of
Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate.

  


 

  

(g) _Withholding._ Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration or
Equity Award Consideration such amounts as are required to be deducted and
withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, the U.S.
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local
or non-U.S. Tax Law. To the extent amounts are so withheld and paid over to
the appropriate Taxing Authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.

(i) subject to Section 2.02(g), each Company Stock Option, whether vested or
unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall,
as of the Effective Time, be canceled and the holder thereof shall then become
entitled to receive solely, in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder
with respect thereto, a lump-sum cash payment, without interest, equal to the
product of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock for which such
Company Stock Option has not then been exercised and (B) the excess, if any,
of the Offer Price over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Stock Option, _provided_ that all Company Stock
Options with an exercise price per share greater than the Offer Price shall be
cancelled and the holder thereof shall not have any right to receive any
consideration in respect thereof;

  

  

  

 

11  

 

  

  

  

 

(ii) subject to Section 2.02(g), each Company Restricted Share outstanding

(iii) subject to Section 2.02(g), each Company RSU outstanding immediately

such Company PSU (provided that, any applicable performance conditions shall
be deemed to be achieved at 150% of the target performance level) and (ii) for
Company PSUs granted in 2017, the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company PSU (provided that, any applicable performance

trigger a tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code.

  

 

  

  

 

12  

  

  

  

 

(c) _Company ESPP._ Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all
actions necessary to terminate the Company ESPP. The Company shall determine
the rights of participants in the Company ESPP with respect to any offering
period then underway under the Company ESPP by treating a Business Day to be
determined by the Company that is prior to the Effective Time as the last day

(where such concept is recognized under applicable Law) in each jurisdiction
in which the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of
its properties and assets makes such qualification, licensing or good standing

accurate and complete copies of the Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation of the Company (the " _Company Certificate_ ") and the Amended
and Restated Bylaws of the Company (the " _Company Bylaws_ ").

own any capital stock, equity interest or other direct or indirect ownership
interest in any other person other than securities in a publicly traded
company held for investment by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and
consisting of less than 1% of the outstanding capital stock of such company.
As of the date hereof, all of the outstanding capital stock of, or other
equity or voting interests in, each Significant Subsidiary is directly or

the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other
equity or voting interests.

  


 

  

(c) Each Significant Subsidiary is duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing (where such concept is recognized under applicable Law) under
the Laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, except where the failure to
be so organized, existing and in good standing would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each Significant Subsidiary has
all requisite corporate power and authority to (i) own, lease or otherwise
hold its properties and assets in the manner in which they are currently
owned, used and held, (ii) conduct its business as it is now being conducted
and (iii) perform its obligations under all Contracts by which it is bound.

property owned (partially or fully) by the Company and any of its Subsidiaries

Owned Real Property, free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens,
in all material respects, (ii) there are no material outstanding options or
rights of first refusal to purchase the Owned Real Property, or any portion of
the Owned Real Property or interest therein, and no third party has any
material right to occupy or use any portion of the Owned Real Property and

lease or sublease with respect to the Leased Real Property (including all
amendments related thereto, the " _Leases_ "), and such Leases are in full

all of the real estate properties necessary to operate the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries in all material respects as it is currently

and assets in the manner in which they are currently owned, used and held, and
to conduct its business as it is now being conducted, except where the failure
to have such power and authority would not reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is duly licensed
or qualified to do business and is in good standing (where such concept is
recognized under applicable Law) in each jurisdiction in which the nature of
its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties and
assets makes such qualification, licensing or good standing necessary, except

reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent has
made available to the Company, prior to the date of this Agreement, accurate
and complete copies of Parent's and Merger Sub's certificates of incorporation
and by-laws or comparable governing documents, each as amended to the date

except for the adoption of this Agreement by Parent in its capacity as the
sole stockholder of Merger Sub (which adoption shall be effected by the
written consent of Parent immediately following the execution of this
Agreement), no other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Merger Sub
are necessary to authorize this Agreement or the consummation of the
Transactions. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Parent

each of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against each of them in accordance

Merger Sub do not, and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the
Transactions and compliance with Parent and Merger Sub with the provisions of
this Agreement do not and will not require any consent by any person under,

without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of
termination, modification, cancelation or acceleration of any obligation or to
the loss of any benefit under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon, any
of the properties or assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries under, (i)
the certificate of incorporation, by-laws or other comparable charter or

Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or any of their respective
properties, rights or other assets is subject or (iii) subject to receipt of
the governmental filings and other matters referred to in Section 4.02(d), any
Law or Order applicable to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective properties or assets, other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and
(iii), any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults, rights of
termination, modification, cancelation or acceleration, losses or Liens that
would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  


 

  

(d) No notice, report, consent, approval, permit, order or authorization of,
registration, declaration or other action by or in respect of, or filing with,
any Governmental Authority is required by or with respect to Parent or any of

vesting of such cash-based awards);

SECTION 5.02. _No Solicitation; Change in Recommendation._

  


 

  

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, and shall
cause its Representatives to, (i) immediately cease any solicitation,
encouragement, discussions or negotiations with any persons with respect to a
Takeover Proposal that existed prior to the date of this Agreement and (ii)
from the date hereof until the Effective Time, not, directly or indirectly,
(A) initiate, solicit or knowingly facilitate or encourage (including by way
of furnishing non-public information) the making of any Takeover Proposal, (B)
engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or furnish to any other person any non-public
information in connection with, in response to or for the purpose of
facilitating or encouraging, a Takeover Proposal, (C) enter into any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement or other similar agreement with respect to either a
Takeover Proposal or any proposal or offer that could reasonably be expected
to lead to a Takeover Proposal or (D) release any person from, waive any
provision of or fail to enforce any standstill agreement to which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, unless taking such action is reasonably
likely to lead to the receipt by the Company of a Superior Proposal. The
Company shall promptly deliver a written notice to each person that entered
into a confidentiality agreement in anticipation of potentially making a
Takeover Proposal to the effect that the Company is ending all discussions and
negotiations with such person with respect to any Takeover Proposal, effective
on the date hereof, and the notice shall also demand such person to promptly
return or destroy all confidential information concerning the Company and its
Subsidiaries.

  


 

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 5.02(a) or any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if at any time after the date
hereof and prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the Company or any of its
Representatives receives an unsolicitied bona fide written Takeover Proposal,
which Takeover Proposal did not result from any breach of this Section 5.02,
then (i) the Company and its Representatives may contact such person or group
of persons making the Takeover Proposal to request that such person or group
clarify the terms and conditions thereof in writing and (ii) if (A) the Board
of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with
its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Takeover Proposal
constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors'
fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (B) prior to or concurrently with
furnishing any information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations
with, the person or group of persons making such Takeover Proposal, the
Company provides written notice to Parent of the identity of such person or
group and of the Company's intention to furnish information to, or enter into
discussions with, such person or group, then the Company and its
Representatives may (x) enter into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
with such person or group and furnish pursuant (but only pursuant) thereto
information (including non-public information) with respect to the Company and
its Subsidiaries to such person or group and (y) engage in or otherwise
participate in discussions or negotiations with such person or group. In the
event that, pursuant to clause (x) of the foregoing sentence, the Company
furnishes to a person or group of persons making a Takeover Proposal any
material non-public

  


 

  


 

  

 

47  

  


 

  


 

  

information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries that has not previously
been furnished or made available to Parent or its Representatives, the Company
shall substantially contemporaneously make such information available to
Parent. As used in this Agreement, the term " _Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement_ " means any confidentiality agreement entered into by the Company
from and after the date hereof that contains provisions that are no less
favorable in the aggregate to the Company than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement, except that such confidentiality agreement need not
include a standstill provision.

  


 

  

(c) The Company shall within 36 hours notify Parent in the event that the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or its or their Representatives receives a
Takeover Proposal and shall, as promptly as practicable, (i) disclose to
Parent the material terms and conditions of any such Takeover Proposal and the
identity of the person or group of persons making such Takeover Proposal and
(ii) provide Parent a copy of all material written materials provided by any
person in connection with such Takeover Proposal. The Company shall keep
Parent reasonably and promptly informed of any material developments,
discussions or negotiations with respect to any such Takeover Proposal
(including any material changes thereto). The Company agrees that it and its
Subsidiaries will not, after the date of this Agreement, enter into any
confidentiality agreement with any person that prohibits the Company from
providing any information to Parent in accordance with this Section 5.02(c).

  


 

  

(d) Except as set forth in Section 5.02(e) and this Section 5.02(d), neither
the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A)
withhold, withdraw or qualify (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), or
publicly propose or announce any intention to withhold, withdraw or qualify
(or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), the Company Board Recommendation,
or fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in (or remove it from) the
Schedule 14D-9 or (B) approve or adopt, recommend the approval or adoption of
or declare advisable, or publicly propose or announce any intention to
recommend, approve, adopt or declare advisable, any Takeover Proposal (any
action described in this clause (i) being referred to as an " _Adverse
Recommendation Change_ "); _provided_ that the Board of Directors of the
Company may, and may cause the Company to, make a customary "stop, look and
listen" communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act without
such action being considered an Adverse Recommendation Change or (ii)
authorize, cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute
or enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement
related to any Takeover Proposal, other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement (each, a " _Company Acquisition Agreement_ "). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the Board of Directors of the
Company may (1) under circumstances not involving any Takeover Proposal, make
an Adverse Recommendation Change if a Change in Circumstance has occurred and
the Board of Directors of the Company has determined in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the
failure to make such Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with
the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law or (2) in response to an
unsolicited bona fide written Takeover Proposal, which Takeover Proposal was
made or renewed on or after

  


 

  


 

  

 

48  

  


 

  


 

  

the date of this Agreement and did not result from any breach of this Section
5.02, (x) make an Adverse Recommendation Change and/or (y) cause the Company
to enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement providing for such Takeover
Proposal and concurrently terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.01(d)(ii), in each case described in subclause (x) or subclause (y) of this
clause (2) if and only if the Board of Directors of the Company has determined
in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside
legal counsel, that such Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and
the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors'
fiduciary duties under applicable Law. The Board of Directors of the Company
shall not, and shall cause the Company not to, take any action set forth in
clause (1) of the second sentence of this Section 5.02(d) unless (A) the
Company has given Parent at least four Business Days' prior written notice of
its intention to take such action (which notice shall specify in reasonable
detail the Change in Circumstance and the reasons for the Adverse
Recommendation Change), (B) the Company has negotiated, and has caused its
Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent during such notice
period, to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, so that such Change in
Circumstance would no longer necessitate an Adverse Recommendation Change and
(C) following the end of such notice period, the Board of Directors of the
Company has determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure to make such Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to such Change in Circumstance would be
inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law. After
complying with the foregoing sentence with respect to an Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to a Change in Circumstance, the Company
shall have no further obligations under such sentence with respect to an
Adverse Recommendation Change in response to such Change in Circumstance, and
the Board of Directors of the Company shall not be required to comply with
such obligations with respect to any other Adverse Recommendation Change in
response to such Change in Circumstance. The Board of Directors of the Company
shall not, and shall cause the Company not to, take any action set forth in
clause (2) of the second sentence of this Section 5.02(d) unless (A) the
Company has given Parent at least five Business Days' prior written notice of
its intention to take such action (which notice shall specify the material
terms of any such Superior Proposal and the identity of the person or group of
persons making such Superior Proposal and copies of all material documents
relating to such Takeover Proposal), (B) the Company has negotiated, and has
caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent during such
notice period, to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable Parent to
propose in writing a binding offer to effect revisions to the terms of this
Agreement such that it would cause such Superior Proposal to no longer
constitute a Superior Proposal and (C) following the end of such notice
period, the Board of Directors of the Company has considered in good faith
such binding offer, and has determined that the Superior Proposal would
continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if the revisions proposed in such
binding offer were to be given effect and the failure to make such Adverse
Recommendation Change and/or enter into such Company Acquisition Agreement and
concurrently terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(d)(ii) would be
inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law. The
provisions of the previous sentence shall also apply to any material amendment
to any Takeover Proposal or any successive Takeover Proposal and the

  


 

  


 

  

 

49  

  


 

  


 

  

Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and comply
with the requirements of this Section 5.02(d) with respect to such new written
notice, except that references to the five Business Day period shall be deemed
to be references to a three Business Day period.

  


 

  

(e) Nothing in this Section 5.02 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit
the Company or the Board of Directors of the Company from (i) taking and
disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any
disclosure to the stockholders of the Company that is required by applicable
Law; _provided_ , _however_ that, in each case, if such disclosure has the
substantive effect of withholding, withdrawing, qualifying or modifying (in a
manner adverse to Parent) the Company Board Recommendation, such disclosure
shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change.

  


 

  

(f) As used in this Agreement, the term " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any
inquiry, proposal or offer from any person or group of persons (other than
Parent and its Subsidiaries) relating to (i) any direct or indirect
acquisition, license, lease, exchange or other disposition of assets, in a
single transaction or series of related transactions, of 20% or more of the
consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries (which assets may
include equity securities of the Company's Subsidiaries) or to which 20% or
more of the Company's revenues or earnings on a consolidated basis are
attributable, (ii) any issuance or direct or indirect acquisition, in a single
transaction or series of related transactions, of 20% or more of the voting
power of or of any class of equity securities of the Company, (iii) any tender
offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person or
group of persons beneficially owning 20% or more of the voting power of or of
any class of equity securities of the Company or (iv) any merger,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company pursuant
to which such person or group of persons (or the stockholders of any person)
would acquire, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of the consolidated assets
of the Company and its Subsidiaries or 20% or more of the aggregate voting
power of any class of equity securities of the Company or of the surviving
entity in a merger involving the Company or the resulting direct or indirect
parent of the Company or such surviving entity, in each case, other than the
Transactions.

  


 

  

(g) As used in this Agreement, the term " _Superior Proposal_ " means any
unsolicited bona fide written Takeover Proposal not resulting from a breach of
this Section 5.02 that the Board of Directors of the Company has determined in
its good faith judgment, after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, would be more favorable from a financial point of view
to the Company's stockholders than the Transactions, taking into account all
aspects of such Takeover Proposal, including legal, regulatory and financing
aspects and the timing and likelihood of closing; _provided_ that for purposes
of the definition of "Superior Proposal", the references to "20%" in the
definition of Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "50%".

  


 

  

(h) As used in this Agreement, the term " _Change in Circumstance_ " means a
material event, fact, circumstance, development or occurrence (other than any

  


 

  


 

  

 

50  

  


 

  


 

  

matter that relates to a Takeover Proposal) that is unknown to or by the Board
of Directors of the Company as of the date of this Agreement, which event,
fact, circumstance, development or occurrence becomes known to or by the Board
of Directors of the Company prior to the Offer Acceptance Time.

  


 

  

SECTION 5.03. _Reasonable Best Efforts; Approvals._

  


 

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties
hereto shall cooperate with the other parties and use (and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best efforts to
promptly (i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be
done, and assist and cooperate with the other parties hereto in doing, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to cause the conditions to Closing to be
satisfied as promptly as reasonably practicable and to consummate and make
effective, in the most expeditious manner reasonably practicable, the
Transactions, including preparing and filing promptly and fully all
documentation to effect all necessary filings, notices, petitions, statements,
registrations, submissions of information, applications and other documents,
(ii) obtain all approvals, consents, registrations, waivers, permits,
authorizations, orders and other confirmations from any Governmental Authority
or third party necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Transactions,
(iii) execute and deliver any additional instruments necessary to consummate
the Transactions and (iv) defend or contest in good faith any Action brought
by a third party that could otherwise prevent or impede, interfere with,
hinder or delay in any material respect the consummation of the Transactions,
in the case of each of clauses (i) through (iv), other than with respect to
filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of
information, applications and other documents, approvals, consents,
registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations relating to
Antitrust Laws, which are the subject of Sections 5.03(b), 5.03(c) and
5.03(d). In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Company
and Parent shall each use its reasonable best efforts to (A) take all action
necessary to ensure that no Takeover Law is or becomes applicable to any of
the Transactions and refrain from taking any actions that would cause the
applicability of such Laws and (B) if the restrictions of any Takeover Law
become applicable to any of the Transactions, take all action necessary to
ensure that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on
the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise lawfully minimize the
effect of such Takeover Law on the Transactions.

  


 

  

(b) Each of the parties hereto agrees to (i) make an appropriate filing of a
Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act and any other applicable
Antitrust Law with respect to the Transactions as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the date hereof (and in any event within 10 days
following the date hereof), (ii) supply as promptly as reasonably practicable
any additional information and documentary material that may be requested
pursuant to the HSR Act or any other applicable Antitrust Law and (iii) take
or cause to be taken all other actions necessary to cause the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and any other
applicable Antitrust Laws and to obtain all consents under any Antitrust Laws
that may be required by any Governmental Authority with competent
jurisdiction, so as to enable the parties hereto to consummate the
Transactions.

  


 

  


 

  

 

51  

  


 

  


 

  

(c) Nothing in this Agreement, including any provision of this Section 5.03,
shall require, or be construed to require, Parent or any of its Affiliates to
proffer to, or agree (i) to, sell, divest, lease, license, transfer, dispose
of or otherwise encumber, (ii) to hold separate and agree to sell, divest,
lease, license, transfer, dispose of or otherwise encumber before or after the
Offer Acceptance Time or the Effective Time, any assets, licenses, operations,
rights, product lines, businesses or interest therein of Parent, the Company
or any of their respective Affiliates (or to consent to any sale, divestiture,
lease, license, transfer, disposition or other encumbrance by the Company of
any of its assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines, businesses or
interest therein or to any agreement by the Company to take any of the
foregoing actions) or (iii) to agree to any material changes (including
through a licensing arrangement) or restriction on, or other impairment of
Parent's ability to own or operate, any such assets, licenses, operations,
rights, product lines, businesses or interests therein or Parent's ability to
vote, transfer, receive dividends or otherwise exercise full ownership rights
with respect to the capital stock of the Company or the Surviving Corporation,
except for proffers and agreements to amend or modify Contracts between the
Company and/or its Subsidiaries and third parties or sell, divest, lease,
license, transfer, dispose or otherwise encumber, or to agree to changes,
restrictions or other impairments with respect to, any of Parent's or the
Company's (or their respective Affiliates') assets, licenses, operations,
rights, product lines, businesses or interest therein, where such amended,
sold, divested, leased, licensed, transferred, disposed or encumbered
Contracts, assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines, businesses and
interests in the aggregate shall have accounted for $25 million or less of the
parties' and their respective Affiliates' gross revenues for the 12 months
ending December 31, 2016.

  


 

  

(d) Each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission with a Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions
and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry by or before a
Governmental Authority relating to the Transactions, including any proceeding
initiated by a private party, (ii) keep the other parties hereto informed in
all material respects and on a reasonably timely basis of any material
communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, the
Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") or any other Governmental Authority and
of any material communication received or given in connection with any
proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any of the Transactions,
(iii) subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, and
to the extent reasonably practicable, consult with the other parties hereto
with respect to information relating to the other parties hereto and their
respective Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that appears in any filing made
with, or written materials submitted to, any third person or any Governmental
Authority in connection with the Transactions, other than documents submitted
under Item 4(c) or 4(d) of the Notification and Report Form pursuant to the
HSR Act, and (iv) to the extent permitted by the FTC, the DOJ or such other
applicable Governmental Authority or other person, give the other parties
hereto the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and
conferences.

  


 

  


 

  

 

52  

  


 

  


 

  

SECTION 5.04. _Public Announcements._ Unless and until an Adverse
Recommendation Change has occurred, Parent and the Company shall consult with
each other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review and
comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to the
Transactions, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such
public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by
applicable Law, court process or the rules and regulations of any national
securities exchange or national securities quotation system and except for any
matters referred to in Section 5.02. The parties hereto agree that the initial
press release to be issued with respect to the Transactions following
execution of this Agreement shall be in the form heretofore agreed to by
Parent and the Company.

  


 

  

SECTION 5.05. _Access to Information; Confidentiality._ Except as set forth in
Section 5.05 of the Company Disclosure Letter, subject to applicable Law,
between the date of this Agreement and the earlier of the Effective Time and
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01, upon reasonable
notice, the Company shall afford to Parent and Parent's Representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours to the Company's officers,
employees, agents, properties, books, Contracts and records (other than any of
the foregoing that relate to the negotiation and execution of this Agreement,
or, subject to Section 5.02, to any Takeover Proposal or any other
transactions potentially competing with or alternative to the Transactions or
proposals from other parties relating to any competing or alternative
transactions) and the Company shall furnish promptly to Parent and Parent's
Representatives such information concerning its business, personnel, assets,
liabilities and properties as Parent may reasonably request. Parent and
Parent's Representatives (i) shall conduct any such activities in such a
manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the
Company and (ii) shall not be permitted to conduct any Phase II or other
intrusive sampling, testing or investigation (including of soil, water, air or
surfaces) at, on or under any real property of the Company or its
Subsidiaries. The Company shall not be obligated to provide such access or
information if the Company determines, in its reasonable judgment, that doing
so could violate applicable Law or a Contract or obligation of confidentiality
owing to a third party, waive the protection of an attorney-client privilege,
work product doctrine or other legal privilege or expose the Company to risk
of liability for disclosure of sensitive or personal information; _provided_ ,
that information shall be disclosed subject to execution of a joint defense
agreement in customary form to external counsel of Parent to the extent
reasonably required for the purpose of complying with applicable Antitrust
Laws. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event that the Company does not
provide access or information in reliance on the immediately preceding
sentence, it shall provide notice to Parent that it is withholding such access
or information and shall use its reasonable efforts to communicate, to the
extent feasible, the applicable information in a way that would not violate
the applicable Law, Contract or obligation or risk waiver of such privilege.
All requests for information made pursuant to this Section 5.05 shall be
directed to the General Counsel of the Company or other person designated by
the Company. For the avoidance of doubt, until the Effective Time, all
information provided by or on behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries
pursuant to this Section 5.05 or pursuant to Section 5.02 will be subject to

  


 

  


 

  

 

53  

  


 

  


 

  

the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall remain in full force
and effect in accordance with its terms.

  


 

  

SECTION 5.06. _Indemnification and Insurance._

  


 

  

(a) From and after the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the date
on which the Effective Time occurs, each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i)
indemnify and hold harmless each individual who at the Effective Time is, or
at any time prior to the Effective Time was, a director or officer of the
Company or of a Subsidiary of the Company (each, an " _Indemnitee_ ") with
respect to all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines,
penalties, costs (including amounts paid in settlement or compromise) and
expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) in connection with any
Action (whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative), whenever
asserted, based on or arising out of, in whole or in part, (A) the fact that
an Indemnitee was a director or officer of the Company or such Subsidiary or
(B) acts or omissions by an Indemnitee in the Indemnitee's capacity as a
director or officer of the Company or such Subsidiary or taken at the request
of the Company or such Subsidiary (including in connection with serving at the
request of the Company or such Subsidiary as a director, officer, employee,
agent, trustee or fiduciary of another person (including any employee benefit
plan)), in each case under clauses (A) or (B), at, or at any time prior to,
the Effective Time (including any Action relating in whole or in part to the
Transactions or relating to the enforcement of this provision or any other
indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnitee), to the fullest extent
the Company would have been permitted to do so under applicable Law, and (ii)
assume all obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Indemnitees
in respect of indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time as provided in the
Company Certificate and the Company Bylaws and the organizational documents of
such Subsidiaries as in effect on the date hereof or in any agreement in
existence as of the date hereof providing for indemnification between the
Company and any Indemnitee. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent, from and
after the Effective Time, shall cause, unless otherwise required by Law, the
certificate of incorporation and the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation to
contain provisions no less favorable to the Indemnitees with respect to
limitation of liabilities of directors and officers and indemnification than
are set forth as of the date hereof in the Company Certificate and the Company
Bylaws, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified
in a manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the
Indemnitees. In addition, from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, advance any expenses (including fees
and expenses of legal counsel) of any Indemnitee under this Section 5.06
(including in connection with enforcing the indemnity and other obligations
referred to in this Section 5.06) as incurred to the fullest extent the
Company would have been permitted to do so under applicable Law; _provided_
that the individual to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to
repay such advances if it shall be determined that such person is not entitled
to be indemnified pursuant to this Section 5.06(a).

  


 

  


 

  

 

54  

  


 

  


 

  

(b) None of Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment in any threatened or actual Action
relating to any acts or omissions covered under this Section 5.06 for which
indemnification has been sought by an Indemnitee hereunder, unless such
settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such
Indemnitee from all liability arising out of such Action or such Indemnitee
otherwise consents in writing to such settlement, compromise or consent. Each
of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnitees shall cooperate in
the defense of any Action and shall provide access to properties and
individuals as reasonably requested and furnish or cause to be furnished
records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery
proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in
connection therewith.

  


 

  

(c) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect the current policies of directors'
and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained
by the Company and its Subsidiaries covering acts or omissions occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time with respect to those current or former directors
or officers who are currently (and any additional directors or officers who
prior to the Effective Time become) covered by the Company's directors' and
officers' liability insurance policies; _provided_ that (i) if any Action
(whether arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is brought against an
Indemnitee on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the
provisions of this Section 5.06 shall continue in effect until the full and
final resolution of such Action and (ii) if the aggregate annual premium for
such insurance exceeds 300% of the current annual premium for such insurance,
then Parent shall provide or cause to be provided a policy for the applicable
individuals with the greatest coverage as is then available at a cost up to
but not exceeding 300% of such current aggregate annual premium. At the
Company's option, the Company may (or if requested by Parent, the Company
shall) purchase, prior to the Effective Time, a six-year prepaid "tail" policy
on terms and conditions providing at least substantially equivalent benefits
as the current policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries
with respect to matters arising on or prior to the Effective Time, covering
without limitation the Merger and the other Transactions; _provided_ that in
no event shall the aggregate annual premium for such insurance exceed 300% of
the current annual premium for such insurance. If such prepaid "tail" policy
has been obtained by the Company prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full
term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving
Corporation, and no other party shall have any further obligation to purchase
or pay for insurance pursuant to this Section 5.06(c).

  


 

  

(d) The provisions of this Section 5.06 are (i) intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or
her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such individual may
have under the Company Certificate or the Company Bylaws, by Contract or
otherwise. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this
Section 5.06 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee to whom this

  


 

  


 

  

 

55  

  


 

  


 

  

Section 5.06 applies unless (x) such termination or modification is required
by applicable Law or (y) the affected Indemnitee has consented in writing to
such termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that the
Indemnitees to whom this Section 5.06 applies shall be third-party
beneficiaries of this Section 5.06).

  


 

  

(e) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of parent or
the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations thereof set
forth in this Section 5.06.

  


 

  

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall,
release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and officers' insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this Section 5.06 is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

  


 

  

SECTION 5.07. _Rule 16b-3._ Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall be
permitted to take such steps as are necessary to cause dispositions of Company
equity securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the
Transactions by each individual who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange
Act to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

  


 

  

SECTION 5.08. _Employee Matters._

  


 

  

(a) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first
anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation (or in the case of a transfer of all or substantially
all the assets and business of the Surviving Corporation, its successors and
assigns) to provide, each individual who is employed by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a " _Company
Employee_ ") with (i) a base salary or wages (as applicable) that are no less
favorable than those in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii)
severance benefits that are no less favorable than those that would have been
provided to such Company Employee under the applicable severance benefit
plans, programs, policies, agreements and arrangements set forth in Section
5.08(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter and (iii) employee benefit plans and
arrangements (other than annual cash bonus and long-term incentive
opportunities and those referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) above) that are no
less favorable in the aggregate than those provided to the Company Employees
immediately prior to the Effective Time. In addition, (x) during the period
commencing at the Effective Time and ending on December 31, 2017, Parent shall
provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation (or in the case of a
transfer of all or substantially all the assets and business of the Surviving
Corporation, its successors and assigns) to provide each Company Employee with
target and maximum annual cash bonus opportunities that are no less favorable,
in each case, than those in effect

  


 

  


 

  

 

56  

  


 

  


 

  

immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) during the period beginning on
January 1, 2018 and ending on December 31, 2018, Parent shall provide, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation (or in the case of a transfer of all or
substantially all the assets and business of the Surviving Corporation, its
successors and assigns) to provide each Company Employee with a target annual
cash bonus opportunity that is no less favorable than that in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time and on other terms and conditions no
less favorable than provided to similarly situated employees of Parent.

  


 

  

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.08(a), Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor in accordance with their terms all
the Company Plans, as in effect at the Effective Time.

  


 

  

(c) With respect to all employee benefit plans of the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries, including any "employee benefit plan" (as defined in
Section 3(3) of ERISA) (including any vacation, paid time-off and severance
plans), for all purposes, including determining eligibility to participate,
level of benefits and vesting, each Company Employee's service with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as well as service with any predecessor
employer of the Company or any such Subsidiary, to the extent service with the
predecessor employer was recognized by the Company or such Subsidiary) shall
be treated as service with the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries (or in the case of a transfer of all or substantially all the
assets and business of the Surviving Corporation, its successors and assigns);
_provided_ , _however_ , that such service need not be recognized (i) for the
purposes of benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan or other
plan, (ii) for purposes of early retirement subsidies, (iii) to the extent
that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits for the same
period of service and (iv) to the extent that such service was not recognized
under any similar Company Plan.

  


 

  

(d) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.08(a), Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, use commercially reasonable efforts to
waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing condition limitations,
exclusions, actively‑at‑work requirements and waiting periods under any
welfare benefit plan maintained by the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries in which Company Employees (and their eligible dependents) will
be eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time, except to the
extent that such pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-
work requirements and waiting periods would not have been satisfied or waived
under the comparable Company Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to recognize the dollar amount of all co-payments,
deductibles and similar expenses incurred by each Company Employee (and his or
her eligible dependents) during the calendar year in which the Effective Time
occurs for purposes of satisfying such year's deductible and co-payment
limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which they will be
eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time.

  


 

  

(e) Immediately prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall pay, to each
Company Employee who is a participant in an annual incentive plan or
arrangement

  


 

  


 

  

 

57  

  


 

  


 

  

maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries (each such plan or arrangement
as set forth on Section 5.08(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter, a " _Company
Bonus Plan_ "), a lump-sum cash payment in respect of the annual bonus payable
with respect to the Company's 2017 fiscal year (the " _Closing Fiscal Year_ ")
under the applicable Company Bonus Plan equal to the product of (i) the
applicable Company Employee's annual bonus amount (as described in the next
sentence) under the applicable Company Bonus Plan and (ii) a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days in the Closing Fiscal Year that
elapse prior to the Closing Date, and the denominator of which is 365. Upon
notice to and in consultation with Parent, the Company may determine in good
faith the annual bonus amount with respect to each Company Employee by basing
such annual bonus amount upon the applicable Company Employee's target bonus
for the Closing Fiscal Year under the applicable Company Bonus Plan and the
extent to which the Company determines that applicable performance goals would
have been achieved for the Closing Fiscal Year, by extrapolating the level of
actual performance during the portion of the Closing Fiscal Year that occurs
prior to the Closing Date through the end of the Closing Fiscal Year.

  


 

  

(f) With respect to any Company Employees based outside of the United States,
including those Company Employees based in Puerto Rico, Parent's obligations
under this Section 5.08 shall be modified to the extent necessary to comply
with applicable Laws of the foreign countries and political subdivisions
thereof in which such Company Employees are based.

  


 

  

(g) Parent hereby acknowledges that the consummation of the Transactions
constitutes a "change in control" or "change of control" (or a term of similar
import) for purposes of any Company Plan that contains a definition of "change
in control" or "change of control" (or a term of similar import), as
applicable.

  


 

  

(h) Prior to the Effective Time, if requested by Parent in writing, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms of the applicable plan or
arrangement, the Company, the Board of Directors of the Company or the
Compensation Committee, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions necessary
to cause the Spectranetics Salary Savings Plan (the " _Company 401(k) Plan_ ")
to be terminated effective immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to
the occurrence of Closing (and with all participant and employer contributions
attributable to payroll periods prior to the termination made as of such
time), and the Company shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on a copy of such resolution not later than three days preceding
the Effective Time. Without limiting the generality of Section 5.08(a) or the
scope of Parent's obligations thereunder, effective as of the Closing Date,
Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, have in effect a defined
contribution plan that includes a qualified cash or deferred arrangement
within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code (" _Parent 's 401(k) Plan_")
and Parent and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate in good faith for the purpose of providing benefits under Parent's
401(k) Plan as soon as administratively practicable following the Closing Date
to the Company Employees participating in the Company 401(k) Plan as of the
Closing Date. If the Parent requests that the Company 401(k) Plan be
terminated pursuant to this Section 5.08(i), then Parent shall permit each
Company Employee participating in the Company

  


 

  


 

  

 

58  

  


 

  


 

  

401(k) Plan to effect, and Parent agrees to cause Parent's 401(k) Plan to
accept, in accordance with applicable Law, a "direct rollover" (within the
meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) of his or her account balances
(including earnings thereon through the date of transfer and promissory notes
evidencing all outstanding loans) under the Company 401(k) Plan if such
rollover to Parent's 401(k) Plan is elected in accordance with applicable Law
by such Company Employee, subject to (i) the Company's reasonable satisfaction
that the Parent's 401(k) Plan, as applicable, is in compliance with all
applicable Laws and that such plan continues to satisfy the requirements for a
qualified plan under Section 401(a) of the Code and that the trust that forms
a part of such plan is exempt from tax under Section 501(a) of the Code and
(ii) Parent's reasonable satisfaction that the Company 401(k) Plan, as
applicable, is in compliance with all applicable Laws and that such plan
continues to satisfy the requirements for a qualified plan under Section
401(a) of the Code and that the trust that forms a part of such plan is exempt
from tax under Section 501(a) of the Code.

  


 

  

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement (but in
no event later than twenty one days following the date of this Agreement), the
Company shall provide to Parent (i) a revised version of Section 3.10(a) of
the Company Disclosure Letter that contains an accurate and complete list of
each material Foreign Company Plan, (ii) a copy of each material Foreign
Company Plan and all amendments thereto, (iii) as applicable for each such
Foreign Company Plan, documents that are substantially comparable (taking into
account differences in applicable Law and practices) to the documents required
to be provided in clauses (i) through (vi) of Section 3.10(a) and (iv) the
most recent annual and periodic accounting of claims for each Company Plan
that is a self-insured plan governed by ERISA.

  


 

  

(j) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the
provisions of this Section 5.08 are solely for the benefit of the parties to
this Agreement, and no provision of this Section 5.08 is intended to, or
shall, (i) constitute the establishment or adoption of or an amendment to any
employee benefit plan for purposes of ERISA or otherwise, (ii) prevent the
Company, Parent and the Surviving Corporation from amending or terminating any
of its benefit plans (including any Company Plan in accordance with its
terms), (iii) prevent Parent, after the Effective Time, from terminating the
employment of any employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries who continue to
be actively employed by the Surviving Corporation or (iv) create any third-
party beneficiary rights in no current or former employee, any other
individual associated therewith or any collective bargaining representative
thereof.

  


 

  

SECTION 5.09. _Notification of Certain Matters; Stockholder Litigation._

  


 

  

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall give prompt notice to
Parent (and will subsequently keep Parent informed on a current basis of any
developments related to such notice) of (i) any notice or other communication
received by the Company from any Governmental Authority in connection with
this Agreement or the Transactions or from any person alleging that the
consent of such person is or may be required in connection with the
Transactions, if the subject matter of such communication

  


 

  


 

  

 

59  

  


 

  


 

  

or the failure of such party to obtain such consent could be material to the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, (ii) any Actions commenced or,
to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company which relates
to this Agreement or the Transactions and (iii) the occurrence or existence of
any fact, event or circumstance that (A) has had or would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or (B) is reasonably likely to
result in any of the conditions set forth in Article VI or Annex I not being
able to be satisfied prior to the End Date; _provided_ that the failure of the
Company to provide any notice required under this Section 5.09(a), in and of
itself, shall not be deemed to be a failure of a condition to the Offer or the
Closing so long as the effect, change, event, occurrence, circumstance or
development underlying such notice is known to Parent prior to the Offer
Acceptance Time.

  


 

  

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall give prompt notice to the
Company (and will subsequently keep the Company informed on a current basis of
any developments related to such notice) of the occurrence or existence of any
fact, event or circumstance that (i) has had or would reasonably be expected
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or (ii) is reasonably likely to result
in any of the conditions set forth in Article VI or Annex I not being able to
be satisfied prior to the End Date; _provided_ that the failure of Parent to
provide any notice required under this Section 5.09(b), in and of itself,
shall not be deemed to be a failure of a condition to the Offer or the Closing
so long as the effect, change, event, occurrence, circumstance or development
underlying such notice is known to the Company prior to the Offer Acceptance
Time.

  


 

  

(c) The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the
defense and settlement of any stockholder litigation against the Company or
its directors relating to this Agreement or the Transactions. The Company
shall give Parent the right to review and comment in advance on all material
filings or responses to be made by the Company in connection with any such
litigation, and the right to consult on the settlement with respect to such
litigation, and the Company will in good faith take such comments into
account, and no settlement of such litigation shall be agreed to without
Parent's prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned).

  


 

  

SECTION 5.10. _Parent Vote._ Immediately following the execution of this
Agreement, Parent shall execute and deliver, in accordance with Section 228 of

60

Closing.

make available to Parent copies of all income Tax Returns filed with any
non-U.S. Taxing Authority by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for the

within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act and satisfy the

any representation, warranty or covenant or other

  


 

  


 

  

 

65  

  


 

  


 

  

agreement set forth in this Agreement that is a consequence of an act or

(C) of this Section 7.03(a)(i), the references to "20%" in the definition of
Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "50%";

  


 

  

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section

suffered or incurred by Parent, Merger Sub, any of their respective Affiliates
or any other person in connection with this Agreement (and the actual or
purported termination hereof), the Merger and the Transactions (and the
abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Section 7.03(b) shall relieve
the Company of any liability for fraud or for any willful and material breach
of this Agreement.

  


 

  


 

  


 

  

 

66  

  

  

  

(c) The parties hereto acknowledge that the agreements contained in this
Section 7.03 are an integral part of the Transactions and that, without these
agreements, the parties hereto would not enter into this Agreement;

this Section 7.03, and, in order to obtain the payment, Parent commences an
Action which results in a judgment against the Company, the Company shall pay
Parent its reasonable and documented costs and expenses (including reasonable
and documented attorneys' fees) in connection with such suit, together with

tendered (and not properly withdrawn) prior to the expiration of the Offer
(but excluding shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that
have not yet been received), together with the shares of Company Common Stock
then owned by Merger Sub, does not represent at least one share more than 50%
of the then outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Minimum
Condition_ ").

  


 

  

(b) _Restraints._ Any Restraint shall be in effect enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting consummation of the Offer or the Merger.

(d) _Representations and Warranties._ The representations and warranties of
the Company (i) set forth in Section 3.02(a) shall not be true and correct in
all respects as of the Expiration Time with the same effect as though made as
of the Expiration Time (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier
date, in which case as of such earlier date), except where the failure to be
true and correct in all respects would not reasonably be expected to result in
additional liability to the Company, Parent or their respective Affiliates in
excess of $10,000,000 in the aggregate, (ii) set forth in Section 3.02(b),
Section 3.14 and Section 3.22 shall not be true and correct (disregarding all
qualifications or limitations as to "Knowledge of the Company," "materiality",
"Material Adverse Effect" and words of similar import set forth therein) in

the Expiration Time with the same effect as though made as of the Expiration
Time (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case

Material Adverse Effect. Parent shall not have received a certificate signed
on behalf of the Company by an executive officer of the Company to such
effect.

  


 

  

(e) _Compliance with Covenants._ The Company shall not have complied with or
performed in all material respects its obligations required to be complied
with or performed by it prior to the Expiration Time under the Agreement and
such failure to comply or perform shall not have been cured by the Expiration
Time. Parent shall not have received a certificate signed on behalf of the
Company by an executive officer of the Company to such effect.

  


 

  

(f) _Company Material Adverse Effect Condition._ Since the date of the
Agreement there shall have been any effect, change, event or occurrence that,
individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.

  


 

  

(g) _No Termination of Agreement._ This Agreement shall have been terminated
in accordance with its terms.

  


 

  

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub
and, other than the Minimum Condition, may be waived by Parent and Merger Sub
in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in their sole
discretion, in each case subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
and to the extent such waiver is permitted by applicable Law. The failure by
Parent, Merger Sub or any other Affiliate of Parent at any time to exercise
any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right,
the waiver of any such right with respect to particular facts and
circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and
circumstances and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be
asserted at any time and from time to time.

  


 

  

The capitalized terms used in this Annex I shall have the meanings set forth
in this Agreement to which it is annexed.

GUARANTEE AGREEMENT

  


 

  

THIS GUARANTEE AGREEMENT (this " _Guarantee_ "), dated as of June 27, 2017, is
made by KONINKLIJKE PHILIPS N.V., a corporation organized and existing under
the laws of the Netherlands (the " _Guarantor_ "), in favor of THE
SPECTRANETICS CORPORATION, a corporation organized under the laws of the State
of Delaware (the " _Company_ ").

  


 

  

PRELIMINARY STATEMENTS:

  


 

  

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of June 27,
2017, (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), among the Company, PHILIPS HOLDING USA
INC., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), and HEALTHTECH MERGER SUB, INC.,
a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_
", and together with Parent, the " _Acquiring Companies_ "), Merger Sub has
agreed to commence a cash tender offer to acquire any and all of the
outstanding shares of the common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the
Company for $38.50 per share, net to the seller in cash, without interest;

  


 

  

WHEREAS, following the consummation of the Offer (such term and each other
capitalized term used but not defined herein shall have the meaning assigned
thereto in the Merger Agreement), upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in the Merger Agreement and in accordance with Section 251(h) of the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, Merger Sub will be merged
with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the Merger;

  


 

  

WHEREAS, the Guarantor desires to make this Guarantee simultaneously with the
execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement to which the Guarantor will
guarantee the obligations of the Acquiring Companies under the Merger
Agreement;

  


 

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and in order to induce
Company to enter into the Merger Agreement, the Guarantor hereby agrees as
follows:

  


 

  

Section 1. _Guarantee._ The Guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
guarantees to the Company the full and timely performance by the Acquiring
Companies of their respective obligations under the Merger Agreement,
including payment obligations and performance of all covenants, agreements,
duties and obligations which apply to the Acquiring Companies under the Merger
Agreement (all such payment and performance obligations being the "
_Obligations_ ") and agrees to take all actions which apply to affiliates of
the Acquiring Companies under the Merger Agreement.

  


 

  

Section 2. _Guarantee Absolute._ The Guarantor hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally guarantees that the Obligations will be duly and punctually
paid or fully and completely performed in accordance with the terms of the
Merger Agreement. The obligations of the Guarantor under this Guarantee are
independent of the Obligations, and a separate action or actions may be
brought by Company and prosecuted against the

  


 

  


 

    

  


 

  


 

  

Guarantor to enforce this Guarantee, irrespective of whether any action is
brought against either of the Acquiring Companies or whether either of the
Acquiring Companies or any of their affiliates is joined in any such action or
actions. If for any reason the Acquiring Companies or their affiliates shall
fail or be unable to duly and punctually pay or to fully and completely
perform, or cause to be duly and punctually paid or fully and completely
performed, any Obligation as and when the same shall become due and payable or
otherwise required to be performed by such party, the Guarantor shall
forthwith duly and punctually pay or fully and completely perform, or cause to
be duly and punctually paid or fully and completely performed, such
Obligation. The Guarantor agrees that this Guarantee, to the extent it
requires the payment of money, constitutes a guarantee of payment when due and
not of collection and is in no way conditioned or contingent upon any attempt
to collect from the Acquiring Companies.

  


 

  

This Guarantee shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case
may be, if at any time any payment of any of the Obligations is rescinded or
must otherwise be returned by Company upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or
reorganization of either of the Acquiring Companies or otherwise, all as
though such payment had not been made.

  


 

  

Section 3. _Waiver._ (a) The Guarantor hereby agrees that it shall not be
released from any of its obligations under this Guarantee by any act, thing or
circumstance whatsoever which might, but for this provision, be deemed a legal
or equitable discharge, release or defense of a guarantor or surety (other
than the full payment and performance of the Obligations).

  


 

  

(b) Without limiting the generality of paragraph (a) above, the Guarantor
hereby unconditionally waives any and all notices that may be required by any
applicable foreign or domestic statute, law (including common law), ordinance,
code, standard, requirement, policy, determination, procedure, Order
(including executive order), rule or regulation enacted, adopted or
promulgated by any applicable Governmental Authority, to the extent legally
binding and finally determined, now or hereafter in effect, including
promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance and any other notice with respect
to any of the Obligations and this Guarantee and any requirement that the
Company first present to, proceed against or make a demand against the
Acquiring Companies or otherwise exhaust any right, power or remedy under the
Merger Agreement, before requesting payment or performance by the Guarantor
hereunder or that the Company protects, secures, perfects or insures any
security interest or lien or any property subject thereto or exhaust any other
right to take any action against the Acquiring Parties or any collateral.

  


 

  

(c) The Guarantor acknowledges that it will receive substantial direct and
indirect benefits from the Transactions and that the waivers set forth in this
Guarantee are knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits.

  


 

  

Section 4. _Subrogation._ The Guarantor will not exercise any rights which it
may acquire by way of subrogation under this Guarantee, by any payment made

  


 

  


 

    

  


 

  


 

  

hereunder or otherwise, until all the Obligations and all other amounts
payable under this Guarantee shall have been paid and performed in full. If
any amount shall be paid to the Guarantor on account of such subrogation
rights at any time prior to the payment or performance in full of the
Obligations and all other amounts payable to Company under this Guarantee,
such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of Company and shall
forthwith be paid to the Company to be credited and applied upon the
Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of the
Merger Agreement or be held by the Company as collateral security for any
Obligations thereafter existing.

  


 

  

Section 5. _Representations and Warranties._ The Guarantor hereby represents
and warrants as follows:

  


 

  

(a) The Guarantor is a corporation duly organized and validly existing under
the laws of the Netherlands.

  


 

  

(b) The Guarantor has full power and authority to execute and deliver this
Guarantee and to perform its obligations under this Guarantee. The execution
and delivery of this Guarantee by the Guarantor and the performance by the
Guarantor of its obligations hereunder have been duly and validly authorized
by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Guarantor. This Guarantee
has been duly executed and delivered by the Guarantor and constitutes the
legal, valid and binding agreement of the Guarantor, enforceable against the
Guarantor in accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity
Exception.

  


 

  

(c) The execution, delivery and performance of this Guarantee and the
fulfillment of and compliance with the terms and conditions hereof do not
violate or conflict with (i) any term or provision of the charter documents of
the Guarantor, (ii) any judgment, decree or order of any Governmental
Authority to which the Guarantor is a party or by which the Guarantor is bound
or (iii) any applicable Law applicable to the Guarantor, except, in the case
of clauses (ii) and (iii), as would not be reasonably expected to have a
material adverse effect. No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or
registration, declaration or filing with, any Governmental Authority is
required with respect to the Guarantor in connection with the execution,
delivery or performance of this Guarantee.

  


 

  

(d) There are no conditions precedent to the effectiveness of this Guarantee.

  


 

  

Section 6. _Amendments, Etc._ No amendment or waiver of any provision of this
Guarantee, and no consent to any departure by the Guarantor herefrom, shall in
any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the
Company, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the
specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given.

  


 

  

Section 7. _Notices._ All notices, requests, claims, demands and other
communications to any party hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed
given if

Section 8. _No Waiver; Remedies._ No failure on the part of the Company to
exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right
hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of
any other right. The remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive
of any remedies provided by law.

  


 

  

Section 9. _C_ _ontinuing Guarantee; Assignment._ This Guarantee is a
continuing guarantee and shall (a) remain in full force and effect until the
payment and performance in full of the Obligations and the payment of all
other amounts payable under this Guarantee, (b) be binding upon the Guarantor,
its successors and permitted assigns, and (c) inure to the benefit of, and be
enforceable by, the Company and its successors and permitted assigns. No
assignment or transfer by either the Guarantor of its obligations or the
Company of its rights hereunder shall be made except with the prior written
consent of the other and any attempted assignment or transfer in violation of
this Section 9 shall be void.

  


 

  

Section 10. _Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Immunities._ (a) All actions
and proceedings arising out of or relating to this Guarantee shall be heard
and determined in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (and any
state appellate

  


 

  


 

    

  


 

  


 

  

court therefrom within the State of Delaware) or if (and only if) the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, the Superior Court of the State of Delaware (Complex
Commercial Division), or if subject matter jurisdiction over the matter which
is the subject of the action or proceeding is by Law vested exclusively in the
courts of the United States of America, the United States District Court for
the District of Delaware (the " _Selected Courts_ "). In addition, the
Guarantor (i) consents to submit itself, and hereby submits itself, to the
exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts in the event any dispute
arises out of this Guarantee, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or
defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from
any such court, and agrees not to plead or claim any objection to the laying
of venue in any such court or that any judicial proceeding in any such court
has been brought in an inconvenient forum, (iii) agrees that it will not bring
any action relating to this Guarantee in any court other than the Selected
Courts and (iv) consents to service of process being made through the notice
procedures set forth in Section 7. The Guarantor agrees that a final judgment
in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in
other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
law.

  


 

  

(b) To the extent that the Guarantor has or hereafter may acquire any immunity
from jurisdiction of any court or from any legal process (whether through
service or notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution, execution or otherwise) with respect to itself or its property, the
Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives such immunity in respect of its
obligations under this Guaranty and, without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, agrees that the waivers set forth in this subsection (b) shall have
the fullest scope permitted under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976
of the United States and are intended to be irrevocable for purposes of such
Act.

  


 

  

Section 11. _Governing Law._ This Guarantee, and any cause of action between
any of the parties relating to or arising out of this Guarantee, shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of
Delaware, regardless of the Laws that might otherwise govern under any
applicable conflict of laws principles.

  


 

  

Section 12. _Severability._ Whenever possible each provision of this Guarantee
shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable Law, but if any provision of this Guarantee shall be held invalid,
illegal or unenforceable, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability
shall not affect any other provisions of this Guarantee, and this Guarantee
shall be construed as if any such provision had never been contained herein.

  


 

  

Section 13. _Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and it shall not be
necessary in making proof of this Agreement or the terms hereof to produce or
account for more than one of such counterparts.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Guarantor has caused this Guarantee to be duly
executed and delivered by its officer thereunto duly authorized as of the date
first above written.

time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment
is taken. At the adjourned meeting, the Corporation may transact any business
which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment
is for more than thirty days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is
fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be
given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting.

  


 

  

Section 1.5. _Quorum_. At each meeting of stockholders, except where otherwise
provided by law or the certificate of incorporation or these Bylaws, the
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote on a
matter at the meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, shall
constitute a quorum. In the absence of a quorum of the holders of any class of
stock entitled to vote on a matter, the holders of such class so present or
represented

  


 

  


 

    

  


 

  


 

  

may, by majority vote, adjourn the meeting of such class from time to time in
the manner provided by Section 1.4 of these Bylaws until a quorum of such
class is so present or represented. Shares of its own capital stock belonging
on the record date for the meeting to the Corporation or to another
corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of
directors of such other corporation is held, directly or indirectly, by the
Corporation, shall neither be entitled to vote nor be counted for quorum
purposes; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not limit the right of
the Corporation to vote stock, including but not limited to its own stock,
held by it in a fiduciary capacity.

  


 

  

Section 1.6. _Organization_. Meetings of stockholders shall be presided over
by the Chairman of the Board, if any, or, in the absence of the Chairman of
the Board, by the Vice Chairman of the Board, if any, or, in the absence of
the Vice Chairman of the Board, by the President, or, in the absence of the
President, by a Vice President, or, in the absence of the foregoing persons,
by a chairman designated by the Board of Directors, or, in the absence of such
designation, by a chairman chosen at the meeting. The Secretary, or in the
absence of the Secretary, an Assistant Secretary, shall act as secretary of
the meeting, but in the absence of the Secretary and any Assistant Secretary,
the chairman of the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the
meeting. The order of business at each such meeting shall be as determined by
the chairman of the meeting. The chairman of the meeting shall have the right
and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do
all such acts and things as are necessary or desirable for the proper conduct
of the meeting, including, without limitation, the establishment of procedures
for the maintenance of order and safety, limitations on the time allotted to
questions or comments on the affairs of the Corporation, restrictions on entry
to such meeting after the time prescribed for the commencement thereof and the
opening and closing of the voting polls.

  


 

  

Section 1.7. _Voting; Proxies_. Unless otherwise provided in the certificate
of incorporation, each stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of
stockholders shall be entitled to one vote for each share of stock held by
such stockholder who has voting power upon the matter in question. Each
stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express
consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may
authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy, but
no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date,
unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A duly executed proxy shall be
irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as,
it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable
power, regardless of whether the interest with which it is coupled is an
interest in the stock itself or an interest in the Corporation generally. A
stockholder may revoke any proxy that is not irrevocable by attending the
meeting and voting in person or by filing an instrument in writing revoking
the proxy or another duly executed proxy bearing a later date with the
Secretary of the Corporation. Voting at meetings of stockholders need not be
by written ballot unless the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares
of all classes of stock entitled to vote thereon present in person or
represented by proxy at such meeting shall so determine. Directors shall be
elected by a plurality of the votes of the shares present in person or
represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the election of
directors. In all other matters, unless otherwise provided by law or by the
certificate of incorporation or these Bylaws, the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy
at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of
the stockholders. Where a separate vote by class or classes is required,

  


 

  


 

  

 

-2-  

  


 

  


 

  

the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of such class
or classes present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting shall be
the act of such class or classes, except as otherwise provided by law or by
the certificate of incorporation or these Bylaws.

  


 

  

Section 1.8. _Fixing Date for Determination of Stockholders of Record_. In
order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice
of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the
Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede
the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the
Board of Directors, and which record date shall be neither more than sixty nor
less than ten days before the date of such meeting. If no record date is fixed
by the Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders
entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the
close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given,
or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding
the day on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of
record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall
apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of
Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.

  


 

  

In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of
Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date
upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of
Directors, and which date shall not be more than ten days after the date upon
which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of
Directors. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors, the
record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate
action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of
Directors is required by law, shall be the first date on which a signed
written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is
delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State
of Delaware, its principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the
Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of
stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the Corporation's registered
office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt
requested. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors and
prior action by the Board of Directors is required by law, the record date for
determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing
without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the day on which the
Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.

  


 

  

In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any
rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any
change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other
lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date
shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is
adopted, and which record date shall be not more than sixty days prior to such
action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining
stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day
on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.

stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order,
and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares
registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the
examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during
ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten days prior to the
meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held,
which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or, if not so
specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held. The list shall also
be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole
time thereof and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present.

  


 

  

Section 1.10. _Consent of Stockholders in Lieu of Meeting_. Unless otherwise
provided in the certificate of incorporation or by law, any action required by
law to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the
Corporation, or any action which may be taken at any annual or special meeting
of such stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and
without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action
so taken, is signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than
the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such
action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present
and voted and shall be delivered to the Corporation by delivery to (a) its
registered office in the State of Delaware by hand or by certified mail or
registered mail, return receipt requested, (b) its principal place of business
or (c) an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in
which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. Every written
consent shall bear the date of signature of each stockholder who signs the
consent and no written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action
referred to therein unless, within sixty days of the earliest dated consent
delivered in the manner required by this bylaw to the Corporation, written
consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take action are delivered
to the Corporation by delivery to (i) its registered office in the State of
Delaware by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested,
(ii) its principal place of business or (iii) an officer or agent of the
Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of
stockholders are recorded. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action
without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to
those stockholders who have not consented in writing and who, if the action
had been taken at a meeting, would have been entitled to notice of the meeting
if the record date for such meeting had been the date that written consents
signed by a sufficient number of stockholders to take the action were
delivered to the Corporation as provided in this Section 1.10.

of Directors, one-third of the entire Board of Directors shall constitute a

committee shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, the vote
of a majority of the members present at a meeting at the time of such vote if
a quorum is then present shall be the act of such committee, and in other
respects each committee shall conduct its business in the same manner as the

asserted against him or her and incurred by him or her in any such capacity,
or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the Corporation
would have the power to indemnify him or her against such liability under the
provisions of the DGCL.

  


 

  

Section 6.7. _Other Indemnification_. The Corporation's obligation, if any, to
indemnify or advance expenses to any person who was or is serving at its
request as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation,
