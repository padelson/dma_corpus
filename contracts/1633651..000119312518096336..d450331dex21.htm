Shares pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.4(e)_). For the avoidance of doubt,

     | Section 2.4 | _Exchange of Partnership Public Units_. 
---|---|---

commercial bank or trust company as exchange agent hereunder for the purpose
of exchanging Book-Entry Units for the Merger Consideration and the payment of
any distributions pursuant to _ Section 2.4(c)_ (the " _Exchange Agent_ ").
Promptly after the Closing, TEGP shall (i) deposit, or cause to be deposited,
with the Exchange Agent the New TEGP Class A Shares to be issued as the Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3(a)(i)_ (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, New TEGP Class A Shares issued upon the rounding up of
fractional TEGP Class A Shares pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.4(e)_) and (ii)
authorize the Exchange Agent to exchange Partnership Public Units
in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.3(a)_. TEGP shall deposit or make

Any New TEGP Class A Shares and cash deposited with or made available to the

__ _ 2.4(c)_ shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_." The
Exchange Fund shall be used only for the purposes contemplated by _Section_ __
_ 2.4(c)_.

 



14 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, TEGP shall
instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each record holder of Book-Entry Units
(i) a form of letter of transmittal (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
Book-Entry Units shall pass only upon adherence to the procedures set forth in
the Letter of Transmittal, and which shall be in such customary form and have
such other provisions as TEGP and the Partnership may reasonably agree prior
to the Effective Time) and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of
Book-Entry Units in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in respect
of such Book-Entry Units and any distributions payable pursuant to  _Section_
__ _ 2.4(c)_. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 2.4(c)_, upon surrender to the
Exchange Agent of Book-Entry Units, together with a properly completed and
duly executed Letter of Transmittal and such other documents as may be
required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Book-Entry Units shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) that number of New TEGP Class A
Shares (including, for the avoidance of doubt, New TEGP Class A Shares to be
issued upon the rounding up of fractional TEGP Class A Shares pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.4(e)_) to which such holder of Book-Entry Units is entitled
pursuant to this _Article II_ and (B) any distributions such holder of Book-
Entry Units is entitled to receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.4(c)_. All
New TEGP Class A Shares delivered in accordance with this _Article II_ shall
be uncertificated and shall be registered in book-entry form. After the
Effective Time, there shall be no further transfer on the records of the
Partnership or its transfer agent of Book-Entry Units, _provided_ , that the
foregoing shall not restrict the transfer of any Partnership Interest other
than Partnership Public Units after the Effective Time. If such Book-Entry
Units are presented to the Partnership or its transfer agent for transfer,
they shall be canceled against delivery of the appropriate
Merger Consideration and any distributions payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.4(c)_ as hereinabove provided. Until surrendered, as contemplated by this
_Section_ __ _ 2.4_, each Book-Entry Unit shall be deemed, at any time after
the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender
the appropriate Merger Consideration payable and any distributions to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.4(c)_. No interest
shall be paid or accrue on any Merger Consideration or unpaid distributions
payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.4(c)_ to holders of Book-Entry Units.

 

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Partnership Public Units_.
No distributions declared or made with respect to New TEGP Class A Shares
with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
Book-Entry Units not surrendered with respect to TEGP Class A Shares issuable
in respect thereof until such Book-Entry Units have been surrendered in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.4_. Subject to Applicable Law,
following compliance with the requirements of this _Section_ __ _ 2.4_, TEGP
shall (i) cause the Exchange Agent to pay to each holder of Book-Entry Units,
without interest, (a) promptly after the time of surrender of such Book-Entry
Units, the amount of distributions previously paid with respect to New TEGP
Class A Shares issuable with respect to such Book-Entry Units that have a
record date after the Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to the
date of surrender, and (b) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
distributions payable with respect to such Book-Entry Units that have a
record date prior to the Effective Time and that were declared on or prior to
the Effective Time but that remain unpaid at the Closing Date and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, pay to each holder of New TEGP Class A
Shares issuable with respect to such Book-Entry Units the amount of
distributions payable with respect to such New TEGP Class A Shares that have a
record date after the Effective Time and prior to the date of surrender and a
payment date subsequent to the date of surrender.

 



15 (d) _No Further Rights in Partnership Public Units_. All
Merger Consideration issued upon the surrender of Book-Entry Units in
accordance with the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 2.4_ shall be deemed to have
been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
Book-Entry Units, subject, however, to TEGPs obligation, with respect to
Partnership Common Units outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
to pay any distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time that
were declared on or prior to the Effective Time by the Partnership on such
Partnership Common Units in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and
that remain unpaid at the Closing Date.

 

(e) _No Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing
fractional TEGP Class A Shares shall be issued in the Merger. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, all fractional TEGP Class A Shares that
a holder of Partnership Public Units would otherwise be entitled to receive as
Merger Consideration (after taking into account all Partnership Public Units
held by such holder) will be aggregated and then, if a fractional TEGP Class A
Share results from that aggregation, be rounded up to the nearest whole TEGP
Class A Share, and any such additional TEGP Class A Shares shall become part
of the Merger Consideration.

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains unclaimed by the former holders of Partnership Public Units as of the
date that is twelve months following the Effective Time shall be delivered to
TEGP upon demand. Thereafter, any former holders of Partnership Public Units
who have not theretofore complied with the provisions of this _Section 2.4_
shall look only to TEGP for payment of their claim for Merger Consideration
and any distributions with respect to New TEGP Class A Shares to which they
are entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.4(c)_, in each case, without any
interest thereon.

 

(g) _No Liability_. None of TEGP, TEGP Management, the Partnership, the
General Partner or the Surviving Entity shall be liable to any holder of
Partnership Public Units for any New TEGP Class A Shares (or cash for the
payment of distributions with respect thereto) from the Exchange Fund
delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

(h) _Transferred Partnership Public Units_. If any Book-Entry Units shall
have been transferred, but such transfer is not registered in the transfer
records of the Partnership, the transferee of such Book-Entry Units may effect
the surrender of such Book-Entry Units by delivering evidence of ownership of
such Book-Entry Units as required by the Exchange Agent accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer. In addition, such
transferee shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other
Taxes required by reason of the delivery of the Merger Consideration and any
distributions payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.4(c)_ in any name other
than that of the record holder of such Book-Entry Units, or shall establish to
the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Taxes have been paid or are
not payable. Upon compliance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.4(h)_, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of such Book-Entry Units, and any
distributions to which the holder of such Book-Entry Units is entitled
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.4(c)_, may be paid to such transferee.

(i) _Admission as a Limited Partner_. Upon the issuance of New TEGP Class
A Shares to holders of Partnership Public Units in accordance with this
Agreement, each Person receiving New TEGP Class A Shares shall automatically
be admitted as a limited partner of TEGP.

 



16 (j) _Withholding_. Each of TEGP, the Surviving Entity and the Exchange
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Partnership
Common Units or Partnership EPUs such amounts as TEGP, the Surviving Entity or
the Exchange Agent deems to be required to deduct and withhold under the Code
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Law, with respect to the making of such payment.
To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by TEGP, the
Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Partnership
Common Units or Partnership EPUs in respect of whom such deduction and
withholding was made by TEGP, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent, as
the case may be. If withholding is taken in TEGP Class A Shares, TEGP, the
Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, shall be

If between the Execution Date and the Effective Time, whether or not
permitted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the number of outstanding

different number of units, shares or other securities (including
any different class or series of securities) by reason of any dividend or
distribution payable in partnership interests, voting securities, equity
interests or rights, subdivision, reclassification, split, split-up,
combination, merger, consolidation, reorganization, exchange or other similar
transaction, or any such transaction shall be authorized, declared or agreed
upon with a record date at or prior to the Effective Time, then the Merger
Consideration, and any other similarly dependent items shall be appropriately
adjusted to reflect fully the effect of such transaction and to provide to the
Partnership, Merger Sub and the holders of Partnership Common Units the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event, and
thereafter, all references in this Agreement to the Merger Consideration, and
any other similarly dependent items shall be references to the
Merger Consideration, and any other similarly dependent items, as so
adjusted; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 2.5_

pursuant to this Agreement.



     | Section 2.6 | _Partnership Equity Awards_. 
---|---|--- 

At the Effective Time, each Partnership EPU that is outstanding and unvested
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to

set forth in the agreement by which the award of such Partnership EPU is
evidenced, as in effect on the Execution Date (all outstanding Partnership

will be settled in TEGP Class A Shares; (b) the number of TEGP Class A Shares
subject to each Assumed EPU award shall be 

 



17  determined by multiplying the number of Partnership Common Units subject to
such Assumed EPU award immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange
Ratio, and rounding the resulting number up to the nearest whole number of
TEGP Class A Shares; and (c) any conditions and restrictions on the receipt of
any Assumed EPUs shall continue in full force and effect and the term, vesting

to each Assumed EPU, (ii) each Assumed EPU shall, in accordance with its
terms, be subject to further adjustment as appropriate to reflect any dividend
or distribution payable in partnership interests, voting securities, equity
interests or rights, subdivision, reclassification, split, split-up,
combination, merger, consolidation, reorganization, exchange or other similar
transaction with respect to TEGP Class A Shares following the Effective Time,
and (iii) the TEGP Management Board, or any committee thereof, shall succeed
to the authority and responsibility of the General Partner Board, or any
committee, thereof with respect to each Assumed EPU.

---|---|--- 

For U.S. federal income tax purposes (and for purposes of any applicable
state, local or foreign Tax that follows the U.S. federal income tax
treatment), the Parties agree to treat the Merger (a) with respect to holders
of Partnership Public Units, as a taxable sale of such Partnership Public
Units to TE and (b) with respect to TE, as a purchase of Partnership Public
Units from the holders of such Partnership Public Units. The Parties will
prepare and file all Tax Returns consistent with the foregoing and will not
take any inconsistent position on any Tax Return, or during the course of any
audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes, except as

summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules
and forms. The Partnership maintains internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act)

possession or control of such information or contravene any Law, fiduciary
duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the Execution Date. The
Parties shall make reasonable and appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions referred to in the
preceding sentence apply.

(b) Each Party agrees that it (i) shall not use any information obtained
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.2_ or _Section_ __ _ 5.5_ for any purpose
unrelated to (A) the consummation of the Transactions or (B) the matters
contemplated by  _Section_ __ _ 5.5_, in accordance with the terms thereof,
and (ii) shall hold all information and documents obtained pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 5.2 _and _Section_ __ _ 5.5_ in confidence; _provided_ ,
_however_ , the foregoing restrictions shall not apply to any information
obtained pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.2_ or _Section_ __ _ 5.5_ to
which such Party was, prior to the Execution Date, entitled to receive
pursuant to Applicable Law or any contract or agreement other than this
Agreement. No investigation by any Party of the business and affairs of
another Party shall affect, or be deemed to modify or waive,
any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement in this Agreement,
or the conditions to any Partys obligation to consummate the Transactions.



     | Section 5.3 | _Registration Statement_. 
---|---|--- 

(a) _Preparation of the Registration Statement._ Each of the Parties

(the " _Registration Statement_ "), including a joint proxy statement and
other proxy solicitation materials of the Partnership and prospectus of TEGP
constituting a part thereof (the " _Proxy Statement_ ") and all related
documents, to be filed by TEGP with the SEC in order to register the issuance
of the New TEGP Class A Shares to be issued in the Merger, as contemplated by
this Agreement. Provided each of the other Parties has cooperated in the
preparation of the Registration Statement as provided in this  _Section_ __ _
5.3(a)_, TEGP shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to file the
Registration Statement with the SEC as promptly as reasonably practicable, and
in any event within twenty (20) days, following the Execution Date. Each of
TEGP and the Partnership shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Registration Statement to be declared effective under the Securities
Act as promptly as practicable after the filing thereof, and to maintain the
Registration Statement in effect until the earlier of the consummation of the

 



37  Transactions or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Article VII_. Each of the Parties also agrees to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary state securities Law or "Blue Sky"
permits and approvals required to consummate the Transactions. Each of the
Parties agrees to furnish to the other Parties all information concerning the
members of the TEGP Group and the members of the Partnership Group, as
applicable, and to take such other action as may be reasonably requested in
connection with the foregoing.

 

(b) _Information Supplied_. Each of the Parties agrees, as to itself and
its Subsidiaries, that (i) none of the information supplied or to be supplied
by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Registration
Statement will, at the time the Registration Statement and each amendment or
supplement thereto, if any, becomes effective under the Securities Act,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, and (ii) none of the information supplied or to be supplied
by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement
forming a part of the Registration Statement, and any amendment or supplement
thereto, will, at the date such Proxy Statement is mailed to the holders of
Partnership Common Units, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. Each of the Parties further agrees that, if it shall become aware
prior to the Closing Date of any information that would cause any of the
statements in the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement forming a
part thereof to be false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or
omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not false or
misleading, it will promptly inform the other Parties of such information and
take the necessary steps to correct such information in an amendment or
supplement to the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement forming a part
thereof, as applicable.

 

(c) _SEC Correspondence_. Each of TEGP and the Partnership shall (i)
promptly notify the other Party of receipt of any comments from the SEC or
its staff regarding, and any requests by the SEC or its staff for amendments
or supplements to or additional information regarding, the Registration
Statement and (ii) promptly supply the other Party with copies of all
correspondence between such Party and its employees, counsel, accountants and
other authorized representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff,
on the other hand, with respect thereto. TEGP and the Partnership shall
use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to respond to any
comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the Registration Statement as
promptly as practicable following receipt thereof from the SEC or its staff.

or cause the distribution of, the Proxy Statement to holders of Partnership
Common Units as promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement is
declared effective under the Securities Act.

 

(e) _Registration of TEGP Class_ __ _ A Shares Subject to Assumed EPUs_.
On the Closing Date, to the extent necessary to register the issuance of the
TEGP Class A Shares subject to Assumed EPUs, TEGP shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement on Form
S-8, a post-effective amendment to Form S-3, or, in each case,

 



38  any successor form thereto, or such other registration statement or
amendment as may be required in order to register the issuance of such TEGP
Class A Shares. TEGP shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
maintain in effect such registration statement, including any related
prospectus or prospectuses, for so long as such Assumed EPUs continue to be
outstanding and unvested.

 



     | Section 5.4 | _Partnership Limited Partner Meeting_. 
---|---|--- 
 

(a) _Partnership Limited Partner Meeting_. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the General Partner shall take, for and on
behalf of the Partnership, in accordance with the TEP Partnership Agreement,
Applicable Law, and applicable stock exchange rules, and as soon as
practicable following the Execution Date, all action necessary to set
a record date for, call, give notice of, hold and convene an appropriate
meeting of the holders of Partnership Common Units to consider and vote upon
the approval of this Agreement and the Transactions, including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Merger, and any other matters required to be approved

(b) _General Partner Recommendation_. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.5_,
each of the General Partner Board and the Partnership Conflicts Committee
shall recommend approval of this Agreement and the Transactions, to the
holders of Partnership Common Units (the " _General Partner Recommendation_ ")

withdraw, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to TEGP, the General Partner
Recommendation; (ii) if any Acquisition Proposal has been made public, fail to
issue a press release recommending against such Acquisition Proposal and
reaffirming the General Partner Recommendation, if requested by TEGP in
writing, within the earlier of (x) ten (10) Business Days after such written
request and (y) two (2) Business Days before the Meeting; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that TEGP may only make such request once with respect to a
particular Acquisition Proposal unless such Acquisition Proposal is materially
modified, in which case TEGP may make such request once with respect to each
such material modification; (iii) fail to announce publicly, within ten
Business Days after a tender offer or exchange offer relating to any
securities of the Partnership has been commenced, that the General Partner
Board and the Partnership Conflicts Committee recommend rejection of such
tender or exchange offer; (iv) fail to include such General Partner
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement; or (v) resolve or publicly propose to
do any of the foregoing (any such action, a " _Partnership Adverse
Recommendation Change_ "). Subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.5_, the General
Partner shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain from the holders of
Partnership Common Units the Partnership Limited Partner Approval. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of the General
Partner, for and on behalf of the Partnership, set forth in _Section_ __ _
5.4(a)_ shall not be affected by a Partnership Adverse Recommendation Change.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (A) the General
Partner may postpone or adjourn the Meeting (1) to solicit additional proxies
for the purpose of obtaining the Partnership Limited Partner Approval, (2) in
the absence of quorum, or (3) to allow reasonable additional time for the
filing and/or mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure that the
General Partner has determined after consultation with outside legal counsel
is necessary under Applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended
disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the holders of Partnership
Common Units prior to the Meeting, and (B) the General Partner Board or the
Partnership Conflicts Committee, as applicable, may

 



39  cause the General Partner to postpone or adjourn the Meeting if the General
Partner Board or the Partnership Conflicts Committee has delivered any notice
contemplated by  _Section_ __ _ 5.5(b)_ and the time periods contemplated by
_Section_ __ _ 5.5(b)_ have not expired.

 

(c) _Agreement to Support_. Contemporaneously with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, TE has executed and delivered the Support
Agreement.



     | Section 5.5 | _Acquisition Proposals; Partnership Adverse
Recommendation Change_. 
---|---|--- 
 

(a) (i) The General Partner, for and on behalf of the Partnership, shall
not, and the Partnership Subsidiaries shall not, and shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause their respective officers, employees, counsel,
accountants and other authorized representatives not to, directly or
indirectly, (A) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage or facilitate the
submission of any Acquisition Proposal, (B) participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any non-public information
regarding, the Partnership in connection with any Acquisition Proposal, (C)
approve, endorse, recommend or enter into any contract or agreement in
principle, whether written or oral, with any Person (other than a member of
the TEGP Group) concerning an Acquisition Proposal (except in compliance with
_Section_ __ _ 5.5(a)(ii)_), (D) terminate, amend, release, modify or fail to
enforce any provision of, or grant any permission, waiver or request under,
any standstill, confidentiality or similar contract entered into in
compliance with _Section_ __ _ 5.5(a)(ii)_ by the General Partner or one or
more of the members of the Partnership Group in respect of or in contemplation
of an Acquisition Proposal, (E) take any action to make the provisions of any
Takeover Laws inapplicable to any transactions contemplated by any Acquisition
Proposal, or (F) resolve or publicly propose or announce to do any of the
foregoing.

 

(ii) If the General Partner, any member of the Partnership Group, or any of
their respective officers, employees, counsel, accountants or other
authorized representatives receives a Bona Fide Acquisition Proposal, the
General Partner shall, or shall cause such Person, as applicable, to, promptly
deliver such Bona Fide Acquisition Proposal to the General Partner Board and
the Partnership Conflicts Committee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, but
subject to the limitations in _Section_ __ _ 5.5(a)(i)_, prior to obtaining
Partnership Limited Partner Approval, the General Partner, for and on behalf
of the Partnership, may furnish any information to and enter into or
participate in discussions or negotiations with, any Person that makes a Bona
Fide Acquisition Proposal (such Person making such a proposal, a " _Receiving
Party_ "), if (A) either or both of the General Partner Board or the
Partnership Conflicts Committee, after consultation with its or their
respective outside legal counsel(s) and financial advisors, determines in
good faith (1) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably
likely to result in a Superior Proposal and (2) that failure to permit the
General Partner to furnish information to, or enter into or participate in
discussions or negotiations with, such Receiving Party would be inconsistent
with their respective duties to the holders of Partnership Common Units under
Applicable Law, as modified by the TEP Partnership Agreement, and (B) prior to
the General Partner furnishing any non-public information or data pertaining
to the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Non-Public _ 

 



40   _Information_ ") to such Receiving Party, (1) the Partnership receives from
such Receiving Party an executed Confidentiality Agreement, (2) the
Partnership furnishes a copy of such executed Confidentiality Agreement to
TEGP and (3) the Partnership notifies TEGP of the identity of such Receiving
Party.

 

(iii) The Partnership agrees that any breach of the restrictions or
obligations set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.5(a)_ by the Partnership
Conflicts Committee or, to the extent directed by the Partnership Conflicts
Committee, any of its authorized representatives, shall constitute a breach of
this  _Section_ __ _ 5.5(a)_ by the Partnership.

(iv) The General Partner, for and on behalf of the Partnership, shall, as
promptly as practicable (and in any event within 24 hours of receipt) advise
TEGP orally and in writing of any Acquisition Proposal and the material terms
and condition of any such Acquisition Proposal (including any changes
thereto) and the identity of the Person making any such Acquisition Proposal.
The Partnership shall keep TEGP informed on a reasonably current basis of
material developments to the status and details regarding any such
Acquisition Proposal (including changes thereto).

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any
time prior to obtaining the Partnership Limited Partner Approval, either or
both of the General Partner Board or the Partnership Conflicts Committee may
make a Partnership Adverse Recommendation Change if, after consultation with
its or their respective outside legal counsel(s) and financial advisors, the
General Partner Board and/or the Partnership Conflicts Committee (as the case
may be) determines in good faith that the failure to make a Partnership
Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with their respective
duties to the holders of Partnership Common Units under Applicable Law, as
modified by the TEP Partnership Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x)
no such Partnership Adverse Recommendation Change shall be made other than in
response to (1) a Superior Proposal that did not result from a breach of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.5_ or (2) an Intervening Event and (y) neither the General
Partner Board nor the Partnership Conflicts Committee, as the case may be,
shall be entitled to exercise its right to make a Partnership Adverse
Recommendation Change pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.5(b)_ unless:

 

(i) the General Partner Board or the Partnership Conflicts Committee (as
the case may be) has provided prior written notice to TEGP specifying in
reasonable detail the reasons for making a Partnership Adverse Recommendation
Change (including, in the case of a Superior Proposal, a description of the
material terms of such Superior Proposal and in the case of an Intervening
Event, a description of the material events giving rise to the Intervening
Event) at least four days in advance of its intention to take action with
respect to a Partnership Adverse Recommendation Change, unless at the
time such notice is required to be given there are less than four days prior
to the Meeting, in which case the General Partner Board or the Partnership
Conflicts Committee (as the case may be) shall provide as much notice as is
reasonably practicable (the period inclusive of all such days, the "
_Partnership Notice Period_ "); and

 

(ii) during the Partnership Notice Period, the General Partner Board or the
Partnership Conflicts Committee (as the case may be) has negotiated with the
TEGP

 



41  Management Board in good faith (to the extent the TEGP Management Board
desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of
this Agreement so that the failure to effect such Partnership Adverse
Recommendation Change would not be inconsistent with the General Partner
Boards and/or the Partnership Conflicts Committees (as the case may be)
duties to holders of Partnership Common Units under Applicable Law, as
modified by the TEP Partnership Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
material amendment to the terms of a Superior Proposal, if applicable, shall
require a new notice pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.5_ and a new
Partnership Notice Period, except that such new Partnership Notice Period in
connection with any material amendment shall be for two days from the time
TEGP receives such notice (as opposed to four days).

 

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Partnership, the
General Partner, the General Partner Board or the Partnership Conflicts
Committee from issuing a "stop, look and listen" communication pursuant to
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule
14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal if the
General Partner Board or the Partnership Conflicts Committee determines
in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that its
failure to do so would be reasonably likely to constitute a violation of
Applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the General Partner
Recommendation is expressly reaffirmed in any such communication unless a
Partnership Adverse Recommendation Change has occurred in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 5.5(b)_.



     | Section 5.6 | _Commercially Reasonable Efforts; Further
Assurances_. 
---|---|--- 

From and after the Execution Date, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions hereof, each of the Parties shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to (a) take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
Applicable Law to consummate and make effective the Transactions as promptly
as practicable (but in any event before a termination of this Agreement) and
(b) defend any lawsuits or other Actions, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions or seek to
have lifted or rescinded any injunction or restraining order or other order
adversely affecting the ability of the Parties to consummate

before, at or after the Closing Date, each of them will execute and deliver,
or cause to be executed and delivered, such instruments of assignment,
transfer, conveyance, endorsement, direction or authorization as may be
necessary to consummate and make effective the Transactions. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement will require any Party to hold
separate or make any divestiture not expressly contemplated herein of any
asset or otherwise agree to any restriction on its operations or other
condition in order to obtain any consent or approval or other clearance
required by this Agreement.



     | Section 5.7 | _No Public Announcement_. 
---|---|--- 

On the Execution Date, TEGP and the Partnership shall issue a joint press
release with respect to the execution of this Agreement and the Transactions,

the Partnership Conflicts Committee. Except in connection with a Partnership
Adverse Recommendation Change, if any, no Party shall issue

 



42  any other press release or make any other public announcement concerning
this Agreement or the Transactions (to the extent not previously issued or
made in accordance with this Agreement) (other than as may be required by
Applicable Law or pursuant to the rules of the NYSE, in which event the Party
making the public announcement or press release shall, to the extent
practicable, notify TEGP and the Partnership in advance of such
public announcement or press release) without the prior approval of TEGP or
the Partnership, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned.

the Party incurring such expenses, except that TE and the Partnership shall
each pay for one-half of (a) any filing fees with respect to the Registration
Statement, including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Proxy Statement, (b) the
costs of printing and mailing of the Proxy Statement and (c) any filing fees
and other costs and expenses relating to the preparation of any filing with a
Governmental Authority required in connection with the Transactions, including
any filings required under the HSR Act.



     | Section 5.9 | _Regulatory Issues_. 
---|---|--- 

(a) The Parties shall cooperate fully with respect to any filing,
submission or communication with a Governmental Authority having jurisdiction
over the Transactions. Such cooperation shall include each of the Parties: (i)
providing, in the case of oral communications with a Governmental Authority,
advance notice of any such communication and, to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, an opportunity for each other Party to participate; (ii)
providing, in the case of written communications, an opportunity for
each other Party to comment on any such communication and provide the other

additional request for information and documentary material), unless directed
not to do so by any other Party. All cooperation shall be conducted in such a
manner so as to preserve all applicable privileges.

 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Parties
shall cooperate fully to (i) make an appropriate filing of a Notification and

to be taken, all other actions consistent with this _Section_ __ _ 5.9(b)_
necessary to cause the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting
periods under the HSR Act as promptly as practicable (and in any event no
later than the Termination Date).

 



43 ---|---|--- 

TEGP shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the New TEGP Class A
Shares to be approved for listing on the NYSE (subject, if applicable, to
notice of issuance) prior to the Effective Time.

 



     | Section 5.11 | _Termination of Trading and Deregistration of
Partnership Common Units_. 
---|---|--- 
 

The Partnership shall cooperate with TEGP, and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or
cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under
Applicable Law and rules of the NYSE to cause (a) the delisting of the
Partnership Common Units on the NYSE and the termination of trading of the
Partnership Common Units on the Closing Date and prior to the Effective Time
and (b) the deregistration of the Partnership Common Units under the Exchange

     | Section 5.12 | _Distributions_. 
---|---|--- 

(a) Until the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with _Article VII_ , TEGP will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the General Partner Board to declare and cause the
Partnership to pay regular quarterly cash distributions to holders of
Partnership Common Units (i) declared, set aside or paid, as applicable,
pursuant to the TEP Partnership Agreement, (ii) paid in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice or (iii) in accordance with any plan
or practice for the declaration, setting aside or payment of distributions

Units, as applicable, approved and declared on or prior to the Execution Date
by the TEGP Management Board or the General Partner Board, as applicable,
pursuant to the TEGP Partnership Agreement or the TEP Partnership Agreement,
as applicable, but that remain unpaid as of the Execution Date.

(c) From the Execution Date until the Effective Time, each of TEGP and the
Partnership shall coordinate with the other regarding the declaration of any
distributions in respect of TEGP Class A Shares and Partnership Common Units,
and the record dates and payment dates relating thereto. It is the intention
of the Parties that holders of Partnership Public Units shall not receive, for
any quarter, distributions in respect of both Partnership Public Units and New
TEGP Class A Shares that they receive upon conversion of such Partnership
Public Units in the Merger, but that instead they shall receive, for any such
quarter, either: (i) only distributions in respect of Partnership Public Units
or (ii) only distributions in respect of New TEGP Class A Shares that
they receive upon conversion of such Partnership Public Units in the Merger.



     | Section 5.13 | _Section_ __ _ 16 Matters_. 
---|---|--- 

Prior to the Effective Time, TEGP and the Partnership shall take all such
steps as may be necessary or appropriate to cause the Transactions, including
any dispositions of Partnership Common Units (including derivative securities
with respect to such Partnership Common Units) or acquisitions of shares of
TEGP Class A Shares (including derivative securities with respect to such TEGP
Class A Shares) resulting from the Transactions by each individual who is
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
with respect to TEGP or the Partnership, or will become subject to such
reporting requirements with respect to TEGP, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



44 ---|---|--- 

Prior to the Effective Time or termination of this Agreement in accordance
with _Article_ __ _ VII_, neither the General Partner Board nor any member of
the TEGP Group shall, without the consent of the Partnership Conflicts
Committee, eliminate the Partnership Conflicts Committee, or revoke or
diminish the authority of the Partnership Conflicts Committee, or remove or
cause the removal of any member of the General Partner Board that is a member
of the Partnership Conflicts Committee either as a member of such board or
such committee without the affirmative vote of the members of the General
Partner Board, including the affirmative vote of each of the other members of
the Partnership Conflicts Committee. For the avoidance of doubt, this 
_Section_ __ _ 5.14_ shall not apply to the filling in accordance with the
provisions of the General Partner LLC Agreement of any vacancies caused by the
death, incapacity or resignation of any director.

 



     | Section 5.15 | _Takeover Laws_. 
---|---|--- 

No Party shall take any action that would cause the Transactions to be
subject to requirements imposed by any Takeover Laws, and each Party shall
take all necessary steps within its control to exempt (or ensure the continued
exemption of) the Transactions from, or if necessary challenge the
validity or applicability of, any rights plan adopted by such Party or any
applicable Takeover Law, as now or hereafter in effect, including Takeover
Laws of any state that purport to apply to this Agreement or the Transactions.

 



     | Section 5.16 | _Indemnification and Insurance_. 
---|---|--- 

(a) TEGP and the Surviving Entity jointly and severally agree to indemnify
and hold harmless the Partnership Indemnified Parties from and against any and
all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, joint or several, expenses
(including legal fees and expenses), judgments, fines, penalties, interest,
settlements or other amounts arising from any and all threatened, pending or
completed claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, and whether formal or informal and
including appeals, relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
Transactions, in which any such Partnership Indemnified Party may be involved,
or is threatened to be involved, as a party or otherwise, by reason of
its status as a Partnership Indemnified Party and acting (or omitting or
refraining to act) in such capacity on behalf of or for the benefit of the
Partnership, and to advance to such Partnership Indemnified Party expenses
(including legal fees and expenses) incurred by such Partnership Indemnified
Party in connection therewith, in each case to the same extent provided in,
and in accordance with, the Organizational Documents of the Partnership and
the General Partner as of the Execution Date. 

(b) TEGP shall, and shall cause the members of the Partnership Group to,
honor all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses, elimination of
liability and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time (including the Transactions) now existing in
favor of the Partnership Indemnified Parties as 

 



45  provided in the Organizational Documents of any member of the Partnership
Group, under applicable Delaware Law or otherwise, and shall ensure that the
Organizational Documents of the Surviving Entity and the General Partner (or
their successor entities) shall, for a period of six years following the
Effective Time, contain provisions no less advantageous with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses, elimination of liability and
exculpation of their present and former directors, officers, employees and
agents than are set forth in the Organizational Documents of the Partnership
and the General Partner as of the Execution Date. This  _Section_ __ _
5.16(a)_ shall not be amended, repealed, terminated or otherwise modified at
any time in a manner that would adversely affect the rights of a Partnership
Indemnified Party as provided therein except with the prior written consent
of such Partnership Indemnified Party, and shall be enforceable by any
Partnership Indemnified Party and its heirs and representatives against TEGP
and its successors and assigns.

 

(c) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, TEGP shall maintain
officers and directors liability insurance with a nationally reputable
carrier covering each Partnership Indemnified Party who is or at any time
prior to the Effective Time was covered by the existing officers and
directors liability insurance applicable to the members of the Partnership
Group (" _D andO Insurance_"), on terms substantially no less advantageous to
the Partnership Indemnified Parties, as applicable, than such existing
insurance with respect to acts or omissions, or alleged acts or omissions,
prior to the Effective Time (whether claims, actions or other Actions relating
thereto are threatened, commenced, asserted or claimed before or after the
Effective Time); _provided_ , _however_ , that TEGP shall not be required to
pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance for the Partnership Indemnified
Parties in excess of 300% of the current annual premium currently paid by
members of the Partnership Group for such insurance, but shall purchase
as much of such coverage as possible for such applicable amount. TEGP shall
have the right to cause such coverage to be extended under the applicable DandO
Insurance by obtaining a six-year "tail" policy on terms and conditions no
less advantageous to the Partnership Indemnified Parties than the existing DandO
Insurance, and such "tail" policy shall satisfy the provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.16_.

 

(d) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.16_ shall survive the
consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions for a period of six
years and expressly are intended to benefit each of the Partnership
Indemnified Parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that any claim
or claims for indemnification or advancement set forth in this _Section_ __ _
5.16_ are asserted or made within such six-year period, all rights to
indemnification and advancement in respect of any such claim or claims shall
continue until disposition of all such claims. The rights of any Partnership
Indemnified Party under this _Section_ __ _ 5.16_ shall be in addition to any
other rights such Partnership Indemnified Party may have under the
Organizational Documents of any member of the Partnership Group or Applicable
Law.

(e) In the event TEGP or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then and in
either such case, TEGP shall cause proper provision to be made so that its
successors and assigns, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.16_.

 



46 ---|---|--- 
 

(a) On the trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date, the
Partnership shall issue and sell to Holdco, and Holdco shall purchase, the
number of Partnership Common Units equal to (i) 0.1%, multiplied by (ii) (A)
the number of Partnership Common Units held by TE as of the date of such

Holdco an amount of cash sufficient to permit Holdco to purchase each Pre-
Closing Common Unit at the Pre-Closing Common Unit Price.

Parties shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, take such
actions as are necessary or required to terminate in full all indemnification

avoidance of doubt, any rights to indemnification held by securityholders,
directors, officers and employees of any member of the Partnership Group or
the TEGP Group as a third party beneficiary, if any, without any liability,
obligation or additional cost to any Party, or their respective Affiliates,
with respect thereto following the Closing.

 

(c) Prior to or at the Closing, the General Partner and the Partnership
shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
resignation of each director of the General Partner, each of such resignations

partner of TEGP, and by the Partnership Conflicts Committee, on behalf of the
Partnership.



     | Section 7.2 | _Termination by_ _TEGP or the Partnership_. 
---|---|--- 

This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Effective Time by
(x) TEGP, if duly authorized by the TEGP Management Board on behalf of TEGP
Management in its

 



49  capacity as the general partner of TEGP, or (y) the Partnership, if duly
authorized by the Partnership Conflicts Committee on behalf of the
Partnership, if:

 

(a) _Termination Date_. The Effective Time shall not have occurred on or
before September 30, 2018 (the " _Termination Date_ "); _provided_ that the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)_
shall not be available (i) to TEGP if any member of the TEGP Group fails to
perform or observe in any material respect, or to the Partnership if the
Partnership fails to perform or observe in any material respect, any of their
respective obligations under this Agreement in any manner that shall have been
the principal cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Effective Time to
occur on or before such date, or (ii) to any Party if any other Party has
filed (and is then pursuing) an action seeking specific performance as
permitted by  _Section_ __ _ 8.4_;

(b) _Order of Governmental Authority_. A Governmental Authority
shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action
(including the enactment of any statute, rule, regulation, decree or executive
order) permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
Transactions and such order, decree, ruling or other action (including the
enactment of any statute, rule, regulation, decree or executive order) shall

_Section_ __ _ 5.6_ and  _Section_ __ _ 5.9_.

(c) _No Partnership Limited Partner Approval_. The Meeting shall
have concluded, a vote upon the approval of this Agreement and the
Transactions shall have been taken, and the Partnership Limited Partner
Approval shall not have been obtained, it being understood by the Partnership
that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
7.2(c)_ shall be available to TEGP even where the failure to obtain the
Partnership Limited Partner Approval is proximately caused by a withdrawal,
modification or qualification of the General Partner Recommendation, whether
or not permitted by this Agreement. __



     | Section 7.3 | _Termination by_ _the Partnership_. 
---|---|--- 

This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Effective Time by
the Partnership, if duly authorized by the Partnership Conflicts Committee on
behalf of the Partnership, if any of TEGP, TE, Merger Sub or the General
Partner shall have breached or failed to perform any of their respective
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement (or if any of their respective representations or warranties set
forth in this Agreement shall fail to be true), which breach or failure (i)
would (if it occurred or was continuing as of the Closing Date) give rise to
the failure of a condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.2(a)(i)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 6.2(a)(ii)_ (with or without the passage of time) and (ii) is
incapable of being cured, or is not cured, by the breaching Party prior to the
Termination Date; _provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ shall not be available to the
Partnership if, at such time, the condition set forth in _Section_ __ _
6.3(a)(i)_ or _Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)(ii)_ cannot be satisfied (with or without
the passage of time).

 



50 ---|---|--- 

This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Effective Time by
TEGP, if duly authorized by the TEGP Management Board on behalf of TEGP
Management in its capacity as the general partner of TEGP:

 

(a) _Partnership Adverse Recommendation Change_. If a Partnership Adverse
Recommendation Change shall have occurred and not been withdrawn; _provided_
that TEGP may only terminate the Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
7.4(a)_ prior to the conclusion of the Meeting at which a vote of the holders
of Partnership Common Units is taken in accordance with this Agreement.

(b) _Breach_. If the Partnership shall have breached or failed to perform
any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in
this Agreement (or if any of its representations or warranties set forth in
this Agreement shall fail to be true), which breach or failure (i) would (if
it occurred or was continuing as of the Closing Date) give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)(i)_ or _Section_ __
_ 6.3(a)(ii)_ (with or without the passage of time) and (ii) is incapable of
being cured, or is not cured, by the breaching Party prior to the Termination
Date; _provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 7.4(b)_ shall not be available to TEGP if, at such time, the
condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.2(a)(i)_ or _Section_ __ _
6.2(a)(ii)_ cannot be satisfied (with or without the passage of time).

 

(c) _Certain Breaches_. If the Partnership shall have materially breached
or materially failed to perform any of its covenants or agreements set forth
in _Section_ __ _ 5.4_ or _Section_ __ _ 5.5_.

 

(d) _TEGP Alternative Proposal_. If TEGP shall have received a TEGP
Alternative Proposal that the TEGP Management Board believes is bona fide
and, in connection therewith, the TEGP Management Board, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, shall have determined in good faith that the
failure to terminate this Agreement in order to pursue such TEGP Alternative
Proposal is reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its duties to the
holders of TEGP Class A Shares and TEGP Class B Shares under Applicable Law,
as modified by the TEGP Partnership Agreement.

 



     | Section 7.5 | _Effect of Certain Terminations_. 
---|---|--- 

In the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to this _Article VII_
, written notice thereof shall be given to each Party, specifying the
provision of this Agreement pursuant to which such termination is made, and
this Agreement, except for the provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 5.2(b)_,
_Section_ __ _ 5.7_, _Section_ __ _ 5.8_, this _Section_ __ _ 7.5_,
_Section_ __ _ 7.6_ and _Article VIII_ , shall forthwith become null and
void and there shall be no liability on the part of any Party and all rights
and obligations of the Parties under this Agreement shall terminate, except
for the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 5.2(b)_,  _Section_ __ _ 5.7_,
_Section_ __ _ 5.8_, this _Section_ __ _ 7.5_, _Section_ __ _ 7.6_ and
_Article VIII_ , shall survive such termination; _provided_ , _however_
, that nothing herein shall relieve any Party from any liability for any
intentional or willful and material breach by such Party of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, and all rights and remedies of a non-breaching Party under this
Agreement in the case of such intentional or willful and material breach, at
law or in equity, shall be preserved.

 



51 ---|---|--- 

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement:

(a) If this Agreement is terminated by TEGP pursuant to _Section_ __ _
7.4(a)_, then the Partnership shall reimburse to TE the TEGP Expense
Reimbursement Amount.

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by the Partnership pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 7.3_, then TE shall reimburse to the Partnership the
Partnership Expense Reimbursement Amount. If this Agreement is terminated by
TEGP pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 7.4(b)_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.4(c)_, then
the Partnership shall reimburse to TE the TEGP Expense Reimbursement Amount.

 

(c) If this Agreement is terminated by TEGP pursuant to _Section_ __ _
7.4(d)_, then TEGP shall pay to the Partnership an amount equal to the
Partnership Termination Fee.

(d) Except as otherwise provided herein, any payment or reimbursement
required to made pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.6_ shall be made by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by TE or an
account designated by the Partnership, as applicable, within one Business Day
after the occurrence of the event triggering such payment or reimbursement.

 

(e) The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section_
__ _ 7.6_ are an integral part of the Transactions, and that, without these
agreements, none of the Parties would enter into this Agreement. The Parties
acknowledge that the payment of the TEGP Expense Reimbursement Amount, the
Partnership Expense Reimbursement Amount or the Partnership Termination Fee,
as applicable, by a Party, if, as and when required pursuant to this Section
__ _ 7.6_, shall not constitute a penalty but shall be liquidated damages, in
a reasonable amount that will compensate the Party receiving such payment and
its Affiliates party hereto (collectively, the " _Payee_ ") in the
circumstances in which it is payable for the efforts and resources expended
and the opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in
reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
Merger, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 8.4_, the Parties agree that the
payment of the TEGP Expense Reimbursement Amount, the Partnership Expense
Reimbursement Amount or the Partnership Termination Fee, as applicable, by a
Party shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of the Payee in respect
of this Agreement and the Transactions, and the Party making such payment and
its Affiliates party hereto shall have no further liability to the Payee of
any kind in respect of this Agreement and the Transactions. The Parties
further agree that in no event shall TEGP be required to pay the Partnership
Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, this  _Section_ __ _ 7.6_ shall survive
any termination of this Agreement.

 



52 ---|---|--- 

None of the representations, warranties, agreements, covenants or obligations
in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement
shall survive the consummation of the Transactions, except for those covenants
and agreements contained herein that by their terms apply or are to
be performed in whole or in part after the Effective Time, including, for the
avoidance of doubt, _Section_ __ _ 5.16_.

55 ---|---|--- 

This Agreement shall be subject to and governed by the laws of the State of
Delaware, without regard to principles of conflicts of laws. Each Party agrees
that this Agreement involves at least $100,000 and that this Agreement has
been entered into in express reliance upon 6 Del. C. § 2708\. Each Party
irrevocably and unconditionally confirms and agrees that it is and shall
continue to be (i) subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of
Delaware and of the federal courts sitting in the State of Delaware, and (ii)
subject to service of process in the State of Delaware. Each Party hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally (A) consents and submits to the exclusive
personal jurisdiction and venue of the Delaware Court of Chancery (or, solely
if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over any
matter, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Superior Court of the State of
Delaware (Complex Commercial Division) or, if the subject matter jurisdiction
over any matter is vested exclusively in the federal courts of the United
States of America, the United States District Court for the District of
Delaware) and any appellate courts of any thereof (the "Delaware Courts") for
any actions, suits or proceedings arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the Transactions (and agrees not to commence any litigation
relating thereto except in such courts), (B) waives any objection to the
laying of venue of any such litigation in the Delaware Courts and agrees
not to plead or claim in any Delaware Court that such litigation brought
therein has been brought in any inconvenient forum, (C) acknowledges and
agrees that any controversy that may arise under this Agreement is likely to
involve complicated and difficult issues, and therefore each such Party
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right such Party may have to
a trial by jury in respect of any litigation directly or indirectly arising or
relating to this Agreement or the Transactions, and (D) agrees to service of
process upon such Party in any such action or proceeding shall be effective if
such process is given as a notice in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ or
in any manner prescribed by the Laws of the State of Delaware. Nothing in
this _Section_ __ _ 8.3_ shall affect the right of any Party to serve legal
process in any other manner permitted by Law.

 



     | Section 8.4 | _Specific Performance_ _; Remedies_. 
---|---|--- 

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the
Parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached and it is accordingly agreed that
the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, in each case, in accordance with  _Section_ __
_ 8.3_, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at law or in equity. Each of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief as
provided herein on the basis that (i) either party has an adequate remedy at
law or (ii) an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for
any reason at law or equity (it being understood that nothing in this
sentence shall prohibit the Parties from raising other defenses to a claim for
specific performance or other equitable relief under this Agreement). Each
Party further agrees that no Party shall be required to obtain, furnish or
post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to
obtaining any remedy referred to in this _Section_ __ _ 8.4(a)_, and each
Party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining,
furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.

 



56 (b) Without limiting the rights of the Parties under  _Section_ __ _
7.6_, the Parties agree that (i) no Party shall have any liability for
monetary damages for any breach of this Agreement, or any inaccuracy in any
representation or warranty made by such Party hereunder, except as provided
in _Section_ __ _ 7.6_, and (ii) (A) the enforcement of this Agreement in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.4(a)_ and (B) termination of this Agreement
in accordance with _Article VII_ and any receipt of any TEGP Expense
Reimbursement Amount, Partnership Expense Reimbursement Amount or Partnership
Termination Fee in connection therewith pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.6_ shall
be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Parties for a breach of this
Agreement or any inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made by a Party
hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section_ __ _
8.4(b)_ shall relieve any Party from any liability for any intentional or
willful and material breach by such Party of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement, and all
rights and remedies of a non-breaching Party under this Agreement in the case
of such intentional or willful and material breach, at law or in equity, shall
be preserved.

 



     | Section 8.5 | _Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers_. 
---|---|--- 

(a) This Agreement and the other Transaction Documents constitute the
entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. Each
Party agrees that no other Party (including its agents and representatives)
has made any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement to or with such
Party relating to this Agreement or the Transactions, other than those
expressly set forth herein and in the Transaction Documents.

(b) Subject to compliance with Applicable Law, prior to the Closing, any
provision of this Agreement may be (i) waived in writing by the Party
benefited by the provision and approved by the TEGP Management Board in the
case of TEGP and by the Partnership Conflicts Committee in the case of the
Partnership and executed in the same manner as this Agreement, or (ii) amended
or modified at any time, whether before or after the Partnership Limited
Partner Approval, by an agreement in writing between the Parties approved by
the TEGP Management Board in the case of TEGP and by the Partnership Conflicts
Committee in the case of the Partnership and executed in the same manner as
this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that after the Partnership Limited
Partner Approval, no amendment shall be made that requires further Partnership
Limited Partner Approval without such approval. No waiver of any provision of
this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any
other provision hereof (regardless of whether similar), nor shall any such
waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly provided.



     | Section 8.6 | _Conflicting Provisions_. 
---|---|--- 

This Agreement sets forth the Parties rights, responsibilities and
liabilities with respect to the Transactions. In this Agreement, specific
provisions prevail over general provisions.

 



57 ---|---|--- 

This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties
and their respective permitted successors and assigns, but neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, benefits or obligations hereunder shall be
assigned or transferred, by operation of law or otherwise. Nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any Person other
than the Parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any
rights, benefits or obligations hereunder, except for (a) the rights of
the holders of Partnership Common Units to receive the Merger Consideration
(as well as any distributions pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.4(c)_) after the
Closing and (b) the rights of third parties under  _Section_ __ _ 5.16_.



     | Section 8.8 | _Severability_.

If any provision of this Agreement is rendered or declared illegal or
unenforceable by reason of any existing or subsequently enacted legislation or
by decree of a court of last resort, the Parties shall promptly meet and
negotiate substitute provisions for those rendered or declared illegal
or unenforceable, but all of the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect, so long as the economic or legal substance of
the Transactions are not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
Party.

 



     | Section 8.9 | _Interpretation_. 
---|---|--- 

It is expressly agreed by the Parties that this Agreement shall not be
construed against any Party, and no consideration shall be given or
presumption made, on the basis of who drafted this Agreement or any provision
hereof or who supplied the form of this Agreement. Each Party agrees that it
has exercised business discretion in negotiating this Agreement and this
Agreement correctly reflects its understanding of the Transaction and,
therefore, waives the application of any Law or rule of construction providing
that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be construed against
the Party drafting such agreement or document.



     | Section 8.10 | _Headings and Disclosure Schedules_. 
---|---|--- 

The headings of the several Articles and Sections herein are inserted for
convenience of reference only and are not intended to be a part of or to
affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The Partnership
Disclosure Schedule, the TEGP Disclosure Schedule and the Exhibits referred
to herein are attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference, and unless
the context expressly requires otherwise, the Partnership Disclosure Schedule,
the TEGP Disclosure Schedule and such Exhibits are incorporated in the
definition of " _Agreement_."



     | Section 8.11 | _Multiple Counterparts_. 
---|---|--- 

This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one
and the same instrument. Signatures to this Agreement transmitted by facsimile
transmission, by electronic mail in "portable document format" (".pdf") form,
or by any other electronic means intended to preserve the original graphic and
pictorial appearance of a document, will have the same effect as physical
delivery of the paper document bearing the original signature.

 



58 ---|---|--- 

Any consent, approval, decision or waiver that is required to be given or
made, or that may be given or made, by the Partnership with respect to the
Transactions shall be given or made by the Partnership Conflicts Committee,

consent, approval, decision or waiver.



     | Section 8.13 | _Provision Respecting Legal Representation_. 
---|---|--- 

(a) It is acknowledged that Bracewell LLP has represented the Partnership
Conflicts Committee prior to Closing in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions, as well as prior transactions involving the Partnership. Each
Party, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Other Parties, irrevocably
acknowledges and agrees that all communications between the Partnership
Conflicts Committee and its counsel and information or documents subject to
attorney work-product protection made in connection with the negotiation,
preparation, execution and delivery of and closing under, or any claim,
dispute, proceeding or obligation arising under or in connection with this
Agreement, which, immediately prior to the Closing, would be deemed to be
a privileged communication or subject to attorney work-product protection and
would not be subject to disclosure to a Party or its Other Parties, shall
continue after the Closing to be a privileged communication between the
Partnership Conflicts Committee and its counsel or attorney work product, and
neither a Party, its Other Parties nor anyone acting or purporting to act on
behalf of or through them shall be entitled to use or seek to obtain the same
by any process on the grounds that the privilege attached to such
communication or attorney work-product belongs to the Party or its Other
Parties and not to the Partnership Conflicts Committee or its counsel. Any
access thereto by a Party or its Other Parties shall not waive or otherwise
affect the rights of the Partnership Conflicts Committee with respect to the
related privilege.

(b) It is acknowledged that Baker Botts L.L.P. has represented TEGP prior
to Closing in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions, as well as
prior transactions involving TEGP. Each Party, on its own behalf and on behalf
of its Other Parties, irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that all
communications between TEGP and its counsel and information or documents
subject to attorney work-product protection made in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of and closing under, or any
claim, dispute, proceeding or obligation arising under or in connection with
this Agreement, which, immediately prior to the Closing, would be deemed to be
a privileged communication or subject to attorney work-product protection and
would not be subject to disclosure to a Party or its Other Parties, shall
continue after the Closing to be a privileged communication between TEGP and
its counsel or attorney work product, and neither a Party, its Other Parties
nor anyone acting or purporting to act on behalf of or through them shall be
entitled to use or seek to obtain the same by any process on the grounds that
the privilege attached to such communication or attorney work-product belongs
to the Party or its Other Parties and not to TEGP or its counsel. Any access
thereto by a Party or its Other Parties shall not waive or otherwise affect
the rights of TEGP with respect to the related privilege.

 



59 ---|---|--- 

No past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member,
partner, stockholder, agent, attorney, representative or affiliate of any
Party or any of their respective Affiliates (unless such Affiliate is
expressly a Party) shall have any liability (whether in contract or in tort)
for any obligations or liabilities of such Party arising under, in connection
with or related to this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or
by reason of, the Transactions; provided, however, that nothing in this
_Section_ __ _ 8.14_ shall limit any liability of the Parties to this
Agreement for breaches of the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
