2\. Investor agrees that it shall, prior to the Share Acceptance, invest in

terminated orally or by course of conduct, but only by an instrument in
writing duly executed by both the Company and Investor. No waiver by the
Company of any default or any other event shall be effective unless in
writing, nor shall it operate as a waiver of any other default or of the same
default on a future occasion. No delay or omission by the Company in
exercising any of its rights, remedies, powers and privileges hereunder and no
course of dealing between the Company and Investor shall be deemed a waiver by
the Company of any of its rights, remedies, powers or privileges, even if
such delay or omission is continuous or repeated, nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege preclude any other
or further exercise thereof by the Company, or the exercise of any other
right, remedy, power or privilege by the Company.



5\. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the
Company and Investor and their respective successors and assigns. This
