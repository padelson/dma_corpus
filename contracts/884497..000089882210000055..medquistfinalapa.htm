Contract or Assumed Lease entered into prior to the Petition Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the Closing, Medquist may identify any
Assumed Contract or Assumed Lease as one that Medquist no longer desire to
have assigned to it or a Medquist Designee in accordance with _Section 2.9_.

###### (ii) At the Closing, the Sellers shall assume and assign
to Medquist and/or, as applicable, one or more Medquist Designees the Assumed

except as prohibited by applicable Law, Sellers shall be solely responsible
for the payment, performance and discharge when due of the Liabilities under
the Assumed Contracts and Assumed Leases arising prior to the Closing Date.

#### (b) Nothing herein shall be deemed to require the transfer,
assignment, conveyance or delivery of any Purchased Asset that by operation of
applicable Law cannot be transferred, assigned, conveyed, delivered or
assumed, including any Purchased Asset that cannot be transferred, assigned,
conveyed, delivered or assumed without a Consent that has not been obtained
(after giving effect to the Sale Order and the Bankruptcy Code).
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent that
the sale, transfer, assignment, conveyance or delivery or attempted sale,
transfer, assignment, conveyance or delivery to Medquist and/or, as
applicable, one or more Medquist Designees of any asset that would be a
Purchased Asset or any claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder or
resulting therefrom is prohibited by any applicable Law or would require any
Consent from any Governmental Authority or any other third party (after giving
effect to the Sale Order and the Bankruptcy Code) and such Consents shall not
have been obtained prior to the Closing, the Closing shall proceed without the
sale, transfer, assignment, conveyance or delivery of such asset unless there
is a failure of one or more of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ , in
which event the Closing shall proceed only if each failed condition is waived
by the Party entitled to the benefit thereof. In the event that any failed
condition is waived and the Closing proceeds without the transfer or
assignment of any such asset, then following the Closing, the Purchasers and
the Sellers shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts, and
cooperate with each other, to obtain promptly such Consent. Pending such
Consent, the Parties shall reasonably cooperate with each other in any
mutually agreeable arrangement designed to provide Purchasers and the
Purchaser Designees with all of the benefits of use of such asset, at the sole
cost and expense of Purchasers. Once Consent for the sale, transfer,
assignment, conveyance or delivery of any such asset not sold, transferred,
assigned, conveyed or delivered at the Closing is obtained, the Sellers shall
promptly transfer, assign, convey and deliver such asset to Medquist and/or,
as applicable, one or more Medquist Designees at no additional cost. To the
extent that any such asset cannot be transferred or the full benefits or use
of any such asset cannot be provided to Medquist and/or, as applicable, one or
more Medquist Designees following the Closing pursuant to this _Section
2.8(b)_ , then, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Purchaser and
the Sellers shall enter into such arrangements (including subleasing,
sublicensing or subcontracting) to provide to the Parties hereto the economic
(taking into account Tax costs and benefits) and operational equivalent, to
the extent permitted, of obtaining such Consent. The Sellers shall hold in
trust for, and pay to Medquist and/or, as applicable, one or more Medquist
Designees, promptly upon receipt thereof, all income, proceeds and other
monies received by the Sellers derived from its use of any asset that would be
a Purchased Asset in connection with the arrangements under this _Section
2.8(b)_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, nothing
in this Section 2.8 shall be deemed to require the Sellers to delay or
otherwise alter the completion of the Seller Chapter 11 Cases.

#### (c) If following the Closing, any Seller receives or
becomes aware that it holds any asset, property or right which constitutes a
Purchased Asset, then Sellers shall transfer such asset, property or right to
Medquist and/or, as applicable, one or more Medquist Designees as promptly as
practicable for no additional consideration.

#### (d) If following the Closing, Medquist receives or becomes
aware that it holds any asset, property or right which constitutes an Excluded
Asset, then Medquist shall transfer such asset, property or right to the
Sellers as promptly as practicable for no additional consideration.

   

## Section 2.9 _Additional and Eliminated Assumed Contracts_.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Medquist may, in
its sole and absolute discretion, amend or revise Schedule 1.2(a) and 1.2(b)
of the Purchaser Schedule setting forth the Assumed Contracts and the Assumed
Leases, respectively, in order to add or eliminate any Contract or Lease to
such Purchaser Schedule up to one (1) Business Day prior to the Closing Date
(the " _Designation Deadline_ ") and, for any particular Assumed Contract or
Assumed Lease that will be assumed in whole or in part by a Medquist Designee,
to identify such Medquist Designee; _provided_ , however, that the Sellers may
terminate or reject any Contract set forth on Schedule 2.9 to the Disclosure
Letter at any time whether prior to or after the Designation Deadline.
Automatically upon the addition of any Contract to Schedule 1.2(a) of the
Purchaser Schedule or Lease to Schedule 1.2(b) of the Purchaser Schedule, it
shall be an Assumed Contract or Assumed Lease, as applicable, for all purposes
of this Agreement, and all Cure Costs and Liabilities arising at and after the
Closing Date under such Contract shall be an Assumed Liability for all
purposes of this Agreement to the extent so provided herein. Automatically
upon the deletion of any Contract from Schedule 1.2(a) of the Purchaser
Schedule or deletion of any Lease from Schedule 1.2(b) of the Purchaser
Schedule, it shall be an Excluded Agreement for all purposes of this
Agreement. If Medquist indicates in writing to Sellers after the Closing Date
that it wishes to acquire a Contract or Lease of any Seller that was not an
Assumed Contract or Assumed Lease on the Closing Date, the Sellers will use
their commercially reasonable efforts to assign such Contract or Lease to
Medquist; _provided_ , _however_ , nothing herein shall be deemed or construed
to obligate the Sellers to retain, or refrain from rejecting or terminating
any Contract after the Designation Deadline that does not constitute an
Assumed Contract or Assumed Lease. With respect to each Assumed Contract,
Medquist and, as applicable, the Medquist Designees shall provide adequate
assurance of the future performance of such Assumed Contract by Medquist and,
as applicable, such Medquist Designees.

## Section 2.10 _Purchase Price Deposit_.

#### (a) Within one (1) Business Day of the execution of this
Agreement, Purchasers shall deposit into escrow an earnest money deposit (the
" _Purchase Price Deposit_ ") in the amount of $7,500,000 as security for the
performance of the Purchasers obligations under this Agreement. The Purchase
Price Deposit together with any interest thereon shall be applied against the
Purchase Price at Closing in accordance with the Deposit Escrow Agreement.
Except as set forth in _Section 2.10(b)_ , if this Agreement shall be
terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1_ , the Purchase Price Deposit, together
with any interest earned thereon, shall be delivered to the Purchasers no
later than one Business Day after such termination.

#### (b) If this Agreement is terminated by Sellers pursuant to
_Section 8.1(d)_ or _Section 8.1(k)_ , the Purchase Price Deposit, and all
interest thereon, shall be delivered to the Sellers in accordance with the
terms of the Deposit Escrow Agreement.

entitle any person to subscribe to or receive in the present or future, or
which require or may require Spheris India to, issue any stocks of Spheris
India or grant rights to purchase or acquire any stocks of Spheris India or
convertible into or exchangeable for stocks or other securities of Spheris
India. Spheris Holdings III, Inc. does not own any material assets other than

Subject to the entry of the Sale Order, the execution, delivery and
performance by each Seller of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Transaction have been duly and validly authorized by all requisite corporate

due authorization, execution and delivery by all parties hereto and thereto,
other than the Sellers) constitute (or will constitute) valid and binding
obligations of each Seller enforceable against each Seller in accordance with
its terms (subject, in the case of the obligation to carry out the
Transaction, to the entry of the Sale Order).

result in the breach of any provision of the organizational documents of any
Spheris Entity, (ii) conflict with, violate or result in the breach by any

case of the assumption and assignment to Medquist or any Medquist Designee of
any Assumed Contract or Assumed Lease or Permit that by its terms requires
consent to assignment, to the entry of the Sale Order and the terms and
conditions of this Agreement), or (v) result in any Encumbrance on any of the
Purchased Assets or Spheris India Capital Stock (other than a Permitted
Encumbrance); other than, in the case of the foregoing subclauses (iv) and

have a Material Adverse Effect.

 

#### (d) As of the date of this Agreement, there is not pending
or, to the Knowledge of the Sellers, threatened, an Action against a Spheris
Entity that individually or in the aggregate would constitute a Material
Adverse Effect.

#### (e) Other than (i) the Purchasers, (ii) pursuant to any
bids made by any Person in connection with the Auction, or (iii) prior to the

real property or occupies any real property other than the Leased Real
Property, except in accordance with the agreements set forth on Schedule

leasehold interest in, the material tangible personal property constituting
Purchased Assets in each case free and clear of Encumbrances other than

#### (g) The Books and Records have been maintained in material
compliance with applicable Law and accounting requirements and fairly reflect,
in all material respects, all dealings and transactions in respect of the
Purchased Assets, the Spheris India Capital Stock and the Assumed Liabilities.
Copies of the Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association of Spheris
India as made available to the Purchasers and filed with the Registrar of
Companies are true and complete copies, and Spheris India has at all times
acted in material compliance therewith. Spheris India has made all statutory

consistent basis and (iii) contain accurate records of all matters required to
be dealt with in such books and records.

#### (h) Attached as Schedule 4.1(h) of the Disclosure Letter is

material respects with their terms and conditions, all required renewal
applications have been timely filed, no notice has been received by a
Governmental Authority to revoke any material Permit and no proceeding is

#### (i) Since January 1, 2008, the Spheris Entities have been
in compliance with all applicable Laws except for such non-compliance that
would not have a Material Adverse Effect. As of the date of this Agreement,
no Spheris Entity has received a notice of any investigation or review by any
Governmental Authority with respect to the Leased Real Property that is
pending, or, to the Knowledge of the Sellers, threatened.

#### (j) Schedule 4.1(j)(i) of the Disclosure Letter sets
forth a complete and accurate list of all customer Contracts which the Company
has reasonably estimated to account for 2009 sales revenue in excess of
$1,000,000 (with the name of the customer redacted) and material Contracts
other than customer Contracts. Schedule 4.1(j)(ii) of the Disclosure Letter
sets forth a complete and accurate list of all material Leases (the Contracts
and Leases described in this sentence and the immediately preceding sentence
together, the " _Scheduled Agreements_ "). The Scheduled Agreements are
reasonably estimated to account at least 60% of Sellers aggregate 2009 sales
revenue. Since January 1, 2008, (1) there has not been any claim or
allegation by any Person that any Spheris Entity is in material breach or
default under any Scheduled Agreements or that there exists an event or
condition which (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) would result
in a material breach or default by any Spheris Entity under any Scheduled
Agreements and (2) to the Knowledge of the Sellers, no other party to any
Scheduled Agreement is in material breach or default thereunder. As of the
date hereof, no party to a Scheduled Agreement has provided any Spheris Entity
with written notice (or, to the Knowledge of the Sellers, notice) that it
intends to cancel, terminate, fail to renew or reduce business conducted under
any Scheduled Agreement. Each of the Scheduled Agreements is in full force
and effect and is valid and binding on the Spheris Entity party thereto and,
to the Knowledge of Sellers, each other party thereto. The Sellers have made
available to the Purchasers complete and accurate copies of each Scheduled
Agreement other than any such Scheduled Agreement with a customer of any
Seller and shall, promptly after determination of which bidders constitute
Qualified Bidders (as defined

   

in the Sale Procedures Order) and in no event later than the first day
following the completion of the Auction, make available to the Purchasers all
material Contracts of the Sellers with, in the case of any Contract with a
customer of any Seller, the customer name (and other information that could
identify the customer) and pricing redacted therefrom. There is no material
Contract with a third party with both Spheris India and a Seller as parties
thereto. With respect to each Scheduled Agreement with a customer of any
Seller: (I) all services performed outside of the United States for such
customer are so performed not in violation of the terms of such Scheduled
Agreement or otherwise with such customers written consent, (II) all services
for which a customer is charged a rate applicable to services provided in the
United States are actually performed in the United States, (III) all customer
billing is based upon units of measure that are visually verifiable by the
customer and is otherwise consistent with the applicable Scheduled Agreement
and (IV) there is no prohibition in any such Contract regarding subcontracting
services to be performed outside of the United States. A true and correct
copy of the monthly summary financial metrics report reflecting Volume
Reductions and Rate Reductions as of January 18, 2010 has been made available
to Purchasers on or prior to the date of this Agreement.

 

(k) Upon consummation of the Transaction, the Sellers and
Spheris India shall have incurred no Liability for brokerage or finders fees
or agents commissions or other similar payment in connection with the
Transaction (a " _Seller Broker Fee_ "). None of the Purchasers nor any
Affiliate of a Purchaser will have any Liability in connection with any Seller
Broker Fee.

 

#### (l) The use by the Spheris Entities of the Leased Real
Property is in material compliance with all Environmental Laws. To the
Knowledge of the Sellers, the Leased Real Property is in compliance with
Environmental Laws, including any Environmental Permits, except for such non-
compliance that individually or in the aggregate would not constitute a
Material Adverse Effect. As of the date of this Agreement, (i) no Spheris
Entity is subject to any pending or, to the Sellers Knowledge, threatened
Action alleging that a Spheris Entity may be in violation of any Environmental
Law or Environmental Permit, or may have any Liability under any Environmental
Law; and (ii) no Spheris Entity has stored, treated, disposed of, arranged for
disposal or treatment of, transported, handled, manufactured, distributed, or
released any Hazardous Substance on, under or from the Leased Real Property,
except in material compliance with Environmental Laws.

#### (m) As of the date of this Agreement, no Spheris Entity has
received any written notice of any, and, to the Knowledge of the Sellers,
there is no threatened or pending, eminent domain, condemnation or rezoning
proceedings, or any sale or other disposition in lieu of eminent domain or
condemnation, with respect to the Leased Real Property or any part of the
Leased Real Property or for the relocation of roadways or streets providing
access to or egress from the Leased Real Property.

#### (n) The Spheris Entities have valid title to, or the right
to use in connection with their business as presently conducted, all of the
Purchased Intellectual Property. To the Knowledge of the Sellers, all current
and former employees of the Spheris Entities have assigned to the Spheris
Entities all Purchased Intellectual Property that such employees have created
while in the scope of their employment, including copyrights in works made for
hire and patents. Schedule 4.1(n) of the Disclosure Letter lists each
registered Purchased Intellectual Property and each material

  #### Contract with respect to Purchased Intellectual Property pursuant to
which the Spheris Entities have granted any Person the right to reproduce,
distribute, market or exploit such Intellectual Property Rights. There is no
Action pending, or to the Knowledge of the Sellers, threatened that challenges
the validity of ownership or use of any Purchased Intellectual Property, and
there exists no state of facts and circumstances that would result in any such
challenge that is material to the business of the Sellers being successful or
which would be reasonably likely to result in a material liability or
otherwise have a Material Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of the Sellers, no
third partys operations or products infringe on the Purchased Intellectual
Property in any material respect. To the Knowledge of the Sellers, the
operation of the business of the Spheris Entities does not infringe in any
material respect on the Intellectual Property Rights of any other Person. No
Spheris Entity has received during the two-year period preceding the date of
this Agreement, any written claim of infringement with respect to any
Purchased Intellectual Property. Other than the Software License Agreement
executed by Spheris India with Spheris Inc. dated January 1, 2000 and Spheris
Indias permission to use the SPHERIS trademark, Spheris India does not have
or own any rights to any Intellectual Property Rights.

#### (o) Schedule 4.1(o) of the Disclosure Letter sets forth a
complete list of all material insurance policies with respect to which a
Spheris Entity or Spheris Holding III is a party, a named insured or otherwise
the beneficiary of coverage with respect to any of the Purchased Assets or the
Assumed Liabilities. The assets of each Spheris Entity have been insured
against risks normally covered by insurance policies by companies carrying on
business of a similar nature as each of the Spheris Entities. There is no
material claim by a Spheris Entity or Spheris Holding III pending under any
such policies which has been denied or disputed by the insurer. To the
Knowledge of the Sellers, all such insurance policies are in full force and
effect, all premiums due and payable thereon have been paid, all material
terms and conditions of such policies have been complied with, and no written
notice of cancellation or termination has been received by the Spheris
Entities or Spheris Holding III with respect to any such policy which is not
replaceable by the Spheris Entities or Spheris Holding III on substantially
similar terms prior to the date of such cancellation.

#### (p) (i) All material Tax Returns required to be filed by
each Seller or any of its Affiliates with respect to the Purchased Assets,
Spheris India or the Assumed Liabilities have been timely filed (taking into
account extensions) and (ii) all such Tax Returns were correct and complete in
all material respects and (iii) all Taxes shown as due on such Tax Returns
have been paid. During the last three years, no claim has been made by any
taxing authority in a jurisdiction where a Seller or any of its Affiliates do
not file Tax Returns that such Seller or any of its Affiliates is or may be
subject to taxation by that jurisdiction with respect to the Purchased Assets
or the Assumed Liabilities. Each Seller and its Affiliates and Spheris India
have withheld and paid to the relevant taxing authority, in all material

India or (c) with respect to actions occurring after the date of this
Agreement and prior to the Closing, in compliance with _Section 5.1(n)_.
There is no employee stock option scheme or plan or other arrangement under
which Spheris India has issued or shall be required to issue any shares or
securities to any employee.

#### (bb) There is no term of employment for any employee of Spheris
India which provides that a change of control shall entitle the employee to
treat the change of control or management as amounting to a breach of the
contract or entitling him to any payment or benefit whatsoever or entitling
him to treat himself as redundant or otherwise dismissed or released from any
obligation. As of the date of this Agreement, no employee of Spheris India
has given written termination or written notice to Spheris India of his or her

## Section 5.9 _Publicity_. Except as required by applicable Law
(including any Order by the Bankruptcy Court) or filings by the Sellers with,

reasonably practicable, shall not issue any press release, provide any notice
to customers or suppliers, or make any public announcement concerning this

attorneys, investors, parents, predecessors, subsidiaries, successors,
assigns, and affiliates, each of the foregoing in their capacity as such

## Section 5.11 _Certain Matters Relating to North American Employees_.

#### (a) At least five (5) days prior to the Closing Date,
Medquist and/or, as applicable, one or more Medquist Designees will offer
employment to the Sellers current, active employees who are employed in the
United States or Canada as of immediately prior to the Closing Date

  #### (each, a " _North American Employee_ ," and together, the " _North
American Employees_ "), except as set forth on Schedule 5.11(a) of the
Purchaser Schedule, which offers shall be effective as of the Closing Date.
For the avoidance of doubt, active employees shall exclude persons receiving
disability benefits as of the date on which such offers of employment are
made. Each such offer of employment shall provide for a place of employment
which is not a materially greater commuting distance from the applicable North
American Employees residence as of the Closing Date and shall be (i) subject
to such compensation and other terms of employment as Medquist shall determine
in its sole discretion and (ii) contingent on such North American Employees
waiver of any claims to termination payments against the Sellers bankruptcy
estate. Each such North American Employee who accepts an offer of employment
from Medquist or a Medquist Designee and is hired by Medquist or a Medquist
Designee is referred to herein as a " _North American Transferred Employee_."

#### (b) Notwithstanding _Section 5.11(a)_ , nothing herein
expressed or implied shall confer upon any of the North American Employees of
any Seller or any North American Transferred Employees any right to employment
or continued employment for any specified period, of any nature or kind
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

#### (c) Neither Medquist, nor any Medquist Designee nor any
Affiliate of Medquist shall have any Liability whatsoever for (i) any
compensation or other obligations purported to be owing to any North American
Employee by any Seller, including any severance, separation pay, change of
control payments or benefits, retention payments or any other payments or
benefits arising in connection with the termination of such North American
Employees employment by any Seller before, on or after the Closing Date, or
(ii) any Action under WARN by any past or present employee of any Seller or
Affiliate thereof (whether or not a North American Transferred Employee) in
connection with Sellers conduct, including any plant closing or mass layoff.
As soon as reasonably practicable following Medquists request, Sellers shall
reasonably provide Medquist with such information as is necessary to determine
whether any actions taken by Sellers or their applicable Affiliates prior to
the Closing Date will, if aggregated with actions that may be taken by
Medquist or its Affiliates after the Closing Date, require the provision of
notice or payment in lieu of notice (whether under WARN or otherwise) to any
North American Employees or North American Transferred Employees.

#### (d) Effective upon the Closing Date, each of the Sellers
hereby waives, for the benefit of Medquist and its Affiliates, any and all
restrictions in any U.S. Benefit Plan, Foreign Benefit Plan or Contract
relating to (i) non-competition with any Spheris Entity or (ii) maintenance of
confidentiality of any information for the benefit of any Spheris Entity, in
each case, with or covering any North American Transferred Employee.

#### (e) For purposes of annual vacation entitlement under
Medquists vacation plans and policies, and subject to the terms of such
vacation plans and policies, each North American Transferred Employee shall be
credited with his or her years of service with the Sellers before the Closing
Date, to the same extent as such North American Transferred Employee was
entitled, before the Closing Date, to such service credit, and the North
American Transferred Employees shall be treated no less favorably than
similarly situated Medquist employees for purposes of scheduling and use of
vacation days. For the avoidance of doubt, North American Transferred
Employees shall not be entitled to carry over any accrued, unused vacation
time or paid time off

  #### from employment in respect of service periods occurring prior to the
Closing Date. In addition, Medquist shall grant all North American
Transferred Employees credit after the Closing Date for all service with any
of the Sellers for purposes of participation and vesting under any employee
benefit or compensation plans, programs, agreements or arrangements maintained
by Medquist or any of its Affiliates for the benefit of such North American
Transferred Employees (the " _Purchaser Benefit Plans_ "); _provided_ that the
foregoing shall not apply (i) with respect to benefit accrual under any
defined benefit pension plan, (ii) for purposes of any Purchaser Benefit Plan
under which similarly-situated employees of Medquist and its Affiliates do not
receive credit for prior service, (iii) for purposes of any Purchaser Benefit
Plan that is grandfathered or frozen, either with respect to level of benefits
or participation, (iv) for purposes of level of severance payments or benefits
under any Purchaser Benefit Plan or (v) to the extent that its application
would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of
service.

#### (f) Subject to applicable Laws, the Sellers shall
cooperate with Medquist and shall permit Medquist and/or, as applicable, one
or more Medquist Designees a reasonable period during normal business hours
prior to the Closing Date, (i) to meet with North American Employees at such
times as Medquist or a Medquist Designee shall reasonably request, (ii) to
speak with such North American Employees managers and supervisors (in each
case with appropriate authorizations and releases from such North American
Employees) who are being considered for employment by Medquist or a Medquist
Designee, (iii) to distribute to such North American Employees such forms and
other documents relating to potential employment by Medquist or a Medquist
Designee after the Closing, and (iv) subject to any restrictions imposed under
applicable Law, to permit Medquist, upon request, to review personnel files
and other relevant employment information regarding such North American
Employees.

#### (g) Following the Closing, the Sellers and Medquist shall
cooperate reasonably with each other to provide an orderly administrative
transition to Medquist and/or, as applicable, one or more Medquist Designees
of the North American Transferred Employees, including the provision by the
Sellers to Medquist of all necessary or appropriate documents, records,
materials, accounting files and Tax information with respect to each North
American Transferred Employee.

#### (h) Following the Closing, the Sellers shall retain all
Liability to provide health care continuation coverage under Section 4980B of
the Code and Section 601 of ERISA for all MandA Qualified Beneficiaries (as that
term is defined in Treasury Regulations Section 54.4980B-9, QandA-4) so that
neither Medquist nor any of its Affiliates is required by applicable Law to
provide COBRA continuation coverage to any of such MandA Qualified
Beneficiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section
5.11(h)_ shall prevent Sellers from terminating any U.S. Benefit Plan
following the Closing.

#### (i) For the avoidance of doubt, Sellers will not seek to
recover from any Transferred North American Employee any retention payments
previously paid to any such Transferred North American Employee.

   

## Section 5.12 _Non-Solicitation_.

#### (a) Prior to the Closing, and other than as contemplated
by this Agreement (including without limitation _Section 5.11_ ) or consented
to by Sellers, Purchasers shall not (i) directly or indirectly solicit,
encourage or attempt to solicit or encourage any of the employees, agents,
independent contractors, consultants or representatives of any Spheris Entity
to terminate his, her or its relationship with such Spheris Entity prior to
the Closing Date, or (ii) directly or indirectly solicit, encourage or attempt
to solicit or encourage any of the employees or consultants of a Spheris
Entity to become employees or consultants of any other Person; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that this _Section 5.12(a)_ shall not prohibit a solicitation for
employment in a general solicitation that is not specifically directed at
employees of any Spheris Entity, or any solicitation of any individual whose
employment by any Spheris Entity has ceased for any reason other than as a
result of a breach of the covenant contained in this _Section 5.12_.

#### (b) Purchasers shall not (i) directly or indirectly solicit
or attempt to solicit any customer, vendor or distributor of a Spheris Entity
with respect to any product or service being furnished, made, sold or leased
by such Spheris Entity, other than in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice, or (ii) persuade or seek to persuade any
customer of a Spheris Entity to cease to do business or to reduce the amount
of business that such customer has customarily done with the Spheris Entities,
or contemplates doing with Spheris Entities, in either case, in violation of
applicable Law (including antitrust or anti-competition Law) or in breach of
the Confidentiality Agreement.

## Section 5.13 _Lease Deposits_.

 (a) Medquist shall use its best efforts to cause the landlord under each Assumed Lease to return to Sellers, at or prior to Closing, any and all amounts held as a security deposit under each such Assumed Lease (such amounts, collectively, the " _Lease Security Deposits_ "), including by depositing any amount with such landlord or securing a letter of credit or similar commitment for the benefit of such landlord, as required or contemplated by such Assumed Lease as a security deposit.

####

#### (b) Medquist shall pay Sellers at Closing by wire transfer
of immediately available funds, in addition to the consideration required
pursuant to _Section 2.5_ , an amount in cash equal to the Purchased Lease
Security Deposits (such payments, the " _Security Deposit Payments_ ").

## Section 5.14 _Financing and Cooperation_.

 

(a) Purchasers shall use their reasonable best efforts to
obtain debt financing on terms acceptable to Purchasers in their sole
discretion in an amount sufficient to enable Purchasers to pay the Purchase

commitment letter or other binding agreement to provide the Financing (a "
_Commitment Letter_ "), the Purchasers shall promptly (and in any event within
two (2) Business Days after execution of such Commitment Letter) provide a
copy of the Commitment Letter to the Sellers. In the event that a Commitment
Letter is executed, the Purchasers shall use their reasonable best efforts to

Commitment Letter, including by using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain
in effect the Commitment Letter

terms not materially less favorable, in the aggregate, to the Purchasers,

not amend or modify the terms of the Commitment Letter in any manner that

Purchasers in the Commitment Letter and (v) satisfy on a timely basis all

Agreement and ending on the earlier of (i) the termination of this Agreement

in the ordinary course of business; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Sellers
shall only be obligated to furnish such information to sources of Financing
who have executed a confidentiality agreement with the Sellers in a form and
in substance reasonably satisfactory to the Sellers, and (v) facilitating the
pledging of collateral and using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
surveys and title insurance as reasonably requested by Purchasers in order to

#### (e) The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained
in this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated in
this Agreement, that the damages resulting from termination of this Agreement
under circumstances where Sellers are entitled to the Purchase Price Deposit
and the Purchaser Termination Fee are uncertain and incapable of accurate
calculation and that the delivery of the Purchase Price Deposit and the
Purchaser Termination Fee to Sellers is not a penalty but rather shall
constitute liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate
Sellers in the circumstances where Sellers are entitled to the Purchase Price
Deposit and the Purchaser Termination Fee for the efforts and resources
expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in
reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
Transactions contemplated hereby, and that, without these agreements, Sellers
would not enter into this Agreement. If the Purchasers fail to take any
action necessary to cause the delivery of the Purchase Price Deposit and the
Purchaser Termination Fee pursuant to the Deposit Escrow Agreement under
circumstances where Sellers are entitled to the Purchase Price Deposit and the
Purchaser Termination Fee and, in order to obtain such Purchase Price Deposit
and the Purchaser Termination Fee Sellers commence a suit which results in a
judgment in favor of Sellers, the Purchasers shall pay to the Sellers an
amount in cash equal to the costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees) incurred by Sellers in connection with such suit.

#### (f) The Parties further acknowledge that the damages
resulting from termination of this Agreement under circumstances where
Purchasers are entitled to the Breakup Fee are uncertain and incapable of
accurate calculation and that the delivery of the Breakup Fee to Purchasers is
not a penalty but rather shall constitute liquidated damages in a reasonable
amount that will compensate Purchasers in the circumstances where Purchasers
are entitled to the Breakup Fee for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Transactions
contemplated hereby, and that, without these agreements, Purchasers would not
enter into this Agreement. If the Sellers fail to take any action necessary
to cause the delivery of

  the Breakup Fee under circumstances where Purchasers are entitled to the
Breakup Fee and, in order to obtain such Breakup Fee Purchasers commence a
suit which results in a judgment in favor of Purchasers, the Sellers shall pay
to the Purchasers an amount in cash equal to the costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by Purchasers in connection with such
suit.
