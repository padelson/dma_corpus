THE MERGER



SECTION 1.01 _The Merger_. Upon the terms of this Agreement and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL,
at the Effective Time (as defined below), as part of a single integrated plan,
Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, and as soon as
practicable thereafter, the Company shall be merged with and into Parent. As a
result of the Reverse Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub
shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation of
the Reverse Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and as a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent. As a result of the Second-Step Merger, the separate
corporate existence of the Company shall cease, and Parent shall continue as
the surviving corporation.



SECTION 1.02  _Effective Time; Closing_. As promptly as practicable and in no
event later than the second business day following the satisfaction or, if
permissible, waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII (or such other
date as may be agreed in writing by each of the parties hereto), the parties
hereto shall cause (a) the Reverse Merger to be consummated by filing a
certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware in such form as is required by, and executed
in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL and (b) the Second-
Step Merger to be consummated by making all filings and recordings required
under the DGCL. The term " _Effective Time_ " means the date and time of the
filing with, and the acceptance by, the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware of the Certificate of Merger (or such later time as may be agreed in
writing by each of the parties hereto and specified in the Certificate of
Merger). Immediately prior to the filing of the Certificate of Merger, a
closing (the " _Closing_ ") will be held at the offices of Gunderson Dettmer
Stough Villeneuve Franklin and Hachigian, LLP (" _Gunderson Dettmer_ "), 155
Constitution Drive, Menlo Park, California 94025 (or such other place as the
parties hereto may agree). The date on which the Closing shall occur is
referred to herein as the " _Closing Date_."



SECTION 1.03 _Effect of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the
effect of the Reverse Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions
of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject
thereto, at the Effective Time, all the properties, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of each of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the
Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions,
disabilities and duties of each of the Company and Merger Sub shall become
the debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of
the Surviving Corporation, and, following the Second-Step Merger, all the
properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Surviving
Corporation shall vest in Parent, and all debts, liabilities, obligations,
restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation shall
become the debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and
duties of Parent.



SECTION 1.04 _Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws_.



(a) At the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company as
the Surviving Corporation shall be amended to read the same as the Certificate
of Incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, except for such changes as may be determined by Parent and except that
Article I of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation,
instead of reading the same as Article I of the Certificate of Incorporation
of Merger Sub, shall read as follows: "The name of this corporation is
FreeMarkets, Inc.," or such other name as determined by Parent, and following
the Second-Step Merger, the Certificate of Incorporation of Parent shall be
the Certificate of Incorporation of the surviving corporation of the Second-
Step Merger.



 

2 (b) At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of Merger Sub shall be the Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation (except that all references to Merger Sub in the Bylaws
of the Surviving Corporation shall be changed to refer to such name as is set
forth in the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation), and
following the Second-Step Merger, the Bylaws of Parent shall be the Bylaws of
the surviving corporation of the Second-Step Merger.



SECTION 1.05 _Directors and Officers_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the
Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate
of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, and the officers of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of
the Surviving Corporation, in each case until their respective successors are
duly elected or appointed and qualified. The directors of Parent immediately
prior to the Second-Step Merger shall be the initial directors of the
surviving corporation of the Second-Step Merger, together with those
directors appointed pursuant to Section 6.17 hereof, each to hold office in
accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the surviving
corporation of the Second-Step Merger, and the officers of Parent immediately
prior to the Second-Step Merger shall be the initial officers of the surviving
corporation of the Second-Step Merger, together with those officers appointed
pursuant to Section 6.18 hereof, in each case until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.



ARTICLE II 



CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES 



SECTION 2.01 _Conversion of Securities_.

 



(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any of the
following securities:



(i) Each share of common stock of the Company, par value $0.01 per share (the
" _Company Common Stock_ "), (all issued and outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock being hereinafter collectively referred to as the " _Shares_ "),
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any
Shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.01(a)(ii) and any Dissenting
Shares (as defined in Section 2.06)) shall be converted, subject to Section
2.02(e), into the right to receive (x) 2.25 Parent Common Shares (the "
_Exchange Ratio_ ") and (y) $2.00 in cash (the " _Per Share Cash
Consideration_ ") (collectively, the number of Parent Common Shares equal to
the Exchange Ratio and the Per Share Cash Consideration are referred to herein
as the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, each
such Share shall cease to be outstanding and cease to exist and each holder of
Shares shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares,
except the right to receive, without interest, Parent Common Shares and cash
in accordance with this Section 2.01(a)(i) and cash for fractional Parent
Common Shares in accordance with Section 2.02(e).



(ii) Each Share held in the treasury of the Company and each Share owned by
Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and
extinguished without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution
shall be made with respect thereto.



(iii) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub, par value $0.001 per share,
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and exchanged for one duly authorized, validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of
the Surviving Corporation.



(b)



(i) If between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding Parent Common Shares shall have been changed into a different
number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock dividend,
subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or
exchange of shares  



 

3  or any similar event, the Exchange Ratio shall be correspondingly adjusted
to the extent appropriate to reflect such stock dividend,
subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or
exchange of shares or similar event.



(ii) If between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination
or exchange of shares or any similar event, the Exchange Ratio and the Per
Share Cash Consideration shall be correspondingly adjusted to the extent
appropriate to reflect such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares or similar event.



(c) If any Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time are
unvested or are subject to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other
condition under any applicable restricted stock purchase agreement or other
agreement with the Company (each such share a " _Restricted Company Share_
"), then (i) the cash and Parent Common Shares issued in exchange for such
shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Restricted Parent Shares_ ") will also
be unvested and/or subject to the same repurchase option, risk of forfeiture
or other condition, (ii) the certificates representing such Restricted Parent
Shares may accordingly be marked with appropriate legends and (iii) the
Company shall take all action that may be necessary to ensure that, from and
after the Effective Time, Parent is entitled to exercise any such repurchase
option or other right set forth in any such restricted stock purchase
agreement or other agreement; provided that the repurchase price for each
Restricted Parent Share shall equal the repurchase price for the Restricted
Company Share divided by the Exchange Ratio. Cash and certificates
representing the Restricted Parent Shares shall be held by Parent until such
shares and cash are no longer subject to repurchase or forfeiture. Cash
dividends on Restricted Parent Shares will be distributed to the holder of
such Restricted Parent Shares on whose behalf the Restricted Parent Shares are
being held by Parent. Any Parent Common Shares or other equity
securities issued or distributed by Parent, including shares issued upon a
stock dividend or split, in respect of Restricted Parent Shares (which remain
restricted at the time of such distribution) will be subject to the same
restrictions and other terms as the Restricted Parent Share with respect to
which the distribution is made. Each holder of Restricted Parent Shares will
have voting rights with respect to Restricted Parent Shares (and other voting
securities) held by Parent on its behalf. 



SECTION 2.02 _Exchange of Certificates_.



(a) _Exchange Agent_. Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent shall
enter into an agreement (reasonably satisfactory to the Company) with
EquiServe, or such other bank or trust company of recognized standing that may
be designated by Parent and is reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the "
_Exchange Agent_ "). Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for the
benefit of the holders of Shares, for exchange in accordance with this Article
II through the Exchange Agent, (i) certificates representing the number of
Parent Common Shares issuable pursuant to Section 2.01 and (ii) the amount of
cash payable pursuant to Section 2.01 as of the Effective Time and cash from
time to time as required to make payments in lieu of any fractional shares
pursuant to Section 2.02(e) (such cash and certificates for Parent Common
Shares, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto and
together with such cash as may be required to make payments in lieu of any
fractional shares, being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").
The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver (x)
the Parent Common Shares and cash contemplated to be issued pursuant to
Section 2.01 and (y) such cash as may be required to make payments in lieu of
any fractional shares out of the Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated by
Section 2.02(f) hereof, the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other
purpose.



(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time (and in no event later than two business days after the Effective Time),
Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding Shares (the _"Certificates_ ") (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall be in customary form and shall  



 

4  specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to
the Exchange Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of the Certificates in exchange for cash and certificates representing Parent
Common Shares (each as pursuant to Section 2.01) and cash in lieu of any
fractional shares. Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate for
cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and
completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
(x) that amount of cash and a certificate representing that number of whole
Parent Common Shares that such holder has the right to receive in respect of
the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate (after taking into account
all Shares then held by such holder) pursuant to Section 2.01 and (y) cash in
lieu of any fractional Parent Common Shares to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 2.02(e) and any dividends or other distributions to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(c), and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, the amount of cash and a certificate representing the number of
Parent Common Shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.01, cash in lieu of any fractional Parent Common Shares to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e) and any dividends or other
distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(c) may
be issued to a transferee if the Certificate representing such Shares is
presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence satisfactory to the
Surviving Corporation that any applicable share transfer taxes have been paid.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02, each Certificate
(other than Certificates representing Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed at
all times after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender that amount of cash and a certificate representing that number
of Parent Common Shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.01, cash in lieu of any fractional Parent Common Shares to which such holder
is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e) and any dividends or
other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.02(c).



(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Parent Common Shares_. No
dividends or other distributions with respect to the Parent Common Shares with
a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the Parent Common Shares entitled to
be received upon surrender thereof, and no cash payment in lieu of any
fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section
2.02(e), until the holder of such Certificate shall surrender such
Certificate as provided in Section 2.02(b). Subject to the effect of escheat,
tax or other applicable Laws (as defined in Section 3.05(a)), following
surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the
certificates representing whole Parent Common Shares issued in exchange
therefor (in addition to the Per Share Cash Consideration), without interest,
(i) the amount of any cash payable with respect to a fractional Parent Common
Share to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e) and the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time and theretofore payable with respect to such whole Parent
Common Shares and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions, with a record date after the Effective Time
but prior to surrender and a payment date occurring after surrender, payable
with respect to such whole Parent Common Shares.



(d) _No Further Rights in Company Common Stock_. All Parent Common Shares
issued and cash paid upon conversion of the Shares in accordance with the
terms hereof and any cash paid pursuant to Sections 2.02(c) or (e) shall be
deemed to have been issued or paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such Shares.



(e)  _No Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
Parent Common Shares shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Parent. Each
holder of a fractional share interest shall be paid an amount in cash (without
interest and rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (i) such fractional share interest to which such
holder (after taking into account all fractional share interests then held by
such holder) would otherwise be entitled by (ii) the  



 

5  average closing price per share of Parent Common Shares for the ten most
recent days that Parent Common Shares have traded ending on (and including)
the trading day one day prior to the Effective Time, as reported on The
Nasdaq National Market (with such average being calculated using the "simple
average" methodology) (the " _Parent Market Price_ "). As promptly as
practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid
to holders of fractional share interests, the Exchange Agent shall so notify
Parent, and Parent shall deposit such amount with the Exchange Agent and shall
cause the Exchange Agent to forward payments to such holders of fractional
share interests subject to and in accordance with the terms of Sections
2.02(b) and (c).



(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Shares for six months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of
Shares who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter
look only to Parent for the cash and Parent Common Shares to which they
are entitled pursuant to Section 2.01, any cash in lieu of fractional Parent
Common Shares to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e) and any
dividends or other distributions with respect to the Parent Common Shares to
which they are entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(c). Any portion of the
Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares as of a date that is
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any government entity shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or
interest of any person previously entitled thereto.



(g) _No Liability_. To the fullest extent permitted by law, neither Parent nor
the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of Shares for any
Parent Common Shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or
cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law. 



(h) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign
tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the
Exchange Agent, as the case may be. 



(i) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and,
if required by the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, the posting
by such person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving
Corporation or Exchange Agent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate and the payment of
any fee charged by the Exchange Agent for such service, the Exchange Agent
will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
amount of cash and number of Parent Common Shares to which the holder thereof
is entitled pursuant to Section 2.01, any cash in lieu of fractional Parent
Common Shares to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to Section
2.02(e) and any dividends or other distributions to which the holder thereof
is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(c).



SECTION 2.03 _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of Shares thereafter on the records of the Company.
From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates representing
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have
any rights with respect to such Shares, except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement or by Law. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates
presented to the Exchange Agent or Parent for any reason shall be converted
into the amount of cash and number of Parent Common Shares to which the
holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.01, any cash in lieu of
fractional Parent Common Shares to which the holders thereof are entitled
pursuant to Section 2.02(e) and any dividends or other distributions to which
the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(c).



 

6 SECTION 2.04 _Company Stock Options_.



(a) At the Effective Time, Parent shall assume (i) all options to acquire
Company Common Stock (the " _Company Stock Options_ ") outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not exercisable and
whether or not vested, under the Companys 1996 Stock Option Plan (the " _1996
Plan_ "), the Companys Second Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan (the
" _Stock Incentive Plan_ ") and the Companys 2001 Broad Based Equity
Incentive Plan (the " _Equity Incentive Plan_ " and together with the 1996
Plan and the Stock Incentive Plan, the " _Company Stock Option Plans_ "), and
(ii) each Company Stock Option Plan, and the Companys repurchase right with
respect to any unvested shares acquired by the exercise of Company Stock
Options shall be assigned to Parent without any further action on the part of
the Company or the holders of such unvested shares. Each Company Stock Option
so assumed by Parent under this Agreement will continue to have, and be
subject to, the same terms and conditions of such option immediately prior to
the Effective Time (including, without limitation, any repurchase rights or
vesting provisions), except that (A) each Company Stock Option will be
exercisable (or will become exercisable in accordance with its terms) for
that number of whole Parent Common Shares (rounded down to the nearest whole
share) equal to (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such Company Stock Option multiplied by (y) the Option Exchange Ratio; and
(B) the per share exercise price for the Parent Common Shares issuable upon
exercise of such assumed Company Stock Option will be equal to (x) the
exercise price per share of such Company Stock Option in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time divided by (y) the Option Exchange Ratio (the
exercise price per share, as so determined, being rounded upward to the
nearest full cent). At or before the Effective Time, the Company shall cause
to be effected any necessary amendments to the Company Stock Option Plans to
give effect to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.04. It is the
intention of the parties that each Company Stock Option assumed by Parent
shall qualify following the Effective Time as an incentive stock option as
defined in section 422 of the Code to the extent permitted under section 422
of the Code and to the extent such option qualified as an incentive stock
option prior to the Effective Time. Outstanding purchase rights under the
Companys Amended and Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _Company
Purchase Plan_ ") shall be exercised upon the earlier of (i) the next
scheduled purchase date under the Company Purchase Plan or (ii) immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and each participant in the Company Purchase
Plan shall accordingly be issued shares of Company Common Stock at that time
pursuant to the terms of the Company Purchase Plan and each share of Company
Common Stock so issued shall by virtue of the Merger, and without any action
on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive cash
and Parent Common Shares in accordance with Section 2.01(a)(i) and cash for
fractional Parent Common Shares in accordance with Section 2.02(e). The
Company shall cause the Company Purchase Plan to be terminated as of the
Effective Time.



For purposes of this Section 2.04, " _Option Exchange Ratio_ " shall mean the
quotient of (i) the sum of (A) the Per Share Cash Consideration and (B) the
product of the Exchange Ratio and the Parent Market Price, and (ii) the Parent
Market Price.



(b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (but in any event not
later than 15 days following the Effective Time), Parent shall deliver to
each person who, immediately prior to the Effective Time, was a holder of an
outstanding Company Stock Option an appropriate notice setting forth such
holders rights pursuant thereto and that the agreements evidencing the grants
of such options shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions
(subject to the adjustments required by this Section 2.04 after giving effect
to the Merger). At or before the Effective Time, Parent shall take all
corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of
Parent Common Shares for delivery upon exercise of Company Stock Options
assumed pursuant to this Section 2.04. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time (but in any event not later than 15 days following the
Effective Time), Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or
any successor or other appropriate forms) that will register the Parent Common
Shares subject to Company Stock Options to the extent permitted by
federal securities laws and shall maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement or registration statements for so long as such options
remain outstanding. In addition, Parent shall use all reasonable best efforts
to cause the Parent Common Shares subject to Company Stock Options to be
listed on The Nasdaq National Market and such exchanges as Parent shall
determine.



 

7 SECTION 2.05 _Reserved_.



SECTION 2.06 _Dissenting Shares_.



(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Shares
that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are
held by stockholders who have demanded and perfected appraisal rights for such
Shares in accordance with the DGCL (collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ")
shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive the applicable
Parent Common Shares and cash. Such stockholders shall be entitled to receive
payment of the appraised value of such shares of Company Common Stock held by
them in accordance with the DGCL, unless and until such stockholders fail to
perfect or effectively withdraw or otherwise lose their appraisal rights under
the DGCL. All Shares held by stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or
who shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their right to appraisal of such
Shares under the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into
and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to
receive the amount of cash, without any interest thereon, and number of
Parent Common Shares (and dividends or other distributions pursuant to
Section 2.02(c), if any) to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.01 and cash in lieu of fractional shares, without any interest thereon, to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e), upon the
surrender, in the manner provided in Section 2.02, of the corresponding
Certificate.



(b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
related instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company
and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except
with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to
any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.



ARTICLE III



REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY



The Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as of the
date of this Agreement that the statements contained in this Article III
are true and correct, subject to the exceptions set forth in the disclosure
letter delivered by the Company to Parent and Merger Sub concurrently with the
execution of this Agreement dated as of the date of this Agreement and
certified by a duly authorized officer of the Company (the " _Company
Disclosure Letter_ "). The Company Disclosure Letter shall be arranged
according to specific sections in this Article III and shall provide
exceptions to, or otherwise qualify in reasonable detail, only the
corresponding section in this Article III and any other section in this
Article III where it is reasonably clear, upon a reading of such disclosure
without any independent knowledge on the part of the reader regarding
the matter disclosed, that the disclosure is intended to apply to such other
section.



SECTION 3.01 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_.



(a) Section 3.01(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth the
jurisdiction of incorporation or organization of each of the Company and each
subsidiary of the Company (collectively, the " _Company Subsidiaries_ "). Each
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of
such incorporation and has all requisite corporate power and authority and all
necessary governmental approvals to own, lease and operate its properties and
to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except where
the failure to have such governmental approvals has not had, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect (as defined below). Each of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation
or organization to do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction
where the character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the
nature of its business makes such qualification or licensing necessary,
except for such failures to be so  



 

8  qualified or licensed and in good standing that have not had, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. The term " _Company Material Adverse Effect_
" means any changes in or effects on the business of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary that, individually or in the aggregate are, or would
reasonably be expected to be, materially adverse to (A) the business,
financial condition, assets (tangible or intangible) and liabilities
(including contingent liabilities) considered as a whole or results of
operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or
(B) the ability of the Company to perform its obligations hereunder and
consummate the Merger; _provided_ , _however_ , in no event shall any of the
following be deemed to constitute, nor shall any of the following be
taken into account in determining whether there has been or will be, a
Company Material Adverse Effect: (i) any changes affecting the industry in
which the Company and the Company Subsidiaries operate that do not have a
disproportionate impact in any material respect on the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) any changes in general economic
conditions or the capital markets that do not disproportionately impact in any
material respect the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
(iii) in and of itself, any change in the market price or trading volume of
Company Common Stock, (iv) in and of itself, a failure by the Company to meet
the revenue or earnings predictions of equity analysts for any period ending
(or for which earnings are released) on or after the date of this Agreement
and prior to the Closing Date, (v) the taking of any action required by this
Agreement or to which Parent has given its written consent, (vi) any changes
or effects to the extent attributable to the announcement or the pendency of
the transactions contemplated hereby, including disruption or loss of
customer, business partner, supplier or employee relationships ( _provided_
that the exception in this clause (vi) shall not be used to excuse a breach
of a representation or warranty of the Company contained in this Agreement
that arises from the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) or (vii) any
changes or effects resulting from the actions of Parent or the Parent
Subsidiaries. With respect to clauses (i) and (ii) of this paragraph (a), in
determining whether any change has had a disproportionate impact on
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, such impact shall
be considered in the context of the impact incurred on comparable products and
services and the businesses directly related thereto. With respect to clauses
(iii) and (iv) of this paragraph (a), the term "in and of itself" means that
the parties acknowledge that (A) the exception set forth in clauses (iii) and
(iv) is not intended to prohibit Parent from claiming that any change, event
or condition that causes such changes in the market price or trading volume
of Company Common Stock or such failure to meet predictions constitutes a
Company Material Adverse Effect, and (B) any, directly or indirectly, related
change in the trading price of Company Common Stock on The Nasdaq National
Market should not independently be used to judge the materiality of any such
change, event or condition.



(b) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary directly or indirectly owns
any equity or similar interest in, or any interest convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for, any corporation, partnership, joint venture
or other business association or entity (other than the Company Subsidiaries
in the case of the Company) that is or would reasonably be expected to
be material to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.



SECTION 3.02 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. The Company has
heretofore made available to Parent a complete and correct copy of the
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company, each as amended to the
date of this Agreement. Such Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws are in
full force and effect. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is in
violation of any of the provisions of its Certificate of Incorporation or
Bylaws (or equivalent organizational documents).



SECTION 3.03 _Capitalization_.



(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 500,000,000
shares of Company Common Stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par
value $0.01 per share (the " _Company Preferred Stock_ "). As of the date of
this Agreement, (i) 42,265,987 shares of Company Common Stock are issued and
outstanding, all of which are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable, (ii) 145,564 shares of Company Common Stock and no shares of
Company Preferred Stock are held in the treasury of  



 

9  the Company, (iii) no shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred
Stock are held by Company Subsidiaries and (iv) no shares of Company
Preferred Stock are issued and outstanding. Each outstanding share of stock
or other equity interest of each Company Subsidiary is duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and each such share or other
equity interest owned by the Company or another Company Subsidiary is free
and clear of all liens, security interests, claims, pledges, options, rights
of first refusal, agreements, limitations on voting rights, charges and other
encumbrances of any nature whatsoever. The Company directly owns 100% of the
issued and outstanding capital stock, and all options or other rights to
acquire such capital stock, of each Company Subsidiary.



(b) The Company has duly reserved 7,000 shares of Company Common Stock for
future issuance pursuant to the 1996 Plan, of which options to purchase 7,000
shares of Company Common Stock are outstanding as of the date of this
Agreement, 13,154,183 shares of Company Common Stock for future issuance
pursuant to the Stock Incentive Plan, of which options to purchase 10,391,746
shares of Company Common Stock are outstanding as of the date of this
Agreement, and 2,482,760 shares of Company Common Stock for issuance to
employees pursuant to the Equity Incentive Plan, of which options to purchase
2,235,444 shares of Company Common Stock are outstanding as of the date of
this Agreement. The Company has provided to Parent a report dated as of
December 31, 2003 that sets forth with respect to each Company Stock Option
that is outstanding as of such date: (i) the name of the holder of such
Company Stock Option; (ii) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
that was originally subject to such Company Stock Option, (iii) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock that remain subject to such Company
Stock Option; (iv) the date on which such Company Stock Option was granted,
(v) the term of such Company Stock Option; (vi) the vesting schedule for such
Company Stock Option; (vii) the vesting commencement date for such Company
Stock Option; (viii) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
purchasable under such Company Stock Option; and (ix) whether such Company
Stock Option has been designated an "incentive stock option" as defined in
section 422 of the Code. Section 3.03 of the Company Disclosure Letter sets
forth a list of all Company Stock Options granted after December 31, 2003
through the date of this Agreement. No Company Stock Option will by its terms
require an adjustment in connection with the Merger, except as contemplated
by this Agreement. Neither the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, nor any action taken or to be taken by the Company in
connection with such transactions, will result in (i) any acceleration
of exercisability or vesting (including, without limiting the foregoing, any
right to acceleration of vesting that is contingent upon the occurrence of a
subsequent event) in favor of any optionee under any Company Stock Option;
(ii) any additional benefits for any optionee under any Company Stock Option;
or (iii) the inability of Parent after the Effective Time to exercise any
right or benefit held by the Company prior to the Effective Time with respect
to any Company Stock Option assumed by Parent or any shares of Company Common
Stock previously issued upon exercise of a Company Stock Option, including,
without limitation, the right to repurchase an optionees unvested shares on
termination of such optionees employment. The assumption by Parent of the
Company Stock Option Plans and the Company Stock Options in accordance with
Section 2.04 hereunder will not give rise to any event described in clauses
(i) through (iii) of the immediately preceding sentence.

 



(c) The Company has duly reserved 1,400,000 shares of Company Common Stock
for future issuance pursuant to the exercise of warrants to acquire Company
Common Stock (" _Warrants_ "). Section 3.03(c) of the Company Disclosure
Letter sets forth, with respect to each Warrant issued to any person: (i) the
name of the holder of such Warrant; (ii) the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock that are subject to such Warrant; (iii) the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock with respect to which such Warrant is
immediately exercisable; (iv) the exercise price per share of Company Common
Stock issuable under such Warrant; (v) whether such Warrant is subject to
vesting and, if so, the conditions of such vesting; and (vi) the term of such
Warrant.



(d) Except (i) for shares of Company Common Stock reserved for issuance under
the Company Purchase Plan, the Company Stock Option Plans and pursuant to the
exercise of Warrants and (ii) as provided in the Rights Plan (as defined in
Section 3.27), there are no options, warrants or other rights,
agreements, arrangements or commitments of any character relating to the
issued or unissued capital stock  



 

10  of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or obligating the Company or any
Company Subsidiary to issue or sell any shares of its capital stock or other
equity interests. The Company has no stockholders rights plan or similar
plan in effect other than the Rights Plan. All shares of Company Common Stock
so subject to issuance, upon issuance in accordance with the terms and
conditions specified in the instruments pursuant to which they are issuable,
will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. There
are no outstanding contractual obligations of the Company to repurchase,
redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock or other equity
interests of the Company or any Company Subsidiary. Each holder of a Company
Stock Option or Warrant has been or will be given, or shall have properly
waived, any required notice of the Merger prior thereto, and all such
rights of notice will terminate at or prior to the Effective Time.



(e) All of the securities sold or issued by the Company and each Company
Subsidiary have been sold or issued in compliance with the requirements of the
federal securities laws and any other applicable securities laws. 



(f) There are no stockholder agreements, voting trusts or other agreements or
understandings to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party (i)
relating to voting, registration or disposition of any shares of capital stock
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary; (ii) granting to any person or
group of persons the right to elect, or to designate or nominate for election,
a director to the board of directors of the Company or any Company Subsidiary;
or (iii) granting to any person or group of persons information rights. 



SECTION 3.04 _Authority Relative to This Agreement_. The Company has all
necessary corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement,
and, subject to obtaining the necessary approvals of the Companys
stockholders, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company
of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby have been duly
and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action and no other
corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize
this Agreement or to consummate the Merger and the other transactions so
contemplated (other than with respect to approval of the Merger and adoption
of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders by the affirmative vote of a
majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Company
Stockholder Approval_ "), and the filing and acceptance of the Certificate of
Merger as required by the DGCL). This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes legal, valid
and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, except as the enforcement thereof may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency (including, without limitation, all laws relating to
fraudulent transfers), reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting
enforcement of creditors rights generally and except as enforcement thereof
is subject to general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement
is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).



SECTION 3.05 _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_.



(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company do not, and
the performance of this Agreement by the Company will not, (i) conflict with
or violate the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company or any
equivalent organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary, (ii) assuming
that all consents, approvals, authorizations and other actions described in
Section 3.05(b) have been obtained and all filings and obligations described
in Section 3.05(b) have been made or complied with, conflict with or violate
any foreign or domestic (federal, state or local) law, statute, ordinance,
writ, rule, regulation, order, injunction, judgment or decree (" _Law_ ")
applicable to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or by which any property
or asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound or affected, or
(iii) result in any breach of or constitute a default (or an event which with
notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) under, or give
to others any right of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation
of, trigger or change any rights or obligations under, or require any payment
under, or result in the creation of a lien, claim, security interest or other
charge or encumbrance on any property or asset of the Company or any  



 

11  Company Subsidiary pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other instrument or
obligation to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or by
which any asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound or affected,
except, with respect to clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such conflicts,
violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences that would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect.



(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company do not, and
the performance of this Agreement by the Company will not, require any
consent, approval, order, authorization, registration or permit of, or filing
with or notification to, any domestic, foreign or supranational governmental,
regulatory or administrative authority, agency or commission, any
court, tribunal, or arbitral body, or any quasi-governmental or private body
exercising regulatory, taxing, importing or other governmental authority (a "
_Governmental Entity_ "), except (i) for applicable requirements, if any, of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together with the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, the " _Exchange Act_ "), state securities
or "blue sky" laws (" _Blue Sky Laws_ "), The Nasdaq National Market, state
takeover laws, the pre-merger notification requirements of the Hart-Scott-
Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the rules and
regulations thereunder (the " _HSR Act_ "), any filings under
similar competition or merger notification laws or regulations of foreign
Governmental Entities and the filing and recordation of the Certificate of
Merger as required by the DGCL, and (ii) for such other consents, approvals,
orders, authorizations, registrations, permits, filings or notifications,
which if not obtained or made would not reasonably be expected to be material
to the Company or Parent or prevent or materially delay the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



SECTION 3.06 _Permits; Compliance._  



(a) Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries is in possession of all
material franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements,
variances, exceptions, consents, certificates, approvals and orders of any
Governmental Entity necessary for the Company or any Company Subsidiary to
own, lease and operate its material properties or to carry on its business as
it is now being conducted (the " _Company Permits_ "), except where the
failure to have any such Company Permit would not reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect.



(b) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is in conflict in any
material respect with, or in default or violation in any material respect of,
(i) any material Law applicable to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or by
which any material property or asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
is bound or affected, (ii) any material note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other instrument or
obligation to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or by

of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound or affected or (iii) any
Company Permits.



SECTION 3.07 _SEC Filings; Financial Statements._



(a) The Company has filed all forms, reports and documents required to be
filed by it with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") since
January 1, 2001 (collectively, the " _Company SEC Reports_ "). As of the
respective dates they were filed (and if amended or superseded by a filing
prior to the date of this Agreement then on the date of such filing), (i) each
Company SEC Report complied in all material respects with the requirements of
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (together with the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder, the " _Securities Act_ ") or the
Exchange Act, as the case may be, and (ii) none of the Company SEC Reports
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. No Company Subsidiary is required to file any form,
report or other document with the SEC or any similar Governmental Entity.



 

12 (b) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each case,
any notes thereto) contained in the Company SEC Reports (the " _Company
Financial Statements_ ") was prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") applied on a consistent basis throughout
the periods indicated (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in
the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) and
each presents fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial

consolidated Company Subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof and for
the respective periods indicated therein, except as otherwise noted therein
(subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal and recurring year-

".



(c) The Company has heretofore furnished to Parent a complete and correct copy

entities, particularly during the period when the Companys periodic reports
to which such information relates are required to be prepared, (ii) such
internal controls over financial reporting provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of

material weaknesses in the design or operation of Companys internal controls
which could adversely affect Companys ability to record, process, summarize
and report financial data and (iv) there is no fraud, whether or not material,
that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
Companys internal controls. Section 3.07(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter
lists, and the Company has made available to Parent, complete and correct
copies of, all formally written descriptions of, and all policies, manuals
and other documents promulgating, such disclosure controls and procedures. As

SECTION 3.11 _Employee Benefit Plans; Labor Matters_.



(a) Schedule 3.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter lists (i) all employee
benefit plans (as defined in section 3(3) of ERISA) and all bonus, stock
option, stock purchase, stock appreciation right, restricted stock, phantom
stock, incentive, deferred compensation, executive compensation, cafeteria
benefit, dependent care, director or employee loan, fringe benefit,
sabbatical, retiree medical or life insurance, disability, supplemental
retirement, employment, severance, termination pay or other benefit plans,
programs or arrangements, including (without limitation) any arrangements that
contain change of control or vesting acceleration provisions, whether legally
enforceable or not, to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party,
with respect to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary has any obligation
or which are maintained, contributed to or sponsored by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary for the benefit of any current or former employee, officer
or director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, (ii) each employee
benefit plan for which the Company or any Company Subsidiary could incur
liability under section 4069 of ERISA in the event such plan has been or were
to be terminated, (iii) any plan in respect of which the Company or any
Company Subsidiary could incur liability under section 4212(c) of ERISA, and
(iv) any contracts, arrangements or understandings between the Company or any
Company Subsidiary and any employee or former employee of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary including, without limitation, any contracts, arrangements
or understandings relating to a sale of the Company (collectively, the "
_Company Benefit Plans_ ").



(b) Each Company Benefit Plan is in writing and the Company has made available
to Parent a true and complete copy of each Company Benefit Plan and will
furnish to Parent upon request a true and complete copy of each material
document, if any, prepared in connection with each such Company Benefit Plan,
including, without limitation, (i) a copy of each trust or other
funding arrangement, (ii) each summary plan description and summary of
material modifications, (iii) the three (3) most recent annual reports (Form
5500 series and all schedules and financial statements attached thereto), if
any, required under ERISA or the Code  



 

15  in connection with each Company Benefit Plan, (iv) the most recently
received IRS determination letter for each such Company Benefit Plan, if such
plan is intended to qualify under Section 401 of the Code, (v) any actuarial
report and financial statement in connection with each such Company Benefit
Plan for the three most recent plan years, (vi) any correspondence with the
IRS or the Department of Labor with respect to each such Company Benefit Plan
and (vii) each form of notice of grant or stock option agreement used to
document Company Stock Options. There are no other employee benefit plans,
programs, arrangements or agreements, whether formal or informal, whether in
writing or not, to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party,
with respect to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary has any obligation
or which are maintained, contributed to or sponsored by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary for the benefit of any current or former employee, officer
or director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary. Neither the Company nor
any Company Subsidiary has express or implied commitment, whether
legally enforceable or not, (x) to create, incur liability with respect to,
or cause to exist, any other employee benefit plan, program or arrangement,
(y) to enter into any contract or agreement to provide compensation or
benefits to any individual, or (z) to modify, change or terminate any Company
Benefit Plan, other than with respect to a modification, change or termination
required by ERISA or the Code.



(c) None of the Company Benefit Plans is a multiemployer plan (within the
meaning of section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) (a " _Multiemployer Plan_ ")
or a single employer pension plan (within the meaning of section 4001(a)(15)
of ERISA) for which the Company or any Company Subsidiary could incur
liability under section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA (a " _Multiple Employer Plan_
"). None of the Company Benefit Plans provides for or promises retiree
medical, disability or life insurance benefits to any current or former
employee, officer or director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary other
than procedures intended to comply with the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended (" _COBRA_ "). Each of the Company
Benefit Plans is subject only to the Laws of the United States or a political
subdivision thereof.



(d) None of the Company Benefit Plans provides for the payment of separation,
severance, termination or similar-type benefits to any person or obligates the
Company or any Company Subsidiary to pay separation, severance, termination or
similar benefits solely or partially as a result of any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement or as a result of a "change in ownership or
control," within the meaning of such term under section 280G of the Code. No
amounts payable under the Company Benefit Plans solely as a result of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will fail to
be deductible for federal income tax purposes by virtue of section 280G of the
Code. There is no agreement, contract or arrangement to which the Company is
a party that could, individually or collectively, result in the payment of any
amount that would not be deductible by reason of sections 280G (as determined
without regard to section 280G(b)(4)), 162 (other than 162(a)) or 404 of
the Code. Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, either alone or together
with another event, will (i) result in any payment (including, without
limitation, severance, unemployment compensation, golden parachute,
forgiveness of indebtedness or otherwise) becoming due under any Company
Benefit Plan, (ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable or other
obligations under any Company Benefit Plan or other arrangement, (iii) result
in the acceleration of the time of payment, vesting or funding of any benefits
including, but not limited to, the acceleration of the vesting and
exercisability of any Company Stock Options, or (iv) affect in any
material respects any Company Benefit Plans current treatment under any Laws
including any tax or social contribution law. No Company Benefit Plan provides
or reflects or represents any liability to provide retiree health to any
person for any reason, except as may be required by COBRA or other applicable
statute, and neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has represented,
promised or contracted (whether in oral or written form) to any employee
(either individually or to employees as a group) or any other person that
such employee(s) or other person would be provided with retiree health, except
to the extent required by statute.



(e) Each Company Benefit Plan is now and always has been operated in
accordance in all material respects with its terms and the requirements of
all applicable Laws, regulations and rules promulgated thereunder including,
without limitation, ERISA, COBRA, the Family Medical Leave Act of 1993, as  



 

16  amended ("FMLA"), and the Code. The Company and each Company Subsidiary has
performed in all material respects all obligations required to be performed
by it under, is not in any material respect in default under or in violation
of, and has no knowledge of any default or violation by any party to, any
Company Benefit Plan. No action, claim or proceeding is pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened with respect to any Company Benefit Plan
(other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course) and, to the knowledge
of the Company, no fact or event exists that could give rise to any such
action, claim or proceeding. Neither the Company nor any person that is a
member of the same controlled group as the Company or under common control
with the Company within the meaning of section 414 of the Code (each, an "
_ERISA Affiliate_ ") is subject to any penalty or tax with respect to any
Company Benefit Plan under section 402(i) of ERISA or sections 4975 through
4980 of the Code. Each Company Benefit Plan can be amended, terminated or
otherwise discontinued as of or after the Effective Time, without material
liability to Parent, the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates (other than
ordinary administration expenses). Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary nor any affiliate has, prior to the Effective Time and in any
material respect, violated any of the healthcare continuation requirements of
COBRA, the requirements of FMLA, the requirements of the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, the requirements of the Womens
Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1998, the requirements of the Newborns and
Mothers Health Protection Act of 1996, or any amendment to each such act, or
any similar provisions of state Law applicable to its employees.



(f) Each Company Benefit Plan intended to qualify under section 401(a) or
section 401(k) of the Code and each trust intended to qualify under section
501(a) of the Code has either received a favorable determination, opinion,
notification or advisory letter from the IRS with respect to each such
Company Benefit Plan as to its qualified status under the Code, including all
amendments to the Code effected by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and subsequent
legislation, and, to the knowledge of the Company, no fact or event has
occurred since the date of such determination letter or letters from the IRS
to adversely affect the qualified status of any such Company Benefit Plan or
the exempt status of any such trust, or has remaining a period of time under
applicable Treasury regulations or IRS pronouncements in which to apply for
such a letter and make any amendments necessary to obtain a favorable
determination as to the qualified status of each such Company Benefit Plan.



(g) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary or ERISA Affiliate has any
accumulated funding deficiency under section 412 of the Code or has incurred
any liability under, arising out of or by operation of Title IV of ERISA
(other than liability for premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
arising in the ordinary course), including, without limitation, any liability
in connection with (i) the termination or reorganization of any employee
benefit plan subject to Title IV of ERISA or (ii) the withdrawal from any
Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan, and, to the knowledge of
the Company, no fact or event exists which could give rise to any such
liability.



(h) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has, since January 1, 1998,
terminated, suspended, discontinued contributions to or withdrawn from any
employee pension benefit plan, as defined in section 3(2) of
ERISA, including, without limitation, any multiemployer plan, as defined in
section 3(37) of ERISA. All contributions, premiums or payments required to be
made or accrued with respect to any Company Benefit Plan have been made on or
before their due dates. All such contributions have been fully deducted for
income tax purposes and no such deduction has been challenged or disallowed by
any Governmental Entity and, to the knowledge of the Company, no fact or event
exists which could give rise to any such challenge or disallowance.



(i) (A) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to any
collective bargaining agreement or other labor union contract applicable to
persons employed by the Company or any Company Subsidiary or in the Companys
or any Company Subsidiarys business, and currently there are no
organizational campaigns, petitions or other unionization activities seeking
recognition of a collective bargaining unit which could affect the Company or
any Company Subsidiary; (B) there are no controversies, strikes, slowdowns or
work stoppages pending or, to the knowledge of the Company after reasonable
due inquiry, threatened between the Company or any Company Subsidiary and any

strike, slowdown or work stoppage within the past three years; (C) neither
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has breached or otherwise failed to
comply with the provisions of any collective bargaining or union contract and
there are no grievances outstanding against the Company or any Company
Subsidiary under any such agreement or; (D) there are no unfair labor
practice complaints pending against the Company or any Company Subsidiary
before the National Labor Relations Board or any other Governmental Entity or
any current union representation questions involving employees of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary; (E) the Company and each Company Subsidiary is
currently in compliance in all material respects with all applicable Laws
relating to the employment of labor, including, without limitation,
those related to wages, hours, worker classification, collective bargaining

appropriate Governmental Entity and has withheld and paid to the appropriate

Governmental Entity all amounts required to be withheld from employees of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary and is not liable for any arrears of wages,
Taxes, penalties or other sums for failure to comply with any of the
foregoing; (F) the Company and each Company Subsidiary has paid in full to all
employees or adequately accrued for in accordance with GAAP consistently
applied all wages, salaries, commissions, bonuses, benefits and

being a member of a unitary group, or under comparable Laws of other states
or foreign jurisdictions) which includes a party other than the Company nor

term "the Company" means the Company and any entity included in, or required
under GAAP to be included in, any of the Company Financial Statements.



SECTION 3.17 _Status as a Reorganization_. To the knowledge of the Company,
neither the Company nor any of its affiliates has taken or agreed to take any
action that would prevent the Merger from constituting a reorganization within
the meaning of section 368(a) of the Code or that would prevent the
Alternative Double Merger Transaction (as defined in Section 6.21) from
qualifying for tax-free treatment (either as a reorganization as defined in
Section 368(a) of the Code, a transfer to a corporation controlled by the
transferor within the meaning of Section 351(a) of the Code, or a combination
of both). The Company is not aware of any agreement, plan or other
circumstance that would prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code or that would prevent the
Alternative Double Merger Transaction from qualifying for tax-free treatment
(either as a reorganization as defined in Section 368(a) of the Code, a
transfer to a corporation controlled by the transferor within the meaning
of Section 351(a) of the Code, or a combination of both).



SECTION 3.18 _Interested Party Transactions_. No director, officer or other
affiliate of the Company (or any member of the immediate family of any of the

proposes to furnish or sell; (ii) an economic interest in any person that
purchases from or sells or furnishes to, the Company or any Subsidiary, any
goods or services; (iii) a beneficial interest in any Contract included in
Section 3.12 of the Company Disclosure Letter; or (iv) any contractual or
other arrangement with the Company or any Subsidiary; provided, however, that
ownership of no more than one percent (1%) of the outstanding voting stock of
a publicly traded corporation shall not be deemed an "economic interest in any
person" for purposes of this Section 3.18. The Company and the Company
Subsidiaries have not, since September 30, 2003, (i) extended or maintained
credit, arranged for the extension of credit or renewed an extension of credit
in the form of a personal loan to or for any director or executive officer
(or equivalent thereof) of the Company, or (ii) materially modified any term
of any such extension or maintenance of credit. There are no extensions of
credit maintained by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to which
the second sentence of Section 13(k)(1) of the Exchange Act applies. No

claim, charge, action or cause of action against the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, except for immaterial claims for accrued vacation pay, accrued
benefits under any employee benefit plan and similar matters and agreements
existing on the date hereof.

respect to, any of such policies.

has taken all actions so that the restrictions contained in Section 203 of
the DGCL applicable to a "business combination" (as defined in Section 203)
will not apply to the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement and
the Company Voting Agreements or the consummation of the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No other state takeover

commitment, judgment, injunction, order or decree binding upon the Company or
any Company Subsidiary or to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a
party which has or would reasonably be expected to have the effect of
prohibiting or materially impairing any business practice material to the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, any acquisition of property by the Company
or any Company Subsidiary or the conduct of business by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary as currently conducted.



 

24 SECTION 3.26 _No Illegal Payments_ Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary, nor any director, officer, agent employee or other person acting

Company Rights under the Rights Plan, (iii) enable or require the Company
Rights to separate from the Shares to which they are attached or to be

ARTICLE IV



REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB



Parent and Merger Sub hereby represent and warrant to the Company as of
the date of this Agreement that the statements contained in this Article IV
are true and correct, subject to the exceptions set forth in the disclosure
letter delivered by Parent and Merger Sub to the Company concurrently with the
execution of this Agreement dated as of the date of this Agreement and
certified by a duly authorized officer of Parent (the " _Parent Disclosure
Letter_ "). The Parent Disclosure Letter shall be arranged according to
specific sections in this Article IV and shall provide exceptions to, or
otherwise qualify in reasonable detail, only the corresponding section in this
Article IV and any other section in this Article IV where it is reasonably
clear, upon a reading of such disclosure without any independent knowledge on
the part of the reader regarding the matter disclosed, that the disclosure is
intended to apply to such other section.



SECTION 4.01 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_.



(a) Section 4.01(a) of the Parent Disclosure Letter sets forth the
jurisdiction of incorporation of Parent and each subsidiary of Parent (the "
_Parent Subsidiaries_ "). Each of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of such jurisdiction and has all requisite corporate power and authority
and all necessary governmental approvals to own, lease and operate its
properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except
where the failure to have such governmental approvals has not had, and would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually  



 

25  or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect (as defined below).
Each of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed as
a foreign corporation or organization to do business, and is in good
standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned,
leased or operated by it or the nature of its business makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except for such failures to be so
qualified or licensed and in good standing that have not had, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. The term " _Parent Material Adverse Effect_ " means
any changes in or effects on the business of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary
that, individually or in the aggregate are, or would reasonably be expected to
be, materially adverse to (A) the business, financial condition, assets
(tangible or intangible) and liabilities (including contingent liabilities)
considered as a whole or results of operations of Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (B) the ability of Parent to perform
its obligations hereunder and consummate the Merger; _provided_ , _however_ ,
in no event shall any of the following be deemed to constitute, nor shall any
of the following be taken into account in determining whether there has been
or will be, a Parent Material Adverse Effect: (i) any changes affecting the
industry in which Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries operate that do not have
a disproportionate impact in any material respect on the Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) any changes in general economic
conditions or the capital markets that do not disproportionately impact in any
material respect Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (iii)
in and of itself, any change in the market price or trading volume of Parent
Common Shares, (iv) in and of itself, a failure by Parent to meet the revenue
or earnings predictions of equity analysts for any period ending (or for which
earnings are released) on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to
the Closing Date, (v) the taking of any action required by this Agreement or
to which the Company has given its written consent, (vi) any changes or
effects to the extent attributable to the announcement or the pendency of
the transactions contemplated hereby, including disruption or loss of
customer, business partner, supplier or employee relationships ( _provided_
that the exception in this clause (vi) shall not be used to excuse a breach of
a representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub contained in this
Agreement that arises from the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) or (vii) any
changes or effects resulting from the actions of the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries. With respect to clauses (i) and (ii) of this paragraph (a), in
determining whether any change has had a disproportionate impact on the Parent
and the Parent Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, such impact shall be
considered in the context of the impact incurred on comparable products and
services and the businesses directly related thereto. With respect to clauses
(iii) and (iv) of this paragraph (a), the term "in and of itself" means that
the parties acknowledge that (A) the exception set forth in clauses (iii) and
(iv) is not intended to prohibit the Company from claiming that any change,
event or condition that causes such changes in the market price or trading
volume of Parent Common Shares or such failure to meet predictions
constitutes a Parent Material Adverse Effect, and (B) any, directly or
indirectly, related change in the trading price of Parent Common Shares on The
Nasdaq National Market should not independently be used to judge the
materiality of any such change, event or condition.



(b) Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary directly or indirectly owns any
equity or similar interest in, or any interest convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for, any corporation, partnership, joint venture
or other business association or entity (other than the Parent Subsidiaries in
the case of Parent) that is or would reasonably be expected to be material to
Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.



SECTION 4.02  _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. Parent has
heretofore made available to the Company a complete and correct copy of the
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of Parent and Merger Sub, each as

arrangements or commitments of any character relating to the issued or
unissued capital stock of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, or conditionally
or absolutely obligating Parent or any Parent Subsidiary to issue or sell any
shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests in, Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary. All Parent Common Shares subject to issuance as aforesaid, upon
issuance on the terms and conditions (whether conditional or absolute)
specified in the instruments pursuant to which they are issuable, will be duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. There are no
outstanding contractual obligations of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any Parent Common Shares or any
capital stock or other equity interest of Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary. Each outstanding share of capital stock or other equity interest
of each Parent Subsidiary is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable, and each such share or other equity interest owned by Parent or
another Parent Subsidiary is free and clear of all security interests, liens,
claims, pledges, options, rights of first refusal, agreements, limitations on
Parents or such other Parent Subsidiarys voting rights, charges and other
encumbrances of any nature whatsoever, except where failure to own such
shares free and clear would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.



(d) The authorized stock of Merger Sub consists of 1,000 shares of common
stock, par value $0.001 per share, all of which are duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free of any preemptive rights in
respect thereof, and all of which are owned by Parent. The Parent Common
Shares to be issued pursuant to the Merger in accordance with Section

nonassessable and not subject to preemptive rights created by statute,
Parents Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or any agreement to which

fraudulent transfers), reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting
enforcement of creditors rights generally and except as enforcement thereof

or any Parent Subsidiary is a party or by which any asset of Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary is bound or affected, except, with respect to clauses (ii)

occurrences that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.



(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of Parent and Merger
Sub do not, and the performance of this Agreement by each of Parent and
Merger Sub will not, require any consent, approval, order, authorization,
registration or permit of, or filing with or notification to, any Governmental
Entity, except (i) for applicable requirements, if any, of the Exchange Act,
Blue Sky Laws, the Securities Act, The Nasdaq National Market, state takeover

consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



SECTION 4.06 _Permits; Compliance_.



(a) Each of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries is in possession of all
material franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements,
variances, exceptions, consents, certificates, approvals and orders of any
Governmental Entity necessary for Parent or any Parent Subsidiary to own,
lease and operate its material properties or to carry on its business as it
is now being conducted (the " _Parent Permits_ "), except where the failure to
have any such Parent Permit would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.



 

28 (b) Neither Parent nor any of the Parent Subsidiaries is in conflict in any
material respect with, or in default or violation in any material respect of
any Law applicable to Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries or by which any
material property or asset of Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries is bound or
affected.



SECTION 4.07 _SEC Filings; Financial Statements_.



(a) Parent has filed all forms, reports and documents required to be filed by
it with the SEC since January 1, 2001 (collectively, the " _Parent SEC
Reports_ "). As of the respective dates they were filed (and if amended or
superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement then on the date
of such filing), (i) each Parent SEC Report complied in all material respects
with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case
may be, and (ii) none of the Parent SEC Reports contained any untrue statement
of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. No
Parent Subsidiary is required to file any form, report or other document with
the SEC or any similar Governmental Entity.



(b) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each case,
any notes thereto) contained in the Parent SEC Reports (the " _Parent
Financial Statements_ ") was prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis throughout the periods indicated (except as may be indicated
in the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by
Form 10-Q of the SEC) and each presents fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows of
Parent and the consolidated Parent Subsidiaries as at the respective dates
thereof and for the respective periods indicated therein, except as otherwise
noted therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal and
recurring year-end adjustments which would not reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect). The
most recent balance sheet of Parent contained in the Parent SEC Reports as of
September 30, 2003 is hereinafter referred to as the " _Parent Balance
Sheet_."



(c) Parent has heretofore furnished to the Company a complete and correct
copy of any amendments or modifications, which have not yet been filed with
the SEC but which are required to be filed, to agreements, documents or other
instruments which previously had been filed by Parent with the SEC pursuant
to the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.



(d) Parent has established and maintained (i) disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 promulgated under the Exchange Act) and
(ii) internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15
promulgated under the Exchange Act). To Parents knowledge, (i) such
disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that material
information relating to Parent, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is
made known to Parents senior management by others within those entities,
particularly during the period when Parents periodic reports to which such
information relates are required to be prepared, (ii) such internal controls
over financial reporting provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, (iii) there are no significant deficiencies or
material weaknesses in the design or operation of Parents internal controls
which could adversely affect Parents ability to record, process, summarize
and report financial data and (iv) there is no fraud, whether or not material,
that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
Parents internal controls. Section 4.07(d) of the Parent Disclosure Letter
lists, and Parent has made available to the Company, complete and correct
copies of, all formally written descriptions of, and all policies, manuals
and other documents promulgating, such disclosure controls and procedures. As
used in this Section 4.07, the term "file" shall be broadly construed to
include any manner in which a document or information is furnished, supplied
or otherwise made available to the SEC.



(e) Neither Parent nor any of Parents current or former officers or directors
are the subject of an SEC investigation or enforcement action.



SECTION 4.08 _Tax Matters_. To the knowledge of Parent, neither Parent nor any
of its affiliates has taken or agreed to take any action that would prevent
the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning  



 

29  of section 368(a) of the Code or that would prevent the Alternative Double
Merger Transaction (as defined in Section 6.21) from qualifying for tax-
free treatment (either as a reorganization as defined in Section 368(a) of
the Code, a transfer to a corporation controlled by the transferor within the
meaning of Section 351(a) of the Code, or a combination of both). Parent is
not aware of any agreement, plan or other circumstance that would prevent the
Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code or that would prevent the Alternative Double Merger
Transaction (as defined in Section 6.21) from qualifying for tax-free
treatment (either as a reorganization as defined in Section 368(a) of the
Code, a transfer to a corporation controlled by the transferor within the
meaning of Section 351(a) of the Code, or a combination of both). 



SECTION 4.09 _Operations of Merger Sub_. Merger Sub is a direct, wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent, was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, has engaged in no other business
activities and has conducted its operations only as contemplated by
this Agreement.

any way (the " _Parent Board Approval_ "), has duly (i) approved this
Agreement and the Merger and (ii) recommended that the stockholders of Parent
approve the issuance of Parent Common Shares in connection with the Merger.



(b) The affirmative vote at the Parent Stockholders Meeting (as defined in
Section 6.01(a) below) of a majority of the total votes cast in person or by
proxy on the proposal to approve the issuance of Parent Common Shares pursuant
to the Merger (the " _Parent Share Issuance Stockholder Approval_ ") is the
only vote of the holders of any class or series of Parents capital stock
necessary to approve the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



SECTION 4.12 _Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except for (a) liabilities that are
fully reflected or reserved against on the Parent Balance Sheet, or in the
notes thereto, and (b) liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice that are not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, since the date

repricing of options granted under the Parent Stock Option Plans or
authorization of cash payments in exchange for any options granted under any
such plans. 



 

30 SECTION 4.14 _Absence of Litigation_. There is no Legal Proceeding pending or,
to the knowledge of Parent or Merger Sub, threatened against Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary, or any property or asset of Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary, before any court, arbitrator or Governmental Entity, domestic or
foreign, that (i) would reasonably be expected to, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or (ii) seeks to delay or
prevent the consummation of the Merger or any other material transaction
contemplated by this Agreement. Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary nor
any material property or asset of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is subject
to any continuing order of, consent decree, settlement agreement or other
similar written agreement with, or, to the knowledge of Parent, continuing
investigation by, any Governmental Entity, or any order, writ, judgment,

property formerly owned or leased by Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries.

no investigation, litigation or other proceeding is pending or threatened in
writing with respect thereto.



(e) None of the real property currently or formerly owned or leased by the
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is listed or, to the knowledge of Parent,
proposed for listing on the "National Priorities List" under CERCLA, as
updated through the date of this Agreement, or any similar list of sites in
the United States or any other jurisdiction requiring investigation or
cleanup. 



SECTION 4.16 _Intellectual Property_.



(a) Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries each own or are licensed to use, and
in any event possess sufficient and legally enforceable rights with respect
to, all Parent Intellectual Property (as defined below) relevant to their
respective businesses as currently conducted, except to the extent that
the failure to have such rights has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect and except for such items as
have yet to be conceived or developed or that may reasonably be expected to be
available for licensing on reasonable terms from third parties. With respect
to patent rights, moral rights and Mark rights, the representations and
warranties of this Section 4.16(a) are made only to Parents and the Parent
Subsidiaries knowledge.

that is Used in or necessary for any business of Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary.



(d) Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries have taken all necessary and
appropriate steps to protect and preserve the confidentiality of trade secrets

of Parent Confidential Information has been pursuant to the terms of
valid and binding written confidentiality and nonuse/restricted-use
agreements.



(e) Each current and former employee and contractor of Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary has executed and delivered (and to Parents and the Parent

the case of a contractor) and (ii) providing valid written assignments to
Parent or such Parent Subsidiary of all title and rights to any Parent

by Parent or a Parent Subsidiary by operation of Law).



(f) Since December 31, 2002, none of Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries
has received any communication alleging or suggesting that or questioning
whether Parent or any Parent Subsidiary has been or may be engaged in, liable

funds to pay all required cash amounts to the Companys stockholders pursuant

(a) All material Tax Returns have been or will be completed and filed when due
(including any extensions of such due date) and all amounts shown due on such
Tax Returns on or before the Effective Time have been or will be paid on or
before such date. Except to the extent that an appropriate reserve for Taxes
has been established on the Parent Financial Statements, all information
included on such Tax Returns is correct and complete. The Parent
Financial Statements contained in the Parent SEC Reports fully accrue all
actual and contingent liabilities for Taxes with respect to all periods
through the date of the Parent Balance Sheet. All information set forth in the
notes to the Parent Financial Statements relating to Tax matters is correct
and complete in all material respects. No material Tax liability since the

for all Taxes since that date in accordance with GAAP on at least a quarterly
basis.



(b) Parent has withheld and paid to the applicable financial institution or
Tax Authority all material amounts required to be so withheld and paid.
Parent (or any member of any affiliated or combined group of  



 

32  which Parent has been a member) has not granted any extension or waiver of
the limitation period applicable to any Tax Returns that is still in effect
and there is no material claim, audit, action, suit, proceeding, or (to the
knowledge of Parent) investigation now pending or threatened against or with
respect to Parent in respect of any Tax or assessment. There are no liens for
Taxes (other than for current Taxes not yet due and payable) upon the assets
of Parent. Parent has never been a member of an affiliated group of
corporations, within the meaning of section 1504 of the Code. There is no
agreement, contract or arrangement to which Parent is a party that could,
individually or collectively, result in the payment of any amount that would
not be deductible by reason of sections 280G (as determined without regard to
section 280G(b)(4)), 162 (other than 162(a)) or 404 of the Code. Parent is
not a party to or bound by any Tax indemnity, Tax sharing or Tax allocation
agreement (whether written or unwritten or arising under operation of federal
Law as a result of being a member of a group filing consolidated Tax Returns,
under operation of certain state Laws as a result of being a member of a
unitary group, or under comparable Laws of other states or foreign
jurisdictions) which includes a party other than Parent nor does Parent owe
any amount under any such agreement. Parent is not, and has not been, a
United States real property holding corporation (as defined in section
897(c)(2) of the Code) during the applicable period specified in section
897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code. Other than by reason of the Merger, Parent has
not been and will not be required to include any material adjustment in
Taxable income for any Tax period (or portion thereof) pursuant to section 481
or 263A of the Code or any comparable provision under state or foreign Tax
Laws as a result of transactions, events or accounting methods employed prior
to the Merger. Parent has not entered into any transaction that constitutes a
"reportable transaction" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section
1.6011-4(b). 



(c) As used in this Section 4.18, the term "Parent" means Parent and any
entity included in, or required under GAAP to be included in, any of the
Parent Financial Statements.



SECTION 4.19 _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. Parents Board of Directors has
received the written opinion of Morgan Stanley, dated as of the date of this
Agreement, to the effect that as of the date of this Agreement, the Per Share
Merger Consideration to be paid by Parent is fair to Parent from a financial
point of view, a copy of which opinion will be delivered to the Company
promptly after the date of this Agreement.



SECTION 4.20 _Title to Properties; Absence of Liens and Encumbrances_.



(a) Neither Parent nor any of the Parent Subsidiaries owns any real property.
Section 4.20(a) of the Parent Disclosure Letter lists all real property leases
to which Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is a party and each amendment
thereto. All such current leases are in full force and effect, are valid and
effective in accordance with their respective terms, and, to Parents
knowledge, there is not, under any of such leases, any existing default or
event of default (or event which with notice or lapse of time, or both, would
constitute a default) that would give rise to a material claim.



(b) Each of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries has good and valid title to,
or, in the case of leased properties, valid leasehold interests in, all of
its material tangible personal property, used or held for use in its business,
free and clear of any Liens except for Liens (i) imposed by Law in respect of
obligations not yet due that are owed in respect of taxes or which otherwise
are owed to carriers, warehouse persons or laborers, (ii) reflected in the
financial statements contained in the Parent SEC Reports and (iii) which are
not material in character, amount or extent, and which do not materially
detract from the value, or materially interfere with the present or
contemplated use, of the property subject thereto or affected thereby.



SECTION 4.21 _Insurance_. Parent has provided or made available to the Company
true, correct and complete copies of all policies of insurance to which each
of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries are a party or are a beneficiary or
named insured. There is no material claim pending under any of such policies
as to which coverage has been questioned, denied or disputed by the
underwriters of such policies. All premiums due and payable under all such
policies have been paid and Parent is otherwise in compliance in all material
respects with the terms of such policies. Parent has no knowledge of any
threatened termination of, or material premium increase with respect to, any
of such policies.



 

33 SECTION 4.22 _Employee Benefits Plans_. All Parent employee benefit plans (as
defined in section 3(3) of ERISA) (collectively, " _Parent Employee Benefit
Plans_ ") comply in all material respects with the requirements of all
applicable Laws, regulations and rules promulgated thereunder, including,
without limitation, ERISA, COBRA, FMLA and the Code. Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries have performed in all material respects all material obligations
required to be performed by them under, are not in material default under or
in material violation of, and have no knowledge of any material default or
material violation by any party to, any Parent Employee Benefit Plans. No
material action, claim or proceeding is pending or, to the knowledge of
Parent, threatened with respect to any Parent Employee Benefit Plans
(other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course).



SECTION 4.23  _Interested Party Transactions_. No director, officer or other
affiliate of Parent (or any member of the immediate family of any of the
foregoing persons) has or has had, directly or indirectly, (i) an economic
interest in any person that has furnished or sold, or furnishes or sells,
services or products that Parent or any Subsidiary furnishes or sells, or
proposes to furnish or sell; (ii) an economic interest in any person that
purchases from or sells or furnishes to, Parent or any Subsidiary, any goods
or services; (iii) a beneficial interest in any Contract included in the
Parent Disclosure Letter; or (iv) any contractual or other arrangement with
Parent or any Subsidiary; provided, however, that ownership of no more
than one percent (1%) of the outstanding voting stock of a publicly traded
corporation shall not be deemed an "economic interest in any person" for
purposes of this Section 4.23. Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries have not,
since September 30, 2003, (i) extended or maintained credit, arranged for the
extension of credit or renewed an extension of credit in the form of a
personal loan to or for any director or executive officer (or equivalent
thereof) of Parent, or (ii) materially modified any term of any such
extension or maintenance of credit. There are no extensions of credit
maintained by Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries to which the second
sentence of Section 13(k)(1) of the Exchange Act applies. No officer or
director of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary has asserted any claim, charge,
action or cause of action against Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, except for
immaterial claims for accrued vacation pay, accrued benefits under any
employee benefit plan and similar matters and agreements existing on the date
hereof.



SECTION 4.24 _No Illegal Payments_. Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary,
nor any director, officer, agent employee or other person acting on behalf of
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, has used any corporate or other funds for
unlawful contributions, payments, gifts or entertainment, or made any
unlawful expenditures relating to political activity to government officials
or others or established or maintained any unlawful or unrecorded funds in
violation of Section 30A of the Exchange Act. Neither Parent nor any Parent
Subsidiary, nor any current director, officer, agent, employee or other person
acting on behalf of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary has accepted or received
any unlawful contributions, payments, gifts or expenditures.



SECTION 4.25 _No Misstatements_. No representation or warranty made by
Parent, Merger Sub or any Parent Subsidiary in this Agreement, the Parent
Disclosure Letter or any certificate delivered or deliverable pursuant to the
terms hereof contains or will contain any untrue statement of a material
fact, or omits, or will omit, when taken as a whole, any material fact,
necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading. Parent has disclosed to the
Company all material information relating to the business of Parent, Merger
Sub or any Parent Subsidiary or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS



SECTION 6.01 _Registration Statement; Joint Proxy Statement_. 



(a) As promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, (i)
Parent and the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC a joint proxy
statement (together with any amendments thereof or supplements thereto, the "
_Joint Proxy Statement_ ") relating to the respective meetings of the
Companys stockholders (the " _Company Stockholders  Meeting_") to be held to
consider approval of the Merger and adoption of this Agreement and of the
Parent stockholders (the " _Parent Stockholders  Meeting_") to be held to
obtain (x) the Parent Share Issuance Stockholder Approval and (y) the approval
of the stockholders of Parent to adopt an amendment to Parents Certificate of
Incorporation to effect a reverse split of the Parent Common Shares, in a
ratio of either 1-for-5 or 1-for-6 (any such split, the " _Parent Reverse
Stock Split_ "), and (ii) Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a
registration statement on Form S-4 (together with all amendments thereto, the
" _Registration Statement_ ") in which the Joint Proxy Statement shall be
included as a prospectus, in connection with the registration under the
Securities Act of the Parent Common Shares to be issued to the stockholders
of the Company pursuant to the Merger. Each of Parent and the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement to become
effective as promptly as practicable and, prior to the effective date of
the Registration Statement, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
take all or any action required under any applicable federal or state
securities laws in connection  



 

37  with the issuance of Parent Common Shares pursuant to the Merger. Each of
Parent and the Company shall furnish all information concerning itself as the
other may reasonably request in connection with such actions and the

Statement to their respective stockholders.



(b) The Joint Proxy Statement shall include the unanimous recommendation of
the Board of Directors of the Company to the stockholders of the Company to
vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and, subject to paragraph (c)
of this Section 6.01, neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any

propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw, amend, modify or change, in each
case in a manner adverse to Parent, the unanimous recommendation of the Board
of Directors of the Company that the Companys stockholders adopt this
Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the foregoing shall not prohibit
the Board of Directors of the Company from fulfilling its duty of candor or
disclosure to the stockholders of the Company under applicable law. For
purposes of this Agreement, such recommendation of the Board of Directors
shall be deemed to have been modified in a manner adverse to Parent if such
recommendation shall no longer be unanimous.



(c) Prior to the adoption and approval of this Agreement and the approval of
the Merger by the requisite vote of the stockholders of the Company, nothing
in this Agreement shall prevent the Companys Board of Directors from
withholding, withdrawing, amending, modifying or changing its unanimous
recommendation in favor of the Merger if (i) a Superior Proposal (as defined
in Section 6.05 below) is made to the Company and is not withdrawn, (ii) the
Company shall have provided written notice to Parent as promptly as
practicable (and, in any event, within one business day) advising Parent that
the Company has received a Superior Proposal, specifying the terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal in reasonable detail and identifying the
person or entity making such Superior Proposal (a " _Notice of Superior
Proposal_ "), (iii) Parent shall not have, within three business days of
Parents receipt of the Notice of Superior Proposal, made an offer that the
Companys Board of Directors determines in its good faith judgment to be at
least as favorable to the Company and its stockholders as such Superior

a meeting to consider any such offer by Parent promptly following the receipt
thereof), (iv) the Board of Directors of the Company concludes in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that, in light of such
Superior Proposal, the withholding, withdrawal, amendment, modification or
change of such recommendation is required in order for the Board of Directors
of the Company to comply with its fiduciary obligations to the Company and
its stockholders under applicable Law and (v) the Company shall not have
violated any of the restrictions set forth in Section 6.05 or this Section
6.01(c). The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide
Parent with at least two business days notice of any meeting of the Companys
Board of Directors at which the Companys Board of Directors is reasonably
expected to consider any Competing Transaction (as defined in Section 6.05
below).



(d) The Joint Proxy Statement shall include the unanimous recommendation of
the Board of Directors of Parent to the stockholders of Parent to vote in
favor of approving (i) the issuance of the Parent Common Shares pursuant to
the Merger and (ii) the Parent Reverse Stock Split and neither the Board of
Directors of Parent nor any committee thereof shall withhold, withdraw, amend,
modify or change, or propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw, amend, modify
or change, in each case in a manner adverse to the Company, the unanimous
recommendation of the Board of Directors of Parent that the stockholders of
Parent vote in favor of and approve the issuance of the Parent Common Shares
pursuant to the Merger; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the foregoing shall
not prohibit the Board of Directors of Parent from fulfilling its duty of
candor or disclosure to the stockholders of Parent under applicable law. For
purposes of this Agreement, such recommendation of the Board of Directors
shall be deemed to have been modified in a manner adverse to the Company if
such recommendation shall no longer be unanimous.



(e) No amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement or the
Registration Statement will be made by Parent or the Company without the
approval of the other party (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed). Each of Parent and the Company will advise the other, promptly after
it  



 

38  receives notice thereof, of the time at which the Registration Statement has
become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, of the
issuance of any stop order, of the suspension of the qualification of the
Parent Common Shares issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or
sale in any jurisdiction, or of any request by the SEC for amendment of the
Joint Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement or comments thereon and

supplement to the Registration Statement or Joint Proxy Statement should be
discovered by Parent, Parent shall promptly inform the Company. All documents

SECTION 6.04 Access to Information; Confidentiality.



(a) Except as required pursuant to any confidentiality agreement or similar
agreement or arrangement to which Parent or the Company or any of their
subsidiaries is a party or pursuant to applicable Law, from the date of this
Agreement to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall (and shall
cause their respective subsidiaries to): (i) provide to the other (and its
officers, directors, employees, subsidiaries, accountants, consultants, legal

provided that neither party shall be required to furnish any information
about any Legal Proceeding that is pending, or to the knowledge of such party
threatened, against such party or any subsidiary or property or asset of such

discussions or negotiations with such person at least one business day prior

those contained in the Non-Disclosure Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that
no information may be furnished and no discussions may be entered into in the
event that the Company has breached this Section 6.05(a); _provided_
_further_ , _however_ , that the Companys Board of Directors shall furnish to
Parent all information provided to the person who has made the Superior
Proposal to the extent that such information has not been previously provided

status of any discussions regarding such Superior Proposal.

person (or its stockholders) would own, if consummated, all or substantially
all of the outstanding capital stock of the Company (or of the surviving
entity in a merger or the direct or indirect parent of the surviving entity in
a merger) or all or substantially all the assets of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries taken as a whole (i) that is not attributable to a
material breach by the Company of Section 6.05(a) hereof and (ii) on terms
(including conditions to consummation of the contemplated transaction) that
the Board of Directors of the Company determines, in its good faith
reasonable judgment (after consultation with the Companys financial advisor),
to be more favorable to the Company stockholders from a financial point of
view than the terms of the Merger and with any financing required to
consummate the transaction contemplated by such offer or proposal committed or
likely, in the reasonable good faith judgment of the Companys Board of
Directors (after consultation with the Companys financial advisor), to be
obtained by such third party on a timely basis.



(d) Prior to the Company Stockholder Approval, but only after payment by the
Company to Parent of the Termination Fee as set forth in Section 8.05(b), the
Companys Board of Directors may terminate this Agreement and recommend a

provided Parent two business days prior written notice that the Company is
prepared to accept a Superior Proposal, specifying the terms and

Company shall not have breached (other than inadvertent immaterial breaches)
any of the provisions of this Section 6.05.



(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or its
Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act.



SECTION 6.06 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.



(a) The Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
shall contain the same provisions with respect to indemnification, advancement
and director exculpation set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws of the Company on the date of this Agreement, which provisions shall
not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from
the Effective Time in any manner  



 

41  that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of persons who at any time
prior to the Effective Time were entitled to indemnification, advancement
or exculpation under the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the
Company in respect of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including, without limitation, the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement), unless such modification is required by Law.



(b) After the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law and as required by any
indemnification agreements of the Company (as each is in effect on the date
hereof), indemnify and hold harmless, each present and former director or
officer of the Company and each Company Subsidiary and each such person that
served at the request of the Company or any Company Subsidiary as a director,
officer, trustee, partner, fiduciary, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee
benefit plan or enterprise (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ")
against all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and settlement amounts
paid in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
(whether arising before or after the Effective Time), whether civil,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to any action
or omission in their capacities as officers or directors, in each case
occurring before the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement). Nothing contained herein shall make Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company or the Surviving Corporation an insurer, a co-insurer or an excess
insurer in respect of any insurance policies that may provide coverage for any
of the foregoing, nor shall this Section 6.06 relieve the obligations of any
insurer in respect thereto. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event of
any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, (i) Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall advance or pay the reasonable fees and expenses
of counsel selected by any Indemnified Party, which counsel shall be
reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Surviving Corporation, promptly
after statements therefor are received (unless the Surviving Corporation shall
elect to defend such action) and (ii) Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall cooperate in the defense of any such matter; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any
settlement effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed).



(c) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to
be maintained in effect the current directors and officers liability
insurance policies maintained by the Company with respect to claims arising
from facts or events that occurred prior to the Effective Time (including with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement);  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall Parent be required to expend pursuant to
this Section 6.06(c) more than an amount per year equal to 200% of current
annual premiums paid by the Company for such insurance; _provided_ _ further_
that if the existing directors and officers liability insurance policy
expires, is terminated or cancelled during such six-year period, Parent shall
cause to be obtained as much directors and officers liability insurance as
can be obtained for the remainder of such period for a premium not in excess
(on an annualized basis) of 200% of the current annual premium paid by the
Company for such insurance.



(d) This Section 6.06 is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, the Indemnified Parties and their heirs and personal
representatives and shall be binding on the Surviving Corporation and its
successors and assigns. In the event the Company or the Surviving Corporation
or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in
each case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns
of the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, honor the
indemnification obligations set forth in this Section 6.06.



SECTION 6.07 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall take all action
necessary to cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement
and to consummate the Merger on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement.



 

42 SECTION 6.08 _Affiliates Agreements_. As promptly as practicable, the Company
shall deliver to Parent a letter identifying all persons who are, at the time
this Agreement is submitted for adoption by the stockholders of the Company,
an "affiliate" of the Company for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities
Act. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to deliver or
cause to be delivered to Parent, prior to the Effective Time, an affiliate
agreement in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ (an " _Affiliate
Agreement_ "), executed by each of the affiliates of the Company identified
in the foregoing letter and any person who shall, to the knowledge of the
Company, have become an affiliate of the Company subsequent to the delivery of
such list. The foregoing notwithstanding, Parent shall be entitled to place
legends as specified in the Affiliate Agreement on the certificates evidencing
any of the Parent Common Shares to be received by any such affiliate, and to
issue stop transfer instructions to the transfer agent for Parent Common
Shares, consistent with the term of the Affiliate Agreement, regardless of
whether such affiliate has executed the Affiliate Agreement.



SECTION 6.09 _Further Action; Consents; Filings_.



(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, each of the parties
hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) take, or cause to be
taken, all appropriate action and do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to consummate
and make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) obtain from Governmental Entities any consents, licenses,
permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations or orders required to be obtained
or made by Parent or the Company or any of their subsidiaries in connection
with the authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (iii) make all necessary filings, and thereafter make any other
submissions, with respect to this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement that are required under (A) the
Exchange Act and the Securities Act and any other applicable federal or state
securities laws, (B) the HSR Act and foreign antitrust regulations, if any,
applicable to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereunder and

other in connection with the making of all such filings.



(b) Parent and the Company shall, as soon as practicable after the date of
this Agreement, file notifications under the HSR Act and make any required
antitrust filings in foreign jurisdictions and shall respond as promptly as
practicable to all inquiries or requests received from the Federal
Trade Commission or the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice for
additional information or documentation and shall respond as promptly as
practicable to all inquiries and requests received from any state attorney
general or other Governmental Entity in connection with antitrust matters.
The parties shall cooperate with each other in connection with the making of
all such filings or responses. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Section 6.09, Parent shall not be required to agree to (i) the
divestiture (including, without limitation, through a licensing arrangement)

to consult with the other before issuing any press release or otherwise making

SECTION 6.13 _Employee Benefits_.



(a) All employees of the Company shall continue in their existing benefit
plans until such time as, in Parents sole discretion, an orderly transition
can be accomplished to employee benefit plans and programs (other than the
sabbatical program) maintained by Parent for its and its affiliates
employees. The employees of the Company shall be eligible to participate in
the employee benefit plans of Parent on terms and conditions no less
favorable than those offered to similarly situated employees of Parent. Parent
will cause such employee benefit plans to take into account, for purposes of
eligibility and vesting, and, with respect to severance and vacation
benefits, benefit accrual thereunder, services by employees of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries as if such services were with Parent to the same
extent that such service was credited under a comparable plan of the Company.
Any restriction on coverage for pre-existing conditions or requirement for
evidence of insurability under the employee benefit plans of Parent shall be
waived, and employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall
receive credit under the employee benefit plans of Parent for co-payments and
payments under a deductible limit made by them and for out-of-pocket maximums
applicable to them during the applicable plan year of the Company Benefit Plan
in accordance with the corresponding employee benefit plans of Parent. Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor all compensation
and employee benefit plan obligations under the Company Benefit Plans and all
employment or severance agreements entered into by the Company or adopted by
the Board of Directors of the Company, except to the extent that the Company
Benefit Plans provide that they are terminable by the Company; provided that,
with respect to severance benefits, employees of the Company shall, until
March 31, 2005, remain eligible for severance benefits for non-performance-
related terminations that are no less favorable than the severance benefits to
which such employees were entitled under the Companys severance policy;
provided, further, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
pay, on June 30, 2004 (or if the Effective Time shall not have occurred by
such date, Parent shall permit the Company to pay), to employees of the
Company bonuses accrued for the six months ended June 30, 2004 pursuant to the
Companys bonus programs for fiscal year 2004, as in effect on the date of
this Agreement (provided that the amount of bonuses paid pursuant to
this proviso shall not exceed $3,000,000 in the aggregate).



(b) Parent agrees that, from and after the first enrollment date under the
Parent Purchase Plan coinciding with or following the Effective Time, the
employees of Company or any Company Subsidiary that become employees of Parent
or any Parent Subsidiary may participate in the Parent Purchase Plan, and
that service with the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be treated as
service with Parent for determining eligibility of the Companys employees
under the Parent Purchase Plan.



SECTION 6.14 _Employment Agreements_. Simultaneously with the execution of
this Agreement, the employees of the Company identified in Section 6.14 of the
Company Disclosure Letter shall enter into employment agreements (the "
_Employment Agreements_ ") with Parent. 



SECTION 6.15 _Reserved_.



 

44 SECTION 6.16 _Rights Plan_. Prior to the earlier of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01 hereof or the Effective Time, the Company
and its Board of Directors shall not amend or modify or take any other action
with regard to the Rights Plan in any manner or take any other action so as to
(a) render the Rights Plan inapplicable to any transaction(s) other than the
Merger and other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Voting
Agreements, (b) permit any person or group who would otherwise be an Acquiring
Person (as defined in the Rights Plan) not to be an Acquiring Person, (c)
provide that a Distribution Date or Stock Acquisition Date or Triggering Event
(as such terms are defined in the Rights Plan) or similar event does not occur
as promptly as practicable by reason of the execution of any agreement or
transaction other than this Agreement and the Voting Agreements and the Merger
and the agreements and transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, or (d)
except as specifically contemplated by this Agreement, otherwise affect
the rights of holders of Rights (as defined in the Rights Plan). The Company
and its Board of Directors shall take all action to ensure that the Rights
Plan is and, through the Effective Time, will be inapplicable to Parent and
Merger Sub, this Agreement, the Merger, the Voting Agreements and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. Pursuant to the amendment of the
Rights Plan contemplated in Section 3.27 hereof, the rights under the Rights
Plan shall expire immediately prior to the Effective Time.



SECTION 6.17 _Parent Board of Directors_. Parent shall take all requisite
action to appoint David H. McCormick to the Parent Board of Directors (the "
_Parent Board_ ") as a member of Class I and Karl E. Newkirk to the Parent
Board as a member of Class II, each as of the Effective Time, provided that
if either David H. McCormick or Karl E. Newkirk is unable or unwilling to
serve on the Parent Board at the Effective Time, Parent shall instead take all
requisite action to appoint such other person or persons as the Company may
designate and who is reasonably acceptable to the Board of Directors of Parent
consistent with its fiduciary duties.



SECTION 6.18 _Parent Officers_. Parent shall take all requisite action to
appoint David H. McCormick as President of Parent as of the Effective Time. 



SECTION 6.19 _Section 16 Matters_. Provided that the Company delivers to
Parent the Section 16 Information (as defined below) in a timely fashion, the
Parent Board, or an appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof,
shall adopt resolutions prior to the consummation of the Merger
providing that the receipt by the Company Insiders (as defined below) of the
Parent Common Shares upon conversion of the Company Common Stock, and of
options for Parent Common Shares upon conversion of the Company Stock Options,
in each case pursuant to the transactions contemplated hereby and to the
extent such securities are listed in the Section 16 Information, are intended
to be exempt from liability pursuant to Section 16(b) under the Exchange Act.
Such resolutions shall comply with the approval conditions of Rule 16b-3
under the Exchange Act for purposes of such Section 16(b) exemption,
including, but not limited to, specifying the name of the Company Insiders,
the number of securities to be acquired or disposed of for each such
person, the material terms of any derivative securities, and that the
approval is intended to make the receipt of such securities exempt pursuant to
Rule 16b-3(d). " _Section 16 Information_ " shall mean information regarding
the Company Insiders, the number of shares of the Company Common Stock held
by each such Company Insider and expected to be exchanged for Parent Common
Shares in connection with the Merger, and the number and description of the
Company Stock Options held by each such Company Insider and expected to be
converted into options for Parent Common Shares in connection with the Merger.
" _Company Insiders_ " shall mean those officers and directors of the Company
who will be subject to the reporting requirement of Section 16(b) of the
Exchange Act with respect to Parent and who are listed in the Section 16
Information.



SECTION 6.20 _Plan of Reorganization_.



(a) This Agreement is intended to constitute a "plan of reorganization" within
the meaning of section 1.368-2(g) of the income tax regulations promulgated
under the Code. From and after the date of this Agreement, each party hereto
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify, and will
not knowingly take any action, cause any action to be taken, fail to take any
action or cause any action to fail to be taken which action or failure to act
would reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from  



 

45  qualifying as a reorganization under the provisions of section 368(a) of the
Code or that would reasonably be expected to prevent the Alternative
Double Merger from qualifying for tax-free treatment (either as a
reorganization as defined in Section 368(a) of the Code, a transfer to a
corporation controlled by the transferor within the meaning of Section 351(a)
of the Code, or a combination of both). 



(b) As of the date of this Agreement, the Company does not know of any reason
why it would not be able to deliver to Gunderson Dettmer or Morgan, Lewis and
Bockius LLP (" _Morgan Lewis_ "), at the date of the legal opinions referred
to below, certificates substantially in compliance with IRS published advance
ruling guidelines, with customary exceptions and modifications thereto, to
enable such firms to deliver the legal opinions contemplated by Sections
7.02(d) and 7.03(c), and the Company hereby agrees to deliver such
certificates effective as of the date of such opinions.



(c) As of the date of this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub do not know of any
reason why they would not be able to deliver to Gunderson Dettmer or Morgan
Lewis, at the date of the legal opinions referred to below, certificates
substantially in compliance with IRS published advance ruling guidelines, with
customary exceptions and modifications thereto, to enable such firms to
deliver the legal opinions contemplated by Sections 7.02(d) and 7.03(c), and
Parent hereby agrees to deliver such certificates effective as of the date of
such opinions.



SECTION 6.21 _Alternative Double Merger_. The parties agree that each will
make a good faith attempt to obtain the tax opinions referred to in Section
6.20. If for any reason the tax opinion conditions in Sections 7.02(d) and
7.03(c) are not satisfied on or prior to the Closing, the parties shall,
subject to the receipt of tax opinions as described below, implement an
Alternative Double Merger Transaction (as defined below) on the terms
and conditions contained in this Agreement (preserving the economic and
financial terms of this Agreement) with such modifications to such terms and
conditions as are required to implement such structure. An " _Alternative
Double Merger Transaction_ " means a transaction whereby the following shall
occur: (i) Parent will cause Merger Sub (or another entity formed by Parent
solely to effect the Alternative Double Merger Transaction) (" _Holding
Company_ ") to form two wholly-owned subsidiaries under the DGCL (" _Parent
Merger Subsidiary_ " and " _Company Merger Subsidiary_ ", respectively); (ii)
Parent and the Company will cause Parent Merger Subsidiary and Company
Merger Subsidiary and, if applicable, Holding Company, to become parties to
this Agreement and to execute and deliver all documents required by the DGCL
to authorize and adopt this Agreement; (iii) in lieu of shares of Parent
Common Shares, an equal number of shares of common stock of Holding Company,
together with associated rights similar in all material respects to the rights
of the Parent Common Shares (" _Holding Company Common Stock_ ") shall be
issued as the stock portion of the Per Share Merger Consideration, and
appropriate conforming changes shall be made to this Agreement; (iv) Parent
Merger Subsidiary shall be merged with and into Parent in accordance with the
DGCL, whereupon the separate existence of Parent Merger Subsidiary shall
cease, stockholders of Parent shall receive one share of Holding Company
Common Stock in exchange for each share of Parent Common Shares and Parent
shall be the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Holding
Company; and (v) Company Merger Subsidiary shall be merged with and into the
Company in accordance with the DGCL, whereupon the separate existence of
Company Merger Subsidiary shall cease, and the Company shall be the surviving
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Holding Company. Each of the
foregoing elements of an Alternative Double Merger Transaction may be
undertaken at such times as mutually agreed by the Company and Parent with the
advice of counsel. It is intended that (i) the receipt of Holding Company
Common Stock by the holders of Parent Common Shares in exchange for their
shares of Parent Common Shares will be treated as having occurred pursuant to
either a reorganization as defined in Section 368(a) of the Code and/or
a transaction governed by Section 351(a) of the Code, and Parent will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the opinion of its counsel to that
effect, and (ii) the receipt of Holding Company Common Stock and cash by the
holders of the Company Common Stock in exchange for their shares of Company
Common Stock will be treated as having occurred pursuant to a transaction
governed by Section 351(a) and, if applicable, Section 351(b) of the Code, and
the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
opinion of its counsel to that effect. In the event that counsel for the
Company is unable to render the opinion referred to above, the opinion
condition of this Section 6.21 shall be deemed satisfied if counsel for
Parent renders such opinion to the Company.
