such disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that material information relating to the Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the Company&#146;s senior management by others within those entities,
particularly during the period when the Company&#146;s periodic reports to which such information relates are required to be prepared, (ii) such internal controls over financial reporting provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, (iii) there are no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or operation of
Company&#146;s internal controls which could adversely affect Company&#146;s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data and (iv) there is no fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in Company&#146;s internal controls. Section 3.07(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter lists, and the Company has made available to Parent, complete and correct copies of, all formally written descriptions of, and all policies,
