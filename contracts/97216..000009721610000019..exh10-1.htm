from Seller Parent and the Share Sellers, all of Seller Parent's and the
Share Sellers' right, title and interest in and to the Sold Shares, free
and clear of all Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances and
such Encumbrances, if any, as may be created by or on behalf of Buyer.

 

 

SECTION 2.4. Consideration. (a) On the Closing Date and subject to the terms
and conditions set forth in this Agreement, in consideration of the sale,
conveyance, assignment and transfer of the Sold Shares and the Acquired
Assets, Buyer will pay to Seller Parent and the other Sellers,
$1,300,000,000.00 (One Billion Three Hundred Million Dollars) less the
Estimated Aggregate Discounted Amount, if any, plus or minus Estimated Net
Cash (i.e. minus Estimated

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18  

 

 

 

 

 


 

Net Cash if Estimated Net Cash is determined to be negative), by wire
transfer of immediately available funds in U.S. dollars, net of any
withholdings that Buyer reasonably determines may be required by Law and for
which Buyer notifies Seller Parent in writing thereof by January 30, 2010
(the "Initial Purchase Price," and as adjusted pursuant to Section 2.4(b),
Section 2.8 and Section 2.10(d), the "Purchase Price"); provided however,
that Buyer shall not withhold an amount from the Purchase Price if Seller
Parent provides Buyer with a written opinion from a nationally recognized
accounting firm or law firm that it is more likely than not that Buyer is not
required to withhold such amounts in respect of the Purchase Price. Buyer and
Seller Parent agree to cooperate in determining whether and to what extent
the amounts paid in respect of the Purchase Price may be subject to
withholding. In furtherance thereof, Buyer and Seller shall cooperate to
prepare and file all forms, applications and other procedures to minimize any
required withholdings, including, without limitation, the filing of an
application with the Canada Revenue Agency for a clearance certificate.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall not withhold any amounts for which
Seller Parent was not notified in writing of such amounts by January 30,
2010, without Seller Parent's written consent not to be unreasonably
withheld.

 

 

(b) No later than two Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller Parent
shall deliver to Buyer a good faith estimate of (x) Cash of the Sold
Companies as of the Closing Date, less the sum of any Indebtedness of the
Sold Companies ("Closing Date Net Cash", and such estimate referred to as
"Estimated Net Cash") and (y) the Aggregate Discounted Amount (such estimate
referred to as the "Estimated Aggregate Discounted Amount"). Following the
Closing, the parties shall calculate and agree upon Closing Date Net Cash and
the Aggregate Discounted Amount (or failing such agreement under Section
2.8(a), Closing Date Net Cash and Aggregate Discounted Amount will be
determined as provided in Section 2.8 using the procedural requirements set
forth in Section 2.8). To the extent Estimated Net Cash exceeds Closing Date
Net Cash, Seller Parent shall pay to Buyer such excess in U.S. dollars. To
the extent Closing Date Net Cash exceeds Estimated Net Cash, Buyer shall pay
to Seller Parent such excess in U.S. dollars. To the extent Estimated
Aggregate Discounted Amount exceeds Aggregate Discounted Amount, Buyer shall
pay to Seller Parent such excess in U.S. dollars. To the extent Aggregate
Discounted Amount exceeds Estimated Aggregate Discounted Amount, Seller
Parent shall pay Buyer such excess in U.S. dollars. Such payment shall be
made contemporaneously with, and without duplication of, payments between the
parties pursuant to Section 2.8(d).

 

 

SECTION 2.5. Equity Option. (a) Seller Parent may request that
$300,000,000.00 (such amount, as may be adjusted upon mutual agreement of the
Parties, the "Equity Amount") of the Purchase Price be paid in the form of
Bucyrus Stock in accordance with this Section 2.5, and as set forth in the
Equity Agreement (as defined below). To make such request, Seller Parent
shall give written notice (the "Equity Notice") to Buyer, as promptly as
practicable following the date of this Agreement. The amount of Bucyrus Stock
to be delivered in respect of the Equity Amount shall equal the Stock
Consideration (as defined below). Seller Parent may request that the Equity
Amount be paid in whole or in part for Acquired Assets and/or in whole or in
part in exchange for the equity of certain of the Sold Companies (and such
request shall be specified in the Equity Notice). Buyer and Seller Parent
shall cooperate with one another in good faith in an effort to structure the
Equity Agreement and the allocation of the Stock Consideration between
Acquired Assets and equity of Sold Subsidiaries in a mutually beneficial
manner, including in respect of taxes.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(b) Completion of the Equity Agreement and the delivery of the Stock
Consideration, as part of the Initial Purchase Price (and the corresponding
reduction in the cash portion of the Purchase Price under Section 2.4(a)), is
conditioned upon (i) receipt of the Equity Notice; (ii) completion of the due
diligence contemplated by Section 2.5(c) reasonably satisfactory to Seller
Parent; (iii) the entry into the purchase agreement and any amendments to
this Agreement as contemplated by Section 2.5(d), in each case reasonably
satisfactory to Buyer and Seller Parent; and (iv) satisfaction of any
conditions precedent in the Equity Agreement; provided that in the event that
each of the conditions set forth in clauses (i) through (iii) are not
satisfied on or before January 15, 2010, the Equity Notice shall be deemed to
have been fully and irrevocably withdrawn.

 

 

(c) Prior to Closing (following Seller Parent's delivery of the Equity
Notice), Buyer shall, subject to Seller Parent's entering into customary
confidentiality arrangements similar to the Confidentiality Agreement, afford
Seller Parent the opportunity, at Seller Parent's request, to conduct
customary due diligence with respect to Buyer and the Bucyrus Stock,
including making the Buyer's management team reasonably available for such
purposes.

 

 

(d) Upon receipt by Buyer of the Equity Notice, Buyer and Seller Parent shall
in good faith negotiate mutually acceptable transfer documentation (the
"Equity Agreement") for the Stock Consideration, including amending this
Agreement to the extent necessary. Such documentation or amendment to this
Agreement shall in any event include or provide for the following:

 

 

(i) The Equity Agreement shall include customary representations and
warranties from Buyer in favor of the Seller Parent as to Buyer's and its
Subsidiaries existence, good standing, authorization and absence of conflicts
and required consents, capitalization, the validity of the Bucyrus Stock,
Buyer's periodic reports under the Exchange Act, financial statements and
absence of a material adverse change and from Seller Parent in favor of Buyer
as to existence, good standing, authorization and absence of conflicts and
required consents that are customary, where the consideration or a portion of
the consideration is to be paid in the stock of a publicly traded company
listed on a national securities exchange, and from Seller Parent in favor of
Buyer as to which representations and warranties shall (i) survive the
Closing for a period of 18 months (except for certain representations and
warranties that shall survive for periods consistent with those set forth in
Section 9.5 hereof) and (ii) otherwise be deemed to be representations and
warranties under this Agreement for all purposes, including Article IX
hereof.

 

 

(ii) A Stockholders' Agreement under which Seller Parent shall agree to be
subject to (A) a customary standstill agreement restricting certain corporate
actions for a period of the shorter of (x) five (5) years and (y) the time at
which Seller Parent and its Affiliates no longer hold 5% or more of the
outstanding Bucyrus Stock and (B) restrictions on transferring or selling the
Stock Consideration, including an initial lockup period of one year.
Seller Parent shall not at any time during the lock-up period, enter into any
Hedging Contracts with respect to, or enter any other transaction that is
intended to or otherwise would have the effect of transferring an economic
interest in, the Stock Consideration.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(iii) Under the Stockholders' Agreement, Buyer will agree, after the Closing
Date to effect one underwritten demand registration pursuant to which the
Stock Consideration shall be registered (subject to customary "cutback"
provisions) and will agree to maintain a "shelf" registration, subject to
customary terms and conditions, at Seller Parent's request in order to
facilitate Seller Parent's desired liquidity in the Bucyrus Stock. Buyer
shall also provide Seller Parent with customary "piggy back" registration
rights, subject to customary limitations. Seller Parent's registration rights
will expire at such time as Seller Parent is entitled to sell all of the
Stock Consideration in any three-month period without material restriction
pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act.

 

 

SECTION 2.6. The Closing. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated
pursuant to Article VIII, and subject to satisfaction or waiver of the

the conditions set forth in Articles VI and VII hereof (the "Domestic
Closing Date", or "Closing Date"), or at such other place and time as may be
agreed upon by Seller Parent and Buyer. Unless the parties agree otherwise,
the Closing will be deemed to have occurred at the close of business local

each such jurisdiction, the "Effective Time"). The closings of the sale of
the Foreign Acquired Assets and Foreign Sold Shares (the "Foreign
Closing") shall take place on the Domestic Closing Date, or as soon as

(a) Within 60 days after the Closing Date, Buyer will prepare, or cause to
be prepared, a statement containing a calculation of the Net Asset Value as
of the Closing Date (the "Net Asset Value Statement"), which shall be
prepared in accordance with the definition of Net Asset Value. "Net Asset
Value" shall mean the book value of those components of the Acquired Assets
(excluding any Excluded Assets) less those components of the Assumed
Liabilities (excluding any Excluded Liabilities), and the book value of those
components of the assets and liabilities of the Sold Companies, in each case
as set forth in Schedule 2.8(a) and determined on a combined basis in
accordance with the same accounting principles used in the preparation of the
Base Statement of Net Asset Value applied on a basis consistent with, and
reflecting all categories of adjustments on, the Base Statement of Net Asset
Value in each case in accordance with U.S. GAAP as in effect as of December
31, 2009 and on the same currency exchange rates as those reflected on such
Schedule 2.8(a). For the avoidance of doubt, Cash and Indebtedness shall be
excluded in the determination of Net Asset Value. Seller Parent will assist
and cooperate with Buyer in the preparation of the Net Asset Value Statement,
including by providing Buyer and its accountants access to the books and
records of the Business in its possession and to any other information in its
possession necessary to prepare the Net Asset Value Statement.

 

 

(b) Seller Parent shall, within 30 days after the delivery by Buyer of the
Net Asset Value Statement, complete its review of the Net Asset
Value Statement. In the event that Seller Parent determines that the
Net Asset Value Statement has not been prepared on a basis consistent with
the requirements of Section 2.8(a), Seller Parent shall, on or before the
last day of such 30-day period, inform Buyer in writing (the "Objection"),
setting forth a specific description of the basis of the Objection, the
adjustments to the Net Asset Value Statement which Seller Parent believes
should be made, and Seller Parent's calculation of the Net Asset Value, and
Seller Parent shall be deemed to have accepted any items not specifically
disputed in the Objection. Failure to so notify Buyer within such 30-day
period shall constitute acceptance and approval of Buyer's calculation of the
Net Asset Value.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(c) Buyer shall have 30 days following the date it receives the Objection to
review and respond to the Objection. Seller Parent will provide Buyer and
its accountants access to any relevant books and records of the Business not
in the possession of Buyer, work papers and to any other information
necessary to evaluate the Objection. If Seller Parent and Buyer are unable
to resolve all of their disagreements with respect to the determination of
the foregoing items by the 30th day following Buyer's response thereto,
after having used their good faith efforts to reach a resolution, they shall
refer their remaining differences to Ernst and Young LLP or another
internationally recognized firm of independent public accountants as to which
Seller Parent and Buyer mutually agree (the "CPA Firm"), who shall, acting as
experts in accounting and not as arbitrators, determine on a basis consistent
with the requirements of Section 2.8(a), and only with respect to the
specific remaining accounting related differences so submitted, whether and
to what extent the Net Asset Value Statement requires adjustment. Seller
Parent and Buyer shall request the CPA Firm to render its determination
within 45 days. The CPA Firm's determination shall be conclusive and binding
upon Seller Parent and Buyer. Seller Parent and Buyer shall make reasonably
available to the CPA Firm and each other all relevant books and records, any
work papers (including those of the parties' respective accountants) and
supporting documentation relating to the Net Asset Value Statement and all
other items reasonably requested by the CPA Firm. The "Final Statement of Net
Asset Value" shall be (i) the Net Asset Value Statement in the event
that Seller Parent notifies Buyer that there will be no Objection or no
Objection is delivered to Buyer during the initial 30-day period specified
above, (ii) the Net Asset Value Statement, as adjusted in accordance with the
Objection, in the event that Buyer notifies Seller Parent that it accepts its
Objection or Buyer does not respond to the Objection during the 30-day period
specified above following receipt by Buyer of the Objection or (iii) the Net
Asset Value Statement, as adjusted pursuant to the agreement of Buyer and
Seller Parent or as adjusted by the CPA Firm, together with any other
modifications to the Net Asset Value Statement agreed upon by Seller Parent
and Buyer. All fees and disbursements of the CPA Firm shall be borne equally
by Seller Parent, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand.

 

 

(d) (i) If the calculation of the Net Asset Value contained in the Final
Statement of Net Asset Value is less than the Seller NAV Threshold, Seller
Parent shall pay an amount in cash equal to the amount of such deficiency in
immediately available funds to Buyer within three (3) Business Days after the
ultimate determination of the Final Statement of Net Asset Value as provided
in this Section 2.8(d).

 

 

(ii) If the Closing Date occurs on or before February 28, 2010 and the
calculation of the Net Asset Value contained in the Final Statement of Net
Asset Value is greater than the Buyer NAV Threshold (such difference being
referred to as "Buyer Excess"), Buyer shall pay an amount in cash equal to
the amount of such Buyer Excess to Seller Parent up to a maximum of
$25,000,000.

 

 

(iii) If the Closing Date occurs after February 28, 2010 and the Buyer Excess
is less than or equal to $25,000,000, Buyer shall pay an amount in cash equal
to the amount of such Buyer Excess to Seller Parent.

 

 

(iv) If the Closing Date occurs after February 28, 2010 and the Buyer Excess
is greater than $25,000,000, the Buyer Excess shall also be calculated as of
February 28, 2010 (the "February Buyer Excess"). If the Buyer Excess as of
the Closing Date is (x) less than the


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25  

 

 

 

 

 


 

February Buyer Excess, Buyer shall pay an amount in cash equal to the amount
of such February Buyer Excess up to a maximum of $25,000,000 or (y) greater
than the February Buyer Excess, Buyer shall pay an amount in cash equal to
the amount of such February Buyer Excess up to a maximum of $25,000,000, plus
an amount equal to the amount by which the Buyer Excess as of the Closing
Date exceeds the February Buyer Excess.

 



 

SECTION 2.9. Purchase Price Allocation.

 

 

(a) The Purchase Price (including the amount of Liabilities that are treated
as assumed for Tax purposes) shall initially be allocated among (i) the
Acquired Assets and (ii) the Sold Shares as set forth on Schedule 2.9. Where
the allocation on Schedule 2.9 is for a group of Acquired Assets or a Sold
Company for which a Section 338(g) election is made pursuant to Section
5.6(d) herein, then prior to the Closing, Seller Parent and Buyer shall
mutually agree to make further sub-allocations in the Purchase Price to the
applicable Acquired Assets in each such group listed on Schedule 2.9
in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code, as appropriate, and such
allocation shall be set forth on a separate schedule (the
"Allocation Schedule"). To the extent Seller Parent and Buyer cannot
agree on a mutually acceptable Allocation Schedule, the Allocation Schedule
shall be prepared by the mutually agreed upon CPA Firm, whose decision shall
be final and binding and whose expenses shall be shared equally by Seller
Parent and Buyer. The Allocation Schedule shall be finalized and agreed to
as soon as reasonably practicable after the Final Statement of Net Asset
Value is determined in accordance with the procedures set forth in the
preceding sentence. In the event an adjustment to the Purchase Price is
made pursuant to Section 2.8 or otherwise under this Agreement, Seller Parent
will prepare, in accordance with the above provisions, and provide to Buyer a
revised Allocation Schedule and Buyer and Seller Parent will file amended IRS
Forms 8594.

 

 

(b) Except as otherwise required by applicable Law, Seller Parent and Buyer
shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates, to report the Tax
consequences of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a manner
consistent with the Allocation Schedule and the Purchase Price allocation
described therein, as it may be revised from time to time, and shall not take
any position inconsistent therewith in preparing any Tax Returns, IRS Form
8594 and any other Tax forms or filings, as well as in preparing any
published financial statements, and, unless required by Law, none of Buyer,
Seller Parent or their respective Affiliates shall take any position
inconsistent therewith upon examination of any Tax Return, in any Tax refund
claim, or in any Tax litigation or investigation, without the prior written
consent of Buyer or Seller Parent, as the case may be; provided, however,
that Buyer's Tax basis in the Acquired Assets and the Sold Shares may exceed
the total amount allocated to the Acquired Assets and the Sold Shares
pursuant to this Section 2.9 to reflect Buyer's capitalized transaction
costs, and the Sellers' amount realized may be less than the total amount
allocated to the Acquired Assets and the Sold Shares pursuant to this Section
2.9 in order to reflect the Sellers' transaction costs.

 

 

SECTION 2.10. Completion of Transfers.

 

 

(a) The entire beneficial interest in and to, and the risk of loss with
respect to, the Sold Shares, the Acquired Assets and the Assumed Liabilities
shall pass to Buyer as of the Domestic Closing Date, regardless of when legal
title thereto shall be transferred to Buyer. All

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

26  

 

 

 

 

 


 

operations of the Business shall be for the account of the Sellers up to the
Effective Time and shall be for the account of Buyer thereafter, subject to
Section 2.10(d). In the event legal title to any of the Sold Shares or
the Acquired Assets is not transferred at the Closing, the Seller of such
Sold Shares or Acquired Assets shall hold such Sold Shares or Acquired Assets
as nominee for Buyer until completion of such transfers.

 

 

(b) In the event that (i) the legal interest in the Foreign Sold Shares or
the Foreign Acquired Assets, or any claim, right or benefit arising
thereunder or resulting therefrom cannot be sold, assigned, transferred,
conveyed or delivered as contemplated hereunder as of the Domestic Closing
Date because any Consents required for such transfer have not been obtained
or waived ("Foreign Deferred Transfers") and (ii) such Foreign Deferred
Transfers consist solely of De Minimis Foreign Transfers, then the sale,
assignment, transfer, conveyance and delivery of the legal interest in such
De Minimis Foreign Transfers shall be deferred until such Consents have been
obtained. Seller Parent shall, and shall cause the Share Sellers and the
Asset Sellers, and Buyer shall and shall cause its Affiliates to use
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate in obtaining such Consents as
may be necessary to complete such transfers as soon as practicable (provided
that neither the Sellers nor Buyer or its Affiliates shall be required to
expend money, commence any litigation or offer or grant any accommodation
(financial or otherwise) to any third party (other than immaterial filing,
recordation or similar fees). Subject to Article VII, the failure of Seller
Parent to obtain any required Consents prior to Closing in respect of De
Minimis Foreign Transfers shall not affect Buyer's obligations to close under
this Agreement or to pay, or cause to be paid, the Initial Purchase Price.
Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as an attempt to assign to Buyer
any legal interest in any of the Sold Shares or the Acquired Assets which, as
a matter of law or by the terms of any legally binding contract, engagement
or commitment to which any of the Sellers or the Sold Companies are subject,
is not assignable without the consent of any other party, unless such consent
shall have been given. Once such Consents are obtained, Seller Parent shall,
and shall cause the Asset Sellers or the Share Sellers, as the case may be,
to sell, assign, transfer, convey and deliver any such De Minimis Foreign
Transfers. For purposes of this Section 2.10(b), "De Minimis Foreign
Transfer" means the shares or assets with respect to any or all of the
following: (i) PT Terex (Indonesia); (ii) Hypac (China); (iii) Terex NHL
(China); (iv) the portion of the Business and Acquired Assets located in or
subject to the jurisdiction of Chile; and (v) the portion of the Business and
Acquired Assets located in or subject to the jurisdiction of South Africa.
For the avoidance of doubt, De Minimis Foreign Transfers shall not include
any of the following: (i) any portion of the Business and Acquired Assets
located in or subject to the jurisdiction of Germany; (ii) Terex Mining
Australia and any portion of the Business and Acquired Assets located in or
subject to the jurisdiction of Australia; (iii) Equipo de Acuña S.A. de C.V.
and any portion of the Business and Acquired Assets located in or subject to
the jurisdiction of Mexico; (iv) OandK and any portion of the Business and
Acquired Assets located in or subject to the jurisdiction of Canada; and (v)
Halco and any portion of the Business and Acquired Assets located in or
subject to the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom.

 

 

(c) Pending the assignments, conveyances and transfers referred to in
Section 2.10(b), Seller Parent shall hold and cause the other Sellers to hold
any such non-assigned Sold Shares or Acquired Assets for the benefit and at
the risk of Buyer and shall cooperate with Buyer in any lawful and reasonable
arrangements designed to provide Buyer the benefits of ownership thereof,
including indemnities, that they would have obtained had such Sold Shares
or Acquired

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

27  

 

 

 

 

 


 

Assets been sold, assigned, transferred, conveyed or delivered to Buyer at
the Closing, and shall pay to Buyer promptly upon receipt thereof, all
income, proceeds and other monies received by Seller Parent or any of its
Affiliates in connection with its use of any such Foreign Sold Shares or
Foreign Acquired Assets (net of any Taxes and any other costs imposed upon
Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates) in connection with the arrangements
under this Section 2.10, including, without limitation, entering into at the
reasonable request of Buyer appropriate management agreements in form and
substance mutually agreeable to the parties. Each Party shall pay its own
expenses in connection with establishing the arrangements under this Section
2.10. Any Taxes, costs, expenses or other Liabilities imposed on or incurred
by Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates with respect to any Foreign Sold
Shares or Foreign Acquired Assets in connection with the arrangements under
this Section 2.10 shall be borne by Buyer.

 

 

(d) If, after the Domestic Closing Date, any Foreign Acquired Assets or any
Foreign Sold Shares are unable to be transferred as contemplated by this
Agreement by March 31, 2011 (the "Foreign Outside Date") as a result of
failure to obtain the applicable Consent, then this Agreement shall terminate
with respect to such Foreign Acquired Assets or Foreign Sold Shares and the
Purchase Price shall be further adjusted by (i) recalculating the Final Net
Asset Value to exclude such Foreign Acquired Assets, Foreign Sold Companies
and the Foreign Assumed Liabilities, as of the Closing Date and (ii)
including any benefits received by Buyer with respect to such Foreign
Acquired Assets or Foreign Sold Companies from the Closing Date through the
Foreign Outside Date. To the extent (x) the Purchase Price is increased as
result of such adjustment, Buyer shall pay Seller Parent such difference and
(y) the Purchase Price is decreased by such adjustment, Seller Parent shall
pay Buyer such difference. In the event failure to obtain a Consent is the
result of a failure by a party hereto to perform any covenants or agreements
in this Agreement in connection with obtaining a Consent, such failing party
may not receive payment pursuant to this Section 2.10(d), and the non-
defaulting party shall retain all its indemnity and other rights set out in
this Agreement with respect to such failure to perform its agreements
hereunder. Buyer and Seller Parent shall enter into such arrangements to the
extent permitted by applicable Law (including subleasing, sublicensing
or subcontracting) to provide to the parties hereto the economic (taking
into account Tax and other costs and benefits) and operational equivalent, to
the extent permitted, of obtaining such Consents and the performance by
the applicable Sellers of the obligations thereunder.

all requisite corporate or other power and authority to own its assets and to
carry on its business as now being conducted and is duly qualified or
licensed to do business and is in good standing in the jurisdictions in which

qualification or license, except where the failure to be so

qualified or licensed would not reasonably be expected, individually or in
the aggregate, to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

SECTION 3.2. Authorization; Enforceability. (a) Each of the Sellers and the
Sold Companies has all requisite corporate power and authority to carry on
its business as it is now being conducted and to execute and deliver this
Agreement, each Ancillary Agreement and each Closing Agreement to which it is

execution, delivery and performance by any Seller or Sold Company of
this Agreement and each Closing Agreement to which it is a party, and the
performance by such Seller or Sold Company of its obligations hereunder and
thereunder, have been or will have been at the Closing duly and validly
authorized by all requisite corporate action.

outstanding Sold Shares have been validly issued, are fully paid and
nonassessable and have not been issued in violation of any preemptive
or similar rights. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.3, there are no

capital stock of, or other equity interests in, the Sold Companies. There are
no phantom stock or similar rights providing economic benefits based,
directly or indirectly, on the value or price of the stock of, or other

controls applicable to the Sellers, the Sold Companies and the Business

SECTION 3.6. Undisclosed Liabilities. None of the Sold Companies or the
Acquired Assets has or is subject to any Liabilities of any kind that would
be required to be reflected or disclosed on financial statements prepared in
accordance with U.S. GAAP (other than Liabilities that would not,

constitute a default under any Law or other restriction of any Governmental
Authority to which any Seller or Sold Company is subject; except, with

individually or in the aggregate have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

SECTION 3.8. Compliance with Law; Governmental Authorizations; Consents.

 

 

(a) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.8(a), the Sold Companies and the Asset
Sellers in respect of the Acquired Assets and the conduct of the Business are

performance of this Agreement, or any Ancillary Agreement or Closing
Agreement, by the Sellers or the Sold Companies does not require any Consent

the failure of which to obtain, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

Business, or as otherwise set forth on Schedule 3.9, there is (i) no

Environmental Matters which are subject to Section 3.17.

Buyer no later than the third (3rd) Business Day prior to the Closing Date a
true and complete schedule of changes (the "Update Schedule") to any of the
information contained in the Disclosure Schedules (including changes to any
other representations or warranties in Article III hereof as to which no
Disclosure Schedule has been created as of the date hereof but as to which a
Disclosure Schedule would have been required if such changes had existed on
the date hereof), which changes are required as a result of events or
circumstances occurring subsequent to the date hereof which would render any
representation or warranty materially inaccurate or incomplete at any time
after the date of this Agreement until the Closing Date, which Update
Schedule shall be dated as of the Closing Date; provided, however, that if
such supplemental information relates to an event or circumstance
occurring subsequent to the date hereof and if Buyer would have the right to
not consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as a result of
the failure of the condition contained in Section 7.1 on the basis of
the supplemental information so disclosed and it does not exercise such right
prior to the Closing, then such supplemental information shall constitute an
amendment of the representation, warranty or statement to which it relates
for purposes of Article X of this Agreement.

 

 

SECTION 5.4. Efforts; Regulatory Filings and Consents.

 

 

(a) Each of Seller Parent and Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts

all required Consents and Permits and to obtain any Consent of any
Governmental Antitrust Authority required to be obtained or made by Seller
Parent or Buyer, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the taking
of any action contemplated by this Agreement, provided, however, that
Seller shall not be required to divest any assets, and provided, further, the
Sellers and their respective Affiliates shall not be required to make any
material monetary expenditure, commence or be a plaintiff in any litigation
or offer or grant any material accommodation (financial or otherwise) to
any Person. Without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to
this Section 5.4, Buyer and Seller Parent each agrees to take or cause to
be taken the following actions: (i) provide promptly to any
Governmental Authority information and documents requested by any
Governmental Authority or necessary, proper or advisable to permit
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
Ancillary Agreements and the Closing Agreements and (ii) in the event that,
after substantial compliance with all requests for information, any complaint
or challenge by any Governmental Authority seeking a preliminary or permanent
injunction or other order, or, in the case of a Governmental Authority
located outside the United States, decision or decree (in all cases other
than a request for information) becomes reasonably foreseeable to be made or
filed and such injunction or other order, decision or decree would make
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the terms of this Agreement,
any Ancillary Agreements or any Closing Agreements unlawful or would prevent
or prohibit consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,
take promptly all commercially reasonable steps necessary to prevent, vacate,
modify or suspend such injunction or order so as to permit such consummation
on a schedule as close as possible to that contemplated by this Agreement,
any Ancillary Agreements or any Closing Agreements. Buyer agrees to (A)
sell or otherwise dispose of, (B) hold separate and agree to sell or
otherwise dispose of, or (C) enter into any other agreement or

relevant Governmental Authority giving effect thereto) if such action should
be required by any Governmental Authority in connection with permitting the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any court
order obtained by or on behalf of any Governmental Authority; provided that
with respect to clauses (A), (B) and (C), (x) Buyer shall not be
obligated to make any sale or disposition or enter into any agreement or
arrangement that would have a Company Material Adverse Effect or a material
adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operation or business
of Buyer and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole and (y) Buyer may condition
its commitment to any Governmental Authority to take any such action on the
Closing occurring.

applicable laws of Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Russia, South Africa and
Ukraine and such other jurisdictions as may be required by Law. Any such
antitrust notification and report form or filing and supplemental information
shall be in substantial compliance with the requirements of the HSR Act or
the applicable Other Competition Laws, as the case may be. All other
regulatory filings shall be in substantial compliance with the requirements
of applicable laws. Each of Seller Parent and Buyer shall furnish to the
other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may
request in connection with its preparation of any filing or submission that
is necessary under the HSR Act, applicable Other Competition Laws or other
applicable laws and regulations, as the case may be. Seller Parent and Buyer
shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to comply promptly
with any inquiries or requests for additional information and documentary
material ("Second Request") from the FTC or the DOJ, or similar request for
information from any other Governmental Authority having jurisdiction.

 

 

(c) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings and subsections (a)
and (b) of this Section 5.4 and subject to any appropriate confidentiality
protections, Seller Parent and Buyer shall each furnish to counsel for the
other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other party
may request in connection with the foregoing and shall each promptly provide
counsel for the other party with copies of all filings made by such party,
and all correspondence between such party (and its advisors) with any
Governmental Antitrust Authority or other Governmental Authority and any
other information supplied by such party and such party's Affiliates to a
Governmental Antitrust Authority or other Governmental Authority in
connection with this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and the Closing
Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Each such
party shall, subject to applicable Law, permit counsel for the other party
(i) to review in advance, if practicable, any proposed written or oral,
communication to any Governmental Antitrust Authority or other Governmental
Authority; and (ii) to attend any telephonic or in person meeting with any

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

54  

 

 

 

 

 


 

Governmental Antitrust Authority or other Governmental Authority. Neither
Seller Parent nor Buyer shall participate in any meeting with any
Governmental Authority in respect of the foregoing without giving the other
party prior notice of the meeting. Seller Parent and Buyer will use
commercially reasonable efforts to consult and cooperate with one another in
connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs,
arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of each
party in connection with all meetings, actions and proceedings under or
relating to the HSR Act or any Other Competition Laws or other applicable
laws and regulations.

 

 

(d) The filing fees under the HSR Act, Other Competition Laws and other
applicable Laws shall be borne by Buyer. The fees and disbursements of any
legal counsel or other advisor retained by a Party in connection with any
such filings and any other filings with Governmental Authorities shall be
borne by the Party engaging such counsel or advisor except as otherwise
agreed between the Parties.

 

 

(e) In the event that the Closing occurs prior to the time the matters
addressed in Section 5.4 shall have been resolved (including obtaining all
consents and approvals), the obligations hereunder shall continue until
such resolution.

 

 

SECTION 5.5. Third Party Consents. Seller Parent shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any Consent of any Person (other than
Governmental Authorities) required to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Buyer agrees to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with such parties in obtaining
such Consents. To the extent that Seller Parent and Buyer are unable to
obtain any required third party Consents prior to the Closing (such Consents,
the "Post-Closing Consents"), each of Seller Parent and Buyer, respectively,
shall use all commercially reasonable efforts (including the making of any
filing required to obtain any Post-Closing Consents) to obtain (or cause to
be obtained) as promptly as practicable all Post-Closing Consents. For
purposes of this Section 5.5, the term "all commercially reasonable efforts"
shall not be deemed to require any Person to pay or commit to pay any amount
to (or incur any obligation in favor of) any Person from whom any consent or
waiver may be required (other than nominal filing or application fees).

 

 

SECTION 5.6. Tax Matters.

 

 

(a) Buyer and Seller Parent agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to each
other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information and
assistance relating directly to the Sold Companies or the Acquired Assets
(including information relating to the tax attributes of each of the Sold
Companies, access to books and records, employees, contractors and
representatives) as is reasonably necessary for the filing of all Tax
Returns, the making of any election related to Taxes, the preparation for any
audit by any Taxing Authority, and the prosecution or defense of any claim,
suit or proceeding relating to any Tax Return; provided, however, that if
such requested information is contained within a document containing any
unrelated information, only portions pertaining to such relevant information
shall be furnished. Buyer and Seller Parent shall retain all books and
records with respect to Taxes pertaining to the Sold Companies and the
Acquired Assets until the expiration of all relevant statutes of limitations
(and, to the extent notified by Buyer and Seller Parent, as the case may be,
any

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

55  

 

 

 

 

 


 

extensions thereof). At the end of such period, each party shall provide
the other with at least 30 days prior written notice before destroying any
such books and records, during which period the party receiving such notice
can elect to take possession, at its own expense, of such books and records.

 

 

(b) Seller Parent shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, in a manner
consistent with past practice, all Tax Returns in respect of the Sold
Companies or the Acquired Assets for all tax periods that end on or before
the Closing Date ("Pre-Closing Tax Returns"). With regard to a Pre-Closing
Tax Return of a Sold Company that (1) is not part of a consolidated, unitary,
combined or similar basis Tax Return that includes such Sold Company and any
of the Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates other than a Sold Company (a
"Stand Alone Pre-Closing Tax Return") and (2) will be filed after the Closing
Date, (i) Seller Parent shall permit Buyer to review and comment on each such
Pre-Closing Tax Return and shall make such revisions as are reasonably
requested by Buyer, (ii) Seller Parent and Buyer shall provide to each other
such cooperation and information, as and to the extent reasonably requested,
in connection with the filing of any such Pre-Closing Tax Returns, and (iii)
Buyer shall timely file, or cause to be filed, all such Pre-Closing Tax
Returns and provide final copies to Seller Parent. Seller Parent shall timely
file, or cause to be filed, all other Pre-Closing Tax Returns. In the case of
a Stand Alone Pre-Closing Tax Return to be filed by Seller Parent after the
date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date, Seller Parent shall
provide Buyer with a copy of a substantially final draft of such Tax Return
at least 10 days prior to filing. Buyer shall prepare, or cause to be
prepared, all Tax Returns in respect of the Sold Companies for any taxable
period ending after the Closing Date which begins before the Closing Date (a
"Straddle Period"), in a manner consistent with past practices. Buyer shall
provide Seller Parent with a copy of a substantially final draft of each
Straddle Period Tax Return prepared by Buyer (and such additional information
regarding such Straddle Period Tax Return as may reasonably be requested by
Seller Parent) for its review and comment at least 60 days prior to the
filing of such Tax Return. Buyer shall pay the amounts shown to be due on any
such Straddle Period Tax Returns. In advance of the filing of such Straddle
Period Tax Returns, Seller Parent shall pay to Buyer its share of any such
Taxes, with the timing of such payment and the amount of such
share determined in accordance with Section 5.7(d).

 

 

(c) Except for the Sold Companies organized under the laws of the United
Kingdom or Germany, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that each Sold Company that
is not a United States entity shall not pay any distributions or dividends to
its shareholders prior to January 1 of the calendar year following the year
in which the Closing occurs. The preceding sentence shall not apply to
any Sold Company for which Buyer makes a valid election under Section 338(g)
of the Code in accordance with the terms of Section 5.6(d) hereof.

 

 

(d) Without the prior written consent of Seller Parent (which consent may
be withheld in Seller Parent's sole discretion) Buyer shall not make any
Tax election under the Code (or the Tax Laws of any other jurisdiction) with
respect to the Sold Companies (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
election under Section 301.7701-3 of the Treasury Regulations or election
pursuant to Section 338 of the Code (or any comparable state, local or
foreign provision)) to the extent such election would cause the sale of the
Sold Shares to be treated as an asset sale for Tax purposes, except that
Buyer shall be allowed to make an election under Section 338(g) of the Code
with respect to the sale of shares for Terex Mining Australia Pty. Ltd., OandK

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

56  

 

 

 

 

 


 

Australia Pty. Ltd., and OandK Orenstein and Koppel, Inc. provided that for each
Sold Company for which Buyer makes such election, (i) Buyer timely notifies
Seller Parent in writing of such election and (ii) cooperates in the filings
of Tax Returns reflecting such election (i.e., IRS Forms 8023 and 8883).
Buyer shall not (i) amend any Pre-Closing Tax Return without Seller Parent's
written consent, or (ii) without the written consent of Seller Parent (not to
be unreasonably withheld) or unless otherwise required by applicable Law as
reasonably determined by Buyer in good faith (A) take any Tax position on any
Tax Return (other than the United States federal consolidated tax return of
which Buyer is a member) of a Sold Company that is inconsistent with
elections made, positions taken or methods used in preparing the Tax Returns
of such Sold Company for tax periods (including the portion of any Straddle
Period) that end on or before the Closing Date, (B) compromise or settle any
Tax liability of a Sold Company if such action adversely affects Seller
Parent's obligation to indemnify Buyer under Section 5.7(a), or (C) amend a
Straddle Period Tax Return to the extent such action adversely affects Seller
Parent's obligation to indemnify Buyer under Section 5.7(a). Buyer shall
not consent to the waiver of the statute of limitations of the Sold Companies
for any period ending on or before the Closing Date, without the prior
written consent of Seller Parent, which written consent will not unreasonably
be withheld.

 

 

(e) If a Sold Company was treated as a controlled foreign corporation (as
defined in Section 957 of the Code) prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall
cause a Form 5471, Information Return of U.S. Persons with Respect to Certain
Foreign Corporations (including profit and loss balance sheets), to be timely
and accurately filed for each such Sold Company for the Tax year in which the
Buyer acquires such Sold Company. Each such Form 5471 shall be filed as
a joint information return in respect of Buyer (or its applicable Affiliate)
and Seller Parent (or its applicable Affiliate). In connection with
the filing of each such Form 5471, Seller Parent agrees to furnish or cause
to be furnished to Buyer, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such
information and assistance that is reasonably required to properly complete
such Form 5471. Buyer shall provide copies of the Forms 5471 to Seller
Parent no later than 10 Business Days prior to the due date for filing such
Forms 5471 for Seller Parent's review and comment. In the event a Section
338(g) election is made with respect to a Sold Company pursuant to Section
5.6(d) then the parties shall mutually cooperate in the filing of any
required Forms 5471.

 

 

(f) Prior to the Closing Date, Seller Parent shall terminate any tax-sharing
allocation, and indemnification agreements and arrangements of the Sold
Companies and such agreements shall have no further effect for any taxable
year or period (whether a past, present or future year or period), no
additional payments shall be made thereunder on or after the Closing Date
with respect to any period, and the liability for any obligations or amounts
payable thereunder shall be excluded from the Final Statement of Net Asset
Value.

 

 

SECTION 5.7. Tax Indemnity.

 

 

(a) Seller Parent shall indemnify Buyer and its Affiliates (including the
Sold Companies) and each of their respective officers, directors, employees
and agents and hold them harmless against (i) all Tax liabilities of Seller
Parent, the Sold Companies or their Affiliates for all taxable periods (or
portions thereof in the case of a Straddle Period) ending on or before the
Closing Date except to the extent of the amounts reflected on the Final
Statement of Net Asset

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

57  

 

 

 

 

 


 

Value and all Losses, claims, liabilities, costs, and expenses relating to
such Tax liabilities, (ii) all Taxes that are Excluded Liabilities described
in Section 2.2(c)(ix) hereof, (iii) all Tax liabilities arising out of or due
to any breach of any representation or warranty in Section 3.12, treating
such representation or warranty as though made on and as of the date hereof
and the Closing Date, except to the extent such representation or warranty
relates to a specified date (in which case such representation and warranty
shall be true and correct only on and as of such specified date), covenant or
other agreement of any Share Seller contained in this Agreement, (iv) Taxes
(net of all foreign tax credits attributable thereto that are actually
realized within three years of the Closing Date) imposed on subpart F income
(as defined in Section 952 of the Code) or as a result of a Section 956
inclusion (as defined in Section 956 of the Code) in respect of the Sold
Companies that is allocable to any taxable period (or portion thereof in the
case of a Straddle Period) ending on or before the Closing Date based on a
closing of the books method as of the Closing Date (for clarification, the
determination of Taxes will be calculated based on a hypothetical closing of
the books method on the Closing Date, even though Law may require the
calculation of such Taxes on an annual basis, thus, any dividends,
distributions, or other actions of the Sold Companies after the Closing will
not affect such determination), (v) any liability for Taxes imposed on any of
the Sellers, their Affiliates or the Sold Companies (including, without
limitation, by manner of withholding) as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other than any Transfer Taxes
required to be paid by Buyer pursuant to Section 5.22(b)), any internal
restructuring in anticipation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (other than Taxes that Buyer is obligated to indemnify Seller
Parent for pursuant to Section 5.7(c))or any repayment, discharge,
cancellation, or extinguishment of an intercompany liability, (vi) any
liability for Taxes of the Share Sellers or their Affiliates (other than any
of the Sold Companies), (vii) any liability for Taxes attributable to any
entity other than the Sold Companies but imposed on any of the Sold Companies
pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or similar provision of
state, local, or foreign Law solely as a result of such Sold Company having
been a member of Share Sellers' Group or any Retained Affiliate Group, (viii)
any Tax Equalization Clawback amount for which it is liable pursuant to
Section 5.7(c), and (ix) any liability for Transfer Taxes required to be paid
by Seller Parent pursuant to Section 5.22(b).

 

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in Section 5.7(a) to the contrary, the Tax
indemnity provided under Section 5.7(a) shall not cover Tax liabilities (i)
directly resulting from the operations of the Sold Companies after the
Closing Date to the extent such liabilities would have been imposed in the
absence of any event giving rise to an obligation of Seller Parent to
indemnify Buyer under Section 5.7(a), or, (ii) resulting from a breach of any
covenant or other agreement of Buyer contained in this Agreement, including
without limitation a breach of Sections 5.6(c) or 5.6(d) (a "Buyer Tax Act").
With respect to the transactions contemplated in Schedule 2, hereto, Buyer
and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Seller Parent and its Affiliates, on
the other hand, agree that neither party is warranting to the other party any
Tax consequences of the Hive-Down (as defined in Schedule 2) and neither
party shall be liable to the other party for the failure of such other party
to realize the anticipated Tax consequences.

 

 

(c) Buyer, jointly and severally, and the Sold Companies shall indemnify
Seller Parent and its Affiliates and each of its officers, directors,
employees and agents and hold them harmless against (i) all Tax liabilities
of the Sold Companies proximately resulting from any Buyer Tax Act, (ii) all
Tax liabilities with respect to any taxable period (or portions thereof in
the case of a Straddle Period) that begins after the Closing Date and that
are imposed on or in respect

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

58  

 

 

 

 

 


 

of the Sold Companies and all Losses, claims, liabilities, costs, and
expenses relating to such Tax liabilities, (iii) all Tax liabilities and
costs described under the "Additional German Carve-out Indemnification" set
forth in Schedule 2 (and subject to the terms set forth on such Schedule 2),
and (iv) the increased Tax liability imposed as a result of a determination
that the income from the sale of the Carve-out Intellectual Property (as
defined in Schedule 2),is, solely as a result of such Carve-out Intellectual
Property not being transferred to the German Carve-out Newco and instead
being transferred directly to Buyer or its designee pursuant to Schedule 2,
treated as subpart F income (as defined in Section 952 of the Code), to the
extent that such subpart F income exceeds the amount of subpart F income that
would have been realized upon the sale of the German Carve-out Newco in
respect of such Carve-out Intellectual Property if such property had been
transferred to German Carve-out Newco pursuant to the hive down; provided,
however, that amounts for which Buyer is liable to indemnify Seller Parent or
its Affiliates pursuant to this clause (iv) shall be reduced (and promptly
refunded to Buyer) by the following: to the extent Terex European Holdings BV
or any of its Subsidiaries or any non-US direct or indirect shareholder of
Terex European Holding BV makes a distribution or otherwise enters into a
transaction that would, in each case, have caused Seller Parent to include
within three years following the Closing Date an amount equal to the excess
of the United States income taxes that would have been paid by Seller Parent
on such distribution had the gain realized on the sale of the Carve-
out Intellectual Property not been treated as subpart F income over the
United States income taxes that would have been paid by Seller Parent on
such distribution had the gain realized on the sale of the Carve-out
Intellectual Property been treated as subpart F income (the "Tax
Equalization Clawback").

 

 

(d) For purposes of this Section 5.7, in the case of any Taxes that are
payable for a Straddle Period, the portion of such Tax related to the portion
of such Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date shall (i) in
the case of any Taxes imposed on a periodic basis (e.g. ad valorem property
and license fees) other than taxes set forth in clause (ii) below, be deemed
to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Tax period multiplied by a
fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the Tax period
ending as of the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of
days in the entire Tax period, and (ii) in the case of any non-periodic
Taxes, including but not limited to any Tax based upon or related to income,
gains or receipts or based upon or related to employment or sales or use,
value added, and customs duty, be deemed equal to the amount that would be
payable if the relevant Tax period ended as of the Closing Date. Any credits
relating to a Taxable period that begins before and ends after the Closing
Date shall be taken into account as though the relevant Taxable period ended
on the Closing Date. The portion of any credits relating to a Straddle Period
shall be determined as though the relevant taxable period ended on and
included the Closing Date. All determinations necessary to give effect to the
foregoing allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with the past
practice of the Sold Companies. In the case of any written notice by any of
Buyer or its Affiliates indicating that Taxes are due for a Straddle Period
Tax Return, such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the calculations
regarding Seller Parent's share of such Taxes, and if within ten (10)
Business Days after receipt of such notice, Seller Parent notifies Buyer in
writing that it disagrees with the computation of their share of such Taxes,
Seller Parent and Buyer shall proceed in good faith to determine Seller
Parent's share of such Taxes. If Seller Parent and Buyer cannot agree in good
faith on Seller Parent's share within thirty (30) days after receipt of such
notice, Seller Parent's share of such Taxes shall be determined pursuant to
Section 5.7(f), and Seller Parent's payment shall be due three (3) Business
Days after the amount

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

59  

 

 

 

 

 


 

payable is determined by agreement between Seller Parent and Buyer or
pursuant to Section 5.7(f).

 

 

(e) Payment by the indemnitor of any amount due under this Section 5.7 shall
be made within ten (10) Business Days following written notice by the
indemnitee that payment of such amounts to the appropriate Taxing Authority
is due, provided that the indemnitor shall not be required to make any
payment earlier than 5 Business Days before it is due to the appropriate
Taxing Authority. In the case of a Tax that is contested in accordance
with the provisions of Section 5.8 below, payment of the Tax to the
appropriate Taxing Authority shall not be considered to be due earlier than
the date a final determination to such effect is made by the appropriate
Taxing Authority or court; provided, however, that payment of such Tax will
be considered due in all cases if the relevant Tax is required to be paid in
advance of a final determination (including, without limitation, payments
that are required to be made to challenge a proposed adjustment).

 

 

(f) Any disputes between the parties with respect to the Tax matters Section
5.6, Section 5.7, Section 5.8 and Section 5.9 shall be resolved by a national
public accounting firm reasonably satisfactory to Seller Parent and Buyer,
whose fees and expenses shall be borne by the non-prevailing party in such
dispute (it being understood that for purpose of this sentence, a party shall
be deemed to have prevailed in such a dispute if the amount ultimately
determined pursuant to this Section 5.7(f) is within 10% of the amount
claimed by such party to be the correct amount and is not within 10% of the
amount claimed by the other party to be the correct amount) or, if there is
no non-prevailing party, shall be borne equally by the parties in such
dispute.

 

 

SECTION 5.8. Procedures Relating to Indemnity of Tax Claims.

 

 

(a) Seller Parent shall promptly notify Buyer in writing upon receipt of
notice of any pending Tax audits, assessments, or administrative or court
proceedings relating to the Taxes of the Sold Companies. If a claim shall be
made against Buyer or Seller Parent, as the case may be, or any of their
Affiliates by any Taxing Authority, which, if successful, would result in an
indemnity payment to Buyer or Seller Parent, as the case may be, or one of
their Affiliates pursuant to Section 5.7(a) or Section 5.7(c) (a "Tax
Claim"), Buyer or Seller Parent, as the case may be, shall promptly notify
Seller Parent, or Buyer, as the case may be, in writing of such Tax Claim
stating the nature and basis of such Tax Claim and the amount thereof, to the
extent known by Buyer or Seller Parent, as the case may be, provided,
however, that the failure to provide such sufficient written notice shall not
excuse the Buyer or Seller Parent from any of its obligations, except to the
extent that Buyer or Seller Parent, as the case may be, is prejudiced
thereby.

 

 

(b) Subject to Section 5.8(d), with respect to any audit, assessment,
or administrative or court proceeding or similar proceeding ("Tax
Proceeding") that relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Return, Seller Parent shall
control at its expense all proceedings taken in connection with such Tax
Proceeding (including selection of counsel) and, without limiting the
foregoing, may in their sole discretion pursue or forego any and all
administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with any Taxing
Authority with respect thereto and may, in their sole discretion, either pay
the Tax claimed and sue for a refund where applicable Law permits such

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

60  

 

 

 

 

 


 

refund suits or contest the Tax Proceeding in any permissible manner.
With respect to any Tax matter covered by the preceding sentence, Seller
Parent shall not, without the prior written approval of Buyer (which shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), agree or consent to compromise or
settle, either administratively or after the commencement of litigation, any
issue or claim arising in such proceeding, or otherwise agree or consent to
any Tax liability, to the extent that any such compromise, settlement,
consent or agreement may increase the Tax Liability of Buyer or the Sold
Companies or any of their Affiliates for any Tax period beginning on or after
the Closing Date (or portion thereof in the case of a Straddle Period),
unless Seller Parent indemnifies Buyer for the increase in Taxes resulting
from such compromise, settlement, consent or agreement. Buyer shall be
entitled to participate at its own expense in any Tax Proceeding subject to
this Section 5.8(b) to the extent that such Tax Proceeding relates to a Sold
Company, the Business, or the Acquired Assets, provided, however, that Buyer
shall not be entitled to participate in the portion of such Tax Proceeding
that relates to a Tax Return that is not a Stand Alone Pre-Closing Tax Return
or relates to items that are not in connection with the Acquired Assets.

 

 

(c) Subject to Section 5.8(d), with respect to any Tax Proceeding relating to
a Straddle Period Tax Return, Buyer shall control at its expense all
proceedings taken in connection with such Tax Claim (including selection of
counsel) but shall not, without the prior written approval of Seller Parent
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), agree or consent to
compromise or settle, either administratively or after the commencement of
litigation, any issue or claim arising in such proceeding, or otherwise agree
or consent to any Tax liability, to the extent that any such compromise,
settlement, consent or agreement may increase the Taxes for which Seller
Parent would be liable under Section 5.7(a), unless Buyer indemnifies the
Seller Parent for the increase in Taxes resulting from such compromise,
settlement, consent or agreement. Seller Parent shall be entitled to
participate at its own expense in any Tax Proceeding subject to this Section
5.8(c), to the extent that such Tax Proceeding relates to a Sold Company, the
Business, or the Acquired Assets, provided, however, that Seller Parent shall
not be entitled to participate in the portion of such Tax Proceeding that
relates to a Tax Return that is not a Straddle Period Tax Return.

 

 

(d) In the event of any Tax Proceeding that relates to Stand Alone Pre-
Closing Tax Returns and other Tax Returns for periods commencing after the
Closing Date in respect of the Sold Companies or the Acquired Assets, Buyer
and Seller Parent shall attempt to mutually agree (and to the extent Buyer
and Seller Parent cannot agree, the parties shall permit the relevant Taxing
Authority to determine) whether one or more issues can be separated in all
respects (including as to settlements) into (A) those for which Seller Parent
would be liable under Section 5.7(a) and (B) those for which Buyer would be
liable under Section 5.7(c) and, in such case, Seller Parent shall control
the defense of those issues that fall under clause (A) of this sentence,
subject to the provisions of Section 5.8(b), and Buyer shall control the
defense of those issues that fall under clause (B) of this sentence, subject
to the provisions of Section 5.8(c). With respect to all other issues, Buyer
shall have the right to control the defense employing counsel and other
advisors of its choice; provided that (i) Seller Parent shall have the right
to participate at its own expense in the defense with respect to the issues
for which Seller Parent would be liable under Section 5.7(a), (ii) Buyer will
cooperate with Seller in the defense of any such issues, and (iii) Buyer
shall not, without the prior written approval of Seller Parent (which shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), agree or consent to compromise or
settle, either

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

61  

 

 

 

 

 


 

administratively or after the commencement of litigation, any issue or claim
arising in such proceeding, or otherwise agree or consent to any Tax
Liability, to the extent that any such compromise, settlement, consent or
agreement may increase the Taxes for which Seller Parent would be liable
under Section 5.7(a), unless Buyer indemnifies Sellers for the increase in
Taxes resulting from such compromise, settlement, consent or agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall control any Tax Proceeding to the
extent it relates to an issue that is subject to indemnification by Buyer
pursuant to Section 5.7(c)(iv).

 

 

SECTION 5.9. Refunds Any Tax refunds that are received by Buyer, or the
Sold Companies, and any refunds, overpayments, or tax credits credited
against Tax for taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date to which
Buyer or the Sold Companies become entitled, which such refunds, overpayments
or tax credits credited relate to taxable periods of the Sold Companies (or
portions thereof in the case of a Straddle Period) ending on or before the
Closing Date shall be for the account of Seller Parent and Buyer shall pay
over to Seller Parent an amount of cash equal to the actual cash received or
the Tax refund or overpayment actually credited in excess of what it would
have received or had credited in the absence of any such refund or credit
within 15 days of the receipt of such benefit. In addition, to the extent
that a claim for refund, credit or overpayment in connection with any audits,
examinations or Tax proceedings results in a refund or credit against Tax by
a Taxing Authority to Buyer or the Sold Companies of any amount accrued for
any taxable periods (or portions thereof in the case of the Straddle Period)
ending on or before the Closing Date, including any Tax refund or credit
allowable in connection with the Excluded Liabilities or Excluded Assets,
Buyer shall pay an amount of cash equal to the actual cash received, or Tax
refund or overpayment actually credited in excess of what it would have
received in the absence of any such refund or credit within 15 days of the
receipt of such benefit. Buyer agrees that it shall not, without Seller
Parent's consent, cause or permit the Sold Companies to carry back to any
taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date any net operating loss,
loss from operations or other Tax attribute, and further agrees that Seller
Parent has no obligation under this Agreement to return or remit any refund
or other Tax benefit attributable to a breach by Buyer of the
foregoing undertaking. Any Tax refunds that are received by a Share Seller
or any of the Share Seller's Affiliates and any overpayments credited against
Tax to which a Share Seller or any of the Share Seller's Affiliates become
entitled, that relate to taxable periods (or portions thereof in the case of
a Straddle Period) of the Sold Companies ending after the Closing Date shall
be for the account of Buyer, and Seller Parent shall pay over to Buyer an
amount of cash received or the Tax refund actually received by a Share Seller
or any of the Share Seller's Affiliates in excess of what it would have
received in the absence of any such refund or credit within 15 days of the
receipt of such benefit.

 

 

SECTION 5.10. Employment Matters Generally.

 

 

(a) In regard to the Closing (i) where applicable Law or rules provide for
the automatic transfer or continuation of employment of the Business
Employees upon the sale of the Business, (A) Buyer or one of its Affiliates
shall assume and honor all terms and conditions of employment in respect of
the Business Employees to the extent required by Law, (B) Buyer and Parent
Seller agree to take such actions as are reasonably practicable such that the
employment of the Business Employees will transfer to Buyer or its Affiliate
as a matter of law

as of the Closing Date, and, except as otherwise required by Law, (C) Buyer
or one of its Affiliates shall employ each Business Employee at salary and
wages which are reasonably comparable in aggregate value to those payable by
Seller Parent or its Affiliates to such Business Employee immediately prior
to the Closing Date and, as and to the extent required by Law, shall maintain
terms and conditions of employment which are of reasonably comparable
aggregate value to those provided by Seller Parent or its Affiliates
immediately prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) where applicable Law or rules
do not provide for the automatic transfer or continuation of employment of
the Employees upon the sale of the Business, Buyer or one of its Affiliates
shall make an offer of employment, to be effective as of the Closing Date, to
such Business Employees which is of reasonably comparable aggregate value to
the salary, wages and terms and conditions of employment provided by Seller
Parent or its Affiliates to such Business Employees immediately prior to the
Closing Date. Effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer shall, or shall cause
one or more of its Affiliates to, assume each of the collective bargaining
agreements listed or described on Schedule 5.10(a).

 

 

(b) Buyer and Seller Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take
any and all required actions necessary to minimize to the greatest extent
practicable the possibility that severance benefits and/or government-
required termination liabilities shall be payable to a Business Employee
regardless of whether such Business Employee becomes employed by Buyer or one
of its Affiliates or accepts Buyer's or one of its Affiliates' offer of
employment; provided, however, that to the extent the payment of severance
benefits and/or government-required termination liabilities to any such
Business Employee is nevertheless required as a result of the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the consequent transfers
of employment, notwithstanding that Buyer or one of its Affiliates has
employed, or made an offer of employment to, such Business Employee in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such severance benefits and
government-required termination liabilities shall be the sole responsibility
of Buyer. Buyer shall indemnify Seller Parent and its Affiliates and hold
them harmless from and against any Losses which may be incurred or suffered
by any of them in connection with any claim made by a Business Employee for
any reason due to a Business Employee's termination or deemed termination of
employment on or after the Closing Date for any reason.

 

 

SECTION 5.11. U.S. Employment Matters.

 

 

(a) On or prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall, or shall cause one or more
of its Affiliates to, offer employment, with reasonably comparable job
responsibilities as those performed prior to the Closing Date, to each U.S.
Business Employee (other than employees of the Sold Companies, all of whom
shall continue employment with such Sold Company as of the Closing Date by
operation of Law) who is either actively employed by a Seller as of the
Closing Date or is absent from work as of the Closing Date by reason of any
leave of absence.

 

 

(b) Such offers of employment described in Section 5.11(a) shall include an
offer, for a period of not less than one year, of compensation programs that
are of reasonably comparable aggregate value to those as in effect with
respect to such U.S. Business Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date
as previously disclosed. As of the Closing Date or, with respect to any
U.S. Business Employee on a leave of absence, as of the date such U.S.
Business Employee commences active employment with Buyer or its Affiliates or
returns to active

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

63  

 

 

 

 

 


 

employment with a Sold Company, each U.S. Business Employee who accepts
Buyer's offer of employment, each U.S. Business Employee whose employment
automatically transfers to a Buyer by operation of local law, and each
employee of the Sold Companies (herein, collectively referred to as "U.S.
Transferred Employees") shall become an employee of Buyer or one or more of
its Affiliates (or a Sold Company, as applicable).

 

 

(c) During the one year period from and after the Closing, Buyer shall
provide to the U.S. Transferred Employees overall employee benefits that are
of reasonably comparable aggregate value to those provided on average to the
U.S. Transferred Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date as
previously disclosed; provided, however, that any specific provision
regarding employee benefits set forth elsewhere in this Section 5.11 shall
take precedence over the foregoing general obligation with respect to the
benefits that are the subject of such specific provision.

 

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this Agreement shall not
alter the at-will nature of any U.S. Transferred Employee's employment.
Nothing in this Agreement shall restrict, limit or interfere with the ability
(after the Closing) of Buyer or its respective Affiliates to terminate, amend
or replace any particular agreement, plan or program, to alter the terms and
conditions of employment or to terminate the employment of any person,
provided that the requirements of this Section 5.11 are otherwise satisfied.

 

 

(e) Retirement Benefits: Seller Parent shall, effective as of the
Closing Date, cease all contributions in respect of each U.S. Transferred
Employee in Seller Parent's tax-qualified defined contribution plans in which
such individual is then participating. Such tax-qualified Plans that
are individual account plans are set forth on Schedule 3.14(c) ("Seller
Parent's Savings Programs"). As of the Closing Date, Buyer or one of its
Affiliates shall have in effect one or more defined contribution plans
that includes a qualified cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning of
Section 401(k) of the Code ("Buyer's 401(k) Plan"). As soon as practicable
following the Closing Date, to the extent elected by a U.S. Transferred
Employee, Seller Parent agrees to cause the Seller Parent's Savings Programs
to transfer to the Buyer's 401(k) Plan, and Buyer agrees to cause the Buyer's
401(k) Plan to accept "eligible rollover distributions within the meaning of
Section 402(c)(4) of the Code of U.S. Transferred Employees' account balances
(including outstanding Plan loans) under Seller Parent's Savings Programs as
of the valuation date next preceding the date of transfer. Except as
otherwise required under any collective bargaining agreement, as of the
Closing Date, Seller Parent will fully vest the account balances of each U.S.
Transferred Employee (to the extent not then fully vested), if any, under
Seller Parent's Savings Programs.

 

 

(f) Welfare Benefits and COBRA:

 

 

(i) As of the U.S. Transferred Employees Transition Date, Buyer or one of
its Affiliates shall establish and designate a health and welfare plan or
plans providing medical, dental, group life, travel, disability and
accidental and dismemberment insurance coverages or policies for the benefit
of the U.S. Transferred Employees that are of reasonably comparable aggregate
value to the health and welfare plan or plans covering the U.S. Transferred
Employees immediately prior to the Closing (the "Buyer Welfare Plans").
Buyer shall be responsible for all claims incurred by U.S. Transferred
Employees and their spouses/dependents under Buyer

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

64  

 

 

 

 

 


 

Welfare Plans on or after the U.S. Transferred Employees Transition Date, and
Seller Parent shall retain responsibility for all claims incurred by U.S.
Transferred Employees and their spouses/dependents prior to the U.S.
Transferred Employees Transition Date pursuant to the terms of the
Transition Agreement. Reimbursement of U.S. Transferred Employees for
expenses associated with such claims shall be determined in accordance with
the terms of the applicable plans as in effect at the time such claims are
made.

 

 

(ii) Buyer shall, or shall cause their respective Affiliates to, recognize
each U.S. Transferred Employee's service with Seller Parent, the Sold
Companies or their respective Affiliates for purposes of eligibility, vesting
and eligibility waiting periods in Buyer Welfare Plans. In addition, to the
extent pre-existing condition limitations have been met or are otherwise
inapplicable with respect to the U.S. Transferred Employees under Seller
Parent's employee benefit plans as of the U.S. Transferred Employees
Transition Date, Buyer shall, or shall cause its respective Affiliates to,
waive any such pre-existing condition under Buyer Welfare Plans applicable to
the U.S. Transferred Employees, and shall recognize the dollar amount of all
expenses incurred by the U.S. Transferred Employees and their respective
spouses or dependents during the calendar year in which the U.S. Transferred
Employees Transition Date occurs for purposes of satisfying the deductibles
and co-payment or out-of-pocket limitations for such calendar year under
Buyer Welfare Plans.

 

 

(iii) Buyer shall assume the liability for all M andA Qualified Beneficiaries
of the Sellers (as that term is defined in 26 C.F.R. Section 54.4980B-9 Q and A
4) under Seller Parent's group health plan. On a monthly basis following the
Closing, Seller Parent shall notify Buyer of any and all actual
costs incurred by Seller Parent's group health plan on account the MandA
Qualified Beneficiaries referenced herein, less the aggregate premiums
actually received from the MandA Qualified Beneficiaries for such coverage (the
"Net COBRA Cost"). Upon receipt thereof, Buyer shall timely remit payment to
Seller Parent's group health plan in an amount equal to the Net COBRA Cost.

 

 

(g) Buyer's workers' compensation program shall be responsible for all claims
for benefits which are incurred on or after the Closing Date by participating
U.S. Transferred Employees. Seller Parent's workers' compensation
program shall be responsible for all claims for benefits which are incurred
prior to the Closing Date by participating U.S. Transferred Employees.

 

 

(h) Labor matters:

 

 

(i) Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, at any time prior
to 90 days after the Closing Date, effectuate a "Plant Closing" or "Mass
Layoff," as those terms are defined in the WARN Act, affecting in whole or in
part any site of employment, facility, operating unit or employee with
respect to the Business. Seller Parent agrees that between the date hereof
and the Closing Date, it will cause the Sold Companies and the Asset Sellers
in respect of the Business not to effect or permit a "Plant Closing" or "Mass
Layoff" as these terms are defined in the WARN Act without notifying Buyer in
advance and without complying with the notice requirements and all other
provisions of the WARN Act.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

65  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(ii) Buyer and Seller Parent shall, and Seller Parent shall cause the other
Sellers and the Sold Companies to, cooperate in connection with any required
notifications as required in accordance with Section 5.15.

 

 

(i) A breach by Buyer or Seller Parent of their respective obligations under
this Section 5.11 shall give rise to an obligation by the breaching party
to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the non-breaching party from and
against any and all damages incurred thereby or caused thereto under or
pursuant to the WARN Act based on, arising out of, resulting from or relating
to any act or omission to act by or of the breaching party with regard to any
single site of employment, facility, operating unit or employee of the
breaching party.

 

 

SECTION 5.12. Non-U.S. Employment Matters.

 

 

(a) Effective as of the Effective Time, in accordance with the principles set
forth in Section 5.10(a), Buyer or one of its Affiliates shall offer
employment to or shall continue the employment of Business Employees who are
employed outside of the United States ("Non-U.S. Employees") with
compensation programs of reasonably comparable aggregate value to those as in
effect with respect to such Non-U.S. Employees immediately prior to
the Effective Time (or the same as may be required by Law) for a period of
not less than one year following the Effective Time, and shall grant to
Non-U.S. Employees who become Transferred Employees ("Non-U.S.
Transferred Employees") reasonably comparable in the aggregate terms and
conditions of employment (or the same as may be required by Law) as are in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time for a period not less than
that provided for by local country Law. In addition, for a period of not less
than one year following the Effective Time, Buyer or one of its Affiliates
shall maintain employee benefit plans, programs, policies and arrangements
for Non-U.S. Transferred Employees (other than the features of any plans
or arrangements based on employer equity securities) that, with respect to
those set forth on Schedule 5.12(a) that Seller Parent and its Affiliates
have in effect at the Effective Time for Non-U.S. Employees, are of
reasonably comparable aggregate value; provided, however, that nothing herein
is intended to require Buyer to provide terms and conditions of employment
after the Effective Time that would conflict or otherwise be inconsistent
with the requirements of local country Law.

 

 

(b) Non-U.S. Employee Benefit Plans:

 

 

(i) Effective as of the Effective Time, except as may otherwise be provided
in the Transition Agreement, Buyer or one of its Affiliates shall establish
and qualify or register with applicable regulatory authorities employee
benefit plans, programs, policies and arrangements for, or shall extend or
transfer existing employee benefit plans, programs, policies and arrangements
of Buyer to, the Non-U.S. Transferred Employees which are in accordance with
local Law and which provide benefits to such Employees on terms and
conditions consistent with Section 5.10 and Section 5.11 hereof.

 

 

(ii) Effective as of the Effective Time, except as may otherwise be provided
in the Transition Agreement, Non-U.S. Transferred Employees shall cease to be
active participants in any Benefit Plans of Seller Parent or its Affiliates
and all such persons shall become eligible to participate in such Benefit
Plans to be established by Buyer or one of its Affiliates in connection with
Buyer's obligations hereunder.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

66  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(iii) Effective as of the Effective Time, except as may otherwise be provided
in the Transition Agreement, all liabilities in connection with Non-U.S.
Transferred Employees and their eligible dependents under any of Seller
Parent's or its Affiliates' Benefit Plans covering such Non-U.S. Transferred
Employees and all security means and pension assets attributable to the
liabilities shall be transferred to Buyer.

 

 

(iv) Effective as of the Effective Time, should local law require that Buyer
or one of its Affiliates having become the sponsor and participant to a
Benefits Plan are required to cease participation in that plan, then Buyer or
one of its Affiliates shall take receipt of all of the assets and liabilities
attributable under local Law to its sponsorship of that Benefits Plan and
transfer these to another suitable Benefits Plan of Buyer or its Affiliates.
All Non-U.S. Transferred Employees affected by such transfers of assets and
liabilities will have all their benefits secured with Buyer or an
Affiliate\'s Benefit Plan and such persons shall be eligible to participate
in that same Benefits Plan in connection with Buyer\'s obligations hereunder.

 

 

(v) Effective as of the Effective Time, Buyer or its Affiliates shall become
liable for any and all unfunded liabilities of Non-U.S. Benefit Plans,
including those arising from the operation of the U.K. Pensions Act 1995,
including any and all liabilities related to Section 75 or Section 75A
thereof or any regulations made under either section and/or any re-enactment
or replacement thereof, and the German Act on Company Pensions (Gesetz zur
verbesserung der betrieblichen Altersversorgung, BetrAVG), which relate to
the sponsorship or participation of Buyer or its Affiliates in any Benefits
Plan. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer or its Affiliates shall assume
liability for any and all unfunded liabilities associated with the Terex
Pension Scheme - Halco Section (UK) (not the remainder of the Terex Pension
Scheme unrelated to Halco) and the Terex OandK GmbH Pension Scheme, relating to
all participants covered by such plans, including deferred vested members and
retirees.

 

 

(c) Employment Liabilities:

 

 

(i) Buyer shall be responsible for all claims incurred by Non-U.S.
Transferred Employees and their eligible spouses/dependents under health and
welfare plans covering Non-U.S. Transferred Employees on or after the
Applicable Non-U.S. Transferred Employees Transition Date, and Seller Parent
shall retain responsibility for all claims incurred by Non-U.S. Transferred
Employees and their eligible spouses/dependents prior to the Applicable
Non-U.S. Transferred Employees Transition Date pursuant to the terms of the
Transition Agreement. Reimbursement of Non-U.S. Transferred Employees
for expenses associated with such claims shall be determined in accordance
with the terms of the applicable plans in effect at the time such claims
are made.

 

 

(ii) Buyer shall be responsible for all workers' compensation claims of any
Non-U.S. Transferred Employee after the Effective Time. Seller Parent shall
be responsible for all workers' compensation claims of any Non-U.S.
Transferred Employee prior to the Effective Time.

 

 

SECTION 5.13. Vacation. With respect to all Transferred Employees, Buyer
will recognize all accrued and unused vacation days which are reflected and
have been accrued as "accrued expenses" in the Closing Statements, and will
allow the Transferred Employees to take

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

67  

 

 

 

 

 


 

such accrued vacation days which have accrued to such Transferred Employee
following the Closing Date in accordance with the policies of the Business,
as in effect from time to time following the Closing Date subject always to
applicable Law.

 

 

SECTION 5.14. No Third Party Beneficiaries. No agreement between the
parties hereto nor any action by Seller Parent, Buyer or their Affiliates
shall be deemed to create any third party beneficiary rights in any employees
of Seller Parent, Buyer, or any Affiliate of either, and no Person other than
the parties hereto shall have any rights to enforce any provision hereof.

 

 

SECTION 5.15. Employee Notifications. Where required under applicable Law,
Buyer and Seller Parent shall, and Seller Parent shall cause the other
Sellers or the Sold Companies prior to the Closing Date (or the date of a
deferred closing, as contemplated by Section 2.10), to, properly and timely
notify, or where appropriate, consult or negotiate with, employees, employee
representatives, the local works council, union, labor board or any relevant
governmental agency concerning the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In the event any payment is required in lieu of such notice,
Seller Parent shall bear such expense.

 

 

SECTION 5.16. Contact with Customers and Suppliers. During the Pre-Closing
Period, Buyer and Seller Parent shall cooperate in communicating with the
Sold Companies' and Asset Sellers' customers, suppliers, dealers
and licensors concerning the transactions contemplated hereby, including
Buyer's intentions concerning the operation of the Business following
the Closing. During the Pre-Closing Period, Buyer and its
representatives shall contact or communicate with the customers, suppliers,
dealers and licensors of the Business in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby only with the prior written consent of Seller Parent,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld and may be conditioned upon a
designee of Seller Parent being present at any such meeting or conference.
For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 5.16 shall prohibit Buyer
from contacting the customers, suppliers, dealers and licensors of the
Business in the ordinary course of Buyer's businesses for the purpose of
selling products of Buyer's businesses or for any other purpose unrelated to
the Business and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

SECTION 5.17. Use of Trademarks.

 

 

(a) Buyer shall have the right to use, for a period of six (6) months
following the Closing Date, the "Terex" name and logo. Without limiting the
prior sentence, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Sold Companies to, take
reasonable measures to transition away from using the "Terex" name and logo
as soon after Closing as practicable. No other use of the Sellers' or any of
their Affiliates' (except for the Sold Companies) trademarks, service marks,
trade names and domain names is permitted. All rights under the
first sentence of this Section 5.17 shall terminate six (6) months after the
Closing Date. Buyer shall cause each Sold Company, or division of
the Business, that has the name "Terex" or any confusingly similar name
thereof, in its corporate or trade name to take all necessary action,
including the filing of any documents required to be filed with any
governmental authority, to effect (within six (6) months of the Closing Date)
a change of its corporate or trade name, as the case may be, not to include
the name "Terex", or the equivalent or corresponding trademark or name in a
foreign jurisdiction (e.g. Terex's Chinese character trademark or name), or
words confusingly similar to thereto.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

68  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Seller
Parent, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, grants to Buyer and its
Affiliates, a non-assignable, non-sublicensable, royalty-free, non-exclusive
license (i) to use the "Terex" name and logo in an incidental manner on any
equipment or fixtures with respect to the Acquired Assets or the Business,
which items are not readily removable or the "Terex" name and logo are not
readily removable from such items, until such items are refurbished or
replaced in the Ordinary Course of Business; (ii) to use tools, dies,
printing plates, and molds acquired by Buyer (or its Affiliates) hereunder
which, as of Closing, cause any of the "Terex" name and logo to be cast,
struck or molded into, or printed upon, products currently being produced by
or for the Business until such tools, dies, printing plates, and molds are
refurbished in the Ordinary Course of Business and (iii) to sell products
manufactured with the use of such tools, dies, printing plates, and molds
until such products have been sold in the Ordinary Course of Business
(including all Inventory existing as of the Closing Date or created within
six (6) months thereafter, following which Buyer may use such plates and
molds but shall not actively use Seller Parent's trademarks). Buyer and its
Affiliates shall in any event phase out such use of the "Terex" name and logo
from such equipment, fixtures, tools, dies, printing plates, and molds as
soon as is reasonably practicable but in no event later than two (2) years
following the Closing, and, subject to the foregoing, shall remove the cast
for the "Terex" name and logo from each such tool, die or mold on the first
occasion after the Closing Date when such tool, die or mold is refurbished by
Buyer or its Affiliates in the Ordinary Course of Business. For the avoidance
of doubt, any such tools, dies, printing plates, and molds acquired by Buyer
(or its Affiliates) hereunder that cause any of the "Terex" name and logo to
be cast, struck or molded into, or printed upon, products may be used for any
purpose, provided that the cast for the "Terex" name and logo is removed or
otherwise permanently deleted from it. Buyer agrees that products of the
Business manufactured following the Closing Date bearing the "Terex" name and
logo will be consistent with past practice and of a standard of quality
equivalent in all material respects to the standard of quality for such
products existing prior to the Closing Date. Buyer further agrees that it
will not, and will cause its Affiliates not to, use the "Terex" name and logo
in its sales, marketing or other promotional materials after six (6) months
after the Closing Date.

 

 

SECTION 5.18. Credit and Performance Support Obligations. Seller Parent
agrees to take any and all actions reasonably necessary to transfer
and assign to Buyer any guaranties, bank guarantees, letters of credit,
performance bonds, advance payment bonds, bid bonds or warranty bonds and
other similar items ("Credit Support Agreements") issued and outstanding in
connection with or for the benefit of the Business of the Sold Companies or
in respect of the Acquired Assets that are assignable or transferable. Buyer
agrees to take any and all actions reasonably necessary (and Seller Parent
and its Affiliates will cooperate with Buyer) to cause Seller Parent and its
Affiliates (other than the Sold Companies) to be absolutely and
unconditionally relieved on or prior to the Closing Date of all Liabilities
arising out of any Credit Support Agreements, including by causing Buyer or
its Affiliate to be substituted in all respects for Seller Parent and its
Affiliates in respect of such liabilities and obligations, in each case to
the extent such relief and/or substitution is permitted under the Credit
Support Agreements, and Buyer shall indemnify Seller Parent and its
Affiliates (other than the Sold Companies) against any Losses of any kind
whatsoever with respect to such liabilities and obligations. To the extent
that Seller Parent and its Affiliates are not absolutely and unconditionally
relieved of all such liabilities and obligations on or prior to the Closing
Date, (i) Buyer agrees to continue to take any and all actions reasonably
necessary to absolutely and unconditionally relieve Seller Parent and

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

69  

 

 

 

 

 


 

its Affiliates of all such Liabilities as promptly as practicable after the
Closing Date, (ii) indemnify Seller Parent and Affiliates (other than the
Sold Companies) in form and substance as reasonably acceptable to Seller
Parent with respect to any such Liabilities under the Credit Support
Agreements and (iii) cause a letter of credit to be issued, in form and
substance and from a financial institution reasonably satisfactory to Seller
Parent, naming Seller Parent and its Affiliates as beneficiaries, as security
for any Liabilities under the Credit Support Agreement, provided, however,
Buyer shall not be required to arrange for such letter of credit in support
of any indemnity of an unsecured Seller Parent guarantee where failure to
have such letter of credit would not affect Seller Parent's liquidity under
its credit facility or other similar arrangement, until such time as Seller
Parent have been relieved of any such Liabilities. Any costs associated with
any termination of the Credit Support Agreements shall be borne by Seller
Parent and any costs associated with the implementation of new or substituted
arrangements of Buyer shall be borne by Buyer.

 

 

SECTION 5.19. Directors and Officers; Organizational Documents.

 

 

(a) Each Share Seller, at the request of Buyer, shall use reasonable efforts
to cause each of the directors and officers (other than any Transferred
Employees) of each Sold Company to resign or be removed from all director and
officer positions with the Sold Companies effective at the Closing and shall
request that, to the extent permitted by Law, such resignation include a
release by such director or officer of any and all rights and claims (other
than any claims that are Assumed Liabilities) against such Sold Companies to
the extent permitted by law.

 

 

(b) Each Share Seller shall use its reasonable efforts to cause each Sold
Company to amend to the extent practicable, effective at the Closing, its
memorandum, articles of incorporation or association, bylaws or similar
organizational documents as reasonably requested by Buyer to the extent
permitted by Law. Any filing fees or other costs and expenses in connection
with such amendments shall be borne by Buyer.

 

 

SECTION 5.20. Further Assurances. (a) Subject to Section 5.4, each of the
parties hereto shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all appropriate action, do or cause to be done all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law, and execute and deliver
such documents and other papers, as reasonably requested by the other party
and necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Without limiting the foregoing, subject to the provisions of Section 5.4,
after the Closing Date each of Buyer and Seller Parent at the reasonable
request of the other shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and
delivered, to or as directed by, and at the reasonable expense of, the
requesting party (i) such assignments, deeds, bills of sale and
other instruments of transfer as either party reasonably may request as
necessary or desirable in order to effect or further evidence the sale and
assignment of the Acquired Assets to Buyer or its Affiliates, and the
retention of the Excluded Assets by Seller Parent as specified in Section
2.1, and (ii) such assumption agreements (including assumption agreements in
relation to specific Acquired Contracts (including such assumption agreements
expressly for the benefit of the counterparties thereto)) and other
instruments of assumption as either party may reasonably request as necessary
or desirable in order to effect or further evidence Buyer's assumption of,
and agreement to pay, perform and discharge when due, the Assumed
Liabilities, or to obtain

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

70

with respect to the Assumed Liabilities, in each case as specified in
Section 2.2.

 

 

(b) To the extent that, from time to time after the Closing, Buyer or any of
the Sellers shall identify Acquired Assets that are in the possession of
Seller Parent or the other Sellers, or Excluded Assets that are in the
possession of Buyer, the Party in possession of those Acquired Assets or
Excluded Assets shall use commercially reasonable efforts to locate such
Acquired Assets or Excluded Assets, as the case may be, and, to the extent
successful in locating such items, take such action as is reasonably
necessary to put the Party entitled to such Assets in actual possession
thereof (it being understood and agreed that delivery thereof to the nearest
facility of such Party shall in any event suffice).

 

 

(c) Each of Seller Parent and Buyer shall retain and cause its Subsidiaries
to retain all Books and Records that relate to the Business and are in
existence as of the Closing Date that are held by such party following the
Closing in accordance with the existing document retention policy of such
party as made available to the other party and to make personnel available
(without undue disruption of employment or such party's operations) to the
extent that access is reasonably related to the Business (as operated by
Seller Parent or Buyer) and necessary for the requesting party to comply with
Applicable Law or is necessary or useful in connection with any Tax inquiry,
audit, investigation or dispute, any litigation or investigation or any other
matter requiring any such Books and Records, information or employees for any
reasonable business purpose. Each party will use commercially reasonable
efforts to inform the other party prior to the destruction of any such Books
and Records in accordance with its document retention policies and will
cooperate in taking steps reasonably requested by the requesting party (at
the requesting party's expense) to preserve such Books and Records.

 

 

SECTION 5.21. Intercompany Debt. To the extent that there are receivables
or payables (other than intercompany trade accounts payable and receivable
created in the Ordinary Course of Business or set forth on the Net Asset
Value Statement) between the Sold Companies, on the one hand, and Seller
Parent or the Sellers or any of their Affiliates, on the other hand, all such
payables shall be paid and satisfied by the party that is the obligor on or
prior to the Closing Date.

 

 

SECTION 5.22. Expenses; Transfer Taxes. (a) Whether or not the Closing

(c) The costs of recording documents conveying title from Seller Parent or
another Seller to Buyer (including deeds and assignments, as well as any

and expiring on the Non-compete Expiration Date, neither it nor any of
its Affiliates shall compete, either directly or indirectly, alone or with
others, as stockholders or otherwise, with the Business; provided that
nothing in this Section 5.27(b) shall restrict Seller Parent from (i) owning
up to 5% of the outstanding voting stock of any Person competing with the
Business provided that such ownership interest shall be passive and no
officer or employee of Seller Parent or any of its Subsidiaries shall be
engaged in the management or serve as a director, officer or employee of such

a Terex brand, trademark or tradename in connection with any business that
competes with the Business prior to the tenth (10th) anniversary of the

and scope. If the final judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of this Section 5.27 is
invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree that the court making the
determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to
reduce the scope, duration, or area of the term or provision, to delete
specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable
term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified.
The parties acknowledge that the consideration to be delivered at the Closing
is sufficient consideration for the enforcement of this Section 5.27.

damage the reputation or goodwill of Buyer, its Affiliates, the Business, the
Sold Companies or the Products; provided that Seller Parent may make any

proprietary information regarding the Business or any of the Acquired Assets,
or (B) trade secrets primarily regarding the Business, in each case only to
the extent permitted by Law and the applicable non-disclosure or
confidentiality agreement. Buyer will reimburse Seller Parent for its
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses associated with enforcing such agreements.
For a period of two (2) years following the Closing Date, Seller Parent
shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to hold all non-public
information of the Business in strict confidence and may use or disclose any

the Sellers any such individual Loss that is $500,000 or less,

 

 

(ii) none of the Buyer Indemnified Persons shall be entitled to recover from
the Sellers any such Losses unless and until the total of all such Losses
which individually exceed $500,000 collectively exceeds $13,000,000, and then
only for the amount by which such Losses collectively exceed $13,000,000,
provided, however, if Buyer incurs an individual Loss in excess of $500,000
arising from Seller Parent or its Affiliates entering into a Material
Contract in violation of Section 5.1, then Buyer may recover for the full
amount of such Loss, and

 

 

(iii) the Buyer Indemnified Persons shall not be entitled to recover more, in

warranty of Buyer contained in this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or

in connection with Losses for which it has received indemnification, such
party shall refund to the indemnifying party the amount of such insurance
proceeds or other proceeds when received, up to the amount of indemnification
received, net of any actual out-of-pocket costs or expenses in securing or
obtaining such proceeds. An indemnified party shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to pursue insurance claims with respect to any Losses.

 

 

(b) Indemnifiable Losses shall in no event include any special,
indirect, incidental, punitive or consequential damages whatsoever.

 

 

(c) Seller Parent and Buyer agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to

SECTION 9.5. Survival. The representations and warranties of the parties
contained in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant hereto

except that the representations and warranties contained in (i) Section 3.1
(Organization), Section 3.2(a) (Authorization), Section 4.1 (Organization)
and Section 4.2(a) (Authorization) shall survive indefinitely, (ii) Section
3.17 (Environmental Matters) shall survive for a period of three (3) years
after the Closing Date and (iii) Section 3.12 (Tax Matters) shall survive
until 30 days following the expiration of the applicable statute of

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

80  

 

 

 

 

 


 

limitations; provided, that such representations and warranties shall survive
beyond such period with respect to any breach thereof if written notice
thereof shall have been duly given within such period in accordance with
Section 9.6 hereof.

 

 

SECTION 9.6. Notice and Opportunity to Defend. (a) If there occurs an event
which a party asserts is an indemnifiable event pursuant to Section 9.1 or
Section 9.2, the party or parties seeking indemnification
(the "Indemnified Party") shall notify the other party or parties obligated
to provide indemnification (the "Indemnifying Party") promptly, provided,
however, that the failure to provide such written notice shall not excuse the
Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this Article IX except
to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced thereby.

 

 

(b) If any third party notifies any party hereto with respect to any matter
which may give rise to a claim for indemnification under this Agreement
against the other party hereto, then the Indemnified Party will notify the
Indemnifying Party thereof in writing promptly, but in no event later than 30
days following the Indemnified Party's receipt of such notice, stating the
nature and basis of any claim made by the third party; provided, that no
delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in notifying the Indemnifying
Party will relieve the Indemnifying Party from any obligation hereunder
except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced thereby.
Within 30 days after receiving such notice, the Indemnifying Party shall give
written notice to the Indemnified Party stating whether it disputes the claim
for indemnification and whether it will defend against any third party claim
or liability at its own cost and expense. In the event that the Indemnifying
Party notifies the Indemnified Party that it desires to defend the
Indemnified Party against such third party claim or liability, the
Indemnifying Party shall only be entitled to direct the defense against a
third party claim or liability with counsel selected by it (subject to the
consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld) as long as the Indemnifying Party is conducting a good faith and
diligent defense (it being agreed that counsel for an Indemnifying Party's
insurer shall be deemed consented to by the Indemnified Party). The
Indemnifying Party shall not (x) consent to the entry of a judgment with
respect to any matter or (y) enter into any settlement which, in either case,
does not include a provision whereby the plaintiff or claimant in the matter
releases the Indemnified Party from all liability with respect thereto. The
Indemnified Party shall at all times have the right to fully participate in
the defense of a third party claim or liability at its own expense directly
or through counsel; provided, however, that if (i) the named parties to an
action or proceeding include both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party and (ii) the Indemnified Party is advised in writing by its outside
counsel that representation of both parties by the same counsel would
be inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct, then, in
such event, the Indemnified Party may engage separate counsel (subject to the
consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld) for such action or proceeding at the reasonable expense of the
Indemnifying Party. If an Indemnifying Party (i) elects not to defend against
a third party claim, (ii) fails to timely notify the Indemnified Party that
the Indemnifying Party will defend against a third party claim or
(iii) fails to commence, or if commenced, fails to prosecute, a diligent
defense of a third party claim, then in either of such event, the Indemnified
Party shall have the right, at the reasonable expense of the Indemnifying
Party, to undertake the defense of such claim (with counsel selected by the
Indemnified Party and reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party), and
to compromise or settle such claim, with the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. If
a third

party claim or liability is one that by its nature cannot be defended solely
by the Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party shall make available
such information and assistance as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably
request and shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such defense, at
the expense of the Indemnifying Party.

 

 

SECTION 9.7. Payments. The Indemnifying Party shall pay all amounts payable
pursuant to this Article IX, by wire transfer of immediately available funds,
promptly following receipt from an Indemnified Party of a bill, together with
all accompanying reasonably detailed back-up documentation reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnifying Party, for a Loss that is the subject of
indemnification hereunder, unless the Indemnifying Party in good faith
disputes the Loss, in which event it shall so notify the Indemnified Party.
In any event, the Indemnifying Party shall pay to the Indemnified Party, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds, the amount of any Loss for
which it is liable hereunder no later than three (3) Business Days following
any final determination of such Loss and the Indemnifying Party's liability
therefor. A "final determination" shall exist when (i) the parties to the
dispute have reached an agreement in writing, (ii) a court of competent
jurisdiction shall have entered a final and nonappealable order or judgment,
or (iii) an arbitration or like panel shall have rendered a final
nonappealable determination with respect to disputes the parties have agreed
to submit thereto.

 

 

SECTION 9.8. Tax Indemnity. Other than as specifically set forth in Section
9.9, indemnification with respect to Taxes shall be governed by Section 5.6,
Section 5.7, Section 5.8 and Section 5.9. Seller Parent and Buyer agree to
treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to Article V or Article IX hereof
as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for federal, state, local and foreign
income Tax purposes.

 

 

SECTION 9.9. Other Limitations on Indemnification. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no Buyer Indemnified Person
shall be entitled to indemnification under Article V or IX for any Losses to
the extent that such Losses are reflected as a liability of the Business
on the Final Statement of Net Asset Value.

 

 

ARTICLE X

 

 

MISCELLANEOUS

 

 

SECTION 10.1. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be construed under and
governed by the Laws of the State of New York.

 

 

SECTION 10.2. Projections. In connection with Buyer's investigation of the
Sold Companies and the Business, Buyer may have received, or may receive,
from Seller Parent and/or their respective representatives certain
projections and other forecasts for the Business, and certain business plan
and budget information. Buyer acknowledges that (i) there are uncertainties
inherent in attempting to make such projections, forecasts, plans and
budgets, (ii) Buyer is familiar with such uncertainties, (iii) Buyer is
taking full responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and
accuracy of all estimates, projections, forecasts, plans and budgets so
furnished to it, and (iv) Buyer will not assert any claim against Seller
Parent or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, Affiliates
or representatives, or hold Seller Parent or any such Persons liable, with
respect to such projections, forecasts, business plans and

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

82  

 

 

 

 

 


 

budget information. Accordingly, Buyer acknowledges that Seller Parent
makes no representation or warranty with respect to such projections,
forecasts, business plans or budget information and that Seller Parent makes
only those representations and warranties explicitly set forth in Article
III.

 

 

SECTION 10.3. Materiality; Schedules. (a) As used in this Agreement, unless
the terms otherwise provide or the context otherwise requires, the terms
"material" and the concept of the "material" nature of an effect upon the
Sold Companies or the Business shall be measured relative to the entire
Business, taken as a whole, as such business is currently being conducted.

 

 

(b) There have been included in the Schedules and may be included elsewhere
in this Agreement items which are not "material" within the meaning of the
immediately preceding sentence for informational purposes and in order to
avoid any misunderstanding, and such inclusion shall not be deemed to be an
agreement by the Sellers that such items are "material" or to further define
the meaning of such term for purposes of this Agreement. With respect to
the Schedules hereto, the disclosures made on any Schedule with respect to
any representation or warranty shall be deemed to be made with respect to any
other representation or warranty to which it relates.

 

 

SECTION 10.4. Amendment. This Agreement may not be amended, modified or
supplemented except upon the execution and delivery of a written agreement
executed by the parties hereto.

 

 

SECTION 10.5. Waiver. Any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement,
which may be lawfully waived, may be waived in writing at any time by each
party which is entitled to the benefits thereof. Any waiver of any of the
provisions of this Agreement by any party hereto shall be binding only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. No failure
to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to or shall
constitute a waiver of such provision and no waiver of any of the provisions
of this Agreement shall be deemed to or shall constitute a waiver of any
other provision hereof (whether or not similar) nor shall such waiver
constitute a continuing waiver.

 

 

SECTION 10.6. Assignment. This Agreement and the rights and obligations
hereunder shall not be assignable or transferable by any Buyer or any Seller
(including by operation of law in connection with a merger or consolidation
of any Buyer or any Seller) without the prior written consent of the other
parties hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to Closing, Buyer
may assign its right to purchase the Acquired Assets, the Sold Shares or any
of its other rights or any portion thereof hereunder to one or more
Affiliates of such Buyer without the prior written consent of Seller Parent
provided that such assignment (i) shall not relieve Buyer of its obligations
hereunder, (ii) will not render a representation of Buyer hereunder untrue,
and (iii) does not adversely impact or delay the obtaining of any material
Consent required by this Agreement to be obtained, or otherwise hinder or
delay the completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Seller Parent hereby consents to the collateral assignment of any claims of
any Buyer under this Agreement to any banks or other lenders under such
Buyer's senior secured credit agreements. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Seller Parent may, or may cause its Affiliates, to transfer assets, create
holding companies or

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

83  

 

 

 

 

 


 

otherwise restructure the Business to facilitate the sale to Buyer, so long
as such restructuring does not adversely affect Buyer.

SECTION 10.10. Publicity; Confidentiality. 

 

 

(a) The Sellers and Buyer will consult with each other and will mutually
agree upon any publication or press release of any nature with respect to
this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements, the Closing Agreements or the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and shall not issue any such
publication or press release prior to such consultation and agreement except
as may be required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with any securities exchange or any securities exchange
regulation of any securities exchange upon which the securities of one of the
parties is listed, in which case the party proposing to issue such
publication or press release shall make reasonable efforts to consult in good
faith with the other party or parties before issuing any such publication or
press release and shall provide a copy thereof to the other party or parties
prior to such issuance.

 

 

(b) Except as requested or required by applicable Law (including securities
laws of any applicable jurisdiction and rules and regulations of any
applicable stock exchange) or legal, judicial or regulatory process, from and
after the date hereof, the parties hereto shall each keep confidential and

accountants, advisors, agents and other representatives) the terms and
conditions of this Agreement or any Closing Agreement.

 

 

SECTION 10.11. Headings. The headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement.

 

 

SECTION 10.12. Severability. Any provision of this Agreement which is
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability, without affecting in any way the remaining provisions
hereof in such jurisdiction or rendering that or any other provision of this
Agreement invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any other jurisdiction.

 

 

SECTION 10.13. Third Parties. Nothing herein expressed or implied is
intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any Person, other
than the parties hereto and their permitted successors or assigns, any rights
or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement.

 

 

SECTION 10.14. Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial . Each of the
parties irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York located in
the borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, or if such court does not
have jurisdiction, the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York
County, for the purposes of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out
of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby. Each of the
parties further agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or
document to such party's respective address listed above in one of the
manners set forth in Section 10.7 hereof shall be deemed in every respect
effective service of process in any such suit, action or proceeding. Nothing
herein shall affect the right of any Person to serve process in any other
manner permitted by Law. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and
unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of any action,
suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby in (a) the United States District Court for the Southern

with respect thereto.

 

 

SECTION 10.15. Enforcement of Agreement. Each party acknowledges and agrees
that, prior to Closing, the other party would be irreparably damaged if any

alone. Accordingly, in addition to any other right or remedy to which any
party may be entitled at law or in equity, prior to Closing it shall be
entitled to enforce any provision of this Agreement by a decree of specific
performance and to temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of any of the provisions of this
Agreement, without posting any bond or other undertaking.
