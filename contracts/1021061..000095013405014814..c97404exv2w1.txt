Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations,
warranties and agreements in connection with the Merger and the other

Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any
holder of any shares of Company Capital Stock (as defined in this Section
2.1(g)):   (a) Conversion of Merger Sub Stock. Each issued and  outstanding
share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Merger  Sub shall be
converted into one validly issued, fully paid and  nonassessable share of
common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the  Surviving Corporation and
shall constitute the only shares of capital  stock of the Surviving
Corporation outstanding immediately after the  Effective Time.    2   
(b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock. All shares of Company  Common Stock (as
defined in Section 2.1(c)) that are owned by the  Company as treasury stock
and all shares of Company Common Stock that  are owned, directly or
indirectly, by Parent or Company (other than  shares of Company Common Stock
held directly or indirectly in trust  accounts, managed accounts and the like
or otherwise held in a  fiduciary capacity for the benefit of third parties
("Trust Account  Shares")) shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and  no stock of Parent, cash or other consideration shall be
delivered in  exchange therefor.   (c) Conversion of Common Stock. Subject
to Section 2.3 with  regard to Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section
2.3(a)), each share  of Common Stock, par value $.01 per share, of the
Company (the "Company  Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the  Effective Time (other than as provided in Section 2.1(b)),
shall be  converted into the right to receive $15.00 in cash to be
distributed in  accordance with Section 2.2, without interest (the "Per
Common Share  Price"); provided, however, that if the Effective Time occurs
after  December 9, 2005, then the Per Common Share Price shall instead be
the  amount set forth in Annex 2.1. All such shares of Company Common Stock 
shall otherwise no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be 
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist. The Company will amend  the
terms of any existing restricted stock agreements with respect to 
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock that do not provide for 
acceleration of termination of restrictions in connection with the  Merger
such that all such restrictions will terminate as of the  Effective Time.  
(d) Conversion of Company Series C Preferred Stock. Subject to  Section 2.3
with regard to Dissenting Shares, all of the shares of  Series C Perpetual
Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $.01 per  share, of the Company (the
"Company Series C Preferred Stock") issued  and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be  converted into the right to receive in the
aggregate $682,561,140.00 in  cash to be distributed in accordance with
Section 2.2, without  interest; provided, however, that if the Effective Time
occurs after  December 9, 2005, then all of the shares of Company Series C
Preferred  Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time  shall be converted into the right to receive in the aggregate the 
amount set forth in Annex 2.1. All such shares of the Company Series C 
Preferred Stock shall otherwise no longer be outstanding and shall 
automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist.   (e)
Cancellation and Conversion of Company Stock Options. Each  option to
purchase Company Common Stock (a "Company Stock Option") that  is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether or not  exercisable) shall
be cancelled as of the Effective Time, in exchange  for the right to receive
a single lump sum cash payment equal to the  excess, if any, of (i) the
product of the Per Common Share Price and  the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company  Stock Option over (ii) the product of
the exercise price per share with  respect to each share of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company  Stock Option and the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject  to such Company Stock Option, such lump sum
cash payment to be made  less any applicable withholding tax at the Effective
Time     3    or, if consent or approval of the Office of the
Comptroller of the  Currency ("OCC") or the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation ("FDIC")  is required for such lump sum cash payment, at such
time as such  consent or approval is obtained (but in no event before the
Effective  Time), and subject in that case to any conditions, requirements
or  restrictions imposed by the OCC or the FDIC; provided, that if the 
exercise price per share of any such Company Stock Option is equal to  or
greater than the Per Common Share Price, such Company Stock Option  shall be
cancelled without any cash payment being made in respect  thereof. Prior to
the Closing, the Company, in consultation with  Parent, shall take or cause
to be taken any and all actions reasonably  necessary, including the
amendment of the Company Stock Plans (as  defined in Section 3.2(a)) and, as
necessary, any stock option  agreements entered into under the Company Stock
Plans, and shall use  reasonable best efforts to obtain any necessary consent
of each holder  of a Company Stock Option, to give effect to the treatment of
Company  Stock Options pursuant to this Section 2.1(e), to the extent such 
treatment is not expressly provided for by the terms of the applicable 
Company Stock Plan and related award agreements.   (f) Cancellation and
Conversion of Company Stock Units. Each  right to be issued shares of Company
Common Stock pursuant to a  restricted stock unit agreement of the Company (a
"Company Restricted  Stock Unit Agreement") that is outstanding immediately
prior to the  Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) shall be cancelled
as of  the Effective Time, in exchange for the right to receive a single
lump  sum cash payment equal to the product of (i) the Per Common Share
Price  and (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to 
issuance upon settlement of such Company Restricted Stock Unit  Agreement,
such lump sum cash payment to be made less any applicable  withholding tax.
Payments with respect to the Company Restricted Stock  Unit Agreements shall
be made at the Effective Time or, if consent or  approval of the OCC or the
FDIC is required for such lump sum cash  payment, at such time as such
consent or approval is obtained (but in  no event before the Effective Time),
and subject in that case to any  conditions, requirements or restrictions
imposed by the OCC or the  FDIC. Prior to the Closing, the Company, in
consultation with Parent,  shall take or cause to be taken any and all
actions reasonably  necessary, including the amendment of the Company Stock
Plans and, as  necessary, any Company Restricted Stock Unit Agreements, and
shall use  reasonable best efforts to obtain any necessary consent of each
holder  of a Company Restricted Stock Unit Agreement, to (x) provide that
all  shares of Company Common Stock issuable pursuant to outstanding
Company  Restricted Stock Unit Agreements will vest in connection with the 
Merger and (y) give effect to the treatment of Company Restricted Stock  Unit
Agreements pursuant to this Section 2.1(f), to the extent such  treatment is
not expressly provided for by the terms of the applicable  Company Stock Plan
and related Company Restricted Stock Unit  Agreements.   (g) Merger
Consideration. The aggregate consideration payable  by Parent pursuant to
Sections 2.1(c), (d), (e) and (f) is referred to  herein as the "Merger
Consideration." The components of the Merger  Consideration are detailed on
Annex 2.1. The Merger Consideration will  in no event exceed the sum of
$1,593,667,377 plus the aggregate amount  of cash received by the Company, if
any, on or after the date hereof up      4    to the Effective Time
from the exercise of Company Stock Options (it  being understood that the
maximum number of shares subject to Company  Stock Options which will become
exercisable during such period is  2,326,556 and the maximum cash proceeds to
the Company from such  exercises, assuming all such Options were exercised
for cash, would be  $19,124,290.32). At the Effective Time, each holder of
Company Common  Stock and Company Series C Preferred Stock (the Company
Common Stock  and the Company Series C Preferred Stock are collectively
referred to  as the "Company Capital Stock") shall cease to have any rights
(other  than Dissenting Shares as set forth in Section 2.3) with respect to 
such issued and outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock (including, 
without limitation, the right to vote), except for the right to receive  his,
her or its respective portion of the Merger Consideration.   Section 2.2
Payment of Merger Consideration.   (a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall  appoint a commercial bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the  Company as a paying agent (the "Paying Agent") for the
benefit of the  holders of Company Common Stock that are not Dissenting
Shares and who  are entitled to receive the Merger Consideration
(collectively, the  "Holders"). At the Effective Time, Parent shall make
available to the  Paying Agent an amount of cash sufficient to permit payment
of the  Merger Consideration to the Holders (other than the cash portion of
the  Merger Consideration to be paid by Parent as provided in Section 
2.2(h)) (the "Exchange Fund"). The Paying Agent shall invest the  Exchange
Fund as directed by Parent, and any interest and other income  resulting from
such investments shall be paid to Parent. The Paying  Agent shall exchange
the shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger  Consideration in
accordance with the terms of this Article II, through  such reasonable
procedures as the Paying Agent or Parent may adopt.   (b) Payment
Procedures. As soon as practicable after the  Effective Time, Parent or the
Paying Agent shall cause to be mailed to  each record holder of a certificate
or certificates that immediately  prior to the Effective Time represented
Company Capital Stock converted  in the Merger (the "Certificates") a letter
of transmittal (which shall  specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to  the Certificates shall pass, only upon actual
delivery of the  Certificates to the Paying Agent, and shall contain
instructions for  use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates and
payment of the  Merger Consideration). The Paying Agent shall accept
Certificates upon  compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as
the Paying  Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in
accordance  with normal exchange practices. Upon surrender for cancellation
to the  Paying Agent of a Certificate held by any Holder or holder of a 
Certificate of Company Series C Preferred Stock, together with such  letter
of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may  reasonably be
required by the Paying Agent, the Holder of such  Certificate or holder of a
Certificate of Company Series C Preferred  Stock shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor that amount of  cash equal to the Per Common Share Price
for each share of Company  Common Stock or, in the case of a holder of a
Certificate of Company  Series C Preferred Stock, such holder\'s    
5    ratable portion of the aggregate cash amount payable pursuant to 
Section 2.1(d) hereof. Any Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith  be
cancelled.   (c) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock. All 
amounts paid upon conversion of shares of Company Capital Stock in 
accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid pursuant to 
Section 2.2(e)) shall be deemed to have been issued in full  satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Capital  Stock. At the
Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of  transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of  the shares of Company
Capital Stock which were outstanding immediately  prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates  are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall  be cancelled and exchanged
as provided in this Article II.   (d) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate
shall have been  lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit
of that fact  by the Person (as defined below) claiming such Certificate to
be lost,  stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Paying Agent,
the  posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent 
or the Paying Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may  be
made against them with respect to such Certificate, Parent will pay  in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the amounts  to which
the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.1. As  used in this
Agreement, "Person" means any person, employee,  individual, corporation,
limited liability company, partnership, trust,  joint venture or any other
non-governmental entity or any governmental  or regulatory authority or
body.   (e) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange  Fund
which remains undistributed to the stockholders of the Company for  six
months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon  demand,
and any stockholders of the Company who have not theretofore  complied with
this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for  payment of their
claim for Merger Consideration.   (f) No Liability. None of Parent, the
Company or the Surviving  Corporation shall be liable to any holder of shares
of Company Capital  Stock for cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a
public official  pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.  If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to
eighteen  months after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such
earlier  date on which any cash payable to the holder of such Certificate 
pursuant to this Article II would otherwise escheat to or become the 
property of any Governmental Entity), any such cash in respect of such 
Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become  the
property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any  person
previously entitled thereto.   (g) Withholding. Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the  Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the  consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any 
holder of shares of Company Capital Stock or Dissenting Shares such  amounts
as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the  making of
such    6    payment pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the  "Code") and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,
or any  provision of state, local or foreign tax Law, and to collect such
tax  forms, including Form W-9, the appropriate series of Form W-8 or any 
other forms, as may be necessary to prevent or reduce any such  deduction or
withholding. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by  Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld  amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having  been paid to the holder
of the shares of Company Capital Stock or  Dissenting Shares in respect of
which such deduction and withholding  was made by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent.   (h) Payment to Holders of the Company
Series C Preferred  Stock. On the Closing Date, immediately following the
Effective Time  and upon the surrender to Parent of the Certificates
representing all  shares of the Company Series C Preferred Stock, Parent
shall pay to the  holders of the Company Series C Preferred Stock, by wire
transfer of  immediately available funds to an account designated by such
holders,  that amount of cash constituting the Merger Consideration which
such  holders are entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(d).   Section
2.3 Dissenters\' Rights.   (a) Shares of Company Capital Stock with respect
to which a  demand for payment and appraisal has been properly made and
perfected  in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL ("Dissenting Shares")
will  not be converted into the right to receive from Parent the portion of 
the Merger Consideration otherwise payable with respect to such shares  at or
after the Effective Time and the holder thereof shall be entitled  only to
such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL. If a  holder of
Dissenting Shares (a "Dissenting Stockholder") shall  withdraw, in accordance
with Section 262 of the DGCL, such holder\'s  demand for such appraisal or
shall become ineligible for such  appraisal, then, as of the later of the
Effective Time or the  occurrence of such event, such holder\'s Dissenting
Shares shall cease  to be Dissenting Shares and shall be converted into the
right to  receive from Parent the Merger Consideration into which such
holder\'s  Company Capital Stock was converted as of the Effective Time
pursuant  to this Agreement.   (b) The Company shall give Parent notice of
any demand  received by the Company from a holder of Dissenting Shares for 
appraisal of shares of Company Capital Stock, withdrawals of such  demands
and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and  received by the
Company, and copies of any correspondence received by  the Company relating
to any such demand or potential demand, and Parent  shall have the right to
participate in and, after the Effective Time,  to direct, all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to such  demand. The Company agrees that, except
with the prior written consent  of Parent, or as required under the DGCL, it
will not voluntarily make  any payment with respect to, or settle or offer or
agree to settle, any  such demand for appraisal. Each Dissenting Stockholder
who, pursuant to  the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, becomes entitled
to payment  of the value of the Dissenting Shares will      7   
receive payment therefor after the value therefor has been agreed upon  or
finally determined pursuant to such provisions, and any Merger  Consideration
that would have been payable with respect to such  Dissenting Shares will be
retained by Parent.   ARTICLE III  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE

Company  and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. To the Knowledge of the
Company  (as defined in Section 3.5(b)), no Company Permit shall cease to
be  effective as a result of the consummation of the transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the Company and its  Subsidiaries is
and has been in compliance in all material respects  with all federal, state,
local or foreign laws, statutes, ordinances,  codes, rules, regulations,

agreements of any Governmental Entity  (individually, a "Law" and
collectively, the "Laws") applicable to the  conduct of its business or the
ownership or operation of its properties  or assets, including state usury
Laws, consumer lending and insurance  Laws, the Truth in Lending Act, the
Consumer Credit Protection Act, the  Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair
Credit Reporting Act, the Fair  Debt Collection Practices Act, the USA
Patriot Act of 2001, the  Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-

respect to collection practices in seeking payment under any loan or  credit

the Company,  threatened.   (b) As used in this Agreement, "Knowledge of
the Company"  means the actual knowledge of (i) the executive officers of the
Company  and its Subsidiaries and (ii) the individuals with the primary 
responsibility over operational or functional areas of the Company and  its
Subsidiaries.   Section 3.6 Legal Proceedings. Except as disclosed in the

suit, action, claim, investigation or proceeding (whether judicial, arbitral,
administrative or other) pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,

as to which there is a substantial possibility of a material adverse outcome.
Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents filed prior to the date of
this Agreement, there is no judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of

Section 3.7 Taxes.   (a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have
filed, or  caused to be filed, on a timely basis (taking into account any 
extension of time within which to file), all material tax returns  required
to be filed by any of them and have paid in full (or the  Company has paid in
full on behalf of any of its Subsidiaries), or have  set up an adequate
reserve for the payment of, all material taxes  required to be paid. All such
tax returns were true, complete and  correct in all material respects. The
most recent financial statements  contained in the Company SEC Documents
filed prior to the date of this  Agreement reflect an adequate reserve, in
accordance with generally  accepted accounting principles, for all taxes
payable by the Company  and its Subsidiaries accrued through the date of such
financial  statements. No material deficiencies or other claims for any taxes
have  been proposed, asserted or assessed in writing against the Company or 
any of its Subsidiaries that are not adequately reserved for. As used  in
this Agreement, the term "tax" (including, with correlative meaning,  the
terms "taxes" and "taxable") shall mean (i) all Federal, state,  local and
foreign income, profits, franchise, gross receipts, payroll,  sales,
employment, use, property, withholding, excise, occupancy and  other taxes,
duties or assessments of any nature whatsoever, together  with all interest,
penalties and additions imposed with respect to such  amounts, (ii) liability
for the payment of any amounts of the type  described in clause (i) as a
result of being or having been a member of  an affiliated, consolidated,
combined or unitary group, and (iii)  liability for the payment of any
amounts as a result of being party to  any tax sharing agreement or as a
result of any express or implied  obligation to indemnify any other Person
with respect to the payment of  any amounts of the type described in clauses
(i) or (ii).   (b) The Company (i) has delivered to Parent or made
available  to Parent for inspection complete and correct copies of all
material  tax returns of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company
relating to  taxes for the taxable periods ending December 31, 2002 and
December 31,  2003, and (ii) has retained and will deliver or make available
to  Parent, on Parent\'s reasonable request, complete and correct copies of 
material tax returns of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company 
relating to taxes for all taxable periods for which the applicable  statute
of limitations has not yet expired, as well as all related  books and records
so as to meet the requirements of Section 6001 of the  Code.   (c) The
federal income tax returns of the Company and each  Subsidiary of the Company
have been audited by the Internal Revenue  Service or are closed by the
applicable statute of limitations for all  taxable years through 1997. No
examination or audit of any tax return  of the Company or any Subsidiary of
the Company by any Governmental  Entity is currently in progress. Neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary  of the Company has been informed in writing by
any jurisdiction where  the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company does not
file a tax return  that the jurisdiction believes that the Company or any
Subsidiary of  the Company was required to file any material tax return that
was not  filed. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company has
(i)  waived any statute of limitations with respect to taxes or agreed to 
extend the period for assessment or collection of any taxes, (ii)  requested
any extension of time within      16    which to file any tax return,
which tax return has not yet been filed,  or (iii) executed or filed any
power of attorney with any taxing  authority.   (d) Neither the Company nor
any Subsidiary of the Company is  or has ever been a member of a group of
corporations with which it has  filed (or been required to file)
consolidated, combined or unitary tax  returns other than (i) the group of
which the Company is the common  parent, and (ii) the group of which
Fingerhut Companies, Inc. and its  successors and assigns is the common
parent.   (e) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company is a 
party to any tax sharing agreement or arrangement other than with each  other
and with Fingerhut Companies, Inc. and its successors and  assigns.   (f)
Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company: (i)  is a "consenting
corporation" within the meaning of former Section  341(f) of the Code, and
none of the assets of the Company or any  Subsidiary of the Company is
subject to an election under former  Section 341(f) of the Code; or (ii) has
been a United States real  property holding corporation within the meaning of
Section 897(c)(2) of  the Code during the applicable period specified in
Section  897(c)(l)(A)(ii) of the Code.   (g) Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary of the Company has  distributed to its stockholders or security
holders stock or securities  of a controlled corporation, nor has stock or
securities of the Company  or any Subsidiary of the Company been distributed,
in a transaction to  which Section 355 of the Code applies (i) in the two
years prior to the  date of this Agreement or (ii) in a distribution that
could otherwise  constitute part of a "plan" or "series of related
transactions" (within  the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code) that
includes the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (h) There are
no material liens or other encumbrances with  respect to taxes upon any of
the assets or properties of the Company or  any Subsidiary of the Company,
other than with respect to taxes not yet  due and payable.   (i) Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has  entered into a transaction that
is identified by published guidance as  a listed transaction under Treas.
Reg. Section 1.6011-4(b)(2).   (j) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries
have withheld  from amounts owing to any employee, creditor or other person
all taxes  required by Law to be withheld and have paid over to the proper 
governmental authority in a timely manner all such withheld amounts to  the
extent due and payable, except for immaterial failures to withhold  and pay
over.   Section 3.8 Certain Agreements. Except for this Agreement, neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any
contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding (i) with respect to the
employment of any directors or executive officers, or with     
17   any consultants that are natural persons, involving the payment of
$250,000 or more per annum, (ii) which involves the payment or receipt of
payment of $1 million or more per annum or is otherwise material to the
conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, as currently conducted or currently contemplated to be conducted by
the Company and its Subsidiaries, (iii) which limits the ability of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to compete in any line of business, in any
geographic area or with any Person, or which requires referrals of business

opportunities to any Person on a priority, equal or exclusive basis, and in
each case which limitation or requirement would reasonably be expected to be
material to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, (iv) with or
to a labor union or guild (including any collective bargaining agreement),
(v) in the case of a Company Plan, any of the benefits of which will be

any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (vi) which relates to
indebtedness of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the principal

consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
Company has made available to Parent complete and accurate copies of each
contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding of the type described in
this Section 3.8 (collectively referred to herein as the
"Company Contracts"). All of the Company Contracts are valid and in full
force and effect, except to the extent they have previously expired in
accordance with their terms, and are enforceable against the Company or the
applicable Subsidiary of the Company and, to the Company\'s Knowledge,
against the other parties thereto, in accordance with their terms, subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
similar Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors\'
rights and to general equitable principles. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has, and to the Knowledge of the Company, none of the other
parties thereto has, violated any material provision of, or committed or
failed to perform any material act, and no event or condition exists, which
with or without notice, lapse of time or both would constitute a material
default under the provisions of, any Company Contract.   Section 3.9

Qualified Plan currently in operation is the  401(k) Retirement Benefit Plan.
No Related Employer has  maintained or contributed to another Qualified Plan.
The  Company has received a favorable determination letter from the  IRS
that has not been revoked, no Qualified Plan has been  amended since the date
of its most recent determination letter  or application therefor in any
material respect, and, to the  Knowledge of the Company, nothing has occurred
with respect to  the operation of any Qualified Plan that could cause the

increase its cost; with respect to each Company  Plan, to the Knowledge of
the Company, no transactions  prohibited by Code Section 4975 or ERISA
Section 406 and no  breaches of fiduciary duty described in ERISA Section 404

condition exists with respect to any Company Plan that would  subject the
Related Employers to any contractual  indemnification or contribution

respect to any  Company Plan, nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, will
any  of the transactions contemplated by this agreement give rise  to such
an obligation; and the Related Employers have never  sponsored an employee
stock ownership plan. Each Qualified  Plan that provides for compliance with

complies.   (iii) Neither any Related Employer nor any ERISA  Affiliate has
ever sponsored or maintained or had any  Liability with respect to any

nor, to the Knowledge of the  Company, is there any basis for any such claim
or lawsuit. No  Company Plans or Company Benefit Arrangements are or have
been  under audit or examination (nor has notice been received of a 
potential audit or examination) by any Governmental Entity;  and no matters
are pending under the IRS\'s Employee Plans  Compliance Resolutions System or

or compensation guarantee; (D) trigger any  Liabilities (including any
obligation to provide a tax  gross-up); or (E) measure any values of benefits

purposes of bank regulation under 12 CFR 359.4(a)(3) will  comport with such
regulation     21    and, prior to being made, will have received
proper approval  from the OCC and, as may be required, with the concurrence
of  the FDIC. No stockholder, employee, officer, or director of  any Related
Employer has been promised or paid any bonus or  incentive compensation
related to the transactions  contemplated pursuant to this Agreement. The
Related Employers  have provided to Parent such accurate information as
Parent  would reasonably be expected to need to enable Parent to  calculate
any excise tax due under Code Section 4999 as a  result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement for  which any Related Employer or Parent may
directly or  indirectly become liable, and the amount of deductions that 
may be disallowed under Code Section 280G as a result of the  transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.   (vi) Each Company Plan and Company
Benefit  Arrangement is amendable and terminable unilaterally by the 
applicable Related Employer at any time without liability or  expense to the
Related Employers or such plan or arrangement  as a result thereof (other
than for benefits accrued through  the date of amendment or termination and
reasonable  administrative expenses related thereto), and no plan 
documentation or agreement or communication distributed  generally to
employees by its terms prohibits the Related  Employers from amending or
terminating such Company Plan or  Company Benefit Arrangement.   (vii) Each
Related Employer has paid all amounts it  is required to pay as contributions

result of a retroactive rate  adjustment or loss sharing arrangement,
incurred any material  liability with respect to a Company Plan or state
workers\'  compensation arrangement that is funded wholly or partially 
through an insurance policy or public or private fund.   (viii) All group
health plans of the Related  Employers and their ERISA Affiliates materially
comply with  the requirements of Part 6 of Title I of ERISA ("COBRA"), Code 
Section 5000, the Health Insurance Portability and  Accountability Act, and
any other comparable domestic or  foreign Laws; no Related Employer has any
Liability under or  with respect to COBRA for its own actions or omissions
or  those of any predecessor or ERISA Affiliate; no Related  Employer
provides benefits through a voluntary employee  beneficiary association as
defined in Code Section 501(c)(9);  no current or former employee or director
(or beneficiary of  any of the foregoing) of any Related Employer is now, or
after  completing additional service or applying at a future date  will be,
entitled to     22    receive any post-employment benefits from any
Related  Employer, including death or medical benefits (whether or not 
insured) beyond retirement or other termination of employment,  other than as
applicable Law or the terms of the Qualified  Plan require and there have
been no written or oral  commitments inconsistent with the foregoing.  
(ix) No Related Employer has taken any action since  March 31, 2005 that
would have required consent under Section  5.1(i) if Section 5.1(i) had been
in effect beginning as of  such date.   (x) No Related Employer has had any

consistent with material communications to recipients of such  compensation;
and (C) will comply in all material respects  with applicable Law.   (d)
With respect to employees of and independent contractors  to the Related

employee  classification, workers\' compensation, family and medical  leave,
the Immigration Reform and Control Act, and  occupational safety and health
requirements, and has complied  in all material respects with all employment
agreements, and  no claims, controversies, investigations or suits are
pending  or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened, with respect  to

mass layoff as defined in  the WARN Act, nor has any Related Employer been
affected by  any transaction or engaged in layoffs or employment 
terminations sufficient in number to trigger application of  any similar

provided notices under the WARN Act as  described in Section 3.9(d)(iv) of
the Company Disclosure  Schedule.   (v) There are no loans or extensions of
credit (other  than (A) for routine business expenses or (B) under credit

its Affiliates holds a residual or  subordinate interest that may experience
reduced payments as a result  of such losses or a cash collateral account or
similar account subject  to reduction as a result of such losses shall not be
deemed to  represent a right of recourse against the Bank or any of its

contemplated by this  Agreement (the "Company Stockholders Meeting").   (b)
The Company will promptly prepare and file all materials  required to be
filed under the Exchange Act as well as all other  applicable state or

and to respond promptly to any comments of the SEC with  respect to the Proxy
Statement, and will cause the Proxy Statement to  be mailed to the Company\'s
stockholders as promptly as reasonably  practicable following completion of
any SEC review of the Proxy  Statement.    40    If at any time prior
to the Effective Time any fact or event relating  to the Company or any of
its Affiliates which causes the Company to  determine to prepare a supplement
to the Proxy Statement should be  discovered by the Company or should to the
Knowledge of the Company  occur, the Company shall promptly inform Parent of
such fact or event.   (c) Parent and Merger Sub will furnish the Company
with such  information concerning Parent and its Subsidiaries as is necessary
in  order to cause the Proxy Statement, insofar as it relates to Parent and 
its Subsidiaries, to comply with the applicable provisions of the  Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. Parent and  Merger Sub agree to
promptly advise the Company if, at any time prior  to the Company
Stockholders Meeting, any information provided by them  or the Company in the

respect and to provide the Company with the  information needed to correct
such inaccuracy or omission. Parent and  Merger Sub will furnish the Company

will, through its Board of Directors,  recommend to its stockholders the
approval and adoption of this  Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby;  provided, however, that the Company\'s
Board of Directors may withdraw,  modify, condition or refuse to make such
recommendation if it  determines in good faith after consultation with its
outside legal  counsel that its fiduciary obligations require it to do so. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, unless this 
Agreement has been terminated, this Agreement shall be submitted to the 
stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholders Meeting for the 
purpose of voting on the approval and adoption of this Agreement and  the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and nothing  contained
herein shall be deemed to relieve the Company of such  obligations.  
Section 6.2 Advice of Changes; Government Filings. Each party shall confer on
a regular basis with the other, report on operational matters and promptly
advise the other orally and in writing of any change or event which has or
would reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on
such party, would materially impair or delay completion of the
transactions contemplated herein or would cause or constitute a material
breach of any of the representations, warranties or covenants of such party
contained herein; provided, however, that any noncompliance with the
foregoing shall not constitute the failure to be satisfied of a condition set
forth in Article VII or give rise to any right of termination under Article
VIII unless the underlying breach shall independently constitute such a
failure or give rise to such a right. In exercising the foregoing right, each
of the parties hereto agrees to act reasonably and as promptly as
practicable. Each party hereto agrees that to the extent practicable it will
consult with the other parties hereto with respect to the obtaining of all
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and
Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions

this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and its
Subsidiaries\' operations.   Section 6.4 Access to Information.   (a) Upon
reasonable notice, the Company shall afford to the  representatives of Parent
reasonable access at reasonable times, during  normal business hours during
the period prior to the Effective Time, to  the Company Employees and the
Company\'s properties, books, contracts  and records and, during such period,
the Company shall not be required  to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or  disclosure would violate or prejudice the
rights of its customers,  jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the
institution in  possession or control of such information or contravene any
Law or  binding agreement to which the Company is subject. The parties will 
make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances  in
which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply, including,  to the
extent possible, entering into appropriate agreements for the  disclosure of
non-public information of any Governmental Entity,  including OCC examination
reports of the Bank, as may be required by  such Governmental Entity.   (b)
Parent will hold any such information which is nonpublic  in confidence to
the extent required by, and in accordance with, the  provisions of the letter
dated January 25, 2005, between Company and  HSBC North America Holdings Inc.

Reserve,  Superintendent, Minnesota DOC, Florida DFS and Bermuda Monetary 
Authority and (D) under any other applicable Law, and (iv) to execute  or
deliver any additional instruments that the other parties, or any of  them,
may reasonably request that are necessary to consummate the  transactions
contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of,  this Agreement
(including the Merger and the Bank Merger). Each of the  Company and Parent
will promptly cooperate with and furnish information  to the other in
connection with any such efforts by, or requirement  imposed upon, any of
them or any of their Subsidiaries in connection  with the foregoing. In
furtherance of the foregoing, each of the  Company and Parent shall, and

which supplemental indentures and other instruments are  required for the due
assumption of the Company\'s outstanding debt,  guarantees and other
securities to the extent required by the terms of  such debt, guarantees and
securities and the instruments and agreements  relating thereto.   (c) Each
of the Company and Parent and their respective Boards  of Directors shall, if
any state takeover statute, similar statute or  similar provision in the
Certificate of Incorporation becomes  applicable to this Agreement, the
Stockholder Agreement, the Merger,  the Bank Merger or any other transactions
contemplated hereby and  thereby, use reasonable best efforts to ensure that
the Merger, the  Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement  and the Stockholder Agreement may be consummated as promptly as 
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise to minimize  the
effect of such statute or provision on this Agreement, the  Stockholder
Agreement, the Merger, the Bank Merger and any other  transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby.   (d) The Company shall, and shall cause

consolidated assets (including,  without limitation, stock of its
Subsidiaries) of it and its  Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any purchase
or sale of, or tender  or exchange offer for, its voting securities that, if
consummated,  would result in any Person (or the stockholders or equity
holders of  such Person) beneficially owning securities representing 10% or
more of  its total voting power (or of the surviving parent entity in such 
transaction) or any of its Subsidiaries (any such proposal, offer or 
transaction (other than a proposal or offer made by Parent or an  Affiliate
thereof) being hereinafter referred to as an "Acquisition  Proposal"), (ii)
have any discussions with or provide any confidential  information or data to
any Person relating to an Acquisition Proposal,  or engage in any
negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal, or  (iii) approve or
recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, or  execute or enter into, any
letter of intent, agreement in principle,  merger agreement, asset purchase
or share exchange agreement, option  agreement or other similar agreement
related to any Acquisition  Proposal.   (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Board of Directors of  the Company shall be permitted, prior to the
Company Stockholders  Meeting to be held pursuant to Section 6.1, and subject
to compliance  with the other terms of this Section 6.6 and to first entering
into a  customary confidentiality agreement, to engage in discussions and 
negotiations with, or provide any nonpublic information or data to, any 
Person in response to an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition  Proposal
by such Person made after the date of this Agreement which the  Board of
Directors of the Company concludes in good faith, after  consultation with a
nationally recognized financial advisor and legal  counsel, constitutes or is
reasonably likely to result in a Superior  Proposal (as defined in Section
6.6(e)), if and only to the extent that  the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith (after  consultation with outside legal
counsel) that its fiduciary obligations  require it to do so.   (i) The
Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in  no event later than 24 hours)
after receipt of any Acquisition  Proposal, or any request for nonpublic
information relating to  the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any Person
that  informs the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that it is  considering
making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal, or  any inquiry from any Person
seeking to have discussions or  negotiations with the Company relating to
a     44    possible Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall be made 
orally and confirmed in writing, and shall indicate the  identity of the
Person making the Acquisition Proposal,  inquiry or request and the material
terms and conditions of  any inquiries, proposals or offers. The Company
shall also  promptly, and in any event within 24 hours, notify Parent, 
orally and in writing, if it enters into discussions or  negotiations
concerning any Acquisition Proposal or provides  nonpublic information or
data to any Person in accordance with  this Section 6.6(b).   (ii) Nothing
contained in this Section 6.6 shall  prohibit the Company from taking and
disclosing to its  stockholders a position required by Rule 14e-2(a) or
Rule  14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act; provided, however,  that
compliance with such rules shall not in any way limit or  modify the effect
that any action taken pursuant to such rules  has under any other provision
of this Agreement, including  Section 8.1(f).   (c) Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the  contrary, at any time prior to obtaining
the Required Company Vote, the  Board of Directors of the Company may, in
response to a Superior  Proposal, cause the Company to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to  Section 8.1(g) and concurrently or promptly thereafter
enter into a  definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal;
provided,  however, that the Company shall not exercise its right to
terminate  this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(g) until the third business
day  following Parent\'s receipt of written notice (a "Notice of Superior 
Proposal") from the Company advising Parent that the Board of Directors  of
the Company has received a Superior Proposal specifying the terms  and
conditions of the Superior Proposal, identifying the Person making  such
Superior Proposal and stating that the Board of Directors of the  Company
intends to exercise its right to terminate this Agreement  pursuant to
Section 8.1(g).   (d) The Company agrees that it will and will cause its 
Subsidiaries, and its and their officers, directors, agents,  representatives
and advisors to, cease immediately and terminate any  and all existing
activities, discussions or negotiations with any third  parties conducted
heretofore with respect to any proposal that  constitutes, or could
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition  Proposal.   (e) For
purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means  a bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal which the Board of Directors  of the Company, concludes
in good faith (after consultation with its  legal advisors and a nationally
recognized financial advisor) (i) is  more favorable to the stockholders of
the Company, from a financial  point of view, than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement,  taking into account all the terms and
conditions of such proposal and  this Agreement (including any proposal by
Parent to amend the terms of  the Agreement) and (ii) is fully financed or
reasonably capable of  being fully financed, reasonably likely to receive all
required  approvals on a timely basis and otherwise reasonably capable of
being  completed on the terms proposed; provided that, for purposes of this 
definition of "Superior Proposal," the term Acquisition Proposal shall  have
the meaning assigned to such term in Section 6.6(a), except that  the    
45    reference to "10% or more" in the definition of "Acquisition
Proposal"  shall be deemed to be a reference to "a majority."   Section 6.7
Employees; Employee Benefit Plans.   (a) Through the six month anniversary
of the Effective Time  (except as applicable Law or third party providers
require otherwise),  Parent and the Surviving Corporation will provide
persons employed by  the Related Employers at the Effective Time ("Company
Employees")  annual base compensation, incentive compensation (other than
equity  based compensation), and Benefit Plans and Benefit Arrangements
(other  than equity based compensation) that are, in the aggregate, at least
as  favorable as those in effect immediately before the Effective Time. For 
purposes of comparability, the parties agree that the determination  shall
not take into account any equity, equity-based, or equity  measured
compensation nor the level of employee contributions in effect  before the
Effective Time, provided any contributions required after  the Effective Time
and during 2005 shall not be in excess of prevailing  market levels. For
purposes of any seniority or length of service  requirements, waiting
periods, vesting periods, or differential  benefits based on length of
service in any such plan or policy of  Parent as of the Effective Time for
which a Company Employee may be  eligible after the Effective Time, Parent
and the Surviving Corporation  shall treat service by such employee with the
Company as though it had  been service with Parent for all purposes under any
such plan or policy  to the extent the Company credited such service under
its similar  plans, excluding vesting, benefit accruals, or accrual or
account  formulas under any Pension Plan maintained by Parent, so long as
this  crediting of service does not violate applicable Laws and is
consistent  with the rules governing Benefit Plans qualified under Section
401(a)  of the Code and permitted by third-party administrators and
insurers.  Notwithstanding any other provision herein, no provision of this 
Agreement shall obligate any of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or  any of
its Affiliates to continue the employment of any Company  Employee for any
period following the Effective Time or to refrain from  revising the terms of
any such Company Employee\'s employment or  transferring any such Company
Employees, nor shall it prevent those  entities from amending or terminating
any Benefit Plan or Benefit  Arrangement.   (b) In addition:   (i) Any
Company Employee covered by the Management  Incentive Plan ("MIP") or the
Annual Incentive Plan ("AIP")  for Designated Corporate Officers ("Covered
Employees") (each  of the MIP and the AIP, as provided to Parent on May 11,
2005)  shall receive a 2005 bonus payable as follows. As of the  Effective
Time, all Covered Employees shall be credited with a  bonus based on Payout
Achievement Level as set forth on  Section 6.7(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule based on the  Company\'s Net Income, as set forth in the MIP and the
AIP,  with payment of such bonuses to be made on or before March 15,  2006
(or such earlier date as may be required by applicable  state Law), which
payment shall be made whether or not a  particular Covered Employee who
is     46    entitled to such bonus payment is employed at the time
of  payment, provided that such Covered Employee has not been  terminated
for Cause (as defined in Section 6.7(b)(vi)) before  the time of payment. In
addition, all Covered Employees shall  receive a prorated bonus on or before
March 15, 2006 (or such  earlier date as may be required by applicable state
Law), to  reflect the achievement of Individual Management Bonus  Objectives
("MBOs") through the Effective Time, which shall be  determined at the
Effective Time by the Company in a manner  consistent with the Company\'s
past practice and agreed to by  Parent (which agreement shall not be
unreasonably withheld).  By March 15, 2006 (or such earlier date as may be
required by  applicable state Law), all Covered Employees who are employed 
by Parent or its Affiliates with operations in the United  States (the "U.S.
Affiliates") as of December 31, 2005 shall  receive a prorated bonus to cover
the period from the  Effective Time through December 31, 2005 ("Stub Period")
and  persons whose employment was terminated without cause will  receive a
prorated bonus for the shorter period during which  the persons were employed
during the Stub Period. Such  prorated bonus will reflect the achievement of
MBOs achieved  by the Covered Employee during the Stub Period as determined 
by the Surviving Corporation in a manner consistent with the  Company\'s past
practice and agreed to by Parent (which  agreement shall not be unreasonably
withheld).   (ii) For a period of 12 months following the  Effective Time,
any Company Employees who are offered  employment with Parent or its U.S.
Affiliates that would  require them to relocate to a different work location
that is  more than 40 miles from their current work location will be 
allowed to choose one of the following two options: (i) accept  the position,
in which case each such relocated Company  Employee will be entitled to
receive relocation benefits under  the Company\'s relocation policy as in
effect March 31, 2005,  or (ii) decline the position and receive the
severance benefit  under the Company\'s Severance Plan as in effect on March
31,  2005, or, if applicable, as outlined in such employee\'s Change  of
Control Severance Agreement or Key Employee Severance  Protection
Agreement.   (iii) Any Company Employee terminated without Cause  within 12
months following the Effective Time who is not  otherwise covered by an
individual agreement with respect to  severance shall be eligible to receive
severance under the  Company\'s Severance Pay Plan (including, but not
limited to,  outplacement benefits) as in effect on March 31, 2005. For 
those Company Employees who receive severance benefits under  this clause
(iii) and who are then eligible for COBRA  coverage, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, or their  Affiliates will, during the months in which each such
severed  Company Employee receives severance payments, pay that portion  of
the severed Company Employee\'s monthly COBRA insurance  coverage costs equal
to the amount of the monthly difference  between (1) the severed employee\'s
monthly COBRA cost and (2)  the monthly amount that the severed employee
would have paid  to obtain    47    medical and dental coverage under
the applicable plans if the  severed employee were an active employee.  
(iv) Following the Effective Time, all Company  Employees shall be credited
with the amount of their accrued  but unused paid time off ("PTO") under the
paid time off  program (or equivalent) of Parent in effect at the Effective 
Time; provided that any Company Employee who has accrued but  unused PTO in
excess of the amount that may be credited under  Parent\'s paid time off
program (or equivalent) shall receive a  payment, as soon as reasonably
practical after the Effective  Time, equal to the value of such excess
accrued but unused  PTO.   (v) Participants in the Company\'s
Supplemental  Executive Retirement Plans ("SERP") who are age 55 or older 
will receive a pro-rata payment to their SERP account at the  Effective Time
based on the expected Company annual  contribution for 2005.   (vi) For
purposes of this Section 6.7(b), "Cause"  shall mean a Company Employee\'s
(A) failure to perform his/her  material duties, which failure continues for
ten (10) days  after the Parent or Surviving Corporation has given written 
notice to the employee specifying in reasonable detail the  manner in which
the employee has failed to perform such  duties; (B) commission of an act or
omission constituting (x)  a felony, (y) embezzlement, theft or material
dishonesty with  respect to the Surviving Corporation, Parent, or their 
Affiliates, or (z) fraud; (C) commission of an act or omission  that (x)
could adversely and materially affect the Surviving  Corporation\'s,
Parent\'s, or their Affiliates\' business or  reputation, or (y) involves
moral turpitude; or (D) breach,  non-performance or non-observance of any
restrictive covenant  or any other written agreement with the Surviving
Corporation,  Parent, or their Affiliates prohibiting any or all of (x) the 
disclosure of confidential trade secrets and other  information, (y)
competitive activities or the solicitation of  customers, or (z) the
solicitation of employees or former  employees.   (c) Parent shall cause
any and all pre-existing condition (or  actively at work or similar)
limitations, eligibility waiting periods  and evidence of insurability
requirements under each employee medical  plan of Parent ("Parent Benefit
Plan") in which Company Employees  participate after the Effective Time to be
waived with respect to such  Company Employees and their eligible dependents
who were covered under  comparable Company Plans and shall provide them with
credit for any  co-payments, deductibles, and offsets (or similar payments)
made during  the plan year including the Effective Time for the purposes of 
satisfying any applicable deductible, out-of-pocket, or similar  requirements
under any of Parent\'s Benefit Plans in which they are  eligible to
participate during the plan year including the Effective  Time. Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall continue the life  insurance and disability
coverage for at least six months following the  Effective Time for Company
Employees who are covered by Company Plans  providing such coverage
immediately prior to the Effective Time.     48    (d) Any
communications proposed to be delivered by the Company  or Parent to the
Company Employees before the Effective Time regarding  the matters contained
in or the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement or otherwise
respecting any changes or potential changes in  employee benefit plans,
practices, or procedures that may or will occur  in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement,  shall be subject to the prior
approval of Parent and the Company,  respectively, which approval shall not
be unreasonably withheld. Each  of Parent and the Company shall be deemed to
have approved a proposed  communication absent objection provided within 72
hours of receipt of  that proposed communication.   (e) Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to  deduct and withhold from any
compensatory payments otherwise payable to  any Company Employee pursuant to
this Section 6.7 such amounts as they  are required to deduct and withhold
under any applicable tax Laws.   Section 6.8 Fees and Expenses. In the event
the Merger is not consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by
the party incurring such expense, provided, however, that the costs and
expenses of printing and mailing the Proxy Statement to the stockholders of
the Company, and all filing and other fees paid to the SEC in connection with
the Proxy Statement or any other Governmental Entity in connection with the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, shall be borne equally
by Parent and the Company. In the event the Merger is consummated, the
Surviving Corporation shall pay all then unpaid costs and expenses incurred
by the Company in connection with the Agreement. Nothing contained in this
Section 6.8 shall limit either party\'s rights to recover any liabilities or
damages arising out of the other party\'s breach of any provision of this
Agreement.   Section 6.9 Indemnification; Directors\' and Officers\'
Insurance.   (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and
shall  cause the Surviving Corporation to, to the fullest extent permitted
by  applicable Law, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and provide 
advancement of expenses to, each person who is now, or has been at any  time
prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective  Time, a
director, officer employee or agent of the Company or any of  its
Subsidiaries or who is or was serving at the request of the Company  or any
of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee or agent of  another
Person (the "Indemnified Parties") against all losses, claims,  damages,
costs, expenses, liabilities or judgments or amounts that are  paid in
settlement of or in connection with any claim, action, suit,  proceeding or
investigation based in whole or in part on or arising in  whole or in part
out of the fact that such person is or was an  Indemnified Party, and
pertaining to any matter existing or occurring,  or any acts or omissions
occurring, at or prior to the Effective Time,  whether asserted or claimed
prior to, or at or after, the Effective  Time (including matters, acts or
omissions occurring in connection with  the approval of this Agreement and
the consummation of the transactions  contemplated hereby) ("Indemnified
Liabilities") to the same extent  such persons are indemnified or have the
right to advancement of  expenses as of the date of     49     this
Agreement by the Company pursuant to the Company\'s Certificate of 
Incorporation, Bylaws and those indemnification agreements with  directors,
officers and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries  that are listed
on Section 6.9(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.  To the extent
permitted by applicable Law, Parent\'s and Surviving  Corporation\'s
obligations under this Section 6.9(a) shall be limited to  a period of six
years from and after the Effective Time.   (b) For a period of six years
after the Effective Time, the  Surviving Corporation shall cause to be
maintained in effect the  current policies of directors\' and officers\'
liability insurance  maintained by the Company (provided that the Surviving
Corporation may  substitute therefor policies with a substantially comparable
insurer of  at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions  which are no less advantageous to the insured) with respect to
claims  arising from facts or events which occurred at or before the
Effective  Time; provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation shall not
be  obligated to make annual premium payments for such insurance to the 
extent such premiums exceed 300% of the premiums paid as of the date  hereof
by the Company for such insurance (the "Company\'s Current  Premium"), and if
such premiums for such insurance would at any time  exceed 300% of the
Company\'s Current Premium, then the Surviving  Corporation shall cause to be
maintained policies of insurance which,  in the Surviving Corporation\'s good
faith determination, provide the  maximum coverage available at an annual
premium equal to 300% of the  Company\'s Current Premium.   (c) Until six
years from the Effective Time, unless otherwise  required by applicable Law,
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws  of the Surviving Corporation
shall contain provisions no less favorable  with respect to the elimination
of liability of directors and the  indemnification of Indemnified Parties
(including as to advancement of  expenses) than those set forth in Article X
of the Certificate of  Incorporation and Article V of the Bylaws, as in
effect on the date  hereof.   (d) The Surviving Corporation shall pay (as
incurred) all  expenses, including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel,
that an  Indemnified Person may incur in the successful enforcement of the 
indemnity and other obligations provided for in this Section 6.9.   (e) If
the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or  assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall  not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such  consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or  substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and  in each such case, to the
extent necessary, proper provision shall be  made so that the successors and
assigns of the Surviving Corporation,  as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations set forth in this  Section 6.9.   (f) The provisions of this
Section 6.9 are intended to be for  the benefit of, and shall be enforceable
by, each Indemnified Party,  his or her heirs and representatives
and      50    are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to  indemnification or contribution that any such person may
have by  contract or otherwise.   Section 6.10 Public Announcements. At all
times at or before the Closing, neither party shall, without the prior
written consent of the other, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed, issue or make, directly or indirectly, any reports,
statements or releases to the public with respect to (a) this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby or (b) (except to the extent disclosed
in or consistent with the Proxy Statement in accordance with the provisions
of Section 6.1 or as otherwise permitted under Section 6.2) the other party
or the other party\'s business, financial condition or results of operations;
provided, however, that either party and its Affiliates may, without the
prior written consent of the other, issue or make, directly or indirectly,
any report, statement or release required by Law (including any periodic
reports required to be filed under the Exchange Act or the rules and
regulations thereunder with the SEC) or any listing agreement or arrangement
with a national securities exchange or national market system (including the
NYSE, the London Stock Exchange, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the Bermuda
Stock Exchange, and Euronext Paris) to which such party or any of its
Affiliates is subject, provided, however, that, to the extent
practicable, the other parties to this Agreement are so notified as soon as

practicable, given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
report, statement or release. The parties will agree to the text of the press
releases announcing the signing of this Agreement.   Section 6.11
Additional Agreements. In case at any time after the Effective Time any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all
properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, the proper officers and directors of each
party to this Agreement shall take all such necessary action.   Section
6.12 Other Actions by Parent. Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of
its Subsidiaries to, take any action that would, or would reasonably be
expected to, result in any of its representations and warranties set forth in
this Agreement being or becoming untrue, subject to such exceptions as do not
have, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, or in any of the conditions to the Merger set forth in Article
VII not being satisfied or in a violation of any provision of this Agreement,
or (unless such action is required by applicable Law) which would adversely

acknowledges that the agreements contained in  Section 8.1 and this Section
8.2 are integral parts of the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement,
and that, without these agreements,  Parent would not have entered into this
Agreement; accordingly, if the  Company fails to promptly pay any amounts due
pursuant to this Section  8.2 and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent
commences a suit which  results in a judgment against the Company for the fee
set forth in this  Section 8.2, the Company shall pay to Parent its
reasonable costs and  expenses (including reasonable attorney\'s fees and
expenses) in  connection with such suit, together with interest from the date
of  termination of this Agreement on the amounts owed at the prime rate of 
The Bank of New York as in effect from time to time during such period.  
Section 8.3 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto,
by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any
time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the
Merger by the stockholders of the Company, but, after any such approval,
no amendment shall be made which by Law requires further approval by
such stockholders without such further approval. This Agreement may not be
amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
parties hereto.   Section 8.4 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the
Effective Time, the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their
respective Board of Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend
the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the
other party hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and
(iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained
herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on
behalf of such party. The failure of a party to assert any of its rights
under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those
rights. No single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or
privilege hereunder shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. Any waiver shall
be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for
which given and shall not constitute a waiver to any subsequent or other
exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder.   ARTICLE IX

mean that the information referred to has been made available if requested by
the party to whom such information is to be made available. The phrases

to refer to this Agreement as a whole, including the Exhibits and Schedules
hereto, and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. Any pronoun

Section 9.4 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
each of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when both counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and

Beneficiaries. This Agreement (including the documents and the instruments
referred to herein, (a) constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all

Section 9.7 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is
invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or
unenforceability and, unless the effect of such invalidity or
unenforceability would prevent the parties from realizing the major portion
of the economic benefits of the Merger that they currently anticipate
obtaining therefrom, shall not render invalid or unenforceable the remaining
terms and provisions of this Agreement or affect the validity or
enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any
other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be
unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as
is enforceable.   Section 9.8 Assignment. This Agreement shall not be
assignable by operation of Law or otherwise without the prior written consent
of the other party, and any attempt to make any such assignment without such

other subsidiary, except that all representations and warranties made herein
with respect to Merger Sub as of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed
representations and warranties made with respect to such other subsidiary as
of the date of such designation, provided further, however, that Parent and
Merger Sub shall not have the benefit of designation set forth in the
foregoing proviso unless such designation will not affect the consideration
to be received by the stockholders of the Company in the Merger or the
treatment of the Merger for federal income tax purposes and will not delay
the completion of the Merger or the satisfaction of the conditions set forth
