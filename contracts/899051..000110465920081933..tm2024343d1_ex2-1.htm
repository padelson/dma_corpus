to the Paying Agent, together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions

to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash which the aggregate number of Company Common Shares previously represented

such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder

or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no holder of
Book-Entry Shares shall be required to deliver a Certificate or any letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger
Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant hereto. In lieu thereof, each registered holder of one or more
Book-Entry Shares shall automatically upon receipt by the Paying Agent of any customary transmission or materials required by
the Paying Agent, be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant hereto. Payment
