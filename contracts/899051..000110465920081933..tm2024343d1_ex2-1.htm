WHEREAS, the parties intend that Merger Sub will be merged with and into the
Company, with the Company as the Surviving Corporation (the " _Merger_

Company Common Stock (the " _Company Common Shares_ ") will be converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration and each issued and outstanding
share of Company Preferred Stock (the " _Company Preferred Shares_ ") will
remain outstanding, in each case, on the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ");

other Transactions and (b) determining that the terms of the Merger and the

WHEREAS, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desires to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with
the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Transactions.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and premises
contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration,

as follows:

  



  

   

 | 1| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

ARTICLE I 
 THE MERGER

  



  

Section 1.1 _The Merger_.

  



  

(a) On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, Merger Sub shall be merged with
and into the Company at the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall
continue as the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ "). The
Merger shall have the effect set forth in this Agreement and specified in the
DGCL.

  



  

(b) The Company Charter in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall remain the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter it is amended in accordance with the
provisions thereof, hereof and the other organizational documents of the
Surviving Corporation and applicable Law.

  



  

(c) At or prior to the Effective Time, the parties shall take all
necessary action such that, effective at the Effective Time, the bylaws of
Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become
the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation (except that all references in the
bylaws of Merger Sub to its name shall instead refer to the name of the
Surviving Corporation) until thereafter it is amended in accordance with the
provisions thereof, hereof and the other organizational documents of the
Surviving Corporation and applicable Law.

  



  

Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing (the " _Closing_ ") of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (such transactions, including the
Merger, the " _Transactions_ ") will take place by the exchange of documents
by facsimile, PDF or other electronic means, at 10:00 a.m. New York City
time, on a date to be specified by the parties, such date to be no later than
the third Business Day after satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions
set forth in _ARTICLE VI_ (other than conditions that may only be satisfied
on the Closing Date, but subject to the satisfaction of such conditions),
unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties.
The date on which the Closing actually occurs is referred to herein as the "
_Closing Date_."

  



  

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date and
contemporaneously with the Closing, the Company and Merger Sub shall cause to
be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "
_Secretary of State_ ") a certificate of merger (the  " _Certificate of
Merger_ ") executed and acknowledged in accordance with, and containing such
information as is required by, the relevant provisions of the DGCL in order
to effect the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at the time the
Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State or such later
date and time as is agreed upon in writing by the parties and specified in
the Certificate of Merger (such date and time the Merger shall become
effective, the " _Effective Time_ ").

  



  

Section 1.4 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving
Corporation_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the parties shall take all
necessary action so that the directors and officers of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the only directors and officers of the
Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time, each to hold
office in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL and the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

ARTICLE II 
 MERGER CONSIDERATION; CONVERSION OF STOCK

  



  

Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company or their respective stockholders:

  



  

(a) Each issued and outstanding share of common stock of Merger
Sub, par value $0.01 per share (the " _Merger Sub Common Stock_ "), shall be
converted into one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation, par value $0.01 (the " _Surviving
Corporation Common Stock_ "). From and after the Effective Time, all
certificates representing shares of Merger Sub Common Stock, if any, shall be
deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of Surviving
Corporation Common Stock into which they were converted in accordance with the
immediately preceding sentence.

  



  

(b) Each Company Common Share and each Company Preferred Share
that is owned by (x) Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or (y) the Company or any direct
or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company (including treasury
shares) shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.

  



  

(c) Subject to _Section 2.1(d)_, _Section 2.1(e)_ and _Section
2.2_, each issued and outstanding Company Common Share (other than Company
Common Shares to be cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.1(b_) and
Appraisal Shares), shall be automatically converted into the right to receive
$32.00 in cash, without interest thereon and subject to any required
withholding of Taxes (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), and such certificated
Company Common Share and the certificate that formerly represented such
Company Common Share (a " _Certificate_ ") or such non-certificated Company
Common Share in book-entry form (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), as the case may be,
shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration
per Company Common Share represented thereby. For the avoidance of doubt,
in addition to the Merger Consideration, immediately prior to and in
connection with the Closing, holders of Company Common Shares will receive
the Special Dividend as contemplated by _Section 5.20_

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
if, from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, the outstanding
Company Common Shares shall have been changed into a different number of
shares or a different class by reason of any reclassification, stock split
(including a reverse stock split), recapitalization, split-up, combination,
exchange of shares, readjustment or other similar transaction, or a stock
dividend or stock distribution thereon shall be declared with a record date
within said period, the Merger Consideration and any other similarly
dependent terms, as the case may be, including the Special Dividend Amount,
shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of Company Common
Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to
such event.

  



  

   

 | 3| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(e) As of the Effective Time, each issued and outstanding share of
Series A Preferred Stock of the Company, par value $0.01 per share (the "
_Company Series A Preferred Stock_"), Series B Preferred Stock of the
Company, par value $0.01 per share (the " _Company Series B Preferred
Stock_"), Series C Preferred Stock of the Company, par value $0.01 per share
(the " _Company Series C Preferred Stock_"), and Series D Preferred Stock of
the Company, par value $0.01 per share (the " _Company Series D Preferred
Stock,_" and, together with the Company Series A Preferred Stock, the Company
Series B Preferred Stock and the Company Series C Preferred Stock, the "
_Company Preferred Stock_ ") shall remain issued and outstanding without
variation.

  



  

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
Company Common Shares and shares of Company Series D Preferred Stock that
are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by
any Person who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
shares and who has not effectively withdrawn or lost such Person's right to
appraisal of such shares (" _Appraisal Shares_ ") pursuant to, and who
complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section
262_") shall not be converted into Merger Consideration as provided in this
_Section 2.1_, or, in the case of the Company Series D Preferred Stock,
remain outstanding as contemplated by _Section 2.1(e)_, but rather shall
entitle the holders thereof only to such rights as are granted by Section
262; _provided_ ; _however_ , if the holder of any such shares shall fail to
perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal
under Section 262, then such shares shall cease to be Appraisal Shares and
shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to
have become exchangeable solely for, the Merger Consideration provided in
this _Section 2.1_, or, in the case of the Company Series D Preferred Stock,
remain outstanding as contemplated by _Section 2.1(e)_. The Company shall
provide prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal of any Company Shares and Parent shall have the right to participate
in and direct all negotiations and Actions with respect to such demands.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written
consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer or
commit to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

  



  

Section 2.2 _Exchange of Company Common Shares_.

  



  

(a) At the Effective Time, Parent shall provide or shall cause to
be provided to the transfer agent for the Company Common Shares or another
nationally recognized financial institution designated by Parent and
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ ") all of the cash
necessary to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration to be paid pursuant to
_Section 2.1 _(such cash provided to the Paying Agent, being hereinafter
referred to as the " _Payment Fund_ "). The Paying Agent shall promptly
deliver the cash contemplated to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.1_ out of the
Payment Fund to each holder of Company Common Shares who has surrendered its
certificates in respect of the Company Common Shares, if applicable,
and delivered a properly completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal,
if applicable; provided that no such delivery shall be required in respect of
a holder of Company Common Shares until at least the third (3rd) Business Day
following surrender of such certificates and delivery of such Letter of
Transmittal by such a holder, in each case, if required pursuant to _Section
2.2_. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. In the event
the Payment Fund shall be insufficient to pay the portion of the Merger
Consideration that remains payable (including as a result of any losses
resulting from the investments contemplated in _Section 2.2(g)_), Parent
shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds with the
Paying Agent in an amount that is equal to the deficiency.

  



  

   

 | 4| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Parent shall instruct the Paying Agent to mail, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, to each holder of record of
a Certificate whose Company Common Shares were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_, (i) a letter
of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to any Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery
of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have
such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify (the " _Letter of
Transmittal_ ") and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration and matters relating
thereto. Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Paying Agent, together with
the Letter of Transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required
by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash which the aggregate number of
Company Common Shares previously represented by such Certificate shall have
been converted pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_, and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Company Common Shares that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other than
the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if
such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of
Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Subject to _Section
2.1(e)_, until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.2(b)_, each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration into
which the Company Common Shares theretofore represented by such Certificate
have been converted pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_. No interest shall be
paid or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no holder of Book-Entry
Shares shall be required to deliver a Certificate or any letter of transmittal
to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is
entitled to receive pursuant hereto. In lieu thereof, each registered holder
of one or more Book-Entry Shares shall automatically upon receipt by the
Paying Agent of any customary transmission or materials required by the
Paying Agent, be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder
is entitled to receive pursuant hereto. Payment of the Merger Consideration
with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose
name such Book-Entry Shares are registered.

  



  

(c) The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of
this _ARTICLE II_ upon conversion of any Company Common Shares shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
Company Common Shares. After the Effective Time there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of Company Common Shares that were outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates
formerly representing Company Common Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _ARTICLE II_. For the avoidance
of doubt, this _Section 2.2(c)_ does not affect the right of holders of
record of issued and outstanding Company Common Shares immediately prior to
the Effective Time to receive, in connection with the consummation of the
Merger and as consideration in connection therewith, the Special
Dividend pursuant to the terms of _Section 5.20_.

  



  

   

 | 5| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains undistributed to
the holders of Company Common Stock for twelve (12) months after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation (or, at
the option of Parent, delivered to Parent) free and clear of any claim or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto other than that holders of
Company Common Shares that have not theretofore complied with this _ARTICLE
II_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation or Parent,
as applicable, therefor for payment of its claim for the Merger
Consideration.

  



  

(e) None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect
of any cash from the Payment Fund (including any amounts delivered to Parent
in accordance with _Section 2.2(d)_) delivered to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  



  

(f) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond
in such reasonable and customary amount as Parent or the Paying Agent may
reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable
pursuant to this _ARTICLE II_ had such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
been surrendered.

  



  

(g) The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Payment
Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily basis or hold as cash or in a savings
deposit or similar account at the direction of Parent; _provided_ , _however_
, if any such investment is directed by Parent, any such investments shall be
in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States government or any
agency or instrumentality thereof, in commercial paper obligations rated A 1
or P 1 or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's
Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or banker's acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$5.0 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that
are then publicly available); _provided_ , _further_ , no monetary losses on
such investment thereof shall affect the Merger Consideration payable
hereunder and, following any such losses, Parent shall promptly provide
additional funds to the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of
Company Common Shares, for exchange in accordance with this _ARTICLE II_, in
the amount of such losses to the extent that the amount then in the Payment
Fund is insufficient to pay the Merger Consideration that remains payable.
Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Parent.

  



  

(h) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as applicable, shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to
any Person pursuant to this Agreement, including the Special Dividend, such
amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986
(the " _Code_ ") or under any provision of U.S. state or local or
non-U.S. Tax Law; _provided_ , _however_ , Parent shall, as soon as
practicable prior to the Effective Time: (a) provide prompt notice to the
Company upon determining any withholding is required and (b) cooperate with
the Company to minimize the amount of any applicable deduction or
withholding, including by providing reasonable opportunity to provide such
documentation or take any other actions necessary to reduce or eliminate such
deduction or withholding. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid
over to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such amount deducted or withheld
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made, and, in
the case of any amounts withheld from any payments not consisting entirely of
cash, Parent shall be treated as though it withheld an appropriate amount of
the type of consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder of Company Common Stock, sold such consideration for an amount of cash
equal to the fair market value of such consideration at the time of such
deemed sale and paid such cash proceeds to the Person in respect of which
such deduction or withholding was made.

a Company Common Share granted pursuant to a Company Stock Plan (a  "
_Company Stock Option_ "), regardless of whether vested or unvested, shall,
without any action on the part of Parent, the Company or the holder thereof,
be cancelled and, in exchange therefor in full satisfaction of the rights of
such holder with respect thereto, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries, through their respective payroll
systems, to pay each former holder of any such cancelled Company Stock Option
on the first regularly scheduled payroll date of the Surviving Corporation
following the Effective Time, that is no less than three (3) Business Days
thereafter, an amount in cash (without interest thereon and subject to
deduction for any required withholding of Taxes) equal to the product of (i)

shares of Company Common Stock underlying such Company Stock Option.

  



  

(b) As of the Effective Time, each outstanding restricted stock
unit granted pursuant to a Company Stock Plan (a " _Company RSU_ "), which

holder thereof, be cancelled and, in exchange therefor in full satisfaction of
the rights of such holder with respect thereto, Parent shall cause the

Stock underlying such Company RSU.

  



  

(c) Each unvested Company RSU, if any, granted following the date
hereof in accordance with the terms of _Section 5.1(a)_, pursuant to the

_Assumed Company RSU_ ") and converted automatically into a restricted stock
unit award with respect to a number of shares of the common stock of Parent
(each, an " _Adjusted RSU Award_ ") equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (A) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
the Assumed Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time by (B)
the Equity Award Exchange Ratio; _provided_ , that any fractional shares
shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number. Each Adjusted RSU Award

applicable to the Assumed Company RSU under the applicable Company Stock Plan
and the agreements evidencing grants thereunder, including vesting, settlement
and acceleration.

filed all annual and quarterly statements, together with all
exhibits, interrogatories, notes, schedules, annexes, and any actuarial
opinions, affirmations or certifications or other supporting documents in
connection therewith and any amendments thereto, required to be filed with or
submitted to the appropriate Insurance Regulators of the jurisdiction in
which such Company Insurance Subsidiary is domiciled or commercially domiciled
on forms prescribed or permitted by such Insurance Regulator (collectively,
the " _Company Statutory Financial Statements_ "), except for such

complied in all material respects with all applicable Laws when filed or

request for such to, a Governmental Entity in connection with the Company
Statutory Financial Statements, which have not been disclosed in the notes to
the Company Statutory Financial Statements filed with a Governmental Entity
prior to the date hereof. The statutory balance sheets and income
statements included in the Company's annual combined statutory financial
statements have been audited by the Company's independent auditors. Except as

financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act and sufficient
to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial
reporting for the Acquired Companies. The Company has designed disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the
Exchange Act) to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be
disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and is accumulated and
communicated to the Company's management as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company has disclosed to its
auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board, based on the most
recent assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal controls
over financial reporting, (i) any significant deficiency or material weakness
which is reasonably likely to adversely affect its ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial data and (ii) any fraud, whether or
not material, that involved management or other employees who have a
significant role in the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
As at December 31, 2019, there were no material weaknesses or significant
deficiencies in such internal control over financial reporting and, as of the
date hereof, nothing has come to the attention of the Company that has caused
the Company to believe that there are any material weaknesses or significant
deficiencies in such internal control over financing reporting.

not misleading. The Proxy Statement will, as of its first date of use, comply
as to form in all material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act.

deliver a new Notice of Company Superior Proposal to Parent and shall comply
with the requirements of this _Section 5.2(f)_ with respect to such new
Notice of Company Superior Proposal, except that any subsequent Company
Superior Proposal Notice Period shall be two (2) Business Days following
Parent's receipt of such new Notice of Company Superior Proposal. For the
avoidance of doubt, delivery and receipt of a Notice of Company Superior
Proposal shall not constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change.

  



  

(g) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the
Company Board, in circumstances not involving or relating to a Company
Acquisition Proposal, from effecting a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
in response to the occurrence of a Company Intervening Event if the Company
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with the Company's outside
legal counsel) that the failure to do so would or would reasonably be
expected to constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law
and the Company has first: (i) provided written notice to Parent (a " _Notice
of Company Intervening Event_ ") describing the Company Intervening Event and
advising Parent that the Company Board intends to take such action and
specifying the reasons therefor in reasonable detail; (ii) caused the Company
and its Representatives to be available to negotiate, during the four (4)
Business Days following Parent's receipt of the Notice of Company Intervening
Event (the " _Company Intervening Event Notice Period_ "), in good faith with
Parent regarding any revisions to the terms of the Transactions proposed
by Parent in response to such Company Intervening Event (to the extent Parent
wishes to do so); and (iii) at the end of the Company Intervening Event
Notice Period, the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with the Company's outside legal counsel (and taking into account any
adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement proposed by
Parent), that a Company Intervening Event continues to exist and that the
failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would constitute a
breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

  



  

(h) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.2_ or elsewhere in this
Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing a
position contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A, Rule 14e-2(a) under
the Exchange Act or Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act, (ii) making any "stop,
look and listen" communication to the Company's stockholders pursuant to Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or (iii) making any disclosure to its
stockholders if the Company Board determines (after consultation with its
outside counsel) that failure to do so would reasonably be expected to
constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company
under applicable Law, provided that this _Section 5.2(h)_ shall not be
deemed to permit the Company Board to make a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change except to the extent permitted by _Section 5.2(d)_; provided, further
that, in each case of the foregoing clauses (i) through (iii), the Company
Board reaffirms its recommendation of the Transaction within three (3) days
of any such communication.

Section 5.3 _Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Company
Stockholder Meeting_.

  



  

(a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement
(and no later than thirty (30) days after the date hereof), the Company shall
prepare and file with the SEC, a preliminary version of a proxy statement
relating to the adoption and approval of this Agreement by the holders of the
Company Common Stock at the Company Stockholder Meeting (together with any
amendments or supplements thereto, whether preliminary or definitive, the "
_Proxy Statement_ "). Parent shall cooperate in the preparation of the Proxy
Statement. The Company shall provide Parent with the opportunity to review and
comment on the Proxy Statement prior to its filing with the SEC. Except as
required by applicable Law, no filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the
Proxy Statement will be made by the Company without Parent's prior written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) and, in any case, without providing Parent the opportunity to review
and comment thereon. The Company will advise Parent promptly after it
receives any oral or written request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy
Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC
for additional information, and will promptly provide Parent with copies of
any written communication received from the SEC or any state or foreign
securities commission. If at any time prior to the Company
Stockholder Meeting any information relating to Parent or the Company, or any
of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, is discovered by
Parent or the Company which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement
to the Proxy Statement so that any such document would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information
shall promptly notify the other and an appropriate amendment or supplement to
the Proxy Statement describing such information shall be promptly filed with
the SEC by the Company, after Parent has had a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment thereon, and, to the extent required by applicable Law,
disseminated to the holders of Company Common Stock. As promptly as reasonably
practicable after the date on which the staff of the SEC confirms that it has
no further comments on the Proxy Statement or that it does not intend to
review the Proxy Statement, the Company will file a definitive version of the
Proxy Statement with the SEC and cause the definitive version of the Proxy
Statement to be mailed to the holders of Company Common Stock.

  



  

(b) Unless the Company Board has effected a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change in accordance with _Section 5.2(d)_, the
Company shall, (i) as soon as reasonably practicable (and in no event later
than forty-five (45) days) following the date on which the definitive version
of the Proxy Statement is first mailed to holders of the Company Common Stock,
duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the holders of
Company Common Stock (the " _Company Stockholder Meeting_ ") for the purpose
of seeking the Company Stockholder Approval, (ii) through the Company Board,
recommend that the holders of Company Common Stock adopt this Agreement (the
" _Company Recommendation_ "), (iii) use its reasonable best efforts to
solicit from holders of Company Common Stock proxies in favor of the adoption
of this Agreement and (iv) use its reasonable best efforts to take all other
action necessary or advisable to secure the Company Stockholder Approval. The
Company shall have the right, after good faith consultation with Parent, to,
and shall at the request of Parent, postpone or adjourn the
Company Stockholder Meeting for no longer than twenty (20) Business Days in
the aggregate (A) for the absence of a quorum, or (B) to allow reasonable
additional time to solicit additional proxies to the extent that at such time,
taking into account the amount of time until the Company Stockholder Meeting,
the Company has not received a number of proxies that would reasonably be
believed to be sufficient to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval at the
Company Stockholder Meeting. The Company shall keep Parent updated with
respect to proxy solicitation results as reasonably requested by Parent.

Section 5.4 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Subject to
contractual and legal restrictions applicable to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to,
afford to Parent and its Representatives reasonable access during normal
business hours during the period from the date of this Agreement to the
Effective Time or the date of the termination of this Agreement, as the case
may be, to all of their respective properties, books, contracts, commitments,
personnel and records (including the work papers of independent accountants,
if available and subject to the consent of such independent accountants) and,
during such period, Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
furnish promptly to Parent and its Representatives all information concerning
its business, properties and personnel as such other may reasonably request,
in each case, for reasonable business purposes related to the consummation of
the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , such access does not
unreasonably disrupt the ordinary course operations of the Acquired
Companies. No access, materials, information or investigation pursuant to
this _Section 5.4_ shall affect any representation or warranty in this
Agreement of any party or any condition to the obligations of the parties.
This _Section 5.4_ shall not require any Acquired Company to permit any
access, or to disclose any materials or information, that in the reasonable
judgment of such party would reasonably be expected to (i) result in the
disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties or a violation of any of its
obligations with respect to confidentiality under any Contract or Law (
_provided_ that party shall have used its reasonable best efforts to obtain
the consent of such third party to such access or disclosure), (ii) result in
the loss of the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other
legal privilege with respect to such materials or information or (iii) in the
case of documents or portions of documents relating to pricing or other
matters that are highly sensitive, result in a violation of applicable Law
(including a Governmental Entity alleging that providing such information
violates any Regulatory Law). If any material is withheld by a party
pursuant to the preceding sentence, such party shall inform the other as to
the general nature of what is being withheld and use reasonable best efforts
to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable disclosure
under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence
apply, to the extent permitted by applicable Law. All materials and
information exchanged or to which access is granted pursuant to this _Section
5.4 _shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of January
21, 2020 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), between the Company and
Parent.

Section 5.5 _Further Action; Efforts_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each
party will use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Law to consummate the Transactions, including: (i)
obtaining all necessary actions or non-actions, waivers, consents,
qualifications and approvals from Governmental Entities and making all
necessary registrations, filings and notifications and taking all reasonable
steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval, clearance, non-action
letter, waiver or exemption from any Governmental Entity (including under the
HSR Act and the Requisite Regulatory Approvals); (ii) defending any lawsuits
or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging
this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions, including seeking to
have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other
Governmental Entity vacated or reversed; and (iii) executing and
delivering any additional documents or instruments reasonably necessary to
consummate the Transactions and to carry out this Agreement. In furtherance
and not in limitation of the foregoing, each party agrees to make, if
required, appropriate filings and registrations under applicable Regulatory
Laws and Insurance Laws. Each party agrees to make, if required, an
appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act
with respect to the Transactions within thirty (30) days after the date hereof
and to supply as promptly as reasonably practicable and advisable any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested by any
Governmental Entity pursuant to the HSR Act and to take all other reasonable
actions necessary, proper or advisable to cause the expiration or termination
of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable,
including by requesting early termination of the waiting period provided for
in the HSR Act. Each party agrees to make, if required, appropriate filings
of Applications for Approval of Acquisition of Control Statements, or "Form A"
statements, and all related filings, with respect to the Transactions with
the applicable Insurance Regulators, as applicable, within thirty (30)
Business Days after the date hereof; provided, however, that any required
pre-acquisition notice (Form E) filings, Form E exemption filings, and all
related applications and filings with respect to the Transactions shall be
submitted within forty (40) Business Days after the date hereof. Each party
agrees to supply as promptly as reasonably practicable and advisable any
additional information and documentary material that may be reasonably
requested by any Insurance Regulator pursuant to the Insurance Laws and to
take all other reasonable actions necessary, proper or advisable to obtain
the applicable consents and approvals of the applicable Insurance Regulators
as soon as practicable.

  



  

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the
Company, on the other hand, shall, in connection with and without
limiting the obligations to use certain efforts referenced in _Section
5.5(a)_, to the extent relating to the requisite approvals, authorizations
and clearances for the Transactions under the HSR Act and the other Regulatory
Laws and the Insurance Laws, use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate
in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry,
including any Action initiated by a private party, (ii) keep the other
reasonably informed of any communication received by such party from, or given
by such party to, the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the Antitrust
Division of the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ "), any
Insurance Regulator or any other Governmental Entity and of any communication
received or given in connection with any Action by a private party, in each
case regarding any of the Transactions, (iii) permit the other a reasonable
opportunity to review any substantive written communication given by it to,
and consult with each other in advance of any scheduled substantive meeting,
discussion or conference with, the FTC, the DOJ, any Insurance Regulator or
any other Governmental Entity or, in connection with any Action by a private
party, with any other Person, and, to the extent permitted by the FTC, the
DOJ, such Insurance Regulator or such other applicable Governmental Entity or
other Person, as applicable, give the other the reasonable opportunity to
attend and participate in such meetings, discussions and conferences solely
to the extent such meetings, discussions and conference relate to this
Agreement, the Merger or the other Transactions, and (iv) to the extent
practicable and subject to the other provisions in this _Section
5.5_, attempt to confer in good faith in order to (A) exchange and review
respective views and positions with the other as to potential Materially
Burdensome Conditions and (B) discuss and present to, and engage with, the
applicable Governmental Entity regarding any approaches or actions that could
mitigate the scope or impact of a potential Materially Burdensome Condition so
that it does not become a Materially Burdensome Condition. Parent and the
Company shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any
communication, including promptly furnishing each other copies of any written
or electronic communication, and shall promptly advise each other when any
such communication causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable
likelihood that any requisite approval, authorization or clearance for the
Transactions under the HSR Act or any Requisite Regulatory Approval will not
be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval, authorization or
clearance or Requisite Regulatory Approval will be materially delayed or
conditioned or impose or require a Materially Burdensome Condition. The
parties will consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good
faith the views of one another, in connection with, and provide to the other
parties in advance, any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda,
briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals to be made or submitted by or on
behalf of any party, including reasonable access to any materials submitted
in connection with any proceedings under or relating to the HSR Act or any
other applicable Regulatory Law, including any proceeding under 16 C.F.R. §
803.20. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.5_, no
party will have any obligation to share any trade secret or other
competitively sensitive information with the other party. Such materials and
the information contained therein shall be given only to the outside counsel
for matters relating to Regulatory Law of the recipient and will not be
disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers, directors or
consultants of the recipient or any of its Affiliates, unless express
permission is obtained in advance from the Company or Parent, as the case may
be, or its outside legal counsel. Each of the Company and Parent shall cause
its respective outside legal counsel for matters relating to Regulatory Law
to comply with this _Section 5.5(b)_.

  



  

   

46

 



    



  

(c) Without limiting any other obligations of Parent hereunder,
Parent will respond to and seek to resolve as promptly as reasonably
practicable any objections asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect
to the Transactions and will use its reasonable best efforts to take any and
all action necessary to ensure that each requisite approval, authorization or
clearance under the HSR Act and each Requisite Regulatory Approval is
obtained by the Outside Date, in each case, without imposing or requiring a
Materially Burdensome Condition.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no
Parent Company shall be obligated to, and no Acquired Company shall, without
the prior written consent of Parent at its sole discretion, consent to, take
or refrain from taking, or offer or commit or consent to take or refrain from
taking (A) any action that involves (i) making any divestiture or disposition
of any portion of any business or assets, (ii) licensing any portion of any
business or assets, (iii) accepting or entering any consent decree or hold
separate order, (iv) placing any assets in trust, in each case by Parent or
any of the other Parent Companies or the Company or any of the other Acquired
Companies or any of their respective Affiliates, (v) accepting or entering
into any operational restriction or restriction on the payment or declaration
of dividends, (vi) making any capital commitment or capital guaranty, (vii)
entering into any capital support agreement, statement of support, guarantee,
keep well or other similar capital maintenance undertaking to maintain a
minimum risk-based capital level or rating, or (B) any other action with
respect to, or in connection with, Parent or the other Parent Companies or the
Company or the other Acquired Companies or any of their respective
Affiliates, in the case of clauses (A) and (B) above, which, individually or
together with any other such action, would or would reasonably be expected to
have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations or
financial condition of (x) the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
when considered together with the business lines of Parent and its
Subsidiaries that, as of the date hereof, Parent intends to integrate with the
Company and its Subsidiaries following the Closing, or (y) Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (provided that, for this purpose, the
business, financial condition, results of operations and financial condition
of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, shall be deemed to be as of
the same scale as the entities described in the foregoing clause (x)) (any
such action, a " _Materially Burdensome Condition_ ").

  



  

   

47

 



    



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, in no event shall a party or any of its Affiliates be required by a
Governmental Entity to agree to take, or enter into any action with respect
to their respective assets, businesses or Subsidiaries pursuant to this
_Section 5.5_, which action is not conditioned upon the Closing.

  



  

Section 5.6 _Employee Benefits Matters._

  



  

(a) For a period commencing at the Effective Time through December
31, 2021 (or, if earlier, the date of termination of the relevant employee)
(the " _Continuation Period_ "), Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be
provided, to each employee of any of the Acquired Companies as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time (each, a " _Continuing Employee_ "), (i) a base
salary or hourly wage rate at least equivalent to the base salary or hourly
wage rate in effect for such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Closing, (ii) a target bonus opportunity that is at least equivalent to such
Continuing Employee's target bonus opportunity as in effect for fiscal year
2020 (which may be settled in cash, equity or a combination thereof as
determined by Parent in its sole discretion), (iii) employee benefits
substantially comparable to either, as determined by Parent in its sole
discretion, the respective levels as in effect under the Company Plans (other
than any equity compensation, change in control, retention, non-qualified
deferred compensation arrangement, defined benefit plan or retiree health or
welfare arrangement) immediately prior to the Closing or the employee
benefits (other than any equity compensation, change in control, retention,
non-qualified deferred compensation arrangement, defined benefit plan or
retiree health or welfare arrangement) made available to similarly situated
employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries from time to time, and (iv) with
respect to any Continuing Employee whose employment is terminated by Parent
or the Surviving Corporation (but not including any Continuing Employee
who has entered into an individualized agreement providing for severance
benefits upon a qualifying termination of employment), severance benefits
that are no less than the severance benefits set forth in _Section 5.6(a)_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter, taking into account all service with the
Company in determining the amount of severance benefits payable, subject to
such Continuing Employee's execution of a general release of claims in favor
of the Parent and its Affiliates in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent
that becomes effective and non-revocable within sixty (60) days following such
termination.

  



  

   

48

 



    



  

(b) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change in control" (or
similar phrase) within the meaning of the Company Plans will occur at the
Effective Time.

  



  

(c) Following the Effective Time, Parent shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause each Continuing Employee to be provided full credit
for prior service with the Company or its Subsidiaries as was credited under
similar or comparable Company Plans for purposes of (i) eligibility and
vesting under any Parent Plans (other than any equity-incentive plans), but
not for eligibility or benefit accrual purposes under any defined benefit
plan or non-qualified deferred compensation plan of any of the Parent
Companies or for purposes of determining eligibility for retiree health and
welfare benefits, and (ii) determination of benefit levels under any Parent
Plan or policy of general application relating to vacation or, following the
Continuation Period, severance, in either case to the extent the Continuing
Employees is eligible to participate, as determined by Parent in its sole
discretion, but except: (x) where such credit would result in a duplication
of benefits; (y) to the extent that such service was not recognized under the
corresponding Company Plan immediately prior to Closing; or (z) to the extent
that such service is not recognized under such Parent Plan for other
similarly situated employees of Parent and its Affiliates. In addition, Parent
shall use reasonable best efforts to: (A) waive, or cause to be waived, any
limitations on benefits relating to pre-existing conditions, actively-at-work
requirements, waiting periods and similar exclusions, to the same extent such
limitations, exclusions and requirements would not have been applicable to
such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents under the terms of
any comparable medical and dental plan of the Acquired Companies; and (B)
cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or
her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the similar or
comparable Company Plans to be taken into account for purposes of
satisfying all deductibles, co-payments, maximum out-of-pocket requirements
and similar expenses applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her
covered dependents for the applicable similar or comparable Parent Plan during
the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs.

  



  

(d) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring, and
the Company shall take no action that would have the effect of
requiring, Parent or the Surviving Corporation to continue any specific
employee benefit plans, to permit the rollover of plan benefits into, or
participation in, a Parent benefit plan or to continue the employment of any
specific individual. The provisions of this _Section 5.6 _are for the sole
benefit of the parties and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended
or shall be construed to (i) constitute an amendment to any of the
compensation and benefits plans maintained for or provided to Continuing
Employees prior to or following the Effective Time, (ii) impede or limit
Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Affiliates from amending or terminating any Company Plan following the
Effective Time or (iii) confer upon or give to any Person (including for the
avoidance of doubt any current or former employees, labor unions, directors or
independent contractors of any of the Acquired Companies or, on or after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries), other
than the parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any
legal or equitable or other rights or remedies under or by reason of
any provision of this Agreement.

  



  

   

49

 



    



  

(e) Upon Parent's reasonable request from time to time prior to
Closing, the Company shall, a reasonable period of time following receipt of
such request (but in no event more than ten (10) Business days following such
request), provide Parent with the then-most recent calculations and
reasonable back-up information relating to Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code
relating to the Merger, including any non-compete valuations.

  



  

(f) _401(k) Plan_. The Company shall take (or cause to be
taken) all actions necessary or appropriate to terminate, effective no later
than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, any Company Plan that
contains a cash or deferred arrangement intended to qualify under Section
401(k) of the Code (the " _401(k) Plans_"), unless Parent or one of its
Affiliates, in its sole and absolute discretion, agrees to sponsor and
maintain such 401(k) Plans by providing the Company with written notice of
such election at least ten (10) days before the Closing. Unless Parent or one
of its Affiliates provides such notice to the Company, Parent shall receive
from the Company, prior to the Closing, evidence that the Company Board or its
applicable Affiliate has adopted resolutions to terminate the 401(k) Plans
(the form and substance of which resolutions shall be subject to review and
approval of Parent), effective no later than the date immediately preceding
the Closing Date. The Company shall take (or cause to be taken) such other
actions in furtherance of terminating such 401(k) Plans as Parent may
reasonably require and Parent shall take all necessary and legally
permissible actions to direct its or one of its Affiliate's defined
contribution plan to accept the rollover of any "eligible rollover
distribution" (within the meaning of Section 402(c)(4) of the Code) from the
Company's 401(k) Plan. If Parent, in its sole and absolute discretion, agrees
to sponsor and maintain any 401(k) Plan, the Company shall amend such 401(k)
Plan, effective as of the Closing, to the extent necessary to
limit participation to employees of the Company and to exclude all employees
of Parent and its Subsidiaries (other than the Acquired Companies) from
participation in the such plan.

  



  

(g) Subject to applicable Law and the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, the
Company will, and will cause each of the Acquired Companies to use reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary to
facilitate (i) the integration of personnel between the Acquired Companies
promptly following the Closing, and (ii) the transfer of employment of
certain employees of Parent or its Affiliates to the Acquired Companies as of
immediately following the Closing.

  



  

Section 5.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company and
Parent shall promptly notify each other of the receipt of any written
communication received from any Person alleging that it or any other Person
is or may be required to obtain a consent of such first-mentioned Person in
connection with the Transactions or a consent from any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Transactions. The delivery of any notice pursuant to this
_Section 5.7_ shall not (a) cure any breach of, or non-compliance with, any
other provision of this Agreement, (b) limit the remedies available to the
party sending or receiving such notice or (c) be construed in any way as an
admission that such consent is required.

  



  

Section 5.8 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

  



  

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation,
indemnification or advancement of expenses arising from, relating to or
otherwise in respect of, acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective
Time now existing in favor of the current or former directors or officers of
any of the Acquired Companies as provided in their respective certificates of
incorporation, bylaws or other comparable organizational documents and any
indemnification or other agreements of the Acquired Companies with any of the
current or former directors or officers of any of the Acquired Companies as
in effect on the date of this Agreement shall be assumed by the
Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further action, at the Effective
Time, and shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with their terms. For a period of no less than six (6)
years from the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, maintain in effect the exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses provisions of each Acquired Company's certificate of
incorporation and bylaws or other comparable organizational documents in
effect as of the date of this Agreement or in any indemnification agreements
of the Acquired Companies with any of their respective directors, officers or
employees in effect as of the date of this Agreement, and shall not amend,
repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who immediately
before the Effective Time were current or former directors, officers or
employees of any of the Acquired Companies; _provided_ , _however_ , all
rights to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses in respect
of any Action pending or asserted or any claim made within such period shall
continue until the final disposition of such Action.

  



  

   

50

 



    



  

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall, to the fullest extent that the Company would have
been permitted under the Law of the State of Delaware, indemnify and hold
harmless (and advance funds in respect of each of the foregoing and costs of
defense to) each current and former director or officer of any of the Acquired
Companies (each such individual, together with such individual's heirs,
executors or administrators, an " _Indemnified Party_ "), in each case
against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, fees, costs and expenses
(including attorneys' fees and disbursements), judgments, fines and amounts
paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened Action, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of, relating to
or in connection with the fact that such Indemnified Party is or was an
officer, director or fiduciary of any of the Acquired Companies at or prior
to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , the Indemnified Party to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to the extent
required by applicable Law, to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party is
not entitled to indemnification for such expenses. No Indemnified Party shall
settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any threatened
or actual Action for which indemnification could be sought by an Indemnified
Party hereunder unless Parent consents in writing to such settlement,
compromise or consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

  



  

(c) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase
a prepaid (or " _tail_ ") directors' and officers' insurance and
indemnification policy that provides coverage for events occurring prior to
the Effective Time for an aggregate period of not less than six (6) years
from the Effective Time, that does not result in gaps or lapses of coverage
with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time and that is no
less favorable with respect to limits, deductibles and other terms compared
to the Company's existing directors' and officers' insurance and
indemnification policies or, if such insurance coverage is unavailable, the
best available similar coverage (the " _Continuing D andO
Insurance_"); provided, however, the premium for the Continuing DandO Insurance
shall not exceed the amount set forth on _Section 5.8(c)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter (in which such case the Company shall purchase Continuing
DandO Insurance that provides the maximum coverage available at such an amount
of premium).

  



  

   

51

 



    



  

(d) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity
of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all its properties and assets, then, and in each case, Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall ensure that such surviving corporation or
entity or the transferees of such properties or assets assume the obligations
set forth in this _Section 5.8_.

opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of
the Transactions. If the Company fails promptly to pay the amounts due

obligations or acts of the other party or parties, as applicable, (b) waive
any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other party or
parties set forth in this Agreement or any document delivered pursuant hereto
or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements, covenants or conditions
of the other party or parties contained herein; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
after the Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained, no waiver may be
made that pursuant to applicable Law requires further approval or adoption by
the stockholders of the Company without such further approval or adoption. Any
agreement on the part of a party to any such waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in a written instrument executed and delivered by a duly authorized
officer on behalf of such party. No failure or delay of any party in
exercising any right or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof,
nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any
abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such right or power, or any
course of conduct, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right or power. Except as otherwise provided herein, the
rights and remedies of the parties hereunder are cumulative and are not
exclusive of any rights or remedies which they would otherwise have hereunder.

unenforceable in any respect under any applicable Law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not

admission that such item is reasonably likely to result in a Company Material
Adverse Effect, and inclusion of any item in the Company Disclosure Letter or
the Parent Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed an admission that such item

disclosure in any section of the Company Disclosure Letter or Parent
Disclosure Letter of information that is also filed with or disclosed in any
Company SEC Document or Parent SEC Document, as applicable, shall not be
deemed a representation that there is no other information filed with or
disclosed in any Company SEC Document or Parent SEC Document, as applicable,
that would qualify the corresponding representation. Any Company SEC
Documents shall be deemed to qualify a representation or warranty only if it
is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure that such information is
relevant to such representation or warranty. All disclosures in the Company
Disclosure Letter and Parent Disclosure Letter are intended only to allocate
rights and risks between the parties to the Agreement and are not intended to
be admissions against interests, be admissible against any party by any
Person who is not a party (other than Affiliates, beneficiaries, or successors
or assigns of any of the parties), or give rise to any claim or benefit to
any Person who is not a party (other than Affiliates, beneficiaries, or
