Article VI, the consummation of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place
at the offices of Cleary Gottlieb Steen and Hamilton LLP, New York, NY, at 10:00

Day during the Marketing Period to be specified by the Parent on no fewer
than two (2) Business Days prior written notice to the Company and (ii) the

satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) of the
conditions set forth in Article VI as of the time of Closing determined
pursuant to such subclauses), or at such other place and time or on such other
date as the Parent and the Company may mutually agree in writing (the date on
which the Closing actually occurs, the " _Closing Date_ ").

1.3 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, on the
Closing Date, the Parent and the Company will cause a certificate of merger
(the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be duly executed, acknowledged and filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the

duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such
other subsequent date or time as the Parent and the Company may agree in
writing and specify in the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the DGCL
(the date and time the Merger becomes effective, the " _Effective Time_ ").

1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger will have the effects set forth in
this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

1.5 _Certificate of Incorporation_. Subject to Section 5.10, from and after
the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Company as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in
accordance with such certificate of incorporation and applicable Law.

1.6 _By-laws_. Subject to Section 5.10, from and after the Effective Time,
the by-laws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time (except that the name of the corporation in the by-laws shall read
"NATIONAL FINANCIAL PARTNERS CORP.") shall be the by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, such by-laws and applicable Law.

1.7 _Directors_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the directors of
the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors have been duly
elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation
or removal, in accordance with the Surviving Corporations certificate of
incorporation and by-laws and applicable Law.

 



2 1.8 _Officers_. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the officers of the

ARTICLE II

 

EFFECT OF MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK

2.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the Company, the Parent, Merger Sub, any
holder of any capital stock of the Company or Merger Sub or any other Person:

(a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of common stock,
par value $0.10 per share, of the Company (" _Common Stock_ ") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded
Shares and Dissenting Shares) will automatically be cancelled and converted
into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to
$25.35 (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), whereupon such shares of Common Stock
will cease to exist and no longer be outstanding, and each holder thereof
(together with each holder of any Excluded Shares or Dissenting Shares, each,
a " _Stockholder_ ") will cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest, upon
surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with Section
2.4.

(b) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time will automatically be converted into one fully paid and
non-assessable share of common stock, $0.10 par value per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

(c) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each share of Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned by the
Company as treasury stock or by the Parent or Merger Sub (collectively, the "
_Excluded Shares_ ") shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and no consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange
therefor. Each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time that is owned by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the
Company will also be an Excluded Share, unless the Parent elects to have any
such shares of Common Stock converted into shares of capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

(d)  _Company Stock Options_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each
then-outstanding Company Stock Option granted under any Company Stock Plan
shall be cancelled and shall be converted into the right to receive payment of
an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (i) the number
of shares of Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the per-share exercise price of such Company Stock Option
(for the avoidance of doubt, each holder of a Company Stock Option with a per-
share exercise price that is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration
shall not be entitled to receive any payment 

 



3  with respect to such Company Stock Option in exchange for its cancellation)
(the aggregate cash payments payable in respect of the Company Stock Options
under this Section 2.1(d), the " _Option Closing Amount_ ").

(e) _Restricted Stock Units_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time,
each Company Restricted Stock Unit Award granted under any Company Stock Plan
(other than non-employee director annual Company Restricted Stock Unit Awards
(" _Non-Employee Director RSUs_ ")) that is then vested or that becomes vested
as of the Effective Time (taking into account any accelerated vesting
provided for by the terms of any such Company Restricted Stock Unit Award as
in effect on the date hereof) (" _Vested RSUs_ ") shall be cancelled and shall
be converted into the right to receive payment of an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Common Stock
subject to such Vested RSUs, and (ii) the Merger Consideration (the aggregate
cash payments payable in respect of the Vested RSUs under this Section
2.1(e), the " _Vested RSU Award Closing Amount_ "). Each Company Restricted
Stock Unit Award (other than Non-Employee Director RSUs) that is not a Vested
RSU shall be expressly assumed by the Surviving Corporation as of the
Effective Time and converted into a service-based award that represents the
right of the holder to receive from the Surviving Corporation, and the
obligation of the Surviving Corporation to pay to such holder (and the Parent
shall cause payment by the Surviving Corporation thereof), on the regularly
scheduled vesting or payment date or dates for such Company Restricted Stock
Unit Award (taking into account any accelerated vesting provided for by the
terms of any such Company Restricted Stock Unit Award as in effect on the date
hereof) an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of
Common Stock subject to such Company Restricted Stock Unit Award that vest as
of the applicable vesting date, and (ii) the Merger Consideration, without
interest other than any interest thereon accrued prior to the applicable
vesting date in accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreement as
in effect on the date hereof evidencing such Company Restricted Stock Unit
Award (the aggregate cash payments payable in respect of the Company
Restricted Stock Unit Awards that are not Vested RSUs under this Section
2.1(e), the " _Unvested RSU Award Amount_ ").

(f) _Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units_. Immediately prior to the
Effective Time, in accordance with the terms of the Performance-Based
Restricted Stock Unit Awards, the performance conditions applicable to each
then-outstanding Performance-Based Restricted Stock Unit Award granted under
any Company Stock Plan shall be deemed satisfied such that 100% of the
participants then-outstanding Performance-Based Restricted Stock Unit Award
shall become "Earned PSUs" (within the meaning of the applicable award
agreement evidencing such Performance-Based Restricted Stock Unit Award).
Such Performance-Based Restricted Stock Unit Awards shall be expressly assumed
by the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time and converted into
service-based awards that represent the right of the holder to receive
from the Surviving Corporation (and Parent shall cause payment by the
Surviving Corporation thereof), and the obligation of the Surviving
Corporation to pay to such holder, on the regularly scheduled vesting date or
dates for any such Performance-Based Restricted Stock Unit Award (taking into
account any accelerated vesting provided for by the terms of any such
Performance-Based Restricted Stock Unit Award as in effect on the date hereof)
an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Common
Stock subject to such Performance-Based Restricted Stock Unit Award that vest
as of the

 



4  applicable vesting date, and (ii) the Merger Consideration, without interest
other than any interest thereon accrued prior to the applicable vesting date
of any such Performance-Based Restricted Stock Unit Award which is calculated
in accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreement as in effect on
the date hereof evidencing such Performance-Based Restricted Stock Unit Award.

 

(g) _Director Units_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each then-
outstanding Director Phantom Unit granted under any Company Stock Plan and
each Non-Employee Director RSU shall be cancelled and shall be converted into
the right to receive payment of an amount in cash, without interest, equal to
the product of (i) the number of shares of Common Stock subject to
such Director Phantom Unit or Non-Employee Director RSU, as the case may be,
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Merger Consideration (the
aggregate cash payments payable in respect of the Director Phantom Units and
the Non-Employee Director RSU under this Section 2.1(g), the " _Director Unit
Closing Amount_ ").

(h) The Option Closing Amount, the Vested RSU Award Closing Amount and the
Director Unit Closing Amount shall be collectively referred to herein as the "
_Closing Equity Incentive Amounts_ ". The Parent shall pay or cause to be paid
by the Surviving Corporation all Closing Equity Incentive Amounts to the
applicable holders entitled to such payments promptly following the Effective
Time (but in any event no later than five (5) Business Days after the date on
which the Effective Time occurs) through the payroll of the Surviving
Corporation or otherwise. Following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall pay, or cause one or more of its Subsidiaries to pay, the
Unvested RSU Award Amount and all other cash amounts described herein in
respect of the Performance-Based Restricted Stock Unit Awards (collectively,
the " _Post-Closing Equity Incentive Amounts_ ") to the applicable holders
entitled to such payments on the applicable vesting dates of such awards as
determined in accordance with their terms (taking into account any accelerated
vesting thereof) and the applicable subsections of this Section 2.1.

(i) _Alternative Treatment_. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this
Section 2.1, to the extent as may be agreed to by the Parent, on the one hand,
and any holder of shares of Common Stock or Company Equity Awards, on the
other hand, such shares or Company Equity Awards, as applicable, shall not be
converted as set forth in this Section 2.1 and shall not be subject to the
actions to be taken by the Company set forth in Section 2.1(j), but shall
instead be treated in the manner agreed to in writing by the Parent and such
holder. The Parent shall promptly (and, in any event, no later than five (5)
Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date) inform the Company of
the existence and terms of any such agreements.

(j) _Company Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take
all commercially reasonable actions to effectuate the provisions of Sections
2.1(d) through 2.1(h), to terminate all of the Company Stock Plans and to
ensure that all Company Equity Awards (other than with respect to
Company Restricted Stock Unit Awards to the extent assumed pursuant to
Section 2.1(e) and Performance-Based Restricted Stock Unit Awards to the
extent assumed pursuant to Section 2.1(f) and Company Stock Plans, in each
case, as related thereto) which have been granted or issued by the Company
(or promised to be issued pursuant to Contracts or offer letters pursuant to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound) are cancelled as of the
Effective Time without any payment or other consideration therefor, other
than the cash payments required by this Section 2.1. The Company shall provide
the Parent with drafts of, and a reasonable opportunity to comment on, all
material written materials required or prepared pursuant to this Section
2.1(j).

 



5 2.2 _Dissenters  Rights_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary and only
to the extent required to be provided under the DGCL, shares of Common Stock
that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the
Excluded Shares) and that are held by any Stockholder who has not voted in
favor of the adoption of this Agreement and who is otherwise entitled to
demand and properly demands appraisal for such shares (the " _Dissenting
Shares_ ") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions
of Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_ ") shall not be converted into,
or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration as provided for in
Section 2.1(a). Any such Stockholder shall instead be entitled to receive
payment of the fair value of such Stockholders Dissenting Shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262\. At the Effective Time, the
Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding, and each holder of a
Certificate or Book-Entry Share that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares
in accordance with the provisions of Section 262\. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, all Dissenting Shares held by any Stockholder who shall have
failed to perfect, waived, withdrawn or lost such Stockholders rights to
appraisal of such Dissenting Shares under Section 262 shall thereupon be
deemed to have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as
of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration in the
manner provided in Section 2.1(a), without interest thereon.

(b) The Company shall give the Parent (i) notice of any demands received by
the Company for appraisal of any shares of Common Stock, withdrawals of such
demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by
the Company relating to any claimed rights of appraisal under Section 262 and
(ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to demands for appraisal under Section 262, and the Company shall
not, except with the prior written consent of the Parent, voluntarily make any
payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or settle any such demands.

 

2.3 _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, the Company and its Subsidiaries, the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries, the Parent, Merger Sub and the Paying Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the amounts otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement to any Person such amounts as the Company or its Subsidiaries,
the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, the Parent, Merger Sub or the
Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign
Tax Law, and pay such withheld amounts over to the appropriate taxing
authority. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by the
Company or its Subsidiaries, the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries,
the Parent, Merger Sub or the Paying Agent and paid to the appropriate taxing
authority, such withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made by the Company or its Subsidiaries, the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries, the Parent, Merger Sub or the Paying Agent
(as applicable).

 



6 2.4 _Payment and Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent; Payment Fund_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Parent
shall designate a bank or trust company (which bank or trust company shall be
reasonably acceptable to the Company) to act as agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ")
to receive the funds to which Stockholders will become entitled pursuant to
Section 2.1(a), and the Parent will enter into a paying agent agreement with
the Paying Agent, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company,
for the payment of the Merger Consideration. At or prior to the Effective
Time, the Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying
Agent in trust for the benefit of the Stockholders an amount of cash equal to
the product of (i) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares) and (ii)
the Merger Consideration (the " _Payment Fund_ "). The Payment Fund shall not
be used for any purpose except as set forth herein. The Payment Fund shall be
invested by the Paying Agent as reasonably directed by the Parent; _provided_
,  _however_ , that such investments must be (x) in short-term obligations
of, or guaranteed in full by, the United States of America or of any agency
thereof that is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of
America, (y) in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by
either Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively, or (z) in deposit accounts, short-term negotiable certificates
of deposit or short-term negotiable bankers acceptances of one or more
commercial banks, each of which has capital, surplus and undivided profits
aggregating more than $10.0 billion (based on the most recent financial
statements of such bank which are then publicly available at the SEC or
otherwise). Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
shall not become part of the Payment Fund and shall be payable out of the
Payment Fund to the Parent or the Surviving Corporation on demand. No
investment or losses on the Payment Fund will affect the Merger Consideration
payable under this Agreement, and the Parent shall promptly provide, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation promptly to provide, additional funds to the
Paying Agent for the benefit of the former Stockholders (i) in the net amount
of any such losses or (ii) to the extent additional funds are necessary to
make payments to Stockholders under Section 262 (or in connection with any
settlements of demands thereunder).

(b) _Exchange Procedure_. As soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time (but in any event no later than two (2) Business Days
after the date on which the Effective Time occurs), the Parent shall cause the
Paying Agent to mail to each record holder of, as of the Effective Time, (i)
an outstanding certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented shares of Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") or
(ii) non-certificated shares of Common Stock represented by book-entry (the "
_Book-Entry Shares_ "): (A) a form of letter of transmittal for use in
effecting the surrender of Certificates or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares,
the surrender of such shares of Common Stock (which will be in customary
form reasonably agreed upon by the Parent and the Company prior to the
Closing, and will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and
title to any Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of such Certificates
to the Paying Agent (or effective affidavits of loss, theft or destruction in
lieu thereof) or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the
procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal) and (B) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of such Certificates or, in the case of Book-
Entry Shares, the surrender of such shares of Common Stock for payment of the
Merger Consideration therefor. Upon surrender of a Certificate or of Book-
Entry Shares for cancellation to the Paying Agent together with such letter

 



7  of transmittal, duly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
and such other customary documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying
Agent, the Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay from the Payment Fund
to the holder of a Certificate or of Book-Entry Shares, or as otherwise
directed in the letter of transmittal, the Merger Consideration for each share
of Common Stock formerly evidenced by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share,
and such Certificate or Book-Entry Share will forthwith be cancelled. No
interest will be paid or will accrue on the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share. If payment of the
Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose
name a surrendered Certificate or, in the case of a Book-Entry Share, a
surrendered share of Common Stock is registered, it will be a condition of
payment that the Certificate or, in the case of a Book-Entry Share, the share
of Common Stock so surrendered be endorsed properly or otherwise be in proper
form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment has paid all
transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
or, in the case of a Book-Entry Share, the share of Common Stock surrendered
and has established to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Taxes
have been paid or has established to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that
such Taxes are not applicable. Prior to the Closing, the Parent and the
Company shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
establish procedures with the Paying Agent and the Depository Trust Company
(" _DTC_ ") such that, assuming the Effective Time occurs at the time of the
Closing, (x) if the Closing occurs at or prior to 11:30 a.m., New York time,
on the Closing Date, the Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominee on
the Closing Date an amount in cash in immediately available funds equal to the
number of shares of Common Stock held of record by DTC or such nominee
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Merger
Consideration (such amount, the " _DTC Payment_ "), and (y) if the Closing
occurs after 11:30 a.m., New York time, on the Closing Date, the Paying Agent
will transmit to DTC or its nominee on the first (1st) Business Day after the
Closing Date an amount in cash in immediately available funds equal to the DTC
Payment.

(c) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Following the end of the twelve (12) month
period beginning on the Closing Date, the Parent will be entitled to require
the Paying Agent to deliver to the Surviving Corporation any funds in the
Payment Fund which had been made available to the Paying Agent and not
disbursed to Stockholders (including all interest and other income then held
by the Paying Agent in respect of all funds made available to it), and
thereafter such Stockholders who have not received the Merger Consideration in
exchange for the surrender of their Certificates or, in the case of Book-Entry
Shares, such shares of Common Stock shall look only to the Surviving
Corporation (as general creditors thereof) for payment of the Merger
Consideration and may surrender such Certificates or, in the case of Book-
Entry Shares, such shares of Common Stock to the Surviving Corporation and,
subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar Laws, receive from
the Surviving Corporation in consideration therefor the aggregate Merger
Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of the Certificates or,
in the case of Book-Entry Shares, such shares of Common Stock held by them,
without interest thereon.

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares_. The Merger Consideration
paid upon the surrender of a Certificate or, in the case of Book-Entry
Shares, such shares of Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Common Stock

 



8  formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares. At the
Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. Until
surrendered as contemplated by Section 2.4(b), each Certificate and Book-Entry
Share (other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall, from and
after the Effective Time, represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest thereon, as contemplated by Section 2.1(a).
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or, in the case of Book-Entry
Shares, such shares of Common Stock are presented to the Surviving
Corporation, the Parent or the Paying Agent for transfer or any other reason,
they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided
in this Article II.

 

(e) _No Liability_. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, none of
Merger Sub, the Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any Stockholder or other Person in respect of any
cash properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. Any portion of the Payment
Fund remaining unclaimed by Stockholders as of the day that is immediately
prior to the date on which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become
property of any Governmental Entity will, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation and any
former Stockholder who has not theretofore complied with this Section 2.4
shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation (as a general creditor
thereof) for payment of its claim for Merger Consideration, without interest
thereon.

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Parent will cause the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent to, upon the receipt of an affidavit
of that fact by the holder thereof in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation or Paying Agent, as the case may
be, and, if required by the Parent, the posting of a bond in a customary
amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of
Common Stock previously evidenced by such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, without interest thereon.

2.5 _Convertible Notes_. Pursuant to the terms of the 2010 Notes Indenture,
after the Effective Time, each holder of 2010 Notes, to the extent such
holder has not exercised its right to require the Surviving Corporation to
repurchase such holders 2010 Notes in accordance with the terms of the 2010
Notes Indenture, will be entitled to convert such holders 2010 Notes into
the right to receive an amount in cash for each one thousand dollars ($1,000)
principal amount of 2010 Notes held by such holder equal to the product of (a)
the Merger Consideration and (b) 77.6714 (plus any increase in the conversion
rate as determined pursuant to Section 10.01(e) and Schedule A of the 2010
Notes Indenture to the extent such holder would be entitled to such increase
pursuant to the terms of the 2010 Notes Indenture).

2.6 _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take all necessary and appropriate action such that (a) no new purchase
or offering period under the ESPP commences after the date hereof, (b) each
participant in the offering period currently in effect shall not increase his
or her payroll deductions or purchase elections from those in effect
immediately prior to the date hereof, (c) if, with respect to a purchase or
offering period in effect

 



9  on the date hereof, the Effective Time occurs prior to the Exercise Date (as
defined in the ESPP) for such purchase or offering period, upon the Effective
Time, each purchase right under the ESPP outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be used to purchase from the Company whole and fractional
shares of Common Stock (subject to the provisions of the ESPP regarding the
maximum number and value of shares purchasable per participant) at the
applicable price determined under the terms of the ESPP (subject to the
limitations set forth in clause (b) of this Section 2.6) for the then
outstanding purchase or offering period using such date as the final
Exercise Date for such purchase or offering period, and any remaining
accumulated but unused payroll deductions shall be distributed to the relevant
participants without interest as promptly as practicable following the
Effective Time, and (d) the ESPP is terminated at or prior to the Effective
Time.

2.7 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. If at any time during the
period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change
in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company shall occur as a
result of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a
reverse stock split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares,
merger, issuer tender or exchange offer, any stock dividend or stock
distribution with a record date during such period or any other similar
transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably and appropriately
adjusted to reflect such change such that the aggregate consideration to each
Stockholder is the same as it would have been if such event had not occurred.

applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and none of
the SEC Filings, when filed, or, if amended prior to the date hereof, as
finally amended prior to the date hereof, contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. None of

basis throughout the periods involved (except as may be indicated therein or
in the notes thereto) and, on that basis, fairly presented, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial condition, income,
comprehensive income, changes in stockholders equity and cash flows of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of the indicated dates and for the indicated
periods (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end
audit adjustments and to any other adjustments described therein, including
the notes thereto).

exist no liabilities of any nature of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
whether accrued, contingent or otherwise, that would be required to be
reflected on a balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP, other than any
such liabilities (i) that were reflected, reserved for or

 



15  otherwise disclosed in the Companys consolidated balance sheet as of
December 31, 2012 included in the SEC Filings, (ii) that were incurred (A) in
the ordinary course of business after December 31, 2012 or (B) in connection

competing with or alternative to such transactions or proposals from other
third parties relating to any competing or alternative transactions, the entry
into this Agreement and the performance of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (iii) arising or resulting from an existing Contract, except
to the extent that such liabilities arose or resulted from a breach or a
default under such Contract by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iv)
that would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect.

3.6 _Internal Controls and Procedures_. The Company has established and

control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f)

reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms.
Since December 31, 2010, the Company has disclosed to the Companys
independent auditors and to the audit committee of the Board of Directors (x)
all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of such disclosure controls and procedures that the Company
determined are or were reasonably likely to materially and adversely affect
the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (y) any material fraud that is known to the Company that

such Subsidiarys liability for Taxes and is otherwise complete and accurate.

for which adequate reserves have been established in accordance with GAAP.
There are no Liens on any of the assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that arose in connection with any failure to pay any Tax, other

appropriate proceedings or for which adequate reserves have been established
in accordance with GAAP.

Law), as a transferee or successor, by applicable Law or otherwise.

(d) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have deducted, withheld and
timely paid, or caused to be deducted, withheld and timely paid, to the

right creation, acceleration or Lien creation would not have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Sub and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, Deutsche Bank AG Cayman Islands
Branch, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc.,
UBS AG, Stamford Branch and UBS Securities LLC and the executed fee letter
associated therewith ( _provided_ , that provisions in the fee letter related
to the amount of fees and other economics, "flex" provisions and "securities
demand" provisions, but only to the extent not affecting the amount,
availability or conditionality of the Debt Financing, may be redacted) (such
commitment letter and the fee letter, together with all exhibits,
schedules, annexes and supplements thereto, collectively, the " _Debt
Financing Commitment_ "), pursuant to which, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth therein, Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, Deutsche
Bank AG Cayman Islands Branch, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Morgan Stanley
Senior Funding, Inc., UBS AG, Stamford Branch and UBS Securities LLC have
agreed to lend the amounts set forth therein (the " _Debt Financing_ ") for
the purpose of funding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
payment of fees and expenses to be incurred by Parent and Merger Sub in
connection therewith and for the other purposes set forth therein; and (ii)
the executed equity commitment letter, dated as of April 14, 2013, among the
Parent and Madison Dearborn Capital Partners VI-A, L.P., Madison Dearborn
Capital Partners VI-C, L.P. and Madison Dearborn Capital Partners VI
Executive-A, L.P., each a Delaware limited partnership (collectively, the "
_Investors_ ") (together with all exhibits, schedules, annexes, supplements
and amendments thereto, the " _Equity Financing Commitment_ " and, together
with the Debt Financing Commitment, the " _Financing Commitments_ "),
pursuant to which, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
therein, each of the Investors has committed to invest the cash amount set
forth therein (the " _Equity Financing_ " and, together with the Debt
Financing, the " _Financing_ "). None of the Financing Commitments has been
amended, restated or otherwise modified or waived prior to the date of this
Agreement, and, other than amendments, restatements, or modifications solely
to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents and similar
entities, no such amendment, restatement, modification or waiver is
contemplated as of the date of this Agreement, and the respective
commitments contained in the Financing Commitments have not been withdrawn,
terminated or rescinded in any respect on or prior to the date of this
Agreement. As of the date hereof, there are, and are contemplated to be, no
other agreements, side letters or arrangements relating to any of the
Financing Commitments (other than as expressly set forth in the Financing
Commitments delivered to the Company pursuant to the first sentence of this
Section 4.4(a) and other than customary engagement letters, customary side
letters and other customary ancillary agreements, none of which affect the
amount, availability or conditionality of the Financing). As of the date
hereof, the Financing Commitments are in full force and effect and
constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of each of the Parent and
Merger Sub and, to the knowledge of the Parent,

 



28  the other parties thereto, in each case in accordance with their terms and
except as limited by (x) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium,
fraudulent conveyance or other similar Laws relating to creditors rights
generally and (y) general principles of equity, whether such enforceability is
considered in a proceeding in equity or at Law. There are no conditions
related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing (including any
"flex" provisions), other than as expressly set forth in the Financing
Commitments furnished to the Company pursuant to the first sentence of this
Section 4.4(a). As of the date hereof, to the knowledge of Parent and Merger
Sub, no event has occurred that would result in any breach or violation of or
constitute a default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both
would become a default) by the Parent or Merger Sub under any of
the Financing Commitments. As of the date hereof, neither the Parent nor
Merger Sub nor any of the Investors has any reason to believe that any of the
conditions to the Financing will not be satisfied or that the Financing will
not be available to the Parent or Merger Sub on the Closing Date. The Parent
has fully paid all commitment fees or other fees required to be paid on or
prior to the date hereof pursuant to the Financing Commitments.

 

(b) Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and
Section 6.2(b), and subject to the "Specified Representations" and the
"Specified Merger Agreement Representations" (each such term as defined in the
Debt Financing Commitment) being true and correct in all material respects
(except to the extent any such "Specified Representation" or "Specified
Merger Agreement Representation" is already qualified by materiality, in which
case such "Specified Representation" or "Specified Merger Agreement
Representation" shall be true and correct in all respects) as of the Closing
as if made as of the Closing (except to the extent any such "Specified
Representation" or "Specified Merger Agreement Representation" speaks as of
another time, in which case such "Specified Representation" or "Specified
Merger Agreement Representation" shall be true and correct as of such other
time), the aggregate proceeds to be disbursed pursuant to the agreements
contemplated by the Financing Commitments, together with the cash and cash
equivalents of the Company and its Subsidiaries available to the Company and
its Subsidiaries on the Closing Date, will be sufficient on the Closing Date
for the Parent and the Surviving Corporation to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration, the aggregate Closing Equity Incentive Amounts and all related
fees and expenses and any other payment contemplated in this Agreement and in
the Financing Commitments.

 

(c) The obligations of the Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement are not
subject to any conditions regarding the availability or receipt of financing
(including the Financing) for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

4.5  _Litigation_. As of the time of the execution of this Agreement, there
is no Action pending or, to the knowledge of the Parent or Merger Sub,
threatened that challenges or seeks to enjoin, alter, prevent or materially
delay the Merger or that, if adversely decided, would otherwise, individually
or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

4.6  _Employment Matters_. As of the time of the execution of this Agreement,
neither the Parent or Merger Sub nor any Representative of the Parent or
Merger Sub has (a) entered into or orally committed to enter into any
employment agreement with any of the Companys directors, officers or
employees, (b) offered employment to any of the Companys directors, officers
or employees, (c) had negotiations with any of the Companys directors,
officers or employees regarding employment after the Closing or (d) sold, or
offered to sell, any direct or indirect equity interest in the Company to any
of the Companys directors, officers or employees.

 



29 4.7 _Merger Sub_. Merger Sub has been formed solely for the purpose of
engaging in the transactions contemplated hereby and prior to the Effective
Time will have engaged in no other business activities and will have incurred
no liabilities or obligations other than as contemplated herein.

 

4.8 _Proxy Statement_. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by
or on behalf of the Parent or Merger Sub (or, if applicable, any Affiliate of
the Parent, including any direct or indirect investor in the Parent) for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in any Proxy Statement will, at the
time at the time it is first mailed to the Stockholders and at the time of
the Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading. Any Proxy Statement (if applicable)
filed by the Parent, Merger Sub or any Affiliate of the Parent, including any
direct or indirect investor in the Parent, will at the time it is first mailed
to the Stockholders and at the time of the Stockholders Meeting, comply as to
form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder applicable thereto as of such
time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Parent nor Merger Sub makes
any representation or warranty with respect to any information supplied or
required to be supplied by or on behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective Representatives which is contained or incorporated by
reference in any Proxy Statement.

4.9 _Ownership of Common Stock_. As of the date of this Agreement and except
as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Parent to the Company
immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement, none of the Parent or
Merger Sub or their respective Affiliates owns (directly or indirectly,
beneficially or of record) any shares of Common Stock and none of the Parent
or Merger Sub or their respective Affiliates holds any rights to acquire or
vote (or control the vote of) any shares of Common Stock except pursuant to
this Agreement. None of the Parent, Merger Sub or any of their "affiliates"
or "associates" is, or at any time during the last three (3) years has been,
an "interested stockholder" of the Company, in each case as defined in Section
203 of the DGCL.

4.10 _Vote/Approval Required_. No vote or consent of the holders of any class
or series of capital stock of the Parent is necessary to adopt this Agreement
or approve the Merger. The adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the
Merger by Parent in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub was the
only vote or consent of the holders of any class or series of capital stock
of Merger Sub necessary to adopt this Agreement or approve the Merger.

4.11 _Brokers  Fees_. No broker, finder, financial advisor or investment
banker is entitled to any brokerage or finders fees or commissions in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon
arrangements made by the Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates or Representatives for which the Company could have any liability
prior to the Effective Time.

 



30 4.12 _Solvency_. Neither the Parent nor Merger Sub is entering into this
Agreement or the Financing Commitments with the intent to hinder, delay or
defraud either present or future creditors. Immediately after giving effect to
all of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Financing
Commitments, including the Financing, the payment of the aggregate Merger
Consideration, the aggregate Closing Equity Incentive Amounts and all related
fees and expenses and any repayment or refinancing of debt that may be
contemplated in the Debt Financing Commitment, and assuming (a) the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2, (b)
the accuracy of the "Specified Representations" in all material respects
(except to the extent any such "Specified Representation" is already
qualified by materiality, in which case such "Specified Representation" shall
be true and correct in all respects) as of the Closing as if made as of the
Closing (except to the extent any such "Specified Representation" speaks as
of another time, in which case such "Specified Representation" shall be true
and correct as of such other time) and the performance in all material
respects by the Company of all of the covenants required to be performed by
it under this Agreement at or prior to the Closing and (c) any estimates,
projections or forecasts regarding the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries that have been provided to the Parent or any of its
Representatives by the Company or any of its Representatives prior to the date
hereof were prepared in good faith and were based on assumptions that were,
when made, and continue to be, reasonable, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (a) as of such date will be able to pay its
liabilities as they become due and shall own property having a fair saleable
value greater than the amounts required to pay its probable liabilities
(including a reasonable estimate of all probable contingent liabilities) as
they become absolute and mature and (b) shall not have, as of such date,
unreasonably small capital to carry on its business in which it is engaged.
For purposes of this definition, "not have, as of such date, unreasonably
small capital to carry on its business in which it is engaged" means that the
Surviving Corporation will be able to generate enough cash from operations,
asset dispositions or refinancing, or a combination thereof, to meet its
obligations as they become due.

by the Parent to the Company immediately prior to the execution of this

or operates in the United States a business that derives a substantial
portion of its revenues from a line of business within the Companys or its
Subsidiaries principal lines of businesses.

 

4.14 _Limited Guarantee_. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, each of the Guarantors has executed and delivered the Limited
Guarantee pursuant to which each such Guarantor is guaranteeing certain
obligations of the Parent and Merger Sub in connection with this Agreement on
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein. The
Limited Guarantee is in full force and effect and constitutes the legal,
valid and binding obligation of each of the Guarantors, enforceable in
accordance with its terms, except as limited by (a) bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or other similar Laws
relating to creditors rights generally and (b) general principles of equity,
whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at Law.

 



31 4.15 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the representations
and warranties contained in Article III, each of the Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledges that (a) neither the Company nor any other Person on behalf of
the Company makes any other express or implied representation or warranty with
respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries or with respect to any other
information provided to the Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b) neither the Company nor
any other Person will have or be subject to any liability or indemnification
obligation to the Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person resulting from the
distribution to the Parent or Merger Sub, or the Parents or Merger Subs use
of, any such information, including any information, documents, projections,
forecasts or other material made available to the Parent or Merger Sub in
certain "data rooms" or management presentations or in any other form in
expectation of, or in connection with, the transactions contemplated by this

Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to seek to provide the

letters) and that the provision of such reports to the Parent would not (i)
be prohibited by applicable Law, (ii) breach any attorney-client privilege or

prior to the Effective Time (or, if earlier, the Termination Date), the Parent
shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries or Control Affiliates
to, take or agree to take any action (including entering into agreements with
respect to any acquisitions, mergers, consolidations or business combinations)

5.2 _Proxy Statement_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the date hereof (and in any event within
fifteen (15) Business Days after the date hereof), the Company shall prepare
and file a proxy statement with the SEC in connection with the Stockholders
Meeting in preliminary form (as such proxy statement is amended and
supplemented by any amendments or supplements thereto filed with the SEC,
including the filing of such proxy statement in definitive form, together
with any other transaction statement filed with the SEC in connection with the
Stockholders Meeting, as any such transaction statement is amended and
supplemented by any amendments or supplements thereto filed with the SEC, the
" _Proxy Statement_ "). In the event either the Company or the Parent
reasonably deems it advisable after consultation with the other Party to make
supplemental or amended disclosure or supplemental or amended disclosure is
required by, or reasonably prudent in light of, applicable Law, or the SEC
staff requests supplemental or amended disclosure (and does not promptly
withdraw such request), then, as promptly as practicable after the date of
such determination, the Parties shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to,
prepare and file, in each case to the extent either the Company or the Parent
reasonably deems it advisable after consultation with the other Party to
make supplemental or amended disclosure or supplemental or amended disclosure
is required by applicable Law, or the SEC staff has so requested the making of
supplemental or amended disclosure (and has not promptly withdrawn the
request), such Proxy Statement and the Parties shall cooperate, and shall
cause their Affiliates to cooperate, in modifying any previously filed Proxy
Statement to satisfy the requirements of the SEC, including by promptly
providing or causing to be provided to each other all information with
respect to itself, its Affiliates and its Representatives as may be reasonably
requested by any of the other Parties for inclusion in a Proxy Statement.
Subject to Section 5.4, the Proxy Statement filed by the Company shall
include the Board Recommendation. The Parent agrees to promptly provide or
cause to be provided all information with respect to itself, its Subsidiaries
and Affiliates (including Merger Sub, the Investors and the Guarantors) and
its Representatives as may be reasonably requested by the Company and which
the Company determines in good faith is reasonably required for inclusion in
any Proxy Statement filed by the Company. The Company agrees to promptly
provide or cause to be provided all information with respect to

 



37  itself, its Subsidiaries and Affiliates and its Representatives as may be
reasonably requested by the Parent and which the Parent determines in good
faith is reasonably required for inclusion in any Proxy Statement filed by
the Parent or any of its Affiliates.

(b) Each Party shall promptly notify the other Party of the receipt of all
comments from the SEC with respect to any Proxy Statement and of any request
by the SEC for any amendment or supplement thereto or for additional
information and shall promptly provide to the other Party copies of all
written correspondence between such Party or any of its Representatives and
the SEC with respect to any Proxy Statement. Each Party shall promptly provide
responses to the SEC with respect to all comments received on the Proxy
Statement from the SEC and use its reasonable best efforts to resolve all
such comments as soon as reasonably practicable. The Company shall cause a
definitive Proxy Statement to be filed with the SEC and mailed to the
Stockholders promptly (and in any event within five (5) Business Days) after
the date the SEC staff advises that it has no further comments on the
preliminary Proxy Statement filed by the Company or that the Company may
commence mailing the Proxy Statement. If at any time prior to
the Stockholders Meeting, any information relating to the Company or the
Parent or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives should be
discovered by the Company or the Parent that should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to any Proxy Statement so that such Proxy Statement
does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the Party which discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other Parties and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall be filed promptly with the SEC, and to the
extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the Stockholders.

(c) Subject to applicable Law, prior to filing or mailing any Proxy
Statement, including any amendment or supplement thereto, or responding to any
comments from the SEC with respect to any Proxy Statement, the Party that
files or that has an Affiliate that files a Proxy Statement shall provide the
other Party with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such
document or response.

(d) All expenses incurred in connection with the filing (including any
applicable SEC filing fees), printing and mailing of any Proxy Statement,
including the filing, printing and mailing of any amendments or supplements
thereto, as applicable, shall be borne by the Company.

 

5.3 _Stockholders Meeting_. The Company shall, in accordance with applicable
Law and its certificate of incorporation and by-laws, convene a special
meeting of the Stockholders (the " _Stockholders Meeting_ ") as promptly as
practicable after the date of mailing of the Proxy Statement (and in any
event, subject to the provisos to this sentence, no more than thirty (30)
days after such date of mailing) to consider and vote upon the adoption of
this Agreement and, subject to Section 5.4, shall use its reasonable best
efforts, consistent with customary practice, to solicit the Stockholder
Approval (it being understood that the Parent shall also be entitled to take
any reasonable lawful action to solicit the Stockholder Approval); _provided_
, that such solicitation activities may include cooperating with the Parent in
making presentations to proxy advisory firms or other similar Persons making
a recommendation with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the Company may postpone, delay or adjourn the
Stockholders Meeting (i) with the consent of the Parent (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), (ii) for the absence of a
quorum, (iii) to allow reasonable additional time for the preparation and
filing of any supplemental or amended disclosure that is prepared and filed
in accordance with Section 5.2(a) and for such supplemental or amended
disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the Stockholders prior to the
Stockholders Meeting, or (iv) if in the good faith judgment of the Board of
Directors (after consultation with its outside legal counsel), failure to
adjourn, delay or postpone the Stockholders Meeting would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board of
Directors under applicable Law; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Parent may
require the Company to postpone or adjourn the

 



38  Stockholders Meeting one time (but in no event to a date that is less than
two (2) Business Days prior to the End Date), unless prior to any such
postponement or adjournment the Company shall have received an aggregate
number of proxies voting for the adoption of this Agreement (and which have
not been withdrawn) sufficient such that, if the shares of Common Stock
subject to such proxies are not otherwise voted at the Stockholders Meeting
so as to withdraw such proxies, the condition set forth in Section 6.1(a) will
be satisfied at the Stockholders Meeting. Without the prior written consent of
the Parent, the adoption of this Agreement and matters related to
the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger) shall be the only
matters which the Company shall propose to be acted on by the Stockholders at
the Stockholders Meeting. The Company shall establish a record date for
purposes of determining Stockholders entitled to notice of and vote at the
Stockholders Meeting (the " _Record Date_ ") on or prior to the date on which
the Proxy Statement is mailed to the Stockholders pursuant to Section 5.2.
Once established, the Company shall not change the Record Date or establish a
different record date for the Stockholders Meeting without the prior written
consent of the Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), unless the Board of Directors determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) that it is required to do so by
applicable Law or pursuant to the Companys certificate of incorporation or
by-laws. In the event that the date of the Stockholders Meeting as originally
called is for any reason postponed or adjourned or otherwise delayed, the
Company agrees that, unless the Parent shall have otherwise approved in
writing, it shall implement such postponement or adjournment or other delay
in such a way that the Company does not establish a new record date for the
Stockholders Meeting, as so postponed, adjourned or delayed, except as
required by applicable Law or the Companys certificate of incorporation or
by-laws. The Company shall, upon the reasonable request of the Parent, advise
the Parent periodically (and at least on a daily basis on each of the last
seven (7) Business Days prior to the date of the Stockholders Meeting) as to
the aggregate tally of the proxies received by the Company with respect to
the Stockholder Approval. Unless this Agreement has been terminated pursuant
to and in accordance with Article VII, and notwithstanding any Change of
Recommendation, this Agreement shall be submitted to the Stockholders for the
purpose of obtaining the Stockholder Approval.

5.4 _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) Subject to the other provisions of this Section 5.4, from and after the
time of the execution of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective
Time or the Termination Date, the Company agrees that neither it nor any of
its Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause its and their respective Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage any inquiry,
proposal or offer with respect to, or which could reasonably be expected to
lead to, or the making, submission or

 



39  announcement of, any Alternative Proposal, (ii) participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding an Alternative Proposal with any Person,
except to notify such Person as to the existence of the provisions of this
Section 5.4(a), or furnish any non-public information to any Person in
connection with or in respect of an Alternative Proposal or any inquiry,
proposal or offer that could reasonably be expect to lead to an Alternative
Proposal, (iii) approve, endorse or recommend any Alternative Proposal, (iv)
enter into, or authorize the entry into, any letter of intent, agreement in
principle, definitive agreement or any other agreement for any
Alternative Proposal (except for confidentiality agreements of the type set
forth under, and to the extent authorized by, Section 5.4(b)) or (v) otherwise
knowingly facilitate the making or submission of any Alternative Proposal.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and its Subsidiaries need not,
prior to the Excluded Party Deadline, require Persons previously provided
confidential information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries in
connection with or in respect of an Alternative Proposal, or any inquiry,
proposal or offer that could reasonably be expect to lead to an Alternative
Proposal, to return or destroy such information which may be in such Persons
possession or control or terminate access of such Person and
its Representatives to any physical or electronic dataroom containing
information about the Company and its Subsidiaries or their respective
businesses; _provided_ , that on such date, the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall, and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and
their respective Representatives to, require all such Persons (other than the
Parent and its Representatives and other than any Person to whom the Company
is authorized to provide non-public information pursuant to Section 5.4(b) as
of such date) to promptly return or destroy such confidential information and
terminate access for all such Persons (other than the Parent and its
Representatives) and their Representatives to any such physical or electronic
dataroom.

(b) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in Section 5.4(a), from and
after the time of the execution of this Agreement until the earlier of the
date of the Stockholder Approval and the Termination Date, if the Company
receives a written Alternative Proposal that did not result from a breach of
Section 5.4(a) and that the Board of Directors determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside legal counsel and its financial advisor)
constitutes or which could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior
Proposal (and, notwithstanding the limitations set forth in Section 5.4(a),
the Company and its Representatives may contact the Person making such
Alternative Proposal and its Representatives to ascertain facts or clarify
terms and conditions for the sole purpose of the Board of Directors
informing itself about such proposal and the Person that made it in
connection with the making of such determination), the Company may take the
following actions: (i) furnish non-public information to the third party
making such Alternative Proposal (and its Representatives) if, and only if,
(A) the Company (I) is already bound by a confidentiality agreement with such
third party entered into prior to the date hereof or (II) receives from such
third party after the date hereof an executed confidentiality agreement
containing terms no less favorable to the Company, in all material respects,
than the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement and which does not, in any
material manner, restrict or limit the ability of the Company to comply with
its obligations under this Agreement (and, for the avoidance of doubt, such
agreement shall contain a "standstill" that is in all material respects at
least as favorable to the Company as the "standstill" in the Confidentiality
Agreement (except that such undertaking need not prohibit the making or
amendment of any Alternative Proposal on a confidential basis)) and (B) the
Company promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours)
makes available to the Parent and Merger Sub any such non-public information
that is provided to such third party and which was not previously made
available to the Parent, and (ii) engage in discussions or negotiations with,
and provide draft documents and agreements to, such third party making such
Alternative Proposal (and its Representatives).

 



40 (c) On the Business Day immediately following the Excluded Party Deadline, the
Company shall notify the Parent in writing (including by email) of any
written proposals or offers with respect to any Alternative Proposals received
by the Company or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any of its Representatives
after the date hereof and prior to the Excluded Party Deadline and that have
not been withdrawn or are not otherwise being pursued by the Company as of
such date and shall also provide in such notice the material terms and
conditions, and any subsequent material amendments thereto, of any such
written proposals or offers (including the identity of the Persons or groups
of Persons making such proposals or offers and unredacted copies of all such
written proposals or offers and also including unredacted copies of
proposed transaction agreements (including those related to financing)). From
and after the Excluded Party Deadline until the earlier of the Effective Time
and the Termination Date, the Company agrees that it shall promptly (and in
any event within two (2) Business Days) notify the Parent in writing
(including by email) if any written proposal or offer with respect to any
Alternative Proposal (including any material amendment to any Alternative
Proposal made after the date hereof and prior to the Excluded Party Deadline)
is received by the Company or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any of its
Representatives after the Excluded Party Deadline and the Company shall also
provide in any such notice the material terms and conditions of any such
written proposal or offer (including the identity of the Person or group of
Persons making such proposals or offers and unredacted copies of all such
written proposals or offers and also including unredacted copies of proposed
transaction agreements (including those related to financing)) and shall
thereafter keep the Parent reasonably informed, on a reasonably current basis,
of the status and terms of any such proposal or offer (including any material
amendments thereto) and the status of any discussions or negotiations in
respect thereof.

(d) Except as provided in Section 5.4(e) and Section 5.4(f), the Board of
Directors shall not (i) withdraw or withhold, or modify or qualify in a manner
adverse to the Parent, the Board Recommendation or publicly announce that it
has proposed or resolved to take such action, (ii) fail to include the Board
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (iii) in the event any tender or
exchange offer is commenced that would constitute an Alternative Proposal,
fail to publish, send or provide to the Stockholders, pursuant to Rule
14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act and within ten (10) Business Days after such
tender or exchange offer is first commenced, or subsequently amended in any
material respect, a statement recommending that the Stockholders reject such
tender or exchange offer and publicly affirming the Board Recommendation or
(iv) recommend, adopt, approve or enter into, or publicly propose or resolve
to recommend, adopt, approve or enter into, any Alternative Proposal or any
letter of intent, agreement in principle, definitive agreement or any other
agreement for any Alternative Proposal (any of the actions described in this
Section 5.4(d), a " _Change of Recommendation_ "). No Change of Recommendation
shall change the approval of the Board of Directors for purposes of causing
any Laws of the type referred to in Section 5.11 to be inapplicable to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(e) Notwithstanding Section 5.4(d) or anything else to the contrary provided
in this Agreement, at any time prior to the receipt of the Stockholder
Approval, the Board of Directors may effect a Change of Recommendation if an
Intervening Event has occurred and the

 



41  Board of Directors has determined in good faith (after consultation with
outside legal counsel) that its failure to effect a Change of Recommendation
following such Intervening Event would be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary obligations under applicable Law.

(f) Notwithstanding Section 5.4(d) or anything else to the contrary provided
in this Agreement, at any time prior to the receipt of the Stockholder
Approval, and so long as the Company has complied in all material respects
with Section 5.4 and Section 7.1(e), the Company may effect a Change of
Recommendation and substantially concurrently therewith terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(e) in order to enter into a definitive
agreement for an Alternative Proposal if the Board of Directors has determined
in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and its
financial advisor) that such Alternative Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal.

(g) Prior to taking any action permitted by Section 5.4(f), (i) the Company
shall give the Parent at least three (3) Business Days prior written notice
(including by email) of its intention to take such action (which notice shall
specify the identity of the Person or Persons making the Superior Proposal and
the material terms thereof, including unredacted copies of all proposed
transaction agreements (including those related to financing) relating to
such Superior Proposal), (ii) if requested by the Parent, the Company and its
Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with the Parent during the
entirety of such notice period to make such changes to the terms of this
Agreement, the terms of the Financing Commitments or the Limited Guarantee as
would reverse the decision of the Board of Directors to cause such Alternative
Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal, and (iii) the Board
of Directors shall have considered in good faith (after consultation with
outside legal counsel and its financial advisor) any changes to this
Agreement, the Financing Commitments or the Limited Guarantee offered in
writing by the Parent during such notice period in a manner that would form a
binding contract if accepted by the Company and shall have determined that the
applicable Alternative Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any material revision to the
applicable Alternative Proposal (whether such revision is made during or
following the completion of the initial three (3) Business Day period), the
Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice pursuant to this
Section 5.4(g) and comply again with the other requirements of this Section
5.4(g) in connection with such new written notice (except that, in connection
with any such new written notice, the time period referred to above shall
be shortened to two (2) Business Days).

(h) Nothing set forth in Section 5.4 or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Board of Directors from (i) taking and disclosing to the
Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act,
issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its
position thereunder or complying with the provisions of Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the
Stockholders that the Board of Directors determines to make in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel) in order to fulfill the
directors fiduciary duties or to satisfy applicable state or federal
securities Laws; _provided_ , that, the Board of Directors shall not make a
Change of Recommendation except in accordance with this Section 5.4.

 



42 (i) As used in this Agreement, " _Alternative Proposal_ " shall mean
any inquiry, proposal or offer (in each case other than from the Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries and other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) relating to (i) any merger,
tender offer, exchange offer, joint venture, consolidation, dissolution,
liquidation, recapitalization, reorganization, business combination, sale of
assets, extraordinary dividend or stock repurchase involving the Company (or
any of its Subsidiaries whose revenue, income, EBITDA or assets, individually
or in the aggregate, constitute twenty percent (20%) or more of the
consolidated revenue, income, EBITDA or assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole), (ii) the acquisition (however structured) by
any such Person or "group" (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange
Act) of twenty percent (20%) or more of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (iii) the acquisition (including by way of
merger or tender offer) by any such Person or "group" of twenty percent (20%)
or more of the outstanding shares of the Common Stock, (iv) the acquisition
(however structured) by any such Person or "group" that would result in such
Person or "group" beneficially owning twenty percent (20%) or more of the
Common Stock or any class of equity or voting securities of the Company (or
any of its Subsidiaries whose revenue, income, EBITDA or assets, individually
or in the aggregate, constitute twenty percent (20%) or more of the
consolidated revenue, income, EBITDA or assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole) or (v) any combination of the foregoing.

(j) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean an
Alternative Proposal (with all of the percentages included in the definition
of Acquisition Proposal increased to seventy-five percent (75%)) that is
reasonably likely to be consummated and that the Board of Directors determines
in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and its
financial advisor), considering such factors as the Board of Directors
considers to be appropriate (which shall in any event include the legal,
financial and regulatory aspects of such Alternative Proposal and the
Persons making such Alternative Proposal or providing financing for such
Alternative Proposal), to be more favorable to the Stockholders than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any offer by the
Parent, in accordance with Section 5.4(g), to modify the terms hereof).

(k) From and after the time of the execution of this Agreement until
the earlier of the Effective Time or the Termination Date, the Company shall
not fail to enforce (unless the Board of Directors determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside legal counsel) that enforcement would be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary obligations under applicable Law)
or grant or agree to any waiver, amendment or release of or under any
"standstill" or under any Law of the type referred to in Section 5.11 or
otherwise provide consent or authorization for the making or submission of
any Alternative Proposal pursuant to any such existing "standstill" or under
any such Law; _provided_ , that the Company may, prior to the time the
Stockholder Approval is obtained, provide consent for the submission of an
Alternative Proposal from a third party on a confidential basis upon request
for such consent if the Board of Directors has determined in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel) that a failure to provide such
consent would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary obligations under
applicable Law. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in the foregoing shall
limit the Companys right to make any disclosures relating to any
such Alternative Proposal in compliance with Section 5.4(h).

(l) Without limiting or modifying any of the other provisions of this
Agreement, any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.4 by
any director or officer of the Company or any other Representative acting at
the instruction of the Company shall constitute a breach of this Section 5.4
by the Company.

 



43 5.5 _Efforts_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each
Party shall use (and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Control Affiliates to
use) its reasonable best efforts (subject to, and in accordance with,
applicable Law) to take promptly, or cause to be taken promptly, all actions,
and to do promptly, or cause to be done promptly, and to assist and cooperate
with the other Parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable on
its part under this Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate and make
effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including
(i) preparing and filing all documentation to effect all material notices,
reports and other filings and to obtain all material consents, approvals,
registrations, authorizations, waivers, Permits and Orders necessary to be
obtained from any third party (including any Governmental Entity) in order to

Agreement and (ii) defending against and resolving any lawsuits or other legal
proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or
the consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries be required to, prior to the Effective Time, pay
any fee, penalty or other consideration to any third party (other than any
filing fee payable to a Governmental Entity) for any consent or approval
required under any Contract or other arrangement for the consummation of the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; 
_provided_ , _further_ , the Company and its Subsidiaries shall agree to pay
any such fee, penalty or other consideration to the extent reasonably directed
by the Parent so long as any such fee, penalty or other consideration is not
due unless the Closing occurs or the Parent advances or reimburses (promptly
upon the request of the Company) the Company and its Subsidiaries for the full
amount of any such fee, penalty or other consideration and the Parent shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and its and their
Representatives from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages,
claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or
incurred by them in connection with the payment of any such fee, penalty or
other consideration.

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.5(a), each Party shall (and
shall cause their respective Subsidiaries and Control Affiliates), as promptly
as reasonably practicable following the execution of this Agreement and before
the expiration of any relevant legal deadline, make or cause to be made all
premerger notification filings required of each of them or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or Control Affiliates, including, not later than the
tenth (10th) Business Day after the date hereof, the notification and report
form required under the HSR Act. All filing fees payable in connection
therewith shall be borne by the Parent.

(c) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.5(a), each Party shall use
its reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions
necessary, including to comply promptly and fully with any inquiries or
requests for information from Governmental Entities, to cause the expiration

44 (d) Each Party shall, subject to applicable Law, (i) to the extent
practicable, promptly notify the other Party of any communication to that
Party from any Governmental Entity (including the Federal Trade Commission and
the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice) with respect to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and permit the other
Parties to review in advance any proposed written communication to any
Governmental Entity, (ii) not agree to participate in any meeting with any
Governmental Entity in respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry
with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby unless

participate thereat, in each case, to the extent practicable, (iii) furnish
the other Party with copies of all written correspondence, filings and
communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between it
and its Subsidiaries and Control Affiliates and their respective
Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Entity or members of
its staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (excluding documents and communications
which are subject to preexisting confidentiality agreements and to the
attorney-client privilege or work product doctrine, _provided_ , that the
Parties shall use reasonable best efforts to minimize the scope of
this parenthetical by entering into reasonable joint defense arrangements)
and (iv) furnish the other Party with such information and assistance as the
other Party and its Subsidiaries and Control Affiliates may reasonably request
in connection with their preparation of necessary filings, registrations, or
submissions of information to any Governmental Entities in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including any filings
necessary or appropriate under the HSR Act and any other applicable Laws.

(e) Each Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve such

transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including by pursuing all
reasonable avenues of administrative and judicial appeal.

(f) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Parent and its
Subsidiaries and Control Affiliates shall (i) propose, negotiate, commit to
and agree to effect, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the
sale, divestiture or disposition of such assets or businesses of the Company

Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) or
its Control Affiliates with respect to, or their ability to retain, one or
more of the businesses, product lines or assets of the Parent, its
Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) or
its Control Affiliates, in each case, as may be required in order to avoid the
entry of, or to effect the

 



45  dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other Order
in any Action which would otherwise have the effect of preventing or
materially delaying the Closing; _provided_ , that nothing in this Section
5.5 or in any other provision of this Agreement shall require the Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries or Control Affiliates, in connection with obtaining
any consent, approval, registration, authorization, waiver, Permit or Order
from any Governmental Entity, to propose, negotiate, commit to or agree to

assets (i) the effectiveness or consummation of which is not conditioned on
the Closing occurring or (ii) that would result in a material adverse effect
on the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or on the Parent and
its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries),
taken as a whole. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parent, its Subsidiaries
and its Control Affiliates shall not propose, negotiate, commit to or agree to
effect the sale, divestiture or disposition of any assets or businesses or to
take or commit to take actions that would limit the Companys or its
Subsidiaries freedom of action with respect to, or their ability to retain,
any businesses, product lines or assets the effectiveness or consummation of
which is not conditioned on the Closing occurring.

party for any such consent or approval; _provided_ , _further_ , the Company
and its Subsidiaries shall agree to pay any such fee, penalty or other
consideration to the extent reasonably directed by the Parent so long as any
such fee, penalty or other consideration is not due unless the Closing occurs
or the Parent advances or reimburses (promptly upon the request of the
Company) the Company and its Subsidiaries for the full amount of any such
fee, penalty or other consideration and the Parent shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives from
and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims,
costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or
incurred by them in connection with the payment of any such fee, penalty or
other consideration. To the extent consistent with applicable Law or SEC
pronouncements or unless affirmative consent is required by the applicable
Investment Advisor Contract, consent to or approval of the continuance of an
Investment Advisor Contract may take the form of a so-called implied or
negative consent; _provided_ , that in seeking any such Client consent
through implied or negative consent, the applicable RIA shall provide, no less
than 30 days prior to the Closing Date (or any longer period required by
applicable Law or SEC pronouncements), written notice to the Client that

pursuant to the Clients existing Investment Advisor Contract, after the
Closing.

 



46 (b) The Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause their Subsidiaries and

Company shall deliver (or cause to be delivered) drafts of all consent
materials prepared by the Company or its Subsidiaries to the Parent a
reasonable time prior to the mailing or distribution of such documents to any
Client in order to afford the Parent an opportunity to review and comment on
such documents. The forms of all such consent materials shall be subject to
the approval of the Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, prior to the Closing,
without the prior written consent of the Company, other than for
communications made by the Parent, its Subsidiaries or its Control Affiliates
in connection with their ordinary course of business or investor relations
activities and explicitly permitted by Section 5.7, neither the Parent nor
Merger Sub nor any of their respective Subsidiaries or Control
Affiliates shall, directly or indirectly, knowingly contact or communicate
with any Client specifically regarding the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

5.7 _Press Releases and Public Announcement_. The initial public announcement
regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be a joint
press release of the Parent and the Company. Other than such joint press
release, none of the Parent, Merger Sub or the Company will (and the Parent

any public announcement relating to this Agreement, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written approval
of, in the case of the Parent and Merger Sub (or the Parents Control
Affiliates), the Company, and in the case of the Company, the Parent;
_provided_ , that each Party may issue any such press release or make such
public announcement it believes in good faith it is required make under
applicable Law or any applicable rule or regulation promulgated by any
applicable securities exchange, in which case the disclosing Party shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to advise and consult in good faith with
the other Party regarding any such press release or other announcement prior
to making any such disclosure; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that the
restrictions in this Section 5.7 shall not apply to any Company communication
regarding an Alternative Proposal (which must be made in compliance with the
other applicable provisions of this Agreement) or following a Change of
Recommendation. Each of the Parent and the Company may make any public
statement in response to specific questions posed by the press, analysts,
investors or those attending industry conferences or financial analyst
conference calls so long as such statements are substantially similar to
previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made jointly
by the Parent, Merger Sub and the Company (or by any of them individually, if
approved by the other Party in advance as contemplated by this Section 5.7).

5.8 _Access to Information_.

 

(a) Subject to applicable Law, during the period commencing on the date hereof
and ending at the earlier of the Effective Time and the Termination Date, the
Company shall, upon reasonable prior written notice of the Parent, permit the
Parent and its

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or proposals from other third
parties relating to any competing or alternative transactions and the actions
of the Board of Directors (or any committee thereof) with respect to any of
the foregoing, whether prior to or after execution of this Agreement;
_provided_ ,  _further_ , that such access shall comply with all applicable
Laws; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company shall consider in good faith
any reasonable arrangement proposed by the Parent which would allow the Parent
to have access to any of the information described in the foregoing clauses
(i) through (iv) without causing, as applicable, a violation of applicable
Law, a breach of any attorney-client privilege or a breach of any Contract;
_provided_ , further, that no investigation pursuant to this Section 5.8(a)
shall be deemed to cure any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant
in this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available
hereunder to any Party hereto.

 

(b) Each of the Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause their respective
Representatives and Affiliates to, hold and treat in confidence all documents
and information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries furnished to the
Parent or Merger Sub or their respective Representatives, Financing Sources or
Affiliates in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
in accordance with that certain confidentiality agreement, dated as of January
18, 2013, between the Company and Madison Dearborn Partners, LLC (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ") as if all such documents and information were
Evaluation Material (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement), which
Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance
with its terms and shall apply to the Parent and Merger Sub as if they
were parties thereto; _provided_ , that the Confidentiality Agreement shall
hereby be deemed amended and/or waived to the extent required to permit, and
the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company shall constitute
the written consent of the Company allowing, all actions of the Parent or
Merger Sub permitted or contemplated by this Agreement and Madison Dearborn
Partners, LLC is an express third party beneficiary of any waiver to and/or
amendment of the Confidentiality Agreement contained in this Section 5.8(b).

5.9 _Employee/Principal Matters_.

 

(a) Employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Date who continue their employment with the Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries following the Effective
Date are hereinafter referred to as the " _Company Employees_." Until the
first (1st) anniversary of the Effective Time (the " _Benefits Continuation
Period_ "), the Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
or any of their respective Subsidiaries to provide, for each Company Employee
at least the same level 

 



48  and amount of base salary or wages (as applicable) and aggregate annual
value of cash incentive bonus and commission opportunities (but in any event
not including equity compensation opportunities), and for all Company
Employees employee benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate than
those provided immediately prior to the Effective Date by the Company or the
applicable Subsidiary to such Company Employees. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
or any of the Surviving Corporations Subsidiaries to provide severance and
any similar benefits to Company Employees for the Benefit Continuation
Period that are no less favorable than the severance and similar benefits
provided under the severance plans or policies listed on _Section 5.9(a) of
the Disclosure Schedule_, including by recognizing all service recognized for
such purposes under the applicable severance policy.

(b) For purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting and
entitlement to benefits, where length of service is relevant under any
benefit plan or arrangement of the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employee or
"principal" after the Effective Time (collectively, the " _New Plans_ "), the
employees (including officers) and "principals" of the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall receive service credit for service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries (and any respective predecessors) to the same extent such
service credit was granted under any benefit plan or arrangement of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except to the extent any such service
credit would result in the duplication of benefits. In addition and without
limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) each Company Employee and
"principal" shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting
time or satisfaction of any other eligibility requirements, in any and all
New Plans to the extent that (A) coverage under such New Plan replaces
coverage under a benefit plan or arrangement in which such Company Employee or
"principal" participated immediately before the Effective Time (collectively,
the " _Old Plans_ ") and (B) such Company Employee or "principal" has
satisfied all waiting time and other eligibility requirements under the Old
Plan being replaced by the New Plan and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any
Company Employee or "principal", the Parent shall cause (A) all pre-existing
condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be
waived for such Company Employee or "principal" and his or her covered
dependents to the extent such conditions were inapplicable or waived under the
comparable Old Plan and (B) any expenses incurred by any Company Employee or
"principal" and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan
year of the Old Plan ending on the date such Company Employees or
"principals" participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken
into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Company
Employee or "principal" and his or her covered dependents for the applicable
plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

(c) The Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and the Surviving
Corporations Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with its terms, each
Employee Benefit Plan (including the obligation to make any payments under any
non-qualified deferred compensation plan) and each agreement with any
"principal" of the Company or its Subsidiaries and all obligations thereunder,
including any rights or benefits arising as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or in combination with any other
event), and the

 



49  Parent hereby acknowledges that the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement constitutes a "change of control" or "change in
control" of the Company or similar event, as the case may be, for all
purposes under such Employee Benefit Plans.

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended (i) to require the
Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Affiliates to establish or maintain any specific Employee Benefit Plan or
arrangement for any length of time or (ii) to create or amend any Employee
Benefit Plan or arrangement or agreement with any "principal" of the Company
or its Subsidiaries. This Section 5.9 is included for the sole benefit of the
Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns and does not
and shall not create any right in any Person, including any Company Employee,
"principal" or any other participant in any Employee Benefit Plan or
arrangement that may be established or maintained by the Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates following the
Merger, or any beneficiary or trustee thereof. Furthermore, nothing contained
in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon
any Person, any right to employment or engagement or continued employment or
engagement for any period of time, or any right to a particular term or
condition of employment or engagement.

 

5.10 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) The Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to agree that all rights
to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses now existing in
favor of the current or former directors, officers, "principals" or
employees, as the case may be, of the Company or its Subsidiaries as provided
in their respective certificates of incorporation or by-laws or other
organization documents or in any agreement with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall survive the Merger and, except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Section 5.10, shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms. For a period of six (6) years from the
Effective Time, the Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation, subject to
compliance with applicable Law, to maintain in effect the exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the Companys and
its Subsidiaries certificates of incorporation and by-laws or similar
organization documents as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time or
in any indemnification agreements of the Company or its Subsidiaries with any
of their current or former respective directors, officers, "principals" or
employees as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and, subject
to compliance with applicable Law, shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify
any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any individuals who at the Effective Time were current or former
directors, officers, "principals" or employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (or their heirs, executors, administrators or estates);
_provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to indemnification or advancement of
expenses in respect of any Action pending or asserted or any claim made within
such period shall continue until the disposition of such Action or resolution
of such claim.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, to
indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds in respect of each of the
foregoing, following receipt of any undertakings required by applicable Law)
each current and former director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and each such person who served as a director, officer, member,
trustee, fiduciary or in a position of similar import with respect to another
corporation, 

 



50  partnership, joint venture, trust, pension, Employee Benefit Plan or other
entity at the request or for the benefit of the Company (each, together with
such Persons heirs, executors, administrators and estate, an " _Indemnified
Party_ ") against any costs or expenses (including advancing attorneys fees
and other expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit,
proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent
permitted by Law and following receipt of any undertaking required by
applicable Law), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened
Actions, arising out of, relating to or in connection with any action or
omission occurring or alleged to have occurred in such Indemnified Partys
capacity as a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
in such Indemnified Partys capacity as a director, officer, member, trustee,
fiduciary or position of similar import with respect to another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, pension, Employee Benefit Plan or other
entity before, at or after the Effective Time, including, for the avoidance
of doubt, in connection with (i) the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (ii) Actions to enforce this Section 5.10 or any other
indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnified Party. In the event
of any such Action (other than an Action described in the immediately
foregoing clause (ii)), the Surviving Corporation shall reasonably cooperate
with the Indemnified Party in the defense of any such Action. 

(c) The Company shall obtain prior to the Effective Time fully paid six (6)
year "tail" insurance policies (the " _D andO Tail_") with respect to
directors and officers liability, employment practices liability and
fiduciary liability insurance of the type and with the amount of coverage as
maintained by or on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately
prior to the Effective Time for the benefit of the current and former
directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective
Time and with such other terms as the Company may determine are no less
favorable in the aggregate than those in the directors and officers
liability, employment practices liability and fiduciary liability insurance
policies maintained by or on behalf of the Company and its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_
, that the Company shall not be permitted to pay aggregate premiums in excess
of 275% of the last annual premium paid by the Company for such coverages
prior to the Effective Time, but, in the case such maximum amount would
otherwise be exceeded, the Company shall purchase as much coverage as
reasonably practicable for such maximum amount. The Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to maintain the DandO Tail in full force and effect for
its full term and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored.

(d) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to,
and not in limitation of, any other rights such Person may have under the
certificates of incorporation or by-laws or other organization documents of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation, any
other indemnification arrangement, the DGCL, directors and officers,
employment practices liability or fiduciary liability insurance claims under
any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or
its Subsidiaries or otherwise. The provisions of this Section 5.10 shall
survive the consummation of the Merger and expressly are intended to benefit,
and are enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, each of whom is
an intended third-party beneficiary of this Section 5.10.

 



51 (e) In the event the Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 5.10. 

5.11 _Takeover Laws_. If any "moratorium", "control share", "fair price",
"affiliate transaction", "business combination" or other anti-takeover Laws
or regulations of any Governmental Entity shall become applicable to the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, the Parties
shall, to the extent a Party has the ability to do so under such Laws or
regulation, (a) take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the
transactions contemplated hereunder may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and (b) otherwise take all such
actions as are reasonably necessary to eliminate or minimize the effects of
any such statute or regulation on the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

5.12 _Financing_.

(a) Without the prior written consent of the Company, neither the Parent nor
Merger Sub shall permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or any
waiver of any provision or remedy under, or replacement of, the Financing
Commitments if such amendment, modification, waiver or replacement (i) (A)
reduces the aggregate amount of the Financing (including by changing the
amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount of the Debt Financing
unless the Equity Financing is increased by a corresponding amount (or Merger
Sub may draw upon an available revolver to fund any additional fees or
original issue discount) and the representation and warranty set forth
in Section 4.4(b) shall remain true and correct), (B) imposes new or
additional conditions or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any of the
conditions to the receipt of the Financing (unless such new or additional
conditions or expanded, amended or modified conditions could not be
reasonably expected to, (x) taking into account the expected timing of the
Marketing Period, make the timely funding of the Financing or satisfaction of
the conditions to obtaining any of the Financing less likely to occur or (y)
adversely affect the ability of the Parent or Merger Sub to enforce their
respective rights against other parties to the Financing Commitments), (C)
adversely affects the ability of the Parent or Merger Sub to enforce their
respective rights against other parties to the Financing Commitments, or (D)
taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing Period, could
reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or materially delay
the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (collectively, the " _Restricted Financing Commitment
Amendments_ ") ( _provided_ that (x) the exercise of the "flex"
provisions contained in the Debt Financing Commitment as of the date hereof
shall not be a Restricted Financing Commitment Amendment and (y) the amendment
of the Debt Financing Commitments solely to add lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents and similar entities shall not be a
Restricted Financing Commitment Amendment) or (ii) could reasonably be
expected to result in the early termination of the Financing Commitments. For
the avoidance of doubt, in the event all or any portion of the Debt Financing
structured as "high-yield" financing has not been consummated on or prior to
the Closing, the Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
proceeds of the bridge facilities contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters
(or alternative bridge financing obtained in accordance with this Agreement)
to fund the

 



52  aggregate Merger Consideration to be available and, upon satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in the Financing Commitments, to be used to replace such
"high-yield" financing to allow the Closing to occur on the date on which the
Parent and Merger Sub are obligated to complete the Closing in accordance with
Section 1.2. In addition, each of the Parent and Merger Sub shall use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to
arrange and consummate the Financing as promptly as practicable on the terms
and conditions described in the Financing Commitments (subject to any "flex"
provisions applicable thereto), including using its reasonable best efforts to
(1) maintain in effect the Financing Commitments (including by complying with
the exercise of "flex" provisions by the Financing Sources) until the funding
of the Financing at or prior to Closing, (2) satisfy on a timely basis (or
obtain a waiver of) all conditions and covenants applicable to the Parent and
Merger Sub to obtaining the Financing at the Closing set forth in the
Financing Commitments, (3) negotiate, execute and deliver definitive
agreements with respect to the Debt Financing on terms no less favorable,
taken as a whole, to the Parent and Merger Sub than the terms and
conditions (including the "flex" provisions) contemplated by the Financing
Commitments (and promptly provide copies of such executed and delivered
definitive agreements to the Company), (4) fully pay when due any and all
commitment fees or other fees or amounts payable under the Financing
Commitments and, (5) upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the
Financing Commitments, consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing
(including by enforcing its rights under such Financing Commitments and, if
necessary and subject to the conditions set forth in Section 7.4(c), taking
enforcement action to cause such Financing Sources and other Persons providing
such Financing to comply with their obligations under the Financing
Commitments and, subject to the terms and upon satisfaction of the conditions
of the Financing Commitments, to fund such Financing by the Closing Date). In
the event any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable, regardless of
the reason therefor, the Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly notify the
Company and shall use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to arrange and obtain alternative financing ("
_Alternative Financing_ ") from the same or alternative sources on terms and
conditions not less favorable, taken as a whole, to the Parent and Merger Sub
(in the reasonable judgment of Parent) than those in the Debt Financing
Commitments. Such Alternative Financing (including any commitments therefor)
(X) shall not have any conditions to the funding of such Alternative Financing
that are (i) more onerous than those in the Debt Financing Commitments, and
(ii) taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing Period, could
reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or materially delay the Financing
and (Y) shall be in an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby by the Closing Date. The Parent shall promptly deliver to
the Company true and complete copies of all material agreements related to any
Alternative Financing (other than customary engagement letters, customary
side letters, and other customary ancillary agreements, none of which affect
the amount, availability or conditionality of the Financing or the accuracy of
the representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.4(b) of this
Agreement), redacted to the same extent as copies of the Debt Financing
Commitment delivered by the Parent as of or prior to the date hereof. The
Parent shall promptly (and, in any event, within two (2) Business Days) notify
the Company in writing (A) of any material breach or default (or any event or
circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both could
reasonably be expected to give rise to any material breach or default) by the
Parent or Merger Sub, or to the knowledge of the Parent or any of its Control
Affiliates or Representatives, any

 



53  other party to any of the Financing Commitments or the definitive agreements
with respect thereto and (B) of the receipt by the Parent or Merger Sub or any
of their respective Affiliates or Representatives of any written notice or
other written communication from any Person with respect to any (x) actual or
potential material breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to
any Financing Commitment or any definitive agreement related thereto of any
provision of the Financing contemplated pursuant to the Financing Commitments
or any definitive agreement related thereto (including any proposal by any
Financing Source or other Person named in the Debt Financing Commitments or
any definitive agreement related thereto to withdraw, terminate or make a
material change in the terms of (including the amount of financing
contemplated by) the Debt Financing Commitments) or (y) material dispute or
disagreement between or among any parties to any Financing Commitment or any
definitive agreement related thereto and (C) if for any reason the Parent or
Merger Sub believes in good faith that it will not be able to obtain all or
any portion of the financing contemplated in the Financing Commitments on the
terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Financing

pursuant to Section 5.12(a)), subject to customary confidentiality
arrangements with such Persons regarding such information.

(g) Nothing in this Section 5.12 or any other provision of this Agreement
shall require, and in no event shall the "reasonable best efforts" of the

or in any amount in excess of that contemplated by the Equity Commitment, (ii)
waive any term or condition of this Agreement or (iii) pay any material fees
in excess of those contemplated by the Financing Commitments (whether to

any condition to the obligations of any Party hereto to effect the Merger or
any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to be
satisfied; _provided_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
Section 5.16 shall not cure any breach of any representation, warranty or

cooperate with the Parent (at the Parents sole expense) regarding all matters
arising in connection with the 2010 Hedges and the 2010 Warrants and, if
reasonably requested by the Parent, shall request quotations (whether with
respect to termination or otherwise) from and have discussions or negotiations
regarding the 2010 Hedges or the 2010 Warrants with the counterparties thereto
(in which the Parent shall be entitled to participate) and shall use its

not be available to the Party seeking to terminate if the failure of such

_further_ , however, that, for the avoidance of doubt, the cure period set
forth in this Section 7.1(h) shall not be applicable to any breach or failure
to perform by the Parent or Merger Sub that gives rise to a termination right
under Section 7.1(i); or

 

(i) by the Company, if (i) all of the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and

63 (b) _Parent Termination Fee_. Any provision in this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding:

(i) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(h)
or Section 7.1(i), then the Parent shall pay the Company a cash amount equal
to eighty-three million three hundred sixty-four thousand dollars
($83,364,000) (the " _Parent Termination Fee_ ").

 

(ii) In the event the Parent Termination Fee is payable, such fee shall be
paid to the Company by the Parent by wire transfer of immediately available
funds within three (3) Business Days after the Termination Date.

 

(c) _Expense Reimbursement_. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 7.1(c) (but only if the Stockholders Meeting has not been held prior
to the End Date) or 7.1(d) or by the Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(g), the
Company shall reimburse the Parents designee, no later than the third (3rd)
Business Day after presentation to the Company of a reasonably detailed
invoice, for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees, costs and
expenses incurred by the Parent, Merger Sub and any of the Financing Sources
in connection with this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby;  _provided_ , that (i) the Company shall not be required to pay more
than an aggregate of four million nine hundred thousand dollars ($4,900,000)
pursuant to this Section 7.2(c), (ii) the Company shall not be required to pay
more than an aggregate of one million dollars ($1,000,000) pursuant to this
Section 7.2(c) in respect of reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees,
costs and expenses incurred by any of the Financing Sources (and, for the
avoidance of doubt, such fees, costs and expenses shall be included in the
calculation of payments made for purposes of, and subject to, together with
all other fees, costs and expenses payable pursuant to this Section 7.2(c),
the maximum amount set forth in, clause (i) of this Section 7.2(c)), (iii) if
the Company becomes obligated to pay the Company Termination Fee after having
made any payment pursuant to this Section 7.2(c), then the amount of the
Company Termination Fee shall be reduced by the amount of such payments
pursuant to this Section 7.2(c) and (iv) if the Company has paid the Company
Termination Fee then it shall have no obligation under this Section 7.2(c)
from and after such payment.

 

(d) Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the agreements contained in this
Section 7.2 and Sections 7.3(b) and 7.3(c) are integral parts of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and that without these agreements, the
Parties would not have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the
Company fails to promptly when due pay any amount due pursuant to Section
7.2(a) or 7.2(c) or if the Parent fails to promptly when due pay any amount
due pursuant to Section 7.2(b) and, in order to obtain such payment, the
Parent, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, commences an
Action that results in an Order against the Company for the Company
Termination Fee or for any reimbursement pursuant to Section 7.2(c) (or any
portion of either of them) or an Order against the Parent for the Parent
Termination Fee (or any portion thereof), respectively, then the Company
shall reimburse the Parent, on the one hand, or the Parent shall reimburse the
Company, on the other hand, together with interest on the amount of the
Company Termination Fee, any reimbursement pursuant to Section 7.2(c) or
the Parent Termination Fee, as the case may be, (or portion of any of them)
at an interest rate of 5% per annum compounded monthly from the date such
payment was required to be made through the date on which such payment is
actually made, its documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
attorneys fees) in connection with such Action.

 



64 (e) For all purposes of this Section 7.2 and Section 7.3, if this Agreement
is terminated by the Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(c) and the Parent would
not otherwise have been entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.1(c) at such time but for the operation of the parenthetical
statement at the end of Section 7.1(c), then such termination by the Parent
pursuant to Section 7.1(c) shall be treated as a termination of this Agreement
by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(i).

 

7.3 _Effect of Termination_.

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1,
written notice thereof shall be given to the other Party specifying the
provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is made (other than in
the case of Section 7.1(a)) and this Agreement shall forthwith become null and
void and have no further force or effect, without any liability (other than as
set forth, and subject to the limitations included, in Section 7.2 or this
Section 7.3) on the part of any Party, their respective directors, officers,
employees, "principals", stockholders, other equity holders, controlling
Persons or any other Representative of any such Party;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the provisions of Sections 5.8(b), 7.2, 7.3, 7.4(d), Article
VIII and the provisions providing for the Parent Reimbursement Obligations
shall survive any termination hereof and nothing in this Section 7.3(a) shall
relieve any Party from any liability thereunder; _provided_ , _further_ , that
nothing in this Section 7.3(a) shall, (i) except as set forth in Sections
7.3(b) and 7.3(c), relieve any Party from any liability for any Willful
Breach by such Party of this Agreement occurring prior to such termination or
(ii) relieve any Guarantor for any obligations under the Limited Guarantee
(including any obligations with respect to any liability for any Willful
Breach of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub occurring prior to such
termination that would not otherwise have been relieved by Section 7.3(c)).

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event
this Agreement has been terminated and the Company Termination Fee is payable
and paid to the Parent (or its designee) pursuant to Section 7.2(a), receipt
of the Company Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the
Parent and Merger Sub and each of their respective Affiliates (whether at law,
in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against the Company and any of
its former, current and future Affiliates, and each of their respective
former, current and future direct or indirect directors, officers,
"principals", general or limited partners, employees, stockholders, other
equity holders, members, managers, agents, assignees, Affiliates, controlling
Persons or Representatives (each, a " _Company Related Party_ ", and
collectively, the " _Company Related Parties_ " and the Company Related
Parties shall include all Company Related Parties of any Company Related
Party) for any loss, damage, liability, claim, obligation or Action (whether
in law or in equity and whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) based
upon, arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including any breach or
alleged breach hereof), the negotiation, execution or performance hereof or
the transactions contemplated hereby or in respect of any other document or
theory of law or equity or in respect of any oral or written representations
made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith, whether at law
or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise. The Parties acknowledge and
agree that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Company
Termination Fee on more than one occasion and in no

 



65  event shall the Parent (or its designee) be entitled to collect the Company
Termination Fee on more than one occasion. For the avoidance of doubt, and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, while the Parent and Merger
Sub may pursue both a grant of specific performance and any other remedy
available to them at law or in equity under this Agreement, under no
circumstances shall the Parent and/or Merger Sub be permitted or entitled to
receive both a grant of specific performance of the Companys obligation to
consummate the Merger and payment of the Company Termination Fee or any
damages or other amounts (other than any amounts payable under the last
sentence of Section 7.2(d)).

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the sole and
exclusive remedies of the Company, any Company Related Party or any Person
claiming by, through or for the benefit of the Company against the Parent,
Merger Sub, the Guarantors, the Investors, the Financing Sources and any of
their former, current and future Affiliates, and each of their respective
former, current and future direct or indirect directors, officers,
"principals", general or limited partners, employees, stockholders, other
equity holders, members, managers, agents, assignees, Affiliates, controlling
Persons or Representatives (each, a " _Parent Related Party_ ", and
collectively, the " _Parent Related Parties_ " and the Parent Related Parties
shall include all Parent Related Parties of any Parent Related Party) for any
loss, damage, liability, claim, obligation or Action (whether in law or in
equity and whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) based upon, arising
out of or relating to this Agreement, the Limited Guarantee, the Financing or
the Financing Commitments (including any breach or alleged breach hereof or
thereof), the negotiation, execution or performance hereof or thereof or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or in respect of any other
document or theory of law or equity or in respect of any oral or written
representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or
therewith, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise shall
be (i) receipt of the Parent Termination Fee (including any related amounts
payable under the last sentence of Section 7.2(d)) from the Parent in the
event this Agreement has been terminated and the Parent Termination Fee is
payable to the Company pursuant to Section 7.2(b), (ii) the right to bring an
Action for money damages against the Parent for a Willful Breach of this
Agreement, prior to the termination of this Agreement, by the Parent or Merger
Sub in circumstances where this Agreement has been terminated and the Parent
Termination Fee is not payable to the Company pursuant to Section 7.2(b),
(iii) receipt from the Parent of any monetary amounts payable pursuant to any
Parent Reimbursement Obligations, (iv) receipt from the Guarantors of any
monetary amounts due and payable by the Guarantors under, and subject to all

Confidentiality Agreement against the other Person party thereto, and (vi)
subject to the other provisions of this Section 7.3(c), the right to receive a
grant of specific performance under and to the extent permitted by Section
7.4. The Parties acknowledge and agree that in no event will the Parent be
required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than one occasion and in no
event shall the Company be entitled to collect the Parent Termination Fee on
more than one occasion. For the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, while the Company may pursue both a grant of
specific performance and any other remedy available to it at law or in equity
under this Agreement, under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted
or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance under Section
7.4(b) and payment of the Parent Termination Fee or any damages or other
amounts (other than any amounts payable pursuant to any Parent Reimbursement
Obligation). Without limitation of the generality of the foregoing or of any

 



66 other provision of this Agreement, (1) in no event shall any Parent Related
Party be liable to the Company, any Company Related Party or any Person
claiming by, through or for the benefit of the Company for any consequential,
special, multiple, punitive or exemplary damages (including any damages
arising from loss of profits, loss of business opportunity or loss of
goodwill) in connection with any claim or Action (whether in law or in equity
and whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) based upon, arising out of
or relating to this Agreement, the Limited Guarantee or the
Financing Commitments (including any breach or alleged breach hereof or
thereof), the negotiation, execution or performance hereof or thereof or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or in respect of any other
document or theory of law or equity or in respect of any oral or written
representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or
therewith, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, (2) in
no event shall the Parent Related Parties be liable to the Company, any
Company Related Party or any Person claiming by, through or for the benefit of
the Company in excess of an aggregate amount equal to the Parent Termination
Fee (other than for any amounts payable under the last sentence of Section
7.2(d) or pursuant to any Parent Reimbursement Obligation, which, for the
avoidance of doubt, shall be payable in full notwithstanding the cap set forth
in this clause (2)) for any loss, damage, liability, claim, obligation
or Action (whether in law or in equity and whether based on contract, tort or
otherwise) based upon, arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the
Limited Guarantee or the Financing Commitments (including any breach or
alleged breach hereof or thereof), the negotiation, execution or performance
hereof or thereof or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or in
respect of any other document or theory of law or equity or in respect of any
oral or written representations made or alleged to be made in connection
herewith or therewith, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise, (3) upon payment of the Parent Termination Fee and any amounts
payable under the last sentence of Section 7.2(d) or pursuant to any Parent
Reimbursement Obligation, none of the Company, any Company Related Party or
any Person claiming by, through or for the benefit of the Company shall have
any rights or claims against any Parent Related Party under this Agreement,
the Limited Guarantee, the Financing, the Financing Commitments, or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (whether in law or in equity and
whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) or for any breach or alleged
breach hereof or thereof and (4) none of the Company, any Company Related
Party or any Person claiming by, through or for the benefit of the Company
shall have any rights or claims against any Parent Related Party under or in
connection with this Agreement, the Limited Guarantee, the Financing, the
Financing Commitments, or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby (whether in law or in equity and whether based on contract, tort or
otherwise) or for any breach or alleged breach hereof or thereof for any
damages of any kind or nature or for any other monetary amounts, except as
otherwise set forth in this Section 7.3(c) or in the Limited Guarantee.

 

7.4 _Enforcement_.

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached (including the Parents and
Merger Subs obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded and to
consummate the Merger) and that any breach of this Agreement could not be
adequately compensated in all cases by monetary damages alone. Except as
otherwise set forth in Section 7.4(b) and 7.4(c), the Parties acknowledge and
agree that, prior to the earlier of the Effective Time and the Termination
Date, the Parties shall be 

 



67  entitled, without obtaining, furnishing or posting a bond or similar
indemnity, to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief
to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any Chosen Court, in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, it is acknowledged and
agreed that the Company shall be entitled to seek and obtain specific

Financing to be funded and to consummate the Merger only in the event that
each of the following conditions has been satisfied: (i) all of the conditions
set forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 shall have been satisfied (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions to
be taken at the Closing or determinations to be made immediately prior to the
Effective Time, so long as each of such conditions (other than the condition
set forth in Section 6.2(c)) would have been satisfied on the date the Closing
should have occurred pursuant to Section 1.2) on the date the Closing should
have occurred pursuant to Section 1.2, (ii) since such date, no event shall
have occurred nor shall any condition exist that would cause any of the
conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 to fail to be satisfied on
any day after such date, (iii) the Parent and Merger Sub are obligated to
complete the Closing in accordance with Section 1.2 and either of them have

subject only to the Equity Financing being funded at the Closing and (v) the
Company has confirmed in an irrevocable written notice delivered to the Parent
that, if specific performance is granted, the Equity Financing and Debt
Financing are funded and the Parent and Merger Sub otherwise comply with their
obligations hereunder, then the Closing will occur.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, it is acknowledged and
agreed that the Company shall be entitled to seek and obtain specific
performance of the Parents and Merger Subs obligation to enforce the Debt
Financing Commitment (which, for the avoidance of doubt, includes any
commitment in respect of Alternative Financing that is being used in
accordance with Section 5.12(a)), including any obligation to bring any
enforcement Action in respect of the Debt Financing Commitment, only in the
event that each of the following conditions has been satisfied: (i) all of the
conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 shall have been satisfied
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by
actions to be taken at the Closing or determinations to be made immediately
prior to the Effective Time, so long as each of such conditions (other than
the condition set forth in Section 6.2(c)) would have been satisfied on the
date the Closing should have occurred pursuant to Section 1.2) on the date the
Closing should have occurred pursuant to Section 1.2, (ii) since such date,
no event shall have occurred nor shall any condition exist that would cause
any of the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 to fail to be
satisfied on any day after such date, (iii) the Parent and Merger Sub are
obligated to complete the Closing in accordance with Section 1.2 and either of
them have failed to do so, (iv) all of the conditions precedent to the
consummation of the Debt Financing (which, for the avoidance of doubt,
includes any Alternative Financing that is being used in accordance with
Section 5.12(a)) provided for in the Debt Commitment (or in any commitment
with respect to any such Alternative Financing) have been satisfied (other
than (x) any conditions that are within the control of the Parent and Merger
Sub and (y) any conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions
to be taken at the Closing or determinations to be made immediately prior
to the Effective Time (so long as each of

 



68  such conditions (other than any conditions requiring the delivery of
documentation or certificates or similar instruments in connection with the
Closing) would have been satisfied on the Closing Date)) and (v) the Company
has confirmed in an irrevocable written notice delivered to the Parent that if
specific performance is granted, the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are
funded and Parent and Merger Sub otherwise comply with their obligations
hereunder, then the Closing will occur.

(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall require any Party to institute
any proceeding for (or limit any Partys right to institute any proceeding
for) specific performance prior to or as a condition to exercising any
termination right under Section 7.1 or receiving the Company Termination Fee
or the Parent Termination Fee, if payable, at the time of or following such
termination nor shall the commencement of any legal proceeding restrict or
limit either Partys right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the
terms of Section 7.1 or pursue any other remedies available to such Party
under this Agreement, the Equity Financing Commitment or the Limited
Guarantee; _provided_ , that nothing in this Section 7.4(d) shall limit or
modify any of the limitations on remedies or recourse set forth in Section
7.3(b), Section 7.3(c) or Section 8.14.

in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to
the principles of conflicts of law thereof or of any other jurisdiction which
would require the application of any other States laws.

8.7 _Exclusive Jurisdiction_.

(a) Each Party irrevocably agrees that it shall bring any Action (whether in
law or in equity and whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) arising

in the City of Wilmington and any State of Delaware appellate court therefrom,
or to the extent the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware located in

to accept personal jurisdiction over any Party, any state or federal court
within the City of Wilmington in the State of Delaware and any appellate

of this Agreement and which must be given full force and effect in the event
of any modification of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.10) is held
to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or future Law or
public policy, (a) such provision shall be fully severable, (b) this Agreement
shall be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provision had never comprised a part hereof, (c) the remaining provisions of
this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected

72  herefrom and (d) the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this

connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be paid by the Party incurring such costs and expenses.

8.12 _Non-Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_. None of the
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements or obligations in
