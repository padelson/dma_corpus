(b)All of the issued and outstanding Equity Securities of the Company shall be

Stock, subdivision or split of any Parent Common Stock, combination or
reclassification of Parent Common Stock into a smaller number of shares of
Parent Common Stock or issuance of any securities by reclassification of
Parent Common Stock (including any reclassification in connection with a
merger, consolidation or business combination in which Parent is the surviving
person) or any merger, consolidation, combination, or other transaction is
consummated pursuant to which Parent Common Stock is converted to cash or
other securities, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued to
Holdings pursuant to this Agreement shall be proportionately adjusted,
including, for the avoidance of doubt, to provide for the receipt by Holdings,

securities as is received in exchange for each share of

   

Parent Common Stock in connection with any such transaction. An adjustment
made pursuant to the foregoing shall become effective immediately after the
record date in the case of a dividend and shall become effective immediately
after the effective date in the case of a subdivision, split, combination,
reclassification or other transaction.

 

3.2Intended Tax Treatment; Withholding

 

.

 

(a)Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Parent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the cash otherwise deliverable under this
Agreement, and from any other consideration otherwise paid or delivered in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to Holdings
such amounts Parent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to any
such deliveries and payments under the Code or any provision of state, local,
provincial or foreign Law; provided that Parent shall notify Holdings and the
Company of its determination and such Persons shall cooperate in good faith to
minimize to the extent permissible under applicable Law the amount of any such
deduction or withholding, including by providing any certificates or forms
that are reasonably requested to establish an exemption from (or reduction in)
any deduction or withholding. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by
Parent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to Holdings in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made, and Parent shall disburse such withheld amounts to
the applicable Governmental Authority.

 

(b)The Parties intend and agree that for U.S. federal income tax purposes (and
any state and local income tax purposes that follow such treatment) that the
merger of the Company into Parent in exchange for the Merger Consideration,
and the issuance and sale of Parent Common Stock and Preferred Stock pursuant
to the Jones Purchase Agreement are, taken together, intended to qualify (in
whole or in part) for nonrecognition of gain or loss pursuant to Section 351
of the Code (the "Intended Tax Treatment.").

timely basis true and complete copies of all SEC Reports required to be filed
or furnished under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act. The SEC Reports, as
of their respective effective dates (in the case of the SEC Reports that are
registration statements filed pursuant to the requirements of the Securities
Act) and as of their respective SEC filing dates (in the case of all other SEC
Reports), or, if amended, as finally amended, prior to the Execution Date,
complied, or if not yet filed or furnished will comply, in all material
respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act, the Securities Act and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, applicable to such SEC Reports, and
none of the SEC Reports as of such respective dates contained, or if filed or
furnished with the SEC subsequent to the Execution Date will contain, any
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted, or will omit, to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading.

 

(ii)The consolidated financial statements of Parent, including all notes and
schedules thereto, included in the SEC Reports as of their respective dates
(if amended, as of the date of the last such amendment) comply, or if filed
after the Execution Date will comply, as to form in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto, have been, or will have been, prepared in
accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited quarterly statements,
as indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of the unaudited statements,
as permitted by Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X of the SEC) applied on a
consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in
the notes thereto), in a manner consistent with the books and records of

adjustments, none of which has been or will be, individually or in the

whole).

 

(iii)Parent has established and maintains internal control over financial
reporting and disclosure controls and procedures (as such terms are defined in
Rule 13a‑15 and Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act); such disclosure controls
and procedures are designed to ensure that material information relating to
Parent, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, required to be disclosed by
Parent in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
accumulated and communicated to Parent's principal executive officer and its
principal financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure; and such disclosure controls and procedures are effective to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that
it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms.
Parent's principal executive officer and its principal financial officer have
disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation, to

   

Parent's auditors and the audit and risk committee of Parent Board (x) all
significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal controls which
could adversely affect Parent's ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial data and have identified for Parent's auditors any material
weaknesses in internal controls and (y) any fraud, whether or not material,
that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
Parent's internal controls. The principal executive officer and the principal
financial officer of Parent have made all certifications required by the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Exchange Act and any related rules and regulations
promulgated by the SEC with respect to the SEC Reports, and the statements
contained in such certifications were complete and correct when made. The
management of Parent has completed its assessment of the effectiveness of
Parent's internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the
requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended

effective.

(i)Except as would not be material to the Parent Entities taken as a whole and
except for any Oil and Gas Properties (1) sold or otherwise disposed of in the
ordinary course of business since the date of the reserve report prepared by
Parent's independent petroleum engineers relating to Parent's interests
referred to therein as of December 31, 2018 (the "Parent Reserve Report")
filed as exhibit 99.1 to Parent's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on March 1, 2019, or (2) reflected
in the Parent Reserve Report as having been sold or otherwise disposed of, the
Parent Entities have Parent Good and Defensible Title to all Oil and Gas
Properties forming the basis for the reserves reflected in the Parent Reserve
Report (after giving effect to such excepted assets and properties, the
"Parent Reserve Report Oil and Gas Properties") and in each case as
attributable to interests owned by the Parent Entities, free and clear of any
material Encumbrances, except for Permitted Encumbrances. For purposes of the
foregoing sentence, "Parent Good and Defensible Title" means that any Parent
Entity's title to each of the Parent Reserve Report Oil and Gas Properties
held or owned by them (or purported to be held or owned by them) (a) entitles
any Parent Entity to receive (after satisfaction or payment of all royalties,
minimum royalties, overriding royalties and other similar leasehold burdens
applicable thereto), not less than the Net Revenue Interest shown in the
Parent Reserve Report of all Hydrocarbons produced from such Parent Reserve
Report Oil and Gas Properties throughout the productive life of such Parent
Reserve Report Oil and Gas Properties other than (i) any decreases in
connection with those operations in which the Parent Entities may elect after
the Execution Date to be a non-consenting co-owner in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, (ii) any decreases resulting from reversion of
interest to co-owners with respect to operations in which such co-owners
elect, after the Execution Date, not to consent, (iii) any decreases resulting
from the establishment or amendment, after the Execution Date, of pools or
units, (iv) any decreases required to allow other working interest owners to
make up past underproduction or pipelines to make up past under deliveries or
(v) as otherwise expressly stated in the Parent Reserve Report, (b) obligates
a Parent Entity to bear a Working Interest relating to such Parent Reserve
Report Oil and Gas Properties of not greater than the Working Interest shown
on the Parent Reserve Report for such Parent Reserve Report Oil and Gas
Properties other than (i) any increases resulting from contribution
requirements with respect to defaulting co-owners under applicable operating
agreements or applicable Law, (ii) changes due to the exercise after the
Execution Date of non-consent rights under the applicable operating agreements
and similar agreements or applicable Law, (iii) increases that are accompanied
by at least a proportionate increase in the Parent Entities' collective Net
Revenue Interest in such Parent Reserve Report Oil and Gas Properties, or (iv)
as otherwise expressly stated in the Parent Reserve Report, and (c) is free
and clear of all Encumbrances (other than Permitted Encumbrances).

   

(ii)Except for any such matter that has not had, and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect, the factual, non-interpretive data supplied by Parent to its
independent petroleum engineers relating to Parent's interests referred to in
the Parent Reserve Report, by or on behalf of Parent and its Subsidiaries that
was material to such firm's estimates of proved oil and gas reserves
attributable to the Parent Reserve Report Oil and Gas Properties in connection
with the preparation of the Parent Reserve Report was, as of the time
provided, accurate in all respects. The oil and gas reserve estimates of
Parent set forth in the Parent Reserve Report are derived from reports that
have been prepared by Parent's independent petroleum engineers, and such
reserve estimates fairly reflect, in all material respects, the oil and gas
reserves of the Parent Entities as of the dates indicated therein.

 

(iii)With respect to the Parent Entities, (1) all material rentals, shut-in
royalties and similar payments owed to any Person or individual under (or
otherwise with respect to) any Oil and Gas Leases held by any Parent Entity
have been properly and timely paid in all material respects, (2) all material
royalties, minimum royalties, overriding royalties and other similar leasehold
burdens owed by any Parent Entity with respect the Parent Entities' interests
in any Oil and Gas Properties have been timely and properly paid in all
material respects and (3) none of the Parent Entities (and, to Parent's
Knowledge, no third party operator) has violated any provision of, or taken or
failed to take any act that, with or without notice, lapse of time, or both,
would constitute a material default under the provisions of any Oil and Gas
Lease (or entitle the lessor thereunder to cancel or terminate such Oil and
Gas Lease) included in the Oil and Gas Properties owned or held by the Parent
Entities.

 

(iv)Except as has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, all
proceeds from the sale of Hydrocarbons produced from the Oil and Gas
Properties owned by the Parent Entities are being received by them in a timely
manner and are not being held in suspense (by Parent, any of its Subsidiaries,
any third party operator thereof or any other Person) for any reason other
than awaiting preparation and approval of division order title opinions for
recently drilled Hydrocarbon wells.

 

(v)All of the Hydrocarbon wells and all water, CO2, injection or other wells
located on the Oil and Gas Leases of the Parent Entities or otherwise
associated with an Oil and Gas Property of Parent Entities have been drilled,
completed and operated within the limits permitted by the applicable Contracts
entered into by the Parent Entities related to such wells and applicable Law,
in each case in all material respects. Except as has not had, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect, all drilling and completion (and plugging and
abandonment) of such wells and all related development, production and other
operations have been conducted in compliance with all applicable Law.

 

(vi)None of the Oil and Gas Properties of the Parent Entities is subject to
any (a) rights or agreements that permit any Person to purchase or acquire any
assets of

   

any Parent Entity or portions thereof triggered by and arising in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, or (b) consents to assignment,
approvals, waivers, or authorizations (excluding any of the foregoing
customarily obtained from Governmental Authorities or following Closing)
triggered by and arising in connection with the execution, delivery, or
performance of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby required to be obtained by Parent, except those rights,
agreements or consents that would not be material to the Parent Entities taken
as a whole.

 

(vii)Rights-of-Way. Each of the Parent Entities has such Rights-of-Way as are
sufficient to conduct its business as such business is currently operated in
all material respects. Each of the Parent Entities has fulfilled and performed
in all material respects all of its material obligations with respect to such
Rights-of-Way and is conducting in all material respects its business in a
manner that does not materially violate any of the Rights-of-Way and no event
has occurred that allows, or after notice or lapse of time would allow,
revocation or termination thereof or would result in any impairment of the
rights of the holder of any such Rights-of-Way. All pipelines operated by the
Parent Entities are subject to Rights-of-Way or are located on real property
owned or leased by the Parent Entities, and there are no material gaps
(including any gap arising as a result of any breach by any Parent Entity of
the terms of any Rights-of-Way) in the Rights-of-Way.

pursuant to the Exchange Act (such Contracts, collectively, the "Parent
Contracts") is either filed as an exhibit to the SEC Reports or is set forth
on Schedule 4.3(n).

 

(ii)Except as has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, (A) each
Parent Contract is valid and binding on the Parent Entity to the extent such
Parent Entity is a party thereto, as applicable, and to Parent's Knowledge,
each other party thereto, and is in full force and effect and enforceable in
accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy or other similar Laws affecting the rights and remedies
of creditors generally as well as to general principles of equity (regardless
of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at
law); and (B) there is no default under any Parent Contract by the Parent
Entity or, to Parent's Knowledge, any other party thereto, and no event or
condition has occurred that constitutes, or, after notice or lapse of time or
both, would constitute, a default on the part of a Parent Entity or, to
Parent's Knowledge, any other party thereto under any such Parent Contract. No
Parent Entity has received any written notice of any such default, event or
condition. Parent has made available to the Company (including through the SEC
Reports) true and complete copies of all Parent Contracts, including all
amendments thereto, as of the Execution Date.

   

(o)Related Parties. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.3(o), no Affiliate of
Parent, the Jones Entities or Comstock Control Person, nor any of their
respective directors, officers or employees (nor any members of such Person's
"immediate family") (as defined in Rule 16a-1 of the Securities Act (any such
Person, a "Related Party") (i) is a party to any Contract with, or is
providing or receiving services from, any Parent Entity, (ii) directly or
indirectly owns, or otherwise has any right, title or interest in, to or
under, any material property or right, tangible or intangible, that is or is

any Parent Entity (any Contract related to the arrangements described in
clauses (i) through (iii) hereof, including any such agreements listed (or
required to be listed) on Schedule 4.3(o), a "Related Party Contract").

 

(p)Financing.

 

(i)Parent has received a term sheet (the "Debt Financing Term Sheet") from
certain prospective lenders regarding the terms pursuant to which such lenders
(and/or other lender parties to be identified following the date hereof), may
provide the Debt Financing for the purposes of funding a portion of the Cash
Consideration, Parent's other obligations hereunder (including the repayment
of the Indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility) and related fees and
expenses required to be paid by Parent in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Parent has delivered to the Company true,
complete and correct copies of the Debt Financing Term Sheet. As of the date
hereof, assuming the conditions in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 are met, Parent has no
reason to believe that the Debt Financing will not be provided or made
available to Parent at or prior to the time contemplated under this Agreement
for the Closing as contemplated by the Debt Financing Term Sheet.

 

(ii)Parent has delivered to the Company true, complete and correct copies of
the executed Jones Purchase Agreement.

 

(iii)Except as expressly set forth in the Jones Purchase Agreement, there are
no conditions precedent to the obligations of each of the Jones Entities to
perform their obligations under the Jones Purchase Agreement or any
contractual contingencies that would permit such Jones Entities to reduce the
value of the shares of Parent Common Stock or the principal amount of
preferred equity in Parent that such Jones Entities are required to purchase
thereunder. Parent does not have any reason to believe that it will be unable
to satisfy all terms and conditions to be satisfied by it in the Jones
Purchase Agreement on or prior to the Closing Date nor does Parent have
knowledge that any Jones Entity will not perform its obligations thereunder
(subject to the terms and conditions thereof).

 

(iv)The Jones Purchase Agreement is a valid and binding obligation of Parent
and, to Parent's Knowledge, of each of the other parties thereto. No event has
occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time, or both, would
reasonably be expected to constitute a failure to satisfy a condition
precedent on the part of Parent under the terms and conditions of the Jones
Purchase Agreement. The Jones Purchase Agreement has not been modified or
amended, and none of the commitments under the Jones Purchase Agreement have
been withdrawn or rescinded in writing in any respect.

   

(v)The Debt Financing and the funding of the amounts contemplated by the Jones
Purchase Agreement are collectively referred to in this Agreement as the
"Financing." The Financing, if and when funded in accordance with the Debt
Financing Term Sheet and the Jones Purchase Agreement, shall provide Parent,
taken together with other cash on hand, with cash proceeds on the Closing Date
sufficient for the satisfaction of all of Parent's obligations to pay all
amounts contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) the Cash Consideration,
(ii) the repayment of the Indebtedness outstanding under the Revolving Credit
Facility, and (iii) any fees and expenses of or payable by Parent under this
Agreement and under the Debt Financing Term Sheet and the Jones Purchase
Agreement that are due on the Closing Date.

 

(q)Form S-3. Parent is eligible to register the shares of Parent Common Stock
comprising the Stock Consideration and the shares of Parent Common Stock to be
issued upon conversion of the Preferred Stock for resale by Holdings under a
Registration Statement on form S-3 promulgated under the Securities Act.

 

(r)Investment Company. Parent is not now, and immediately after the issuance
and sale of Parent Common Stock comprising the Stock Consideration will not
be, required to register as an "investment company" or a company "controlled
by" an entity required to register as an "investment company" within the
meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940.

 

(s)Compliance with Laws. Each Parent Entity is, and at all times since
January 1, 2017, has been, in compliance with all Laws applicable to their
businesses, operations, properties or assets, except where any non-compliance
has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. No investigation or review by
any Governmental Authority with respect to any of the Parent Entities is
pending or threatened in writing, other than those the outcome of which would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

 

(t)Parent Opinion. Parent has received the written opinion of BMO Capital
Markets Corp., dated as of May 31, 2019 and addressed to the Parent Board, to
the effect that, based upon and subject to the limitations, qualifications and
assumptions set forth therein, as of the date of the opinion, the Merger
Consideration, excluding the Series A Preferred Balance, to be paid by Parent
is fair, from a financial point of view, to Parent.

 

(u)Distribution Restrictions. Parent is not currently prohibited, nor as of
the Closing, will be prohibited, directly or indirectly, from paying any
distributions with respect to its Equity Securities, except (a) as prohibited
under the Parent Revolving Credit Facility, the Parent Indenture, the Notes
Indenture, the documents contemplated by the Debt Financing or the Transaction
Documents or (b) such prohibitions mandated by the Laws of each of the
Parent's or its Subsidiaries' state of formation and the terms of their
respective Organizational Documents.

 

(v)No Additional Representations. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, Parent acknowledges and agrees that no Company
Entity has made or is making any representations or warranties relating to the
Company Entities

   

whatsoever, express or implied, beyond those expressly given by the Company
Entities in Section 4.1 and Section 4.2, including any implied representation
or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding
the Company Entities furnished or made available to Parent or any of its
Affiliates or Representatives and that Parent has not relied on any such other
representation or warranty not set forth in this Agreement. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, Parent acknowledges that no representations
or warranties are made with respect to any projections, forecasts, estimates,
budgets or prospect information that may have been made available to Parent or
any of its Affiliates or Representatives (including in certain "data rooms,"

solely in furtherance of Parent's investigation of the Company Entities, the
Company will afford Parent and its authorized Representatives reasonable
access during normal business hours to the offices, properties, books and
records, and Representatives of the Company Entities who have significant
responsibility in connection with the Company business, and will furnish
Parent with such additional information directly concerning the Company
Entities' businesses, properties and personnel as may reasonably be requested;
provided, however, that the Company shall have the right to have a
Representative of the Company or its Affiliates present for any communication
with the Company Entities' Representatives; provided further, Parent shall,
and shall cause its Representatives to, observe and comply with all material
health, safety, and security requirements of the Company Entities and the
Company; provided further, that for purposes of clarification and avoidance of
doubt, the Company shall not be required to provide any information regarding
any of its other business opportunities or operations which are not directly
related to the current business and operations of the Company Entities.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates or
Representatives, shall conduct any subsurface investigation or testing of any
environmental media without the prior written consent of the Company, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditions or delayed; (ii) Parent
will have no right of access to, and none of the Company nor the Company
Entities will have any obligation to provide to Parent, (A) information
relating to bids received from others in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and information and analysis (including
financial analysis) relating to such bids, (B) any information the disclosure
of which would jeopardize any privilege available to any Company Entity or any
of their respective Affiliates, (C) any information that the disclosure of
which would cause a breach of a confidentiality obligation by any Company
Entity or any of their respective Affiliates, or (D) any information, the
disclosure of which would result in a violation of Law; and (iii) without the
prior written consent of the Company, the Parent will not contact any
suppliers to, or customers of, any Company Entity with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby. All information obtained pursuant to this
Section 5.6 will be "Confidential Information" as such term is used in the
Confidentiality Agreement and will be subject to the terms thereof. Parent
agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Holdings and each Company
Entity and all such Persons' stockholders, members, managers, officers,
directors, employees, agents, lenders, advisors, representatives, accountants,
attorneys, and consultants from and against any and all liabilities (including
court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees) to the extent attributable to,
arising out of

   

or relating to the access to the Company Entities, any offices of the Company
Entities, or the Company Assets by Parent or any of Parent's Representatives
after the Execution Date, EVEN IF SUCH CLAIMS, DAMAGES, LIABILITIES,
OBLIGATIONS, LOSSES, COSTS, AND EXPENSES ARE CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE
NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT), STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHER
LEGAL FAULT OF ANY COMPANY ENTITY.

 

5.7Transaction Litigation

 

. Each of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, shall
have the opportunity to participate in the defense, settlement, or prosecution
of any proceeding commenced by or against any Person following the Execution
Date related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby at such
Party's sole cost and expense. Prior to the Closing Date, no Party shall
compromise, settle, come to an arrangement regarding or agree to compromise,
settle, or come to an arrangement with any such Person regarding any such
litigation or consent to the same unless the other Party shall have consented
in writing (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or
delayed). In addition, in connection with a proceeding seeking to prevent or
delay the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent shall (i) afford
the Company a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on filings and
responses related thereto, which comments Parent shall consider and implement
in good faith, acting reasonably and (ii) keep the Company apprised of, and
consult with the Company with respect to, proposed strategy and any
significant decisions related thereto.

 

5.8Cooperation

 

. Each party shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested
by the other Party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and any
audit, litigation, or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation
shall include the retention and (upon another Party's reasonable request) the
provision of records and information that are relevant to any such Tax Return
or audit, litigation, or other proceeding and making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided under this Agreement.

 

5.9Notification of Certain Matters

 

. Parent and Company shall promptly notify each other of (a) any Action
commenced or, to such Party's knowledge, threatened against, relating to or
involving or otherwise affecting such Party or any of its Subsidiaries which
relate to the transactions contemplated hereby, or (b) any change, condition
or event that (i) renders or would reasonably be expected to render any
representation or warranty of such Party set forth in this Agreement to be
untrue or inaccurate such that the conditions to Closing set forth in Section
6.2 or Section 6.3, as applicable, would not be satisfied at the Closing, or
(ii) that results or would reasonably be expected to result in any failure of
such Party to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied hereunder; provided,
however, that no such notification shall affect any of the representations,
warranties, covenants, rights or remedies, or the conditions to the
obligations of, the Parties hereunder.

 

5.10Tax Matters

 

. Neither Parent nor Holdings shall take any action reasonably likely to
cause the transactions described in Section 3.2(b) to not qualify for the
Intended Tax Treatment. Each of Parent and Holdings agrees to file all Tax
Returns consistent with the Intended Tax Treatment and will not take any
inconsistent position during the course of any audit, litigation, or other
proceeding with respect to Taxes, except as otherwise required by a

   

final determination by an applicable Governmental Authority. If either Party
becomes aware of any audit, inquiry, litigation or other proceeding relevant
to the Intended Tax Treatment, such person shall promptly notify the other
Party of such proceeding, and all Parties shall use reasonable efforts to
cooperate with respect to such proceeding. The Parties shall comply with the
record keeping and information reporting requirements set forth in Treasury
Regulations Section 1.351‑3.

 

5.11Employment Matters

 

.

 

(a)With respect to each individual who is employed by a Company Entity
immediately prior to the Closing (each, a "Continuing Employee"), Parent
shall, or shall cause its Affiliate to, for twelve (12) months following the
Closing Date (the "Benefit Continuation Period"), and subject to the
provisions of this Section 5.11, provide (i) a base salary or base wage rate,
as applicable, that is no less than such Continuing Employee's base salary or
base wage rate immediately prior to the Closing; and (ii) employee benefits
that are substantially comparable in aggregate value to the employee benefits
that such Continuing Employee was eligible to receive from the Company or its
Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing. Schedule 5.11(a) shall list all
employees that are a subset of the Continuing Employees, to be referred to as
an "Employment Agreement Recipient."

 

(b)With respect to any Continuing Employee (other than an Employment Agreement
Recipient) whose employment with Parent or any of its Affiliates is terminated
due to an Involuntary Termination (as defined in Schedule 5.11(b)) during the
twelve (12) month period beginning on the Closing Date (the "Severance
Protection Period"), Parent shall, or shall cause its applicable Affiliate to,
pay to each a severance payment (the "Severance Payment"). The terms of
applicable Severance Payments, including, without limitation, payment amounts
and timing, are set forth within Schedule 5.11(b). Parent shall document all
applicable terms of the Severance Payment program in compliance with Section
409A of the Code and all regulations promulgated thereunder, consistent with
the terms set forth in Schedule 5.11(b).

 

(c)With respect to any Employment Agreement Recipient whose employment with
Parent or any of its Affiliates is terminated in a manner that results in the
Employment Agreement Recipient becoming eligible to receive a cash severance
payment incident to the Employment Agreement Recipient's involuntary
termination of employment without "Cause," "Non-Renewal," voluntary
termination for "Good Reason," or death or "Disability," all as defined in and
limited to the terms of the applicable employment, severance or change in
control agreement governing the employment of the Employment Agreement
Recipient (the "Individual Agreement") during the Severance Protection Period
(a "Cash Severance Payment"), Parent shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to,
pay a portion of any applicable Cash Severance Payment due to the Employment
Agreement Recipient pursuant to their Individual Agreement up to an amount
that equals twelve (12) months of the Employment Agreement Recipient's base
salary as in effect immediately prior to the applicable separation of service
for that individual (the "Parent Severance Amount"). In the event that the
Cash Severance Payment due to an Employment Agreement Recipient during the
Severance Protection Period exceeds the Parent Severance Amount, the remainder
shall be the financial responsibility of Holdings or one of its Affiliates
(the "Holdings Severance Amount"). Following the end of the Severance
Protection Period, in the event that an

   

Employment Agreement Recipient's employment with Parent or any of its
Affiliates is terminated in a manner that results in the Employment Agreement
Recipient becoming eligible to receive a Cash Severance Payment, Parent or one
of its Affiliates shall be the sole responsible party for making all Cash
Severance Payments pursuant to the Individual Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in Section 5.11(g), Parent, or one of its Affiliates,
shall at all times be responsible for any COBRA-related liabilities or
payments with respect to an Employment Agreement Recipient as provided under
such Employment Agreement Recipient's Individual Agreement. All Cash Severance
Payments due to an Employment Agreement Recipient pursuant to an Individual
Agreement shall remain subject to the terms and conditions of the Individual
Agreement, including, without limitation, the timing of such payments, or
requirements for the Employment Agreement Recipient to execute a release
agreement or to comply with applicable restrictive covenants.

 

(d)With respect to each Continuing Employee, Parent shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to: (i) recognize, for all purposes (including eligibility, vesting
and benefit levels and accruals, but other than benefit accrual under a
defined benefit pension plan) under all plans, programs and arrangements
established or maintained by Parent or its Affiliates for the benefit of such
Continuing Employee, service with the Company or its Affiliates prior to the
Closing to the extent such service was recognized under the corresponding
plan, program or arrangement covering such Continuing Employee immediately
prior to the Closing; (ii) waive any pre-existing condition exclusion,
actively-at-work requirement or waiting period under all employee health and
other welfare benefit plans established or maintained by Parent or its
Affiliates for the benefit of such Continuing Employee, except to the extent
such pre-existing condition exclusion, requirement or waiting period would
have applied to such individual under the corresponding benefit plan
maintained by the Company or its Affiliate in which such Continuing Employee
was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Closing; (iii) not
require a physical examination or other proof of insurability, except to the
extent it is a prerequisite of the insurance carrier for new hires and (iv)
provide full credit for all co-payments, deductibles, out-of-pocket limits and
similar payments such Continuing Employee made or incurred under a benefit
plan sponsored or maintained by the Company or its Affiliate prior to the
Closing for the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs. Parent shall
recognize and assume all Liability for all unused vacation, holiday, sick
leave, flex days, personal days and paid-time off and other time-off benefits
with respect to Continuing Employees which accrued prior to the Closing.

 

(e)Except as listed in Schedule 5.11(e), all Employee Plans, and all
Liabilities relating thereto, shall be transferred to Parent, and Parent
shall, or shall cause an Affiliate to, assume and adopt all such Employee
Plans as the new sponsor of such transferred plans. Subject to the provisions
of this Section 5.11, each Continuing Employee shall remain eligible to
participate in all such transferred Employee Plans for the remainder of the
2019 calendar year.

 

(f)Parent shall provide benefit plans which provide health care flexible
spending accounts and dependent care flexible spending accounts ("FSA
Benefits") to all Continuing Employees that maintained such benefits in an
Employee Plan immediately prior to Closing. It is the intention of the parties
that all activities under an Employee Plan for the plan year in which the
Closing occurs be treated instead as activity under the corresponding FSA
Benefit plan of Parent. Accordingly, all expenses, contributions or
reimbursements made with

   

respect to the Company's applicable Employee Plan in the year in which the
Closing occurs will be deemed to have been made with respect to the
corresponding FSA Benefits plan of Parent.

 

(g)On and after the Closing, Parent or its applicable Affiliates shall assume
all Liabilities and other obligations under COBRA (and shall provide any
required coverage under Parent's applicable welfare plans) with respect to all
Continuing Employees (and their qualifying beneficiaries) who have a COBRA
qualifying event (as defined in Section 4980B of the Code) after the Closing.
On and after the Closing, if either Holdings or any Subsidiary of Holdings has
any continuing operations on and after the Closing, Holdings or such
Subsidiary(s) shall assume all Liabilities and other obligations under COBRA
for all former employees of a Company Entity who do not become employed by
Parent or any of its Affiliates (and their qualifying beneficiaries) who had a
COBRA qualifying event on or before the Closing. If neither Holdings nor any
Subsidiary of Holdings has any continuing operations on or after Closing,
Parent or its applicable Affiliates shall assume all Liabilities and other
obligations under COBRA incurred on or after the later of (i) the date that
neither Holdings nor any Subsidiary has any continuing operations or (ii) the
effective date of cessation of coverage under the group health plan(s)
maintained by Holdings or any applicable Subsidiary, for all former employees
of a Company Entity who do not become employed by Parent or any of its
Affiliates (and their qualifying beneficiaries) and who had a COBRA qualifying
event on or before the Closing; and Holdings shall provide or cause to be
provided any and all reasonably necessary information related to former
employees of a Company Entity (and their qualifying beneficiaries) who have
elected or are eligible to elect continuation coverage under COBRA to allow
Parent or its applicable Affiliates to properly assume such Liabilities and
other obligations under COBRA.

 

(h)The Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate to
share, retain, and maintain data and records that are necessary or appropriate
to effectuate the actions set forth in this Section 5.11. Subject to any
limitations imposed by applicable Law, the Parties (acting directly or through
applicable Affiliates, respectively) shall provide to the other and their
respective agents and vendors all information reasonably necessary for the
Parties to perform their respective duties under this Agreement. The Parties
also hereby agree to enter into any business associate agreements and/or
confidentiality agreements that may be required for the sharing of any
information pursuant to this Agreement to comply with the requirements of
HIPAA (or other applicable Law). Subject to any limitations imposed by
applicable Law, as soon as administratively feasible following the Closing,
Parent shall, or shall cause its Affiliate to, assume, for purposes of the
Continuing Employees, all personnel records, all immigration documents,
including I-9 forms and work authorizations, all payroll deduction
authorizations and elections, whether voluntary or mandated by Law, including
but not limited to W-4 forms and deductions for benefits under the applicable
Employee Plans and all absence management records, Family and Medical Leave
Act and employee leave records, insurance beneficiary designations, flexible
spending account enrollment confirmations, attendance, and return to work
information ("Benefit Management Records"). Parent will use Benefit Management
Records for lawful purposes only, including calculation of withholdings from
wages and personnel management.

 

(i)To the extent that any obligations under the Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Notification Act, 29 U.S.C. Section 2101 et. seq., the regulations
and rules thereunder, or under any similar provision of any federal, state,
foreign or local Law

   

(collectively, a "WARN Obligation") arise with respect to any loss of
employment by any employee of Holdings or any of its Affiliates in connection
with or as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
whether on or before the Closing, the Company and/or Holdings shall be solely
responsible for such WARN Obligation and any associated obligations.

 

(j)To the extent that any WARN Obligations arise with respect to any loss of
employment by any Continuing Employee in connection with or as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement after the Closing, Parent shall be
solely responsible for such WARN Obligation and any associated obligations.

 

(k)The provisions of this Section 5.11 are for the sole benefit of the Parties
and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be construed to
confer on or give to any person (including any current or former employees,
directors, or independent contractors of any Company Entity, Parent or any of
its Affiliates, or legal representative or beneficiary thereof), other than
the Parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any legal
or equitable or other rights or remedies with respect to the matters provided
for in this Section 5.11. Nothing contained herein, express or implied, shall
be (i) deemed an amendment of any benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement
or (ii) construed to prevent Parent or its Affiliates from terminating or
modifying to any extent or in any respect any employee benefit plan that
Parent or its Affiliates may establish or maintain.

 

5.12Financing

 

. 

 

(a)Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Debt Financing
on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Financing Term Sheet (or,
with respect to the terms and conditions contemplated by the Debt Financing
Term Sheet, on such terms and conditions that are not materially less
favorable to Parent than the terms and conditions described in the Debt
Financing Term Sheet), including reasonable best efforts to negotiate and
enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing having
such terms and conditions.

 

(b)Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed on a current basis of the
status of its efforts to consummate the Debt Financing and shall provide
prompt notice to the Company of any material developments with regard to the
Debt Financing (including any changes in the terms of the Debt Financing
relative to the Debt Financing Term Sheet or any facts, events or
circumstances that could be reasonably expected to hinder, delay or alter the
expected terms of the Debt Financing).

 

(c)Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the proceeds called
for from the Jones Entities under the Jones Purchase Agreement, in each case
on terms and conditions no less favorable to Parent than the terms and
conditions described in the Jones Purchase Agreement, as applicable, including
reasonable best efforts to, as applicable, (i) maintain in effect the Jones
Purchase Agreement, (ii) satisfy (or obtain a waiver of) on a timely basis all
conditions in the Jones Purchase Agreement and (iii) enforce its rights under
the Jones Purchase Agreement (including using its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Jones Entities to fund on the Closing Date the amounts required to
be funded by them under the Jones Purchase Agreement). Parent shall not,
without the prior written consent of the Company, (A) permit any amendment,
supplement or modification to, or any waiver of any material provision or
remedy

   

under, or replace, the Jones Purchase Agreement if such amendment, supplement,
modification, waiver or replacement (1) would be reasonably expected to
materially delay the purchase obligations of the Jones Entities under the
Jones Purchase Agreement, or make the satisfaction of the conditions under the
Jones Purchase Agreement materially less likely to occur, (2) reduces the
principal amount of preferred stock or the value of the shares of Parent
Common Stock the Jones Entities are required to purchase under the Jones
Purchase Agreement, (3) materially and adversely affects the ability of Parent
to enforce its rights against any of the other parties to the Jones Purchase
Agreement, or (4) adds new (or modifies any existing) conditions to the Jones
Entities' purchase obligations under the Jones Entities' purchase obligations
under the Jones Purchase Agreement in a manner that would reasonably be
expected to prevent, impede or materially delay the receipt of the aggregate
amounts payable by the Jones Entities under the Jones Purchase Agreement, or
(B) terminate the Jones Purchase Agreement.

of their respective affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by
Parent or the Company which is required to be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Information Statement, so that the Information Statement
shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other Party, and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing

records, Parent shall give Holdings at least 90 days' written notice to such
effect, and Holdings shall be given an opportunity, at Holdings' cost and
expense, to remove and retain all or any part of such books and records as
Holdings may select. From and after Closing, Parent shall provide to Holdings,
at Holdings' expense, reasonable access to such books and records as remain in
Parent's possession and reasonable access to the Company Assets and other
properties and employees of Parent in connection with matters relating to the

other Takeover Laws (including, in the event Parent re-incorporates in any
other jurisdiction, then the similar Takeover Laws of such jurisdiction) to
not apply to the issuance of the Stock Consideration contemplated hereunder.

occurring prior to the Effective Time and cover each such person covered by
directors' and officers' liability insurance policies of the Company Entities
in effect on the Execution Date on terms with respect to coverage and in
amounts no less favorable in the aggregate than the directors' and officers'
liability insurance policies of the Company Entities in effect on the
Execution Date; provided, however, that in no event shall the Company Entities
expend for such DandO Insurance an aggregate amount in excess of 300% of the
amount per annum the Company Entities paid in its last full fiscal year for
its existing coverage; and provided, further, however, that if the aggregate
premium for such insurance coverage exceeds 300% of such annual amount, the
Company Entities shall obtain as much coverage as reasonably practicable for a
cost not exceeding such amount.

 

(c)The provisions of this Section 5.18 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and will be enforceable by, each Company Group Indemnified Party and in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification
or contribution that any such Person may have by Contract or otherwise. Parent
shall pay all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses, including
reasonable attorneys' fees, that may be incurred by any Company Group
Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity obligations provided in this
Section 5.18 unless it is ultimately determined that such Company Group
Indemnified Party is not entitled to such indemnity.

 

(d)For a period of six years after the Effective Time, if Parent, or any of
its successors or assigns, consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each case, proper provision

other public announcements or make other public disclosures regarding this

liability or obligation on the part of any Party except with respect to this

8.5Severability

of being enforced by any Law, all other conditions and provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby are not
affected in any materially adverse manner to the other party. If a final
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or
provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto
agree that the court making such determination shall have the power to limit
such term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases or to replace such
term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and
that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable

modified. In the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in
the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or
unenforceable term or provision with a valid

   

and enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to the extent possible,
the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable
term or provision.

agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof. Except for the provisions of Article III
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the rights of the former holders of
equity interests in the Company, including Holdings) and Section 5.18 (which
from and after the Effective Time are intended for the benefit of, and shall
be enforceable by, the Persons referred to therein and by their respective
heirs and Representatives), nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to or shall confer upon any Person other than the Parties any right,
benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any Party's Willful
and Material Breach of this Agreement or intentional fraud, then the other
Party shall be entitled to pursue any and all legally available remedies,
including equitable relief, and to seek recovery of all losses, liabilities,
damages, costs and expenses of every kind and nature, including reasonable
attorneys' fees and Parent acknowledges and agrees that, in the event of
Parent's Willful and Material Breach of this Agreement or intentional fraud,
the result of which is a failure of Closing to occur, an appropriate measure
of such damages may include a decrease in equity value.

unenforceable, or order any Party to take any action inconsistent herewith or
not to take an action consistent herewith or required hereby, the validity,
legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions and obligations
contained or set forth herein shall not in any way be affected or impaired
thereby, unless the foregoing inconsistent action or the failure to take an
action constitutes a material breach of this Agreement or makes this Agreement
impossible to perform, in which case this Agreement shall terminate. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is null, void or unenforceable,
the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in a mutually
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be
consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

   

8.10Assignment

 

. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations
hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties (whether by operation of Law
or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other Party. Subject to
the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors
and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment in violation of this Section
8.10 shall be void.

 

8.11Affiliate Liability

 

. Solely for purposes of this Section 8.11, each of the following is herein
referred to as a "Company Affiliate" any (a) Affiliate of the Company and any
direct or indirect holder of equity interests or securities in the Company or
any such Affiliate (in each case, whether limited or general partners,
members, stockholders or otherwise), and (b) any director, officer, employee,
Representative or agent of any Person described in clause (a). No Company
Affiliate, other than any Party, shall have any liability or obligation, to
Parent or any of its Affiliates of any nature whatsoever in connection with or
under this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and Parent, on
behalf of itself and each of its Affiliates, hereby waives and releases all
claims of any such liability and obligation.

 

8.12Specific Performance

 

. The Parties agree that irreparable damage, for which monetary damages would
not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that any of the provisions
of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms
or were otherwise breached by the Parties. Prior to the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1, it is accordingly agreed that the Parties
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, or any other appropriate
form of specific performance or equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any
court of competent jurisdiction, in each case in accordance with this Section
8.12, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
under the terms of this Agreement at law or in equity. Each Party accordingly
agrees not to raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy
of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches
of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of such Party
under this Agreement all in accordance with the terms of this Section 8.12;
provided, however, that solely to the extent a Financing Failure exists, the
Company shall not be entitled to specifically enforce Parent's obligation to
consummate the Closing. Each Party further agrees that no other Party or any
other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar
instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy
referred to in this Section 8.12, and each Party irrevocably waives any right
it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond
or similar instrument. If prior to the End Date, any Party hereto brings an
action to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions
hereof by any other Party, the End Date shall automatically be extended by
such other time period established by the court presiding over such action.

 

8.13Amendment

 

. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed
on behalf of each of the Parties.

 

8.14Extension; Waiver

 

. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the Company and Parent may, by
action taken or authorized by, with respect to Parent, its Board of Directors,
and, with respect to the Company, its board of managers, to the extent legally
allowed:

   

(a)extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of
the other Party hereunder;

 

(b)waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other
Party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto; or

 

(c)waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the other
Party contained herein.

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company or Parent in
exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any
single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of
any other right hereunder. No agreement on the part of a Party to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid unless set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such Party.
