**STOCK  PURCHASE AGREEMENT**

 

 

**THIS  STOCK  PURCHASE AGREEMENT,** dated as of August 16, 2007, is made by
and among  Peoples Energy Corporation, an Illinois corporation (" **Seller**
"),  and El Paso EandP Company, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership  ("
**Buyer** ").

 

 

 

        

    |  

_RECITALS:_

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

**A.** Seller  is the owner of one hundred percent (100%) of the issued and
outstanding shares  of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Peoples
Energy Production  Company, a Delaware corporation (the " **Company** ").

 

 

**B.** Prior  to the sale contemplated under this Agreement, the Company will
be converted  into a limited liability company, and the shares of common
stock of the Company  will be converted into equity interests in such limited
liability company (such  shares in the Company and the equity interests in
the successor limited  liability company being referred to as the  "
**Shares"** ).

 

 

**C.** Seller  desires to sell the Shares to Buyer, and Buyer desires to
purchase the Shares  from Seller, on the terms and conditions set forth
herein.

 

 

_AGREEMENT_ **:**

 

 

**NOW,  THEREFORE,** in consideration of the foregoing Recitals and the
mutual  covenants and agreements contained herein, Seller and Buyer do hereby
agree  as  follows:

 

 

**ARTICLE  I**

 

_TERMS  OF THE  TRANSACTION_

 

 

** Section  1.1. _Agreement  to Purchase_ _and Sell Shares._** Seller 
agrees to sell and Buyer agrees to purchase the Shares for the consideration 
hereinafter set forth and subject to the terms and provisions  herein.

 

 

** Section  1.2. _Purchase  Price._**

 

 

In  consideration of the sale of the Shares to Buyer, Buyer shall pay to
Seller  an  aggregate cash purchase price of $877,632,150 (the "
**Purchase  Price** "). The Purchase Price, as adjusted pursuant to 
_Section 1.3_ , is herein called the " **Adjusted Purchase  Price** ".

 

 

**Section  1.3. _Potential  Adjustments to the Purchase Price._**

 

 

(a) The  Purchase Price shall be increased by the amounts listed below in
this _Section  1.3(a)_ :

 

 

(i) The  amount, if any, by which the Seller's updated computation of Working
Capital,  calculated as of June 30, 2007, set forth in the statement provided
pursuant  to  _Section 1.3(c)_ exceeds $2,632,150;

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

(ii) the  amount of any capital contributions by Seller to the Company or any
of its  Subsidiaries, or the funding by Seller of the negative cash flow or
cash needs  of the Company and its Subsidiaries, during the period from July
1, 2007 until  the Closing Date (which shall include any increase in the
outstanding balance  due from the Company to Integrys under the Intercompany
Loan as of the Closing  Date as compared to the outstanding balance due
thereunder as of July 1, 2007,  such outstanding balance as of July 1, 2007
being $70,000,000); and

 

 

(iii) the  amount, if any, of any increases to the Purchase Price as provided
in _Section  9.1(f)_.

 

 

(b) The  Purchase Price shall be decreased by the amounts listed below in
this _Section  1.3(b)_ :

 

 

(i) The  amount, if any, by which the Seller's updated computation of Working
Capital,  calculated as of June 30, 2007, set forth in the statement provided
pursuant  to  _Section 1.3(c)_ is less than $2,632,150;

 

 

(ii) the  amount of the dividends or other distributions made by the Company
to Seller  and, if applicable, (exclusive of payments or reimbursements by
the Company  and  its Subsidiaries to Seller for services or advances
consistent with the  provisions of _Article VII_ ) during the period from
July 1, 2007 until the  Closing Date;

 

 

(iii) the  excess, if any, of the outstanding balance due from the Company to
Integrys  under the Intercompany Loan as of July 1, 2007 (such outstanding
balance as  of  July 1, 2007 being $70,000,000) over the outstanding balance
due  thereunder as of the Closing Date; and

 

 

(iv) the  amount, if any, of the decrease for Title Defects, Environmental
Defects and  Tax  Liabilities as provided in _Section 9.3_.

 

 

(c) No  later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller
shall  prepare and submit to Buyer a statement setting forth, in reasonable
detail,  Seller's computation of the adjustments to the Purchase Price
described in  _Section 1.3(a)_ and _Section 1.3(b)_ , as applicable, and
such  calculation shall be utilized by the parties for purposes of payment of
the  Adjusted Purchase Price at Closing pursuant to _Section 1.4_.

 

 

(d) After  the Closing, Buyer shall review the calculation made at Closing of
the Working  Capital as of June 30, 2007 and submit an updated calculation to
Seller within  90 days after the Closing Date. If Buyer does not provide
Seller with  an updated calculation of Working Capital as of June 30, 2007 on
or before  90  days after the Closing Date, then the Working Capital used at
the Closing Date  shall be deemed final and not subject to further
adjustment. In the  event that Buyer submits an updated calculation within
the above-referenced  90-day period, Seller and Buyer shall thereafter meet
at a mutually agreeable  time (but no later than 30 days after Buyer's
submission of the updated  calculation) to review the calculation made at
Closing of the Working Capital  as  of June 30, 2007, Buyer\'s updated
calculation thereof, and determine in good  faith whether any additional
revisions to such amount are  necessary. If, based on such review, Seller and
Buyer determine that  the Working Capital as of June 30, 2007 utilized at the

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-2-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

Closing  Date for  purposes of _Section 1.3(a)(i)_ or _1.3(b)(i)_ (the "
**Closing  Date Working Capital** ") is not the same as the Working  Capital
as of June 30, 2007 as determined pursuant to said review  (the amount, as so
redetermined under this _Section 1.3(d)_, being  called the " **Post-Closing
Working Capital** "), then, within three  (3) Business Days after such
determination (i) Seller shall tender to Buyer  cash (via wire transfer of
immediately available funds) equal to the excess  of  that portion of the
Adjusted Purchase Price attributable to the Post-Closing  Working Capital
being less than the Closing Date Working Capital or  (ii) Buyer shall tender
to Seller in cash (via wire transfer of immediately  available funds) any
additional amount owed to Seller as a part of the Adjusted  Purchase Price to
the extent that the Post-Closing Working Capital is greater  than the Closing
Date Working Capital.

 

 

(e) If  a dispute arises under _Section 1.3(d)_ with respect to the 
calculation of the Working Capital as of June 30, 2007 (an  " **Accounting
Dispute** ") that the parties have been unable to  resolve within 120 days
after the Closing Date in accordance with  _Section 1.3(d)_, then, at the
written request of either Seller or  Buyer (the " **Request Date** "), each
of Seller and Buyer shall  nominate and commit one of its senior officers to
meet at a mutually agreed  time  and place not later than 10 days after the
Request Date to attempt to resolve  same. If such senior officers have been
unable to resolve such  Accounting Dispute within a period of 30 days after
the Request Date, either  party shall have the right, by written notice to
the other specifying in  reasonable detail the basis for the Accounting
Dispute, to resolve the  Accounting Dispute by submission thereof to a
nationally recognized independent  public accounting firm commonly considered
as one of the "Big 4" and reasonably  acceptable to Seller and Buyer, which
firm shall serve as sole arbitrator (the  " **Accounting Referee** "). The
scope of the Accounting  Referee\'s engagement shall be limited to the
resolution of the items described  in the notice of the Accounting Dispute
given in accordance with the foregoing  and the corresponding calculation of
the Working Capital. The  Accounting Referee shall be instructed by the
parties to resolve the Accounting  Dispute as soon as reasonably practicable
in light of the circumstances but  in  no event in excess of 15 days
following the submission of the Accounting Dispute  to the Accounting
Referee. The decision and award of the Accounting  Referee shall be binding
upon the parties and final and nonappealable to the  maximum extent permitted
by law, and decision and award thereon may be entered  in a court of
competent jurisdiction and enforced by any party as a final  judgment of such
court. Payment of any amount determined to be  payable by the Accounting
Referee hereunder shall be made in cash (via wire  transfer of immediately
available funds) within three Business Days after such  determination. The
fees and expenses of the Accounting Referee shall be  allocated among Seller
and Buyer in the following manner: Seller shall pay  a  percentage of such
fees and expenses equal to A/(A+B) and Buyer shall pay a  percentage of such
fees and expenses equal to B/(B+A), where "A" is equal to  the  absolute
value of the difference (in Dollars) between the Working Capital as  finally
determined by the Accounting Referee and the Working Capital as proposed  by
Seller and submitted to the Accounting Referee pursuant to this _Section 
1.3_ _(e)_ and "B" is equal to the absolute value of the difference (in 
dollars) between the Working Capital as finally determined by the Accounting 
Referee and the Working Capital as proposed by Buyer and submitted to the 
Accounting Referee pursuant to this _Section 1.3_ _(e)_.

 

 

** Section  1.4. _Payment of  the Adjusted Purchase Price. _**** **The 
Adjusted Purchase Price shall be paid to Seller as follows:

 

 

(a) At  the Closing, Buyer shall pay to Seller, the Adjusted Purchase 
Price.

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-3-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

(b) All  cash payments by Buyer to Seller pursuant to this _Section 1.4_
shall be  made in immediately available funds by confirmed wire transfer to a
bank account  or accounts designated by Seller.

 

 

** Section  1.5. _Parent  Guaranty_**. In  connection with the execution of
this Agreement, El Paso Corporation, the parent  of Buyer (the " **Parent**
"), will execute and deliver to Seller  that certain Guaranty of even date
herewith pursuant to which the Parent will  guaranty certain obligations of
the Buyer pursuant to this  Agreement.

 

 

** Section  1.6. _Intercompany  Loan_**. Buyer  acknowledges and agrees
that the Company and its Subsidiaries maintain an  intercompany loan
arrangement (the " **Intercompany Loan** ") with  Integrys pursuant to which
Integrys provides funding to the Company and its  Subsidiaries. It is the
intention of the parties that the balance  owed by the Company to Integrys
under the Intercompany Loan as of the Closing  Date be treated as a
contribution to the captial of the Company by Integrys,  and  accordingly,
the parties agree that, upon the application of the Purchase Price 
adjustment pursuant to _Section 1.3(a)(ii) or (b)(ii)_ , Seller shall cause 
the Intercompany Loan to be converted into a capital contribution to the 
Company, the Intercompany Loan and all amounts due and payable thereunder
shall  be cancelled in full, the Company shall have no liability for any
indebtedness  or other obligation pursuant to the Intercompany Loan after the
Closing, and  Integrys shall deliver a full and unconditional release at the
Closing with  regard to the Intercompany Loan.

 

 

** Section  1.7. _Excluded  Hedge_ _s_**. The  Company and its Subsidiaries
maintain those Hedges with Calyon Financial, July  2007 Houston Ship Channel
Basis Swap, August 2007 Houston Ship Cannel Basis  Swap, September 2007
Houston Ship Channel Basis Swap, July 2007 Tennessee Zone  0  Basis Swap,
August 2007 Tennessee Zone 0 Basis Swap, and September 2007  Tennessee Zone 0
Basis Swap, and maintain collateral or compensating balances  in  connection
therewith (such Hedges and all related collateral or compensating  balances
are referred to herein as the " **Excluded  Hedges** "). The parties agree
that: (i) Seller shall cause the  Excluded Hedges to be terminated, or
transferred to and assumed by Seller or  its  Affiliate and any collateral
owned by the Company or its Subsidiaries securing  the Excluded Hedges and
which is not an Oil and Gas Property or included in  the  calculation of
Working Capital to be released and transferred to Seller, on  or  before the
Closing Date; (ii) the Company and its Subsidiaries shall have no  liability
or obligation for, or receive any benefit or right from, the Excluded  Hedges
or the assignment or termination thereof; and (iii) none of the Oil  and 
Gas Properties or other assets included in Working Capital shall be
burdended  by  the Excluded Hedge after the Closing.

 

 

**ARTICLE  II**

The  closing of the  transactions contemplated hereby (the " **Closing** ")

following  the  satisfaction or waiver of the conditions in _Article X_

returns,  filings,  notices, correspondence, memoranda, and other
information (in physical or  digital form), including all documents
supporting such reports, returns,  filings, correspondence and memoranda, but
exclusive of any Sales  Information. Buyer will preserve all records so
delivered by Seller  for a period of six years following the Closing and will
allow  Seller reasonable access to such records at all reasonable times for 
a purpose reasonably related to (i) Seller's ownership of Shares in the
Company  or (ii) the performance by it of its obligations, and the
enforcement by it  of  its rights hereunder. If Buyer desires to dispose of
any such records  prior to the expiration of the six-year period referenced
above, Buyer shall  provide notice of same to Seller, and Seller shall have a
period of 10 days  to  deliver written notice to Buyer that Seller elects to
have such records  delivered to Seller (at the expense of Seller). If Seller
fails to  deliver such notice within the 10-day period referenced above,
Buyer shall  have  the right to dispose of the subject records.
Notwithstanding the  foregoing, the Parties shall retain any and all records
of the Company and  the  Subsidiaries that relate to any ongoing audit or
other proceeding in respect  of  Taxes until such time as Buyer is notified
of the final conclusion of such  matter or ninety (90) days after the
expiration of statutes of limitation  applicable to such Taxes.

 

 

** Section  8.9. _HSR  Filing_**. If  compliance with the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as  amended (the " **HSR Act** "), is
required in connection with the  transactions contemplated under this
Agreement, as promptly as practicable  and  in any event not more than ten
Business Days following the date on which the  parties hereto have executed
this Agreement, Seller and Buyer will file with  the  Federal Trade
Commission and the Department of Justice, as applicable, the  required
notification and report forms and will as promptly as practicable  furnish
any supplemental information which may be requested in connection  therewith.
Seller and Buyer will request expedited treatment (i.e.,  early termination)
of such filing. Buyer and Seller shall use  Reasonable Efforts to make or
modify all other filings and submissions on a  prompt and timely basis in
connection with the filings required by this  _Section 8.9_. Seller and Buyer
will bear their own costs  and expenses relating to the compliance with this
_Section 8.9_ ; provided,  however, that 50% of the HSR filing fee shall be
borne by Buyer and 50% shall  be  borne by Seller.

 

 

** Section  8.10. _Employees  and Employee Benefits_**

 

 

(a) _Employment  of the Company Employees_. Buyer will cause the Company, a 
Subsidiary, the Buyer or any affiliate of any such entity to employ each of 
the  Company Employees in accordance with this _Section 8.10_, subject to 
the right to terminate any such Company Employee following the Closing in 
accordance with Applicable Law; provided that neither the Company nor the 
Subsidiaries shall have any obligation to employ or offer employment to an 
officer or director of the Company and the Subsidiaries who resigns from 
employment in accordance with _Section 8.5_.

 

 

(b) _Seller  Responsibility for Certain Compensation Arrangements_. Seller 
shall discharge all obligations or responsibilities that Seller or Company 
(or  any Subsidiary) may have under the compensation arrangements identified
in  _Section 8.10(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedule.

 

 

(c) _Cessation  of Participation in Seller Benefit Plans_. From and after
the  Closing, the Company Employees will accrue no additional benefits under
any  employee benefit plan, policy, program, or arrangement in which the
Company  Employees (or their eligible dependents) participated prior to
Closing and  that  is maintained by Seller or by an Affiliate of Seller
other

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-23-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

than  the Company or  a Subsidiary (the " **Seller Benefit Plans** "). All
such  Seller Benefit Plans are listed (and identified as such) in _Section 
4.15(d)_ of the Disclosure Schedule. _Section 4.15(d)_ of the  Disclosure
Schedule lists (and they are identified as such) each Employee  Benefit Plan
that is sponsored or maintained by the Company or a Subsidiary  that  is not
a Seller Benefit Plan. Seller (or the applicable Seller  Benefit Plan) shall
discharge all obligations with respect to benefits accrued  prior to the
Closing under the Seller Benefit Plans; provided that neither  Seller nor any
of the Seller Benefit Plans will recognize for any purpose a  Company
Employee's post-Closing employment with Buyer or the Company or an  Affiliate
of Buyer.

 

 

(d) _Buyer  Benefit Plans_. From and after the Closing, the Company
Employees  who continue in employment with Buyer or the Company or an
Affiliate of Buyer  will be covered under such employee compensation and
benefit plans, policies,  programs or arrangements as Buyer or the Company or
an Affiliate of Buyer may  make available, which shall include medical and
dental coverage (the  " **Buyer Benefit Plans** "). Buyer will cause the
Company  or any Affiliate of Buyer, for purposes of determining a Company
Employee's  (other than an officer of the Company and the Subsidiaries who
resigns from  employment in accordance with _Section 8.5_) eligibility to 
participate, vesting, attainment of retirement dates, and future benefit 
accruals under any Buyer Benefit Plans (including vacation and sick leave, 
but  not including benefit accruals under a defined benefit pension plan)
where  the  benefit accrual is service weighted, to recognize the service
and seniority  that  is recognized by the Company or by Seller immediately
prior to the Closing.  Buyer or the Company or an Affiliate of Buyer shall be
solely responsible for  all benefits accruing under the Buyer Benefit Plans.

 

 

(e) _Accumulated  Vacation, Holiday and Sick Leave_. Buyer or the Company or
an  Affiliate of the Buyer (1) will be responsible for all accumulated paid
time  off  days accrued or accumulated by the Company Employees (other than
an officer  of  the Company and the Subsidiaries who resigns from employment
in accordance  with  _Section 8.5_ ) but that are unused as of the Closing,
and (2) shall treat  all such accumulated paid time off days as vacation days
that may be used by  such Company Employees following the Closing.

 

 

(f) _Post-Retirement  Health and Life Benefits_. Seller will be responsible
for  providing post-retirement health and/or life insurance benefits in
accordance  with the applicable Seller Benefit Plan to any former employee of
the Company  (and to the eligible dependents of any such former employee) who
satisfied  the  requirements for such post-retirement coverage and who
retires on or prior  to  Closing. Seller shall have no responsibility to
provide  post-retirement health and/or life insurance benefits to any of the
Company  Employees (or to the dependents of any such Company Employee) who
retires or  terminates employment on or following the Closing, and the
eligibility, if  any,  of any Company Employee (or the dependents of any
Company Employee) for  post-retirement health and/or life benefits shall be
determined solely in  accordance with the terms and conditions of the Buyer
Benefit  Plans.

 

 

(g) _COBRA/Insurance  Continuation_. Seller will be responsible for making 
available COBRA continuation coverage to any "qualified beneficiary"  whose
"qualifying event" occurs on or prior to Closing. The Closing  of the
transaction contemplated under this Agreement is not a "qualifying  event",
and Seller shall have no obligation to make COBRA continuation coverage 
available to, the Company Employees who continue in employment with Buyer or 
the  Company or an Affiliate of Buyer following the Closing. Buyer or the 
Company or an Affiliate of the Buyer will be responsible for making
available  COBRA continuation coverage to any "qualified

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-24-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

beneficiary" whose  "qualifying event" occurs following the Closing;
provided that the Buyer or  Company or an Affiliate of Buyer shall provide
the first six (6) months of  such  COBRA continuation coverage without
charge with respect to any Company Employee  (other than an officer of the
Company and the Subsidiaries who resigns from  employment in accordance with
_Section 8.5_ ), and the eligible dependents  of such Company Employee, who
are otherwise eligible for COBRA continuation  coverage and whose employment
terminates within twelve (12) months of the  Closing under the circumstances
described in this _Section  8.10(g)_. A covered Company Employee (and the
covered dependents  of such Company Employee) will be entitled to six (6)
months of COBRA  continuation coverage subsidized by the Buyer or Company or
an Affiliate of  Buyer if (1) the Company Employee's employment is
involuntarily terminated by  Buyer or Company or an Affiliate of Buyer for
reasons other than cause within  twelve (12) months of the Closing, or (2)
the Company Employee voluntarily  terminates employment within such twelve
(12) month period following failure  by  the Buyer or Company or an
Affiliate of Buyer to continue the Company Employee's  employment in a
Comparable Position, or any communication of a requirement  that,  when
implemented, would result in the Covered Employee no longer being employed 
in a Comparable Position. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the  term "
**Comparable Position** " means a position at a base salary  rate that is no
less than the Company Employee's base salary rate as in effect  immediately
prior to the Closing and at a primary work location that is no  more  than
fifty (50) miles from the Company Employee's primary work location 
immediately prior to Closing.

 

 

** Section  8.11. _Change of  Corporate Name; Transitional Use of Signage
and Other  Materials_.**Promptly,  and in no  event more than ten days
following the Closing, Buyer shall cause each of the  Company and the
Subsidiaries to change its corporate name so that it does not  contain the
words "Peoples Energy" or any derivative or combination  thereof. In
addition, Buyer, the Company and any corporation,  partnership, venture, or
other entity controlled directly or indirectly by  either of them shall not
have any name containing the words "Peoples Energy",  or  any derivative or
combination thereof, after such change has been  made. Buyer shall provide
Seller with evidence of the change in the  Company\'s and the Subsidiaries\'
corporate names required by this Section 8.11  within ten days after such
changes have been made. Buyer further  acknowledges that it will have no
ongoing claim or rights in or to Seller Marks.  Buyer will not use or permit
the use of any Seller Marks; provided, however,  that Buyer is not hereby
restricted in filings, instruments, agreements or  other  communications
from indicating the Company's former name. Buyer  shall, within 90 days
following the Closing Date, remove or destroy or cause  the  removal or
destruction of all signage or other items or materials utilizing  Seller
Marks.

 

 

** Section  8.12. _Conversions or  Change in Entity Classification._**

 

 

(a) Prior  to the Closing, Seller shall (i) cause PEP Holding to either merge
into the  Company or file an entity classification election effective prior
to Closing  to  be treated as an entity disregarded from its owner for
United States federal  income tax purposes, (ii) cause the Company to be
converted into a Delaware  limited liability company in accordance with
Delaware law, (iii) cause PEP  Partners and PEP Operating Company to either
merge into the Company or PEP  Texas, or be converted into a Delaware limited
liability company in accordance  with Delaware law and (iv) cause PEP Texas
to either convert into a Delaware  limited liability company in accordance
with Delaware law or merge into either  PEP Partners, PEP Operating Company,
PEP Holding or the Company, with all  related documents and instruments to be
in form and substance mutually  satisfactory to Seller and Buyer in their

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-25-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

respective  reasonable judgments; provided, however, that such documents may
provide that  the names shall be changed to names designated by Buyer at
least five Business  Days prior to the Closing Date that are consistent with
the provisions of  Section 8.11; provided further that if Buyer fails to
timely designate such  names, then Seller may choose new names that comply
with the provisions of  Section 8.11 and change such names to those new names
in connection with  the merger. At or after the time of filing of any
entity  classification election, and at or after the time of any conversion,
described  in the first sentence of this Section 8.12, neither Seller nor any
of its  Affiliates will make an election or take any action that would cause
the entity  that filed such election or that was so converted (as the case
may be) to be  classified as a corporation for federal income Tax  purposes.
The parties intend that for federal income tax  purposes the purchase of
Shares will be treated as a purchase of the interests  in a disregarded
entity and thus as a purchase of the assets of the  Company.

 

 

(b) Notwithstanding  any provision herein to the contrary, the parties
acknowledge and agree that  the  Disclosure Schedule does not take into the
account the effect of the  transactions set forth in _Section 8.12(a)_ ("
**Section 8.12  Transactions** "). Seller agrees, and Buyer agrees to
permit  Seller, to amend or supplement the Disclosure Schedule on or before
August  24,  2007 to address the effect of the Section 8.12 Transactions.
Seller shall  deliver the Disclosure Schedule to Buyer with appropriate
detail or markings  to  reflect the nature of each amendment or supplement.
Upon delivery of the amended  or supplemented Disclosure Schedule to Buyer in
accordance with this _Section  8.12(b)_ , the Disclosure Schedule and this
Agreement shall be amended as set  forth therein with the effect of being
deemed to have been included in the  Disclosure Schedules from the date
hereof. Based upon the understanding of  the  parties that the Section 8.12
Transactions will not constitute an assignment,  conveyance or transfer by
operation of law or otherwise, the Seller will not  schedule any preferential
rights or consents that would be applicable to an  assignment, conveyance or
other transfer of properties.

 

 

**ARTICLE  IX**

 

_BUYER\'S  DUE  DILIGENCE EXAMINATION_

 

 

** Section  9.1. _Title and  Other Due Diligence Examination._**

 

 

(a) From  August 20, 2007 until 5:00 p.m. (local time in Houston, Texas) on
September  20,  2007 (the " **Examination Period** "), Seller shall cause
the Company  to afford to Buyer and its authorized representatives reasonable
access during  normal business hours to the office, personnel and books and
records of the  Company in order for Buyer to conduct an examination as it
may in its sole  discretion choose to conduct with respect to the Properties
(" **Buyer\'s  Review** "); provided, however, that such investigation shall
be upon  reasonable notice and shall not unreasonably disrupt the personnel
and  operations of the Company. Such books and records shall include, 
without limitation, all abstracts of title, title opinions, title files, 
ownership maps, lease files, assignments, division orders, operating records 
and  agreements, well files, financial and accounting records, geological, 
geophysical and engineering records, tax files, and any other files and
records  relating to the Properties, in each case insofar as same may now be
in existence  and in the possession of the Company, excluding, however, any
information that  the Company is prohibited from disclosing by bona fide,
third party  confidentiality restrictions; provided, that if requested by
Buyer, Seller  shall  cause the Company to use its Reasonable Efforts,
without the requirement to  make  any payment or provide any other
consideration, to obtain a waiver of any such  restrictions in favor of
Buyer. The cost and

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-26-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

expense  of Buyer's  Review, if any, shall be borne solely by Buyer. Buyer
shall not  contact any of the customers or suppliers of the Company or its
Working Interest  co-owners, operators, lessors or surface interest owners,
in connection with  the  transactions contemplated hereby, whether in person
or by telephone, mail or  other means of communication, without the specific
prior written authorization  of Seller, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

 

 

(b) If  Buyer discovers any Title Defect affecting any of the Properties
prior to the  expiration of the Examination Period, Buyer shall promptly
notify Seller of  such  alleged Title Defect. To be effective, such notice
(" **Title  Defect Notice** ") must (i) be in writing, (ii) be received by 
Seller prior to the expiration of the Examination Period, (iii) describe  the
Title Defect in reasonable detail including the basis therefor (including 
any alleged variance in the Net Revenue Interest or Working Interest,  (iv)
identify the specific Oil and Gas Property to which such Title Defect 
relates, and (v) include the value of such Title Defect as determined by 
Buyer in good faith, determined in accordance with _Section  9.1(c)_. Upon
Seller's request, Buyer will promptly deliver copies  of any documents in
Buyer's possession concerning the alleged Title Defect, such  as title
opinions if any have been rendered. Any matters that may  otherwise
constitute Title Defects, but of which Seller has not been notified  by 
Buyer in accordance with the foregoing, shall be deemed to have been waived 
by  Buyer for all purposes. Upon the receipt of such effective Title  Defect
Notice from Buyer, Seller shall have the option, in addition to the  remedies
set forth in _Section 9.1_ _(c)_ (the " **Remedies for  Title Defects** "),
but not the obligation, to attempt to cure such Title  Defect at any time
prior to the Closing, at the sole cost and expense of  Seller. The Property
or Properties affected by such uncured Title  Defect shall be referred to
herein as the " **Title Defect  Property** ".

 

 

(c) With  respect to each Title Defect that is not cured as determined to the
reasonable  satisfaction of Buyer acting in good faith on or before the
Closing, the  Purchase Price shall be reduced, subject to this _Article IX_
_,_ by  the Title Defect Amount with respect to such Title Defect  Property.
The " **Title Defect Amount** " shall mean, with  respect to a Title Defect
Property, the amount by which such Title Defect  Property is impaired as a
result of the existence of one or more Title Defects,  which amount shall be
determined as follows:

 

 

(i) The  Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect Property shall be
determined  by taking into consideration the " **Allocated Value(s)** " (as
set  forth in _Exhibit 9.1(c)_ attached hereto) of the Property or 
Properties subject to such Title Defect, the portion of the Property or 
Properties subject to such Title Defect, and the legal effect of such Title 
Defect on the Property or Properties affected thereby; provided, however, 
that: (A) if such Title Defect is in the nature of the Company\'s  Net
Revenue Interest in a Property being less than the Net Revenue Interest 
set  forth in _Exhibit 9.1(c)_ hereto and the Working Interest remains the 
same, then the Title Defect Amount shall be equal to the Allocated Value for 
the  relevant Property multiplied by a fraction (1) the numerator of which is
an  amount equal to the "Net Revenue Interest" shown on _Exhibit 9.1(c)_ 
for such Property less the decimal share to which Seller would be entitled 
to as  a result of its ownership interest in such Property which is
unaffected by  such  Title Defect and (2) the denominator of which is the
"Net Revenue Interest"  shown for such Property on _Exhibit 9.1(c)_ **** or 
(B) if such Title Defect is in the nature of a Lien, then the Title Defect 
Amount shall equal the amount required to fully discharge such Lien;  and

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-27-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

(ii) If  the Title Defect results from any matter not described in _Section 
9.1_ _(c)(i)_ , the Title Defect Amount shall be an amount equal to the 
difference between the value of the Title Defect Property affected by such 
Title  Defect with such Title Defect and the value of such Title Defect
Property  without such Title Defect (taking into account the portion of the
Allocated  Value of the Title Defect Property).

 

 

(d) As  used in this _Section 9.1_ :

 

 

(i) " **Defensible  Title** " means, as of the date of this Agreement and the
Closing Date,  with respect to the Properties, subject to Permitted
Encumbrances, such record  title and ownership by the Company that:

 

 

(1) entitles  the Company to receive and retain, without reduction,
suspension or termination,  not less than the percentage set forth in
_Exhibit 9.1(c)_ as the  Company\'s Net Revenue Interest of all Hydrocarbons
produced, saved and marketed  from each Lease comprising an Oil and Gas
Property as set forth in  _Exhibit 9.1(c)_, through plugging, abandonment and
salvage of all  wells comprising or included in such Oil and Gas Property,
and except for  changes or adjustments that result from the establishment of
units, changes  in  existing units (or the participating areas therein), or
the entry into of  pooling or unitization agreements after the date hereof
unless made in breach  of  the provisions of _Section 7.2_ ;

 

 

(2) obligates  the Company to bear not greater than the percentage set forth
in  _Exhibit 9.1(_c) as the Company\'s Working Interest of the costs and 
expenses relating to the maintenance, development and operation of each
Lease  comprising or included in such Oil and Gas Property, through
plugging,  abandonment and salvage of all such wells comprising or included
in the Oil  and  Gas Property, and except for changes or adjustments that
result from the  establishment of units, changes in existing units (or the
participating areas  therein), or the entry into of pooling or unitization
agreements after the  date  hereof unless made in breach of the provisions
of _Section  7.2_ ;

 

 

(3) is  free and clear of all Liens, except Permitted Encumbrances; and

 

 

(4) reflects  that all preferential purchase rights which are applicable to
or must be  complied with in connection with the transaction contemplated by
this Agreement  have been waived or the time period for exercise has expired
without  exercise.

 

 

(ii) " **Permitted  Encumbrances** " shall mean (A) Liens for Taxes which are
not yet  delinquent or which are being contested in good faith by appropriate
proceedings  and for which adequate reserves have been established; (B)
normal and  customary Liens of co-owners under operating agreements,
unitization agreements,  and pooling orders relating to the Oil and Gas
Properties, which obligations  are  not yet due and pursuant to which the
Company is not in default;  (C) mechanic\'s and materialman\'s Liens relating
to

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-28-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

the  Oil and Gas  Properties, which obligations are not yet due and pursuant
to which the Company  is not in default; (D) Liens in the ordinary course of
business consisting  of minor defects and irregularities in title or other
restrictions (whether  created by or arising out of joint operating
agreements, farm-out agreements,  leases and assignments, contracts for
purchases of Hydrocarbons or similar  agreements, or otherwise in the
ordinary course of business) that are of the  nature customarily accepted by
prudent purchasers of oil and gas properties  and  do not decrease the Net
Revenue Interest, increase the Working Interest (without  a proportionate
increase in the Net Revenue Interest) or materially affect  the  value of
any property encumbered thereby or the ability to operate same in  the 
manner operated prior to the date hereof; (E) all rights to consent by, 
required notices to, filings with, or other actions by Governmental Entities 
in  connection with the sale or conveyance of oil and gas leases or
interests  therein if the same are customarily obtained routinely and
subsequent to such  sale or conveyance; (F) preferential rights to purchase
and consent to  transfer requirements of any Person not triggered by the
consummation of the  transactions contemplated herein or with respect to
applicable prior  transactions, such consents have been obtained and the
preferential purchase  rights have been waived or expired without exercise;
(G) preferential  rights to purchase and required third-party consents to
assignments and similar  agreements with respect to which, prior to Closing,
(i) waivers or consents  are obtained from the appropriate parties, or (ii)
the appropriate time  period for asserting such rights has expired without an
exercise of such rights;  (H) easements, rights-of-way, servitudes, Permits,
surface leases and other  rights in respect of surface operations, pipelines,
grazing, logging, canals,  ditches, reservoirs or the like; and easements for
streets, alleys, highways,  pipelines, telephone lines, power lines, railways
and other easements and  rights-of-way, on, over or in respect of any of the
Property to the extent  such  matters do not materially interfere with
operations on the Property; (I) rights  reserved to or vested in any
municipality or governmental, statutory or public  authority to control or
regulate any of the Property in any manner, and all  Applicable Laws, rules
and orders of governmental authority;  (J) conventional rights of
reassignment actuated by an intent to abandon or  release a lease and
requiring notice to the holders of such rights; and (K)  any  third party
consent applicable to one or more of the transactions covered by  this
Agreement in which the document describing such consent (1) states that  such
consent cannot be unreasonably withheld (or words similar thereto) and  (2) 
does not contain a provision stating that failure to obtain such consent
renders  either the document or such applicable transaction void (or words
similar  thereto).

 

 

(iii) " **Title  Defect** " shall mean any particular defect in or failure of
the Company\'s  or its Subsidiaries' ownership of any Property or 
Properties: (A) that causes the Company or the Subsidiary, as  applicable, to
not have Defensible Title to such Property, (B) that has  attributable
thereto a Title Defect Amount in excess of  $50,000 ** __** and (C) regarding
which a Title  Defect Notice has been timely and otherwise validly 
delivered. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to  the
contrary, the following matters shall not constitute, and shall not be 
asserted as, a Title Defect: (A) defects or irregularities  arising out of
lack of corporate authorization with respect to documents  executed by (1) a
corporate officer presumed under Applicable Law to have such  corporate
authority or (2) other Person's presumed under Applicable Law to have  such
authority, unless Buyer provides affirmative evidence that such corporate 
action was

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-29-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

not  authorized and  results in another Person's superior claim of title to
the relevant Property;  (B) defects or irregularities that have been cured or
remedied by the passage  of  time, including, without limitation, applicable
statutes of limitation or  statutes for prescription; (C) defects or
irregularities in the chain of title  consisting of omissions of heirship
Proceedings if the matters to be covered  by  such omitted heirship
Proceedings are covered by appropriate affidavits of  heirship; (D) gas
imbalances (e.g., a situation where the Company, a Subsidiary  or their
predecessors in title to an Oil and Gas Property has taken more or  less 
gas from a well than their ownership of the Oil and Gas Properties would
entitle  it to receive); and (E) any defect or irregularity as would normally
be waived  by reasonably prudent Persons engaged in the oil and gas business
when  purchasing producing properties.

 

 

(e) If  Seller and Buyer are unable to reach an agreement as to whether a
Title Defect  exists or, if it does exist, the Title Defect Amount
attributable to such Title  Defect, the provisions of _Section 9.4_ shall be
applicable.

 

 

(f) If  prior to Closing Seller determines (or should Buyer, in the course of
Buyer's  Review, determine) that the Company\'s Net Revenue Interest in an
Oil and Gas  Property is greater than the Net Revenue Interest set forth in 
_Exhibit 9.1(c)_ hereto and the Working Interest remains the same,  then the
parties agree that, unless waived in whole or in part by Seller in  Seller's
sole discretion, the Purchase Price shall be increased by an amount  equal to
the Allocated Value for the relevant Oil and Gas Property multiplied  by 
the percentage increase in such Net Revenue Interest; provided, however,
that  Buyer shall have the right to terminate this Agreement if, after giving
effect  to any waiver by Seller, the Purchase Price is increased by more than
five  percent (5%) pursuant to this _Section 9.1(f)_. If Buyer should 
determine that Company has such greater Net Revenue Interest, Buyer agrees 
to  notify Seller in writing of such greater Net Revenue Interest promptly
after  determining same, but in all events prior to the Closing.

 

 

** Section  9.2. _Environmental Due  Diligence Examination._**

 

 

(a) Buyer  shall have the right, or the right to cause environmental
consultant(s)  (" **Buyer\'s Environmental Consultant** "), to conduct an 
environmental review of the Properties prior to the expiration of the 
Examination Period (" **Buyer\'s Environmental Review** "); provided, 
however, that Buyer\'s environmental and physical examination, investigation 
and  assessment of the Properties may not, without the prior written consent
of  Seller, not to be unreasonably withheld, include any soil or water tests
or  borings or other invasive tests or examinations with respect to the 
Properties. Seller shall make, and shall cause the Company and the 
Subsidiaries to make, all of their records, employees, and physical assets 
available to the Buyer and Buyer's Environmental Consultant for inspection
and  review, to allow the Buyer to conduct a reasonable and appropriate
environmental  inquiry and due diligence investigation. The cost and expense
of  Buyer\'s Environmental Review, if any, shall be borne solely by  Buyer.
No Person, other than Buyer\'s Environmental Consultant and  Buyer\'s
employees may conduct Buyer\'s Environmental Review. Seller  shall have the
right to have representatives thereof (including personnel of  the  Company
and/or the Subsidiaries) present to observe Buyer\'s Environmental  Review.
With respect to any samples taken in connection with Buyer\'s  Environmental
Review, Seller shall be permitted to take split samples. Buyer  agrees to
conduct Buyer\'s Environmental Review in a manner so as not to unduly 
interfere with the business operations of the Company or the

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-30-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

Subsidiaries  and in  compliance with all Applicable Laws and Buyer shall
exercise due care with  respect to the Company\'s or the Subsidiaries\'
properties and their  condition.

 

 

(b) Prior  to the Closing, unless otherwise required by Applicable Law, Buyer
shall (and  shall cause Buyer\'s Environmental Consultant, if applicable, to)
treat  confidentially any matters revealed by Buyer\'s Environmental Review
and any  reports or data generated from such review (the " **Environmental 
Information** "), and Buyer shall not (and shall cause Buyer\'s 
Environmental Consultant, if applicable, to not) disclose any Environmental 
Information to any Governmental Entity or other third party without the
prior  written consent of Seller. Prior to the Closing, unless otherwise 
required by Applicable Law, Buyer may use the Environmental Information only 
in  connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If 
Buyer, Buyer\'s Environmental Consultant, if applicable, or any third party 
to  whom Buyer (pursuant to the terms of this Agreement) has provided any 
Environmental Information become legally compelled to disclose any of the 
Environmental Information, Buyer shall provide Seller with prompt notice and 
Seller, at its expense, may file any protective order, or seek any other
remedy,  as it deems appropriate under the circumstances. If this Agreement
is  terminated prior to the Closing, Buyer shall (1) deliver the
Environmental  Information to Seller, (2) destroy all copies thereof in
Buyer's possession  (other than information in Buyer's standard computer
back-up archive provided  such back-up copies shall not be accessed), except
to the extent such  destruction is prohibited by Applicable Law and (3) not
disclose such  Environmental Information to any other Person, except for
disclosures required  by Applicable Law. Upon Seller's written request to
Buyer, Buyer  shall provide copies of the Environmental Information to Seller
without  charge.

 

 

(c) If  Buyer or Buyer\'s Environmental Consultant, if applicable, discovers
any  Environmental Defect (as herein defined) prior to the expiration of
the  Examination Period, Buyer shall notify Seller of such alleged
Environmental  Defect. To be effective, such notice (an " **Environmental 
Defect Notice** ") must (i) be in writing; (ii) be received by  Seller prior
to the expiration of the Examination Period; (iii) describe  the
Environmental Defect in reasonable detail, including the specific Properties 
affected by or associated with such Environmental Defect, and if applicable, 
identify with reasonable specificity the provisions of the Environmental
Laws  alleged to be violated and summarize the related facts that
substantiate such  violation; (iv) describe the procedures recommended to
correct, eliminate  or pay the Environmental Defect; and (v) set forth
Buyer\'s good faith  estimate of the Environmental Defect Value, including
the basis for such  estimate. Any matters that may otherwise constitute
Environmental  Defects, but of which Seller has not been specifically
notified by Buyer in  accordance with the foregoing, together with any
environmental matter that  does  not constitute an Environmental Defect,
shall be deemed to have been waived  by  Buyer for purposes of this _Section
9.2_. With respect to  Environmental Defect(s) alleged by Buyer, upon
Seller's request, Buyer will  promptly deliver to Seller: (A) if applicable,
a site plan showing the  location of all sampling events, boring logs and
other field notes describing  the sampling methods utilized and the field
conditions observed, (B) all  sampling results and other applicable data, (C)
the written conclusion of  Buyer\'s Environmental Consultant, if applicable,
that an Environmental Defect  is  believed to exist and any related
recommendations from Buyer\'s Environmental  Consultant, if applicable. Upon
the receipt of such effective notice  from Buyer, Seller shall have the
option, in addition to the remedy set forth  in  _Section 9.2(d)_ , but not
the obligation, to attempt to cure such  Environmental Defect at any time
prior to the Closing, at the sole cost and  expense of Seller. If Seller and
Buyer are unable to reach an  agreement as to whether an Environmental Defect
exists

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-31-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

or,  if it does  exist, the amount of the Environmental Defect Value
attributable thereto or,  if  Seller elects to cure the Environmental
Defect, the Seller and Buyer are unable  to agree upon the remedy, the
provisions of _Section 9.4_ shall be  applicable.

 

 

(d) If  any Environmental Defect described in a notice delivered in
accordance with  _Section 9.2_ is not cured on or before the Closing, then
the Purchase  Price shall be reduced, subject to _Section 9.3_ , by the
Environmental  Defect Value of such Environmental Defect.

 

 

As  used in this  _Section 9.2_ :

 

 

" **Environmental  Defect** " shall mean, with respect to any given Property,
a  violation of an Environmental Law in effect as of the date hereof in the 
jurisdiction in which such Property is located, an obligation under 
Environmental Laws to complete any corrective action at the Property, or any 
Environmental Liability arising from or attributable to any condition,
event,  circumstance, activity, practice, incident, action, or omission
existing or  occurring prior to the Closing Date, or the use, release,
storage, treatment,  transportation, or disposal of Hazardous Materials prior
to the Closing Date,  (A) regarding which an Environmental Defect Notice has
been timely and  otherwise validly delivered, and (B) that has an
Environmental Defect Value  attributable thereto in excess of $50,000.

 

 

" **Environmental  Defect Value** " shall mean, (A) the net present value of
the  reasonably estimated costs and expenses to correct such Environmental
Defect  in  the most cost effective manner reasonably available, consistent
with  Environmental Laws, or (B) the net present value of the amount of 
Environmental Liabilities reasonably believed will be incurred or required 
to be  paid by the Company or the Subsidiaries with respect thereto. The
parties  recognize that the calculation of an Environmental Defect Value may
require  the  use of assumptions and extrapolations; however, it is
acknowledged and agreed  that any such assumptions and extrapolations will be
consistent with the known  factual information and reasonable in nature. In
determining the net  present value of any items pursuant to this _Section
9.2(d)_ , the  calculation shall be made by discounting each amount related
thereto to the  present value in a commercially reasonable manner as of the
time of payment  to  take into account the period between such payment date
and the date such defect  must be liquidated; provided, however, that neither
the Company nor the  Subsidiaries shall be required to delay or defer
remediation. The  rate of interest used in calculating net present value
under this _Section  9.2(d)_ shall be eight percent (8%) per annum.

 

 

** Section  9.3. _Adjustments to  Purchase Price for Title and Environmental
Defects_ _and Tax  Liabilities_**.

 

 

(a) Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement:
(i) no  single Title or Environmental Defect shall be taken into account as
an  adjustment to the Purchase Price unless the Defect Amount is determined
to  exceed $50,000; (ii) if the aggregate of the Title Defect Amounts and 
Environmental Defect Values, as determined in accordance with this
Agreement,  is  less than or equal to  $8,776,322 ** __** (" **Aggregate
Defect  Threshold** "), then no adjustment of the Purchase Price shall be
made  therefore; and (iii) if the aggregate of the Title Defect Amounts and 
Environmental Defect Values, as determined

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-32-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

in  accordance with  this Agreement, is greater than the Aggregate Defect
Threshold, then the  Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward by the amount
that the aggregate  of  such Title Defect Amounts and Environmental Defect
Values exceeds the Aggregate  Defect Threshold. The provisions of this
_Article IX_ and _Section  4.18_ shall be Buyer's sole remedy for title and
environmental matters  related to the Company, the Subsidiaries and their
respective properties and  other assets. Notwithstanding any other provision
hereof, in the case  of a Title Defect consisting of the exercise of a
preferential purchase right  in  connection with the transactions
contemplated herein, the Purchase Price shall  be adjusted by the entire
Title Defect Amount associated with such Title Defect  without regard to
whether the Aggregate Defect Threshold has been met or whether  the Title
Defect Amount exceeds $50,000; provided that such adjustment shall  not 
apply to any preferential purchase right the proceeds of which are paid, or 
payable, to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

 

(b) _Tax  Liabilities_.

 

 

(i) Buyer  shall notify Seller of the existence of any Tax Liability (as
defined below)  no  later than 90 days after the Closing Date. To be
effective, such  notice (a " **Tax Liability Notice** ") must (A) be in
writing;  (B) be received by Seller no later than 90 days after the Closing
Date;  (C) describe the Tax Liability with reasonable specificity; and  (D)
set forth Buyer\'s good faith estimate of the amount of the Tax  Liability,
including a statement of any significant assumptions employed  therein. Upon
the receipt of the Tax Liability Notice from Buyer and  its acceptance by
Seller, the Purchase Price shall be decreased consistent  with  the
provisions of _Section 1.3(b)_ by the amount of such Tax Liability to  the
extent the amount of such Tax Liability is in excess of any reserve for 
such  Tax Liability (rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes established
to reflect  timing differences between book and Tax income) used in the
computation of  Working Capital, as finally adjusted pursuant to _Section 
1.3_. The provisions of this _Section 9.3(b),_ _Section  10.2_ , and _Article
XIII_ shall be Buyer's sole remedy with respect to  Taxes imposed upon the
Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to or pursuant  to a Pre-Closing
Tax Period.

 

 

(ii) As  used herein, " **Tax Liability** " means any and all Taxes (other 
than United States federal income Taxes or income Taxes imposed by states
which  require the filing of consolidated, combined or unitary returns)
imposed upon  the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect or pursuant to a
period ending  on  or before June 30, 2007, which have not been paid by the
Company or its  Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date.

 

 

(iii) If  Seller and Buyer are unable to reach an agreement as to the
validity or amount  of any Tax Liability, the dispute shall be exclusively
and finally resolved  by  arbitration pursuant to the following terms and
conditions: (1) there  shall be a single arbitrator (the " **Tax Arbitrator**
"), who shall  be a tax attorney with at least 10 years of experience in oil
and gas taxation,  in the State of Texas as selected by mutual agreement of
Buyer and Seller within  15 days after the election to arbitrate, absent such
agreement, the arbitrator  shall be selected (subject to the foregoing
criteria) by the Houston, Texas  office of the American Arbitration
Association; (2) the arbitration proceeding  shall be held in Houston,

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-33-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

Texas  and shall be  conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration
Rules of the American  Arbitration Association, to the extent such rules do
not conflict with the  terms  of this _Section 9.3(b)_ ; (3) the Tax
Arbitrator's determination shall be  made within 20 days after submission of
the matters in dispute and shall be  final and binding upon both parties,
without right of appeal; (4) in making  the  determination, the Tax
Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in  this  _Section 9.3(b)_
and may consider such other matters as in the opinion of  the Tax Arbitrator
are necessary or helpful to make a proper determination;  (5)  the Tax
Arbitrator may consult with and engage disinterested third parties  to 
advise on the matter, including, without limitation, accountants; (6) the
Tax  Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of determining
the  adjustment, if any, based on the disputed Tax Liability and may not
award  damages, interest or penalties to either party with respect to any
matter;  (7)  Seller and Buyer shall each bear its own legal fees and other
costs of  presenting its case; and (8) each party shall bear one-half of the
costs and  expenses of the Tax Arbitrator.

 

 

** Section  9.4. _Defect  Disputes_**. If  a  Title Defect or
Environmental Defect remains uncured by Closing and Seller  and  Buyer are
unable to reach an agreement as to the validity of a claim or the  amount of
any adjustment to the Purchase Price, then Seller may, at its sole 
discretion and upon written notice to Buyer, do any of the  following:

 

 

(a) elect  to cure the Title Defect or Environmental Defect post-Closing
(pursuant to  _Section 9.5_ ) in which event there shall be no adjustment to
the Purchase  Price on account of such Title Defect or Environmental Defect
if  cured;

 

 

(b) elect  to have the dispute exclusively and finally resolved by
arbitration pursuant  to  the following terms and conditions: (1) there
shall be a single  arbitrator (the " **Arbitrator** "), who shall be a title
attorney or  environmental attorney, as applicable, with at least 10 years of
experience  in  oil and gas titles or oil and gas environmental issues, as
the case may be,  in  the State of Texas as selected by mutual agreement of
Buyer and Seller within  15  days after the election to arbitrate, absent
such agreement, the arbitrator  shall be selected (subject to the foregoing
criteria) by the Houston, Texas  office of the American Arbitration
Association; (2) the arbitration proceeding  shall be held in Houston, Texas
and shall be conducted in accordance with the  Commercial Arbitration Rules
of the American Arbitration Association, to the  extent such rules do not
conflict with the terms of this _Section 9.4(b)_ ;  (3) the Arbitrator's
determination shall be made within 20 days after submission  of the matters
in dispute and shall be final and binding upon both parties,  without right
of appeal; (4) in making the determination, the Arbitrator shall  be bound by
the rules set forth in this _Section 9.4(b)_ and may consider  such other
matters as in the opinion of the Arbitrator are necessary or helpful  to make
a proper determination; (5) the Arbitrator may consult with and engage 
disinterested third parties to advise on the matter, including without 
limitation petroleum engineers and environmental consultants; (6) the
Arbitrator  shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the
adjustment,  if  any, based on the disputed Title Defect or Environmental
Defect and may not  award damages, interest or penalties to either party with
respect to any matter;  (7) Seller and Buyer shall each bear its own legal
fees and other costs of  presenting its case; and (8) each party shall bear
one-half of the costs and  expenses of the Arbitrator; or

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-34-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

(c) if  applicable, terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Article XI_.

 

 

** Section  9.5. _Option to  Cure Title Defects Post-Closing._**

 

 

(a) Notwithstanding  anything herein to the contrary, if Seller is not able
to cure a Title Defect  on  or prior to Closing, Seller shall have the
option, by notice in writing to  Buyer  on or before Closing, to attempt to
cure such Title Defect after the Closing  (with any such Title Defect being
called a " **Post-Closing  Defect** "). In such event, the transactions
contemplated  hereby will close as provided herein, but an amount equal to
the Allocated  Value  for the Property or portion thereof to which the Post-
Closing Defect pertains  shall be deducted from the Adjusted Purchase Price
otherwise payable at Closing  and paid into an escrow account (the "
**Defects Escrow** ")  established with a federally insured savings or
banking institution mutually  acceptable to Buyer and Seller (the " **Defects
Escrow Agent** ")  pursuant to the terms of an escrow agreement in a form
acceptable to the Defects  Escrow Agent and reasonably acceptable to Buyer
and Seller (the " **Defects  Escrow Agreement** "). The amount deposited into
the Defects  Escrow with respect to a Post-Closing Defect will remain therein
until released  as provided in _Section 9.5(b)_.

 

 

(b) Buyer  and the Company will act in good faith and reasonably cooperate
with Seller  after the Closing to cure a Post-Closing Defect. If Seller and
Buyer  mutually agree that a Post-Closing Defect has been cured, then within
two  Business Days after such determination, the amount withheld in the
Defects  Escrow with respect thereto (together with any interest earned
thereon) shall  be  released to Seller in accordance with the terms of the
Defects Escrow  Agreement. If Seller and Buyer mutually agree that a Post-
Closing  Defect has been partially cured, then Seller and Buyer shall
mutually determine  the portion of the amount retained in the Defects Escrow
with respect thereto  (together with any interest earned thereon) that should
be paid to Buyer to  compensate it for the uncured portion thereof (together
with interest earned  thereon), and the remaining portion of such amount
shall be released to Seller  (together with any interest earned thereon) in
accordance with the terms of  the  Defects Escrow Agreement. If Seller and
Buyer mutually agree that a  Post-Closing Defect has not been cured, then
within two Business Days after  such  determination, the amount withheld in
the Defect Escrow with respect thereto  (together with any interest earned
thereon) shall be released to Buyer in  accordance with the terms of the
Defects Escrow Agreement. If, at the  end of the 180-day period commencing on
the Closing Date (the " **Cure  Period** "), Seller has been unable to cure,
or has only partially cured,  a Post-Closing Defect (and there is no dispute
as to whether or not it has  been  cured or partially cured), the amount
withheld in the Defect Escrow with respect  to the uncured portion thereof
shall be released to Buyer, and the amount  withheld in the Defect Escrow
with respect to the cured portion shall be  released to Seller (in both
cases, together with any interest earned thereon)  and, in both cases, in
accordance with the terms of the Defects Escrow  Agreement. If, at the end of
the Cure Period, Seller and Buyer are unable to  agree whether there has been
a satisfactory resolution of a Post-Closing Defect,  then such disagreement
shall be resolved as provided in _Section  9.4(b)_.

 

 

** Section  9.6. _Buyer  Indemnification._** ** Buyer  hereby INDEMNIFIES
and SHALL DEFEND AND HOLD the Company, each Subsidiary,  Seller, Affiliates
thereof, and their respective owners, officers, directors,  employees,
agents, representatives, contractors, successors, and assigns  HARMLESS from
and against any and all of the following claims arising from  Buyer\'s
inspecting and observing the Properties: (i) claims for  personal injuries to
or death of employees of Buyer, its contractors, agents,  consultants,**

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-35-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

**and  representatives, and damage to the property of Buyer or others acting
on behalf  of Buyer, except for injuries or death caused by the gross
negligence or willful  misconduct of the Company, Seller or their respective
employees, contractors,  agents, consultants, or representatives; and (ii)
claims for personal  injuries to or death of employees of the Company or
third parties, and damage  to  the property of the Company or third parties,
to the extent caused by the  negligence, gross negligence, or willful
misconduct of Buyer. TO THE  EXTENT PROVIDED ABOVE, THE FOREGOING INDEMNITY
INCLUDES, AND THE PARTIES INTEND  IT TO INCLUDE, AN INDEMNIFICATION OF THE
INDEMNIFIED PARTIES FROM AND AGAINST  CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RESULTING, IN
WHOLE OR PART, FROM THE CONDITION OF  THE  PROPERTY OR THE SOLE, JOINT,
COMPARATIVE, OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT  LIABILITY OF ANY OF THE
INDEMNIFIED PARTIES. THE PARTIES HERETO AGREE  THAT THE FOREGOING COMPLIES
WITH THE EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE RULE AND IS  CONSPICUOUS.**

after written notice thereof from Seller to Buyer (other than those set
forth  in  _Section 6.7_ for which no cure period shall be permitted); or

 

 

(f) by  Buyer, if (i) Seller shall have failed to fulfill in any material
respect  any of its obligations under this Agreement, or (ii) any of the 
representations and warranties of Seller contained in _Article III_ or in 
_Article IV_ shall not be true and correct in all material respects and, 
in  the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii), such failure, misrepresentation
or  breach of warranty (provided it can be cured) has not been cured within
ten  days  after written notice thereof from Buyer to Seller or would not
constitute a  Title Defect, Environmental Defect or Tax Liability subject to
the provisions  of  _Article IX_ ; or

 

 

(g) by  Buyer pursuant to _Section 9.1(f)_.

 

 

** Section  11.2. _Effect of  Termination._** In  the  event of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 11.1_ by  Seller, on the
one hand, or Buyer, on the other, written notice thereof shall  forthwith be
given to the other party or parties specifying the provision hereof  pursuant
to which such termination is made, and this Agreement shall become  void 
and have no effect, except that the agreements contained in this _Article 
XI_ , in _Sections __1.5_ , _8.2_ and _8.7_ , and in  _Articles XIII_ and
_XIV_ **** shall  survive the  termination hereof. Nothing contained in this
_Section 11.2_   shall relieve any party from liability for damages actually
incurred as a result  of any breach of this Agreement.

 

 

** Section  11.3. _Amendment._** This  Agreement may not be amended or
modified except by an instrument in writing  signed by or on behalf of all
the parties hereto.

 

 

** Section  11.4. _Waiver._** Seller,  on the one hand, or Buyer, on the
other, may: (i) waive any  inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
of the other contained herein  or in any document, certificate, or writing
delivered pursuant hereto, or  (ii) waive compliance by the other with any of
the other\'s agreements or  fulfillment of any conditions to its own
obligations contained  herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to
any such  waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing
signed  by or  on behalf of such party. No failure or delay by a party
hereto in  exercising any right, power, or privilege hereunder shall operate
as a waiver  thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof
preclude any other  or  further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right, power, or  privilege.

 

 

**ARTICLE  XII**

 

_SURVIVAL  OF  REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS;_ _ 
INDEMNIFICATION_

 

 

** Section  12.1. _Survival._**

 

 

(a) Except  for the representations and warranties (i) of Seller contained
in  _Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_ and _4.16_ , which shall survive 
indefinitely after the Closing, and (ii) of Buyer contained in _Sections
6.1,  6.2, 6.3, 6.8, 6.9, 6.10, 6.11_ and _6.12_ , which shall  survive

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-40-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

indefinitely  after  the Closing, the respective representations and
warranties of Seller and Buyer  contained in this Agreement shall not survive
the Closing, and thereafter none  of Seller, Buyer, or any officer, director,
employee, or Affiliate of Seller  or  Buyer shall have any liability
whatsoever (whether pursuant to this Agreement  or  otherwise) with respect
to such representation or warranty. Covenants  shall survive for the time
periods specified in this Agreement for performance,  or if no time period is
specified with respect to covenants to be performed  post-Closing, such
covenants shall survive indefinitely. The period,  if any, for which a
representation, warranty and covenant survives is herein  called the "
**Survival Period**."

 

 

(b) No  party hereto shall have any indemnification obligation pursuant to
this  _Article XII_ or otherwise in respect of any representation, warranty
or  covenant unless it shall have received from the party seeking
indemnification  written notice of the existence of the claim for or in
respect of which  indemnification in respect of such representation or
warranty or  covenant is being sought on or before the expiration of the
Survival Period  with  respect to such representation, warranty or covenant.
Such notice  shall set forth with reasonable specificity (i) the basis under
this  Agreement, and the facts that otherwise form the basis of such claim, 
(ii) the estimate of the amount of such claim (which estimate shall not be 
conclusive of the final amount of such claim) and an explanation of the 
calculation of such estimate, including a statement of any significant 
assumptions employed therein, and (iii) the date on and manner in which the 
party delivering such notice became aware of the existence of such  claim.

 

 

** Section  12.2. _Indemnification by  Seller._** Subject  to the terms and
conditions of this _Article XII_ , Seller shall indemnify,  defend and hold
harmless Buyer from and against any and all claims,  actions, causes of
action, demands, assessments, losses, damages, liabilities,  judgments,
settlements, penalties, costs, and expenses (including reasonable 
attorneys\' fees and expenses), of any nature whatsoever (collectively,  "
**Damages** "), asserted against, resulting to, imposed upon, or  incurred by
Buyer, directly or indirectly, by reason of or resulting  from any breach by
Seller of (i) Seller\'s representations and warranties  contained in
_Articles III_ and _IV_ or (ii) Seller\'s covenants and  agreements contained
in this Agreement.

 

 

** Section  12.3. _Indemnification by  Buyer._** Subject  to the terms and
conditions of this _Article XII_ , Buyer shall indemnify,  defend and hold
harmless Seller from and against any and all Damages,  asserted against,
resulting to, imposed upon, or incurred by Seller, directly  or  indirectly,
by reason of or resulting from any breach by Buyer of (i) Buyer's 
representations and warranties contained in _Article VI_ and (ii) Buyer's 
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement. Except to the  extent
Buyer is entitled to indemnification from Seller pursuant to _Section  12.2_
or a Purchase Price adjustment pursuant to _Section 1.3_ , after  Closing,
subject to the terms and conditions of this _Article XII_ , Buyer  shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller from and against any and  all
Damages, asserted against, resulting to, imposed upon, or incurred by 
Seller, directly or indirectly, by reason of or resulting from or related to 
the  ownership and operation of the Company, the Subsidiaries and their
respective  properties and other assets.

 

 

** Section  12.4. _Indemnification  Proceedings._** In  the  event that
any claim or demand for which a party (an " **Indemnifying  Party** "), would
be liable to the another party under _Section  12.2_ , or _Section 12.3_ (an
" **Indemnified Party** ") is  asserted against or sought to be collected
from an Indemnified Party by a third  party, the Indemnified Party shall with
reasonable promptness notify the  Indemnifying Party of such claim or demand,
but the failure so to notify the  Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations  under this

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-41-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

_Article  XII_ ,  except to the extent the Indemnifying Party demonstrates
that the defense of  such claim or demand is materially prejudiced thereby.
The  Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days from receipt of the above notice
from  the  Indemnified Party (in this _Section 12.4_ , the " **Notice 
Period** ") to notify the Indemnified Party whether or not the  Indemnifying
Party desires, at the Indemnifying Party\'s sole cost and expense,  to defend
the Indemnified Party against such claim or demand; provided, that  the 
Indemnified Party is hereby authorized prior to and during the Notice Period 
to  file any motion, answer or other pleading that it shall deem necessary
or  appropriate to protect its interests or those of the Indemnifying Party
and  not  prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party 
elects to assume the defense of any such claim or demand, the Indemnified
Party  shall have the right to employ separate counsel at its own expense and
to  participate in the defense thereof. If the Indemnifying Party elects 
not to assume the defense of such claim or demand (or fails to give notice 
to  the Indemnified Party during the Notice Period), the Indemnified Party
shall  be  entitled to assume the defense of such claim or demand with
counsel of its  own  choice, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party. If
the claim or  demand is asserted against both the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified  Party  and based on the advice of counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnifying  Party it is determined that there is a
conflict of interest which renders it  inappropriate for the same counsel to
represent both the Indemnifying Party  and  the Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall be responsible for paying  separate counsel for the
Indemnified Party; provided, however, that the  Indemnifying Party shall not
be responsible for paying for more than one  separate firm of attorneys to
represent all of the Indemnified Parties,  regardless of the number of
Indemnified Parties. If the Indemnifying  Party elects to assume the defense
of such claim or demand, (i) no  compromise or settlement thereof may be
effected by the Indemnifying Party  without the Indemnified Party\'s written
consent (which shall not be unreasonably  withheld) unless the sole relief
provided is monetary damages that are paid  in  full by the Indemnifying
Party and (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall have  no liability with respect
to any compromise or settlement thereof effected  without its written consent
(which shall not be unreasonably  withheld).

 

 

** Section  12.5. ****_Exclusivity_**.The  parties hereto  agree that after
Closing, in relation to any breach or default of any  representation or
warranty made or entered into by a party hereto pursuant  to  this
Agreement, the sole and exclusive relief and remedy available to the other 
party hereto in respect of said breach or default shall be Damages, but only 
to  the extent properly claimable hereunder and subject to the terms and
provisions  of this _Article XII_ and _Section 9.3(b)_.

 

 

** Section  12.6. _Limits on  Indemnification_**. Notwithstanding  anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement:

 

 

(a) Seller  shall not have any obligation to provide indemnification for
Damages with  respect to any specific occurrence, event or circumstance
giving rise to a  right  to be indemnified pursuant to _Section 12.2_ unless
the aggregate amount of  claims giving rise to the right to be indemnified
exceeds $10,000,000 (the  " **Threshold** "), in which case Seller shall be
only liable to  Buyer for the amount of such Damages that exceed the
Threshold. The  maximum aggregate amount for which Seller may be liable for
indemnification  under this _Article XII_ shall be limited to $100,000,000
(the " **Cap** "); provided, however, that claims with respect to 
breaches  of the representations and warranties of Seller contained in 
_Sections 3.1_, _3.2_ , _3.3_ , _3.4_ , and _4.16_   shall not be subject to
either the Threshold or the Cap.

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-42-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

(b) Any  payments made to Seller or Buyer pursuant to this _Article XII_
shall  constitute an adjustment of the Purchase Price for Tax purposes and
shall be  treated as such by Buyer and Seller on their Tax Returns.

 

 

(c) An  Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under this _Article XII_ for
Damages  resulting from any event relating to a breach of a representation or
warranty  if  the Indemnifying Party can establish that the Indemnified
Party had actual  knowledge on or before the Closing Date of such event.

 

 

(d) Other  than indemnification obligations under the last sentence of
_Section 12.3_ ,  the indemnification obligations of the parties pursuant to
this _Article  XII_ shall be limited to actual Damages and shall not include
incidental,  consequential, indirect, punitive, special or exemplary Damages.

 

 

** Section  12.7. _Indemnification  Despite Negligence_ _._** **IT  IS THE
EXPRESS INTENTION OF THE PARTIES HERETO THAT EACH PARTY TO BE INDEMNIFIED 
PURSUANT TO THIS ARTICLE XII SHALL BE INDEMNIFIED AND HELD HARMLESS FROM AND 
AGAINST ALL DAMAGES AS TO WHICH INDEMNITY IS PROVIDED FOR UNDER THIS ARTICLE 
XII, NOTWITHSTANDING THAT ANY SUCH DAMAGES ARISE OUT OF OR RESULT FROM THE 
ORDINARY, STRICT, SOLE, OR CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE OF SUCH PARTY AND
REGARDLESS  OF WHETHER ANY OTHER PARTY (INCLUDING THE OTHER PARTIES TO THIS
AGREEMENT)  IS OR  IS NOT ALSO NEGLIGENT. THE PARTIES HERETO ACKNOWLEDGE
THAT THE  FOREGOING COMPLIES WITH THE EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE RULE AND IS 
CONSPICUOUS.**

 

 

**ARTICLE  XIII**

 

_TAXES_

 

 

** Section  13.1. _Tax  Returns and Payments_ _._** With  the exception of
income Tax Returns related to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, Buyer  shall control
the preparation of all Tax Returns of the Company and the  Subsidiaries from
and after the Closing Date, provided, however, that Seller  shall have the
right (prior to filing) to review and comment on any such Tax  Return
covering a period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing  Date
(" **Pre-Closing Returns** ") and Buyer shall consider all such  comments in
good faith. Buyer shall prepare such Pre-Closing Returns  in a manner
consistent with past practice. Seller shall pay to the  Buyer prior to the
filing of each such Pre-Closing Return the amount of Tax  with  respect to
such period which relates to the portion of such Pre-Closing Tax  period
ending on or before June 30, 2007 in excess of any reserve for such  Tax 
liability (rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect 
timing differences between book and Tax income) used in the computation of 
Working Capital, as finally adjusted pursuant to _Section 1.3_ (such excess "
**Straddle Period Taxes** "). Such Straddle Period Taxes  shall be calculated
as though the taxable year of the Company and the  Subsidiaries terminated as
of the close of business on June 30, 2007;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in
the case of a Tax not based on income,  receipts, proceeds, profits or
similar items, such Straddle Period Taxes shall  be equal to the amount of
Tax for the taxable period multiplied by a fraction,  the numerator of which
shall be the number of days from the beginning of the  taxable period through
June 30, 2007 and the denominator of which shall be  the  number of days in
the taxable period. Buyer shall not amend any  Pre-Closing Returns

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-43-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

without  the written  consent of Seller, which consent shall not be
unreasonably  withheld. With respect to income Tax Returns related to the 
Pre-Closing Tax Period, Seller shall control the preparation and filing of 
all  such Tax Returns provided, however, that Buyer shall have the right
(prior  to  filing) to review and comment on any such Tax Return and Seller
shall consider  all such comments in good faith.

 

 

** Section  13.2. _Cooperation_ _._** 

 

 

(a) Each  party shall provide the other party with such cooperation and
information as  it  reasonably may request with respect to the Company in
filing any Tax Return,  amended Tax Return or claim for refund, determining a
liability for Taxes or  a  right to a refund of Taxes or participating in or
conducting any audit or other  proceeding in respect of Taxes. Each party
shall bear its own  expenses in complying with the foregoing provisions.

 

 

(b) Buyer  and Seller further agree, upon request, to use their reasonable
efforts to  obtain any certificate or other document from any governmental
authority or  any  other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or
eliminate any Tax that  could be imposed (including, but not limited to, with
respect to the  transactions contemplated hereby).

 

 

** Section  13.3. _Sales and  Use Taxes_ _._**  Buyer  and  Seller shall
each be responsible for the payment of one-half of any sales or  use,
transfer or other Taxes due as a result of the transactions contemplated 
in  this Agreement. The parties will cooperate in obtaining any  exemptions
from any sales or use or other transfer Taxes that may be due as  a  result
of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement.

 

 

** Section  13.4. _Intended  Income Tax Treatment of Transaction._** Prior 
to the Closing, the parties intend that (i) the Company will become a 
disregarded entity for United States federal Tax purposes and under 
corresponding state income Tax laws, (ii) PEP Holding will become a
disregarded  entity for United States federal Tax purposes and under
corresponding state  income Tax laws or will be merged into the Company,
(iii) each of PEP Partners  and PEP Operating Company will become a
disregarded entity for United States  federal Tax purposes and under
corresponding state income Tax laws, or will  be  merged into the Company or
into PEP Texas, and (iv) PEP Texas will become a  disregarded entity for
United States federal Tax purposes and under  corresponding state income Tax
laws or will be merged into either PEP Partners,  PEP Operating Company, PEP
Holding or the Company. Accordingly, the parties  intend that for United
States federal Tax purposes and for relevant state income  Tax purposes, (i)
the Company and each of its Subsidiaries that is  classified as a corporation
for United States federal Tax purposes will be  treated as completely
liquidating in a nontaxable transaction pursuant to  Sections 332 and 337 of
the Code, (ii) the purchase and sale hereunder of  the membership interest in
the Company as a single-member limited liability  company will be treated as
a taxable sale (except to the extent  Section 1031 of the Code applies) by
Seller of the assets of the Company  and its Subsidiaries to Buyer, and a
purchase of such assets by Buyer from  Seller, for the Final Purchase Price
and the assumption of liabilities of the  Company, and (iii) this Agreement
is a plan of complete liquidation of the  Company and each of its
Subsidiaries that is classified as a corporation for  United States federal
Tax purposes pursuant to Section 332 of the Code. The  parties agree not to
take any position inconsistent with such intended Tax  consequences,
including any action that would cause any of the Company (or  any  of its
Subsidiaries that is converted into a limited liability company) to  become
taxable as a corporation or to  reincorporate **.**

**Section  13.5. _Like Kind  Exchange_.** Each  of  the Buyer and Seller
shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably  requested by the
other Party, in connection with enabling the transactions  contemplated
herein to qualify in whole or in part as a "like kind" exchange  pursuant to
Section 1031 of the Code and any corresponding state income Tax  provision,
including identification of the situs of replacement property for  state
income Tax purposes. The Party requesting the other Party's  cooperation with
a like-kind exchange agrees to reimburse and indemnify such  other Party
against any and all reasonable costs and expenses such other Party  shall
incur with respect to cooperating with the requesting Party in enabling  the
transactions contemplated herein to qualify in whole or in part as a  like-
kind exchange under Section 1031 of the Code. The requesting  Party shall
provide such reimbursement and indemnification within ten (10)  days  of
request for such payment.

 

 

** Section  13.6. _Allocation  of Adjusted Purchase Price._** Within  one
hundred and fifty (150) days following the Closing Date, Buyer and Seller 
shall negotiate with a view to completing the drafting of a schedule that 
allocates the Adjusted Purchase Price and the liabilities of the Company and 
the  Subsidiaries among the assets of the Company and the  Subsidiaries.
Such allocation schedule shall be reasonable, shall be  consistent with
_Exhibit 9.1(c)_ and shall be prepared in accordance  with Section 1060 of
the Code. Buyer and Seller shall endeavor in  good faith to resolve any
disagreement in connection with the negotiation and  drafting of a proposed
allocation schedule, but if unable to resolve such  disagreement, Buyer and
Seller shall each use its own allocation  schedule. Provided that Buyer and
Seller are able to agree on such an  allocation schedule within one hundred
and fifty (150) days following the  Closing Date, Buyer and Seller each
agrees to file Internal Revenue Service  Form 8594, and all federal, state,
local and foreign Tax Returns, in  accordance with such allocation schedule
and further agrees to provide the  other  party promptly with any other
information required to complete  Form 8594.

** Section  14.2. _Entire  Agreement._** This  Agreement, the Disclosure
Schedule, together with the Schedules, Exhibits,  and  other writings
referred to herein or delivered pursuant hereto, constitute  the  entire
agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter 
hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written 
and  oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter  hereof.
Each of the parties acknowledges that no other party, nor any  agent or
attorney of any other party, has made any promise, representation  or 
warranty whatsoever not contained herein, and that such party has not
executed  or authorized the execution of this Agreement in reliance upon any
such promise,  representation or warranty not contained herein.

 

 

** Section  14.3. _Binding  Effect; Assignment; No Third Party Benefit._**
This  Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto  and their respective heirs, legal representatives, successors, and
permitted  assigns. Each of the Seller and Buyer may assign either this 
Agreement or any of their rights, interests or obligations  hereunder

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-46-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

without  the prior  written approval of the other Party to a qualified
intermediary and/or a  qualified exchange accommodation titleholder (as that
term is defined in Revenue  Procedure 2000-37) in connection with any
transaction described in _Section  13.5_ ; _provided,_ _however_ , that no
such assignment shall relieve  the other Party from any of its obligations or
liabilities under this Agreement.  Except as otherwise expressly provided in
this Agreement, neither this Agreement  nor any of the rights, interests, or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned  by  any of the parties hereto
without the prior written consent of the other  parties. Except as provided
in _Section 9.6_ and  _Article XII_, nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is  intended to or shall confer upon any Person other than the
parties hereto,  and  their respective heirs, legal representatives,
successors, and permitted  assigns, any rights, benefits, or remedies of any
nature whatsoever under or  by  reason of this Agreement.

 

 

** Section  14.4. _Severability._** If  any  provision of this Agreement is
held to be unenforceable, this Agreement shall  be  considered divisible and
such provision shall be deemed inoperative to the  extent it is deemed
unenforceable, and in all other respects this Agreement  shall remain in full
force and effect; provided, however, that if any such  provision may be made
enforceable by limitation thereof, then such provision  shall be deemed to be
so limited and shall be enforceable to the maximum extent  permitted by
Applicable Law.

 

 

** Section  14.5. _GOVERNING  LAW._** ** THIS  AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED
BY AND CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH  THE  INTERNAL LAWS OF THE
STATE OF TEXAS, WITHOUT REGARD TO THE PRINCIPLES OF  CONFLICTS OF LAWS
THEREOF.**

 

 

** Section  14.6. _Further  Assurances._** From  time to time following the
Closing, at the request of any party hereto and  without further
consideration, the other party or parties hereto shall execute  and deliver
to such requesting party such instruments and documents and take  such other
action (but without incurring any material financial obligation)  as  such
requesting party may reasonably request in order to consummate more fully 
and effectively the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the  parties
hereto shall afford, and shall request their respective corporate  parents to
afford, to each other on a reasonable basis access to their  respective
personnel, and books and records relating to the Company (excluding  books
and records which may not be disclosed pursuant to confidentiality 
agreements with third parties or which are subject to an attorney-client, 
attorney-work product, or other privilege), in each case to the extent such 
access is reasonably necessary to permit each other as necessary to (i)
prepare  Tax Returns, (ii) prosecute claims against third parties, (iii)
investigate,  defend against, or otherwise oppose any pending or threatened
claim against  any  party or any of such party's Affiliates (excluding a
claim asserted by a party  against the other party or any of its Affiliates),
or (iv) comply with any  Applicable Law. Neither party shall make, or be
deemed to have made,  any representation or warranty whatsoever with respect
to any books and records  or access to personnel furnished pursuant to this
_Section  14.6_. The party affording access to its personnel, books or 
records shall be reimbursed by the requesting party for its reasonable  out-
of-pocket expenses attributable to affording such access, and, to the extent 
that providing any such access shall require any material effort or internal 
expense, the parties shall agree upon reasonable compensation therefor, but 
the  party affording access shall not be entitled to charge or collect any
other  fee.

 

 

** Section  14.7. _Counterparts._** This  instrument may be executed in any
number of identical counterparts, each of  which for all purposes shall be
deemed an original, and all of

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-47-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

which  shall  constitute collectively, one instrument. It is not necessary
that  each party hereto execute the same counterpart so long as identical
counterparts  are executed by each such party hereto. This instrument may
be  validly executed and delivered by facsimile or other electronic 
transmission.

 

 

** Section  14.8. _Injunctive  Relief._** The  parties hereto acknowledge
and agree that irreparable damage would occur in  the  event any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance  with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is  accordingly agreed that the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction or  injunctions to prevent
breaches of the provisions of this Agreement, and shall  be entitled to
enforce specifically the provisions of this Agreement, in any  court of the
United States or any state thereof having jurisdiction, in addition  to any
other remedy to which the parties may be entitled under this Agreement  or 
at law or in equity.

 

 

** Section  14.9. _Disclosure  Schedule_**. Nothing  in the Disclosure
Schedule is intended to broaden the scope of any  representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement or to create any covenant  unless clearly
specified to the contrary herein. Any disclosure in  one section of the
Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be disclosed in all  sections of the
Disclosure Schedule and under this  Agreement. Inclusion of any item in the
Disclosure Schedule (a) does  not represent a determination that such item is
material nor shall it be deemed  to establish a standard of materiality, (b)
does not represent a determination  that such item did not arise in the
