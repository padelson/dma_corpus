consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the parties hereto
agree as follows:   ARTICLE I   THE MERGER   Section 1.1 The Merger.
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and
in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL, Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time. Following the Merger,

subject to the conditions set forth in Article VII of this Agreement, the
parties hereto shall file a Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware in accordance with the applicable provisions of the
DGCL (the "Certificate of Merger"). The parties hereto shall make all other
filings, recordings or publications required by the DGCL in connection with
the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at the time specified in the
Certificate of Merger, which specified time shall be a time on the Closing
Date (the time at which the Merger becomes effective being the "Effective
Time").   Section 1.4 Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have
the effects set forth in section 259 of the DGCL.   Section 1.5 Charter and
Bylaws.    2    (a) Immediately after the Effective Time,

shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended as provided by law and such certificate of incorporation
of the Surviving Corporation.   (b) Immediately after the Effective Time,
the bylaws of Surviving Corporation shall be as set forth in Exhibit D to
this Agreement, and such bylaws shall be the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by law and such bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation.   Section 1.6 Directors. The directors of Merger
Sub at the Effective Time shall be the only directors of the Surviving
Corporation until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be. In
furtherance thereof, the Company shall secure, effective at the Effective
Time of the Merger, such resignations, as directors, of its incumbent
directors, and the Company shall take all other actions available to the
Company to cause designees of Parent to be elected or appointed as directors
of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time.   Section 1.7 Officers.
The officers of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall be the only officers
of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their resignation or
removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified,
as the case may be.   ARTICLE II   CONVERSION OF SHARES   Section 2.1
Conversion of Shares.   (a) Treatment of Common Stock. Subject to
the limitations in this Agreement, each share of Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares
of Common Stock to be cancelled pursuant to Section 2.1(c) and Dissenting
Shares (as defined below)) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and extinguished and
automatically converted into the right to receive an amount of cash equal to
the Common Stock Merger Consideration, as adjusted pursuant to Section
2.1(e), without interest, and subject to any escrow, set off, deduction or
indemnification contemplated herein. At the Effective Time, all such shares
of Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Common Stock (the "Common Stock
Certificates") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the Common Stock Merger Consideration.    3    (b)
Treatment of Preferred Stock. Subject to the limitations in this Agreement,
(i) (x) each share of Series A Preferred Stock, issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares, if
any), shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the holder thereof be cancelled and extinguished and automatically converted
into the right to receive the Series A Merger Consideration, with the amount
exceeding $0.4658 being adjusted pursuant to Section 2.1(e), without
interest, and (y) with the full amount being subject to any escrow, set off,
deduction or indemnification contemplated herein; (ii) (x) each share of
Series B Preferred Stock, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares, if any), shall, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof be
cancelled and extinguished and automatically converted into the right
to receive the Series B Merger Consideration, with the amount exceeding
$0.5774168 being adjusted pursuant to Section 2.1(e), without interest, and
(y) with the full amount being subject to any escrow, set off, deduction or
indemnification contemplated herein; (iii) (x) each share of Series C
Preferred Stock, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than Dissenting Shares, if any), shall, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the holder thereof be cancelled and
extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive the Series
C Merger Consideration, with the amount exceeding $0.64 being adjusted
pursuant to Section 2.1(e), without interest, and (y) with the full amount
being subject to any escrow, set off, deduction or indemnification
contemplated herein (together with the Common Stock Merger Consideration, the
Series A Merger Consideration and Series B Merger Consideration, the "Merger
Consideration"). At the Effective Time, all shares of Preferred Stock shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate or certificates which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock (together with the Common Stock Certificates, the
"Certificates") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration.   (c)
Cancellation of Capital Stock Owned by Company. Each share of Capital Stock
that is owned by the Company or any direct or indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
automatically cancelled and extinguished, and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.   (d) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each
share of common stock, $0.01 par value, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and exchanged
for one (1) validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation. Each stock certificate of Merger Sub
evidencing ownership of any such shares shall evidence ownership of such
shares of Common Stock of the Surviving Corporation.   (e) Adjustments. The
per share Merger Consideration (i) shall be adjusted to reflect the full
effect of any stock split, reverse split, stock dividend (including any
dividend or distribution or distribution of securities convertible into
Capital Stock), reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with
respect to Capital Stock that occurs or    4   has a record date after
the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) shall be reduced to
give effect to any inaccuracy of the representations and warranties of the
Company set forth in Sections 3.2 hereof.   Section 2.2 Options.   (a) At
the Effective Time, each outstanding stock option, stock equivalent right or
right to acquire shares of Common Stock, to the extent unexercised (each, an
"Option"), issued under the Stock Plan, whether or not then vested, shall be
assumed by Parent in accordance with the Stock Plan, and immediately
converted into an option to purchase that number of shares of Parent Common
Stock equal to (i) the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (ii) the Option
Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share, at a price per share
of Parent Common Stock equal to (x) the per share exercise price of the
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, divided by (y) the Option
Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest tenth of a cent. Each Option so
assumed and converted shall continue to have and be subject to terms
and conditions (including vesting schedule and repurchase rights) as are
currently applicable to each such Option. As soon as reasonably practicable
following the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to each holder of an
Option an appropriate notice setting forth the terms of such assumption and
conversion. With respect to any Option that is an incentive stock option
(within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "Code")) immediately prior to the Effective Time, but in no
event later than fifteen (15) business days after the Effective Time, such
assumption shall, to the extent reasonably practicable, conform to the
requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code. "Option Exchange Ratio" means the
quotient determined by dividing the Common Stock Merger Consideration payable
for one (1) share of Common Stock by the average of the closing sale prices
for one (1) share of Parent Common Stock as quoted on the New York Stock
Exchange for the ten (10) consecutive trading days ending on (and including)
the trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date.   (b) Except as may
be otherwise agreed to by Parent and the Company or as otherwise contemplated
or required to effectuate this Section 2.2, (i) no action shall be taken by
the Company prior to the Merger (except as expressly provided in this
Agreement) to accelerate any Option, (ii) the provisions in any Benefit Plan
other than the Stock Plan providing for the issuance or grant of any other
interest in respect of the Capital Stock of the Company shall be deleted or
otherwise terminated as of the Effective Time and (iii) no Person shall have
any right under any Benefit Plan other than the Stock Plan with respect to
equity securities of the Company, Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any
subsidiary thereof.   (c) At or before the Effective Time, the
Company shall provide to Parent such documents, records and other information
as is necessary or appropriate, and cause to be effected any necessary
amendments to the Stock Plan, to give effect to the foregoing provisions of
this Section 2.2.   Section 2.3 Warrants. As of the Effective Time, all
warrants convertible into, or exchangeable for, Securities (the "Warrants")
shall have been exercised or otherwise have    5   expired or
terminated in accordance with the terms of the applicable
governing instrument. Following the Effective Time, no Warrants shall remain
outstanding and no holder of a Warrant shall have the right to receive any
security or other consideration of the Company, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation upon the exercise or conversion of such Warrant.   Section 2.4
Escrow. At the Effective Time, Parent shall withhold the Escrow Amount,
subject to the terms of the Escrow Agreement. Concurrent with the Closing,
Parent, the Stockholder Representative and the Escrow Agent shall enter into
the Escrow Agreement. Within fifteen (15) business days after the Closing
Date, Parent shall cause the Escrow Amount to be deposited with the Escrow
Agent.   Section 2.5 Payment and Surrender of Certificates.   (a) Prior to
the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall designate a bank or trust
company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as Payment Agent in
connection with the Merger (the "Payment Agent"). Subject to the terms of any
restricted stock agreement applicable to any Capital Stock (each a
"Restricted Stock Agreement"), and Sections 2.4 and 2.8 hereof, at or prior
to the Effective Time, Parent will provide to, or cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide to, and shall deposit in trust with, the Payment
Agent, the aggregate Merger Consideration less the Escrow Amount. Until used
for that purpose, the funds shall be invested by the Payment Agent,
as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, in obligations of
or guaranteed by the United States of America or obligations of an agency of
the United States of America which are backed by the full faith and credit of
the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or
P-1 or better by Moody\'s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor\'s
Corporation, or in deposit accounts, certificates of deposit or banker\'s
acceptances of, repurchase or reverse repurchase agreements with, or
Eurodollar time deposits purchased from, commercial banks, each of which has
capital, surplus and undivided profits aggregating more than $500 million
(based on the most recent financial statements of the banks which are then
publicly available at the Securities Exchange Commission or otherwise). All
fees and expenses of the Payment Agent shall be paid by Parent.   Promptly
after the Effective Time, Parent shall instruct the Payment Agent to mail to
each holder of record of Capital Stock a letter of transmittal and
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for such holder\'s portion of the Merger Consideration. Subject to
the terms of any Restricted Stock Agreement and Sections 2.4, 2.6, 2.8 and
2.10 hereof, promptly upon surrender of a Certificate to the Payment Agent,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such
other information as the Payment Agent may reasonably request, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor that
portion of the Merger Consideration, without interest, represented by such
Certificate, less any required Tax withholdings in accordance with Section
2.11 hereof, and the Certificate shall forthwith be cancelled; provided that,
Parent may satisfy such obligation to any such holder, in part, by depositing
a portion of the Merger Consideration to which such holder would otherwise be
entitled, into escrow pursuant to the terms of Section 2.4 and the Escrow
Agreement. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Article II, from and
after the Effective Time each Certificate shall be deemed to represent only
the right to receive its portion of the Merger Consideration determined
pursuant to this Agreement then due and shall not evidence any interest in,
or any    6   right to exercise the rights of a stockholder of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation. If the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a
person other than the one in whose name the Certificate surrendered in
exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that
such Certificate be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate
instrument of transfer) and accompanied by evidence that any applicable stock
transfer taxes and other applicable taxes have been paid or provided for.  
Section 2.6 Termination of Payment Fund. At any time which is more than six
(6) months after the Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the
Payment Agent to deliver to it any funds which had been deposited with the
Payment Agent and have not been disbursed in accordance with this Article II
(including, without limitation, interest and other income received by the
Payment Agent in respect of the funds made available to it), and after the
funds have been delivered to Parent, Stockholders entitled to payment
in accordance with this Article II shall be entitled to look solely to
Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar applicable
laws) for payment of the Merger Consideration upon surrender of the
Certificates held by them, without any interest thereon. Any Merger
Consideration remaining unclaimed as of a date which is immediately prior to
such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any government entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any
person previously entitled thereto.   Section 2.7 No Liability.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article II, none of the
Payment Agent, the Surviving Corporation or any party hereto shall be liable
to any person in respect of any cash delivered to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.   Section 2.8
Dissenting Shares; Appraisal Rights. If Stockholders are entitled to
appraisal rights in connection with the Merger pursuant to Section 262 of the
DGCL, or if Section 2115 of the Corporations Code applies to the Company and
the Stockholders are entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the
Merger pursuant to Chapter 13 of the Corporations Code, any Dissenting Shares
will not be converted into the right to receive a Merger Consideration as
provided in Section 2.1 hereof, but will be entitled to such rights (but only
such rights) as may be determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting
Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or, if applicable, Chapter 13 of
the Corporations Code. The Company will give Parent prompt notice (and in any
case, within one (1) business day) of any demand received by the Company for
appraisal of shares of Capital Stock, and Parent will have the right to
control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demand. Company
agrees that, except with Parent\'s prior written consent, it will not
voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle,
any such demand for appraisal. If any Stockholder fails to make an effective
demand for payment or otherwise loses his status as a holder of Dissenting
Shares, then the appraisal right of such holder shall cease and
such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at the
Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to receive such Merger
Consideration to which such Stockholder would have been entitled pursuant to
Section 2.1, subject to the provisions of this Agreement. "Dissenting Shares"
means any shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock that are outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect to which dissenters\'
rights to obtain payment for such Dissenting Shares in   
7   accordance with the DGCL, or if applicable, Chapter 13 of the
Corporations Code, have been duly and properly exercised and perfected in
connection with the Merger.   Section 2.9 No Further Ownership Rights in
Capital Stock. From and after the Effective Time, no shares of Capital Stock
will be deemed to be outstanding, and holders of Certificates formerly
representing such Capital Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto except as provided herein or by applicable law. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of Company shall be closed and no further
registration or transfer of Capital Stock shall thereafter be made, excepting
for stock issued by the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Payment Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this Article II, subject to Section 2.4 and the
Escrow Agreement.   Section 2.10 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In
the event any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Payment Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact coupled with an
indemnity by the holder thereof, such Merger Consideration as may be required
pursuant to Sections 2.1 and 2.4 hereof; provided, however, that Parent or
the Surviving Corporation may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent
to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Payment Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed.   Section 2.11 Tax Withholding. Parent
or Parent\'s agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration, or other payment otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
or the Escrow Agreement, the amounts required to be deducted and withheld
under the Code, or any provision of any Federal, state, local or foreign tax
law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld, such deducted
and withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to such holder in respect of whom such deduction and
withholding was made.   Section 2.12 Transfer Taxes. In no event shall
Parent or the Surviving Corporation bear any Tax imposed in connection with
any holder\'s receipt of the Merger Consideration, or other payment otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, to which such
holder is entitled.   Section 2.13 Further Assurances. If at any time after
the Effective Time the Surviving Corporation shall determine, in its
sole discretion, or shall be advised, that any deeds, bills of sale,
assignments, instruments, assurances or any other actions or things are
necessary or desirable to consummate the Merger or vest, perfect or confirm
of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or
interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of either of
the Company or Merger Sub acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving
Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger or otherwise to
carry out the purpose and intent of this Agreement, then the officers and
directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of either the Company or Merger Sub, all
such deeds, bills of sale, instruments of conveyance, assignments,   
8   instruments and assurances and to take and do, in the name and on
behalf of each such corporation or otherwise, all such other actions and
things necessary to consummate the Merger and to carry out the purpose and
intent of this Agreement or as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect
or confirm any and all right, title or interest in, to and under such rights,
properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation in each case, to the extent
such action is not inconsistent with this Agreement.   ARTICLE III  
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COMPANY   Except as set forth in the
schedule prepared and signed by an appropriate officer of the Company
delivered to Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement setting forth
specific exceptions to the Company\'s representations and warranties set
forth herein (the "Disclosure Schedule"), the Company represents and warrants
to Parent and Merger Sub as of the date hereof and the Closing Date as set
forth below. Each exception set forth in the Disclosure Schedule is
identified by reference to the specific section or subsection of this
Agreement and relates only to such section or subsection.   Section 3.1
Organization.   (a) The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly
existing and in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize
such concept with respect to such entity) under the laws of the jurisdiction
of its incorporation and has all requisite power and authority to own, lease
and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now
being conducted. The Company is duly qualified or licensed and in good
standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which the property owned,
leased or operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes
such qualification or licensing necessary, except in such other jurisdictions
where the failure to be so duly qualified or licensed and in good standing
would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Company Material Adverse Effect" with respect to the Company
means, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the
business, capitalization, assets, liabilities, properties, results of
operations, prospects or condition (financial or otherwise) of the Company,
or that would prevent or materially alter or delay the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated hereby, in each case other than as a result
of (i) changes generally adversely affecting the economy or the industry in
which the Company currently operates (so long as the Company is not
disproportionately affected thereby), (ii) changes in laws or accounting
principles applicable to the Company, or (iii) acts of war or terrorism (so
long as the Company is not disproportionately affected thereby). The Company
has heretofore delivered to Parent accurate and complete copies of the
Company\'s Certificate of Incorporation (the "Charter") and Bylaws as
currently in effect.   (b) The Company has no Subsidiaries. The
Company does not own directly or indirectly, any Capital Stock or other
equity securities of any corporation or have any direct or indirect equity
or ownership investment or interest in any business.    9    Section
3.2 Capitalization.   (a) As of the date hereof, the authorized
Capital Stock of the Company consists of (i) 75,000,000 shares of Common
Stock, of which 10,358,600 shares were issued and outstanding, (ii)

designated Series B Preferred Stock, 20,782,214 shares of which are issued
and outstanding as of the date hereof, and (C) 24,546,900 shares have been
designated Series C Preferred Stock, 23,437,499 shares of which are issued
and outstanding. As of the date hereof, (i) no shares of Common Stock or
Preferred Stock are issued and held in the treasury of the Company, (ii) no
shares of Common Stock are reserved for issuance pursuant to outstanding

(v) 894,532 shares of Series C Preferred Stock are reserved for issuance
pursuant to outstanding Warrants, (vi) 5,603,573 shares of Common Stock are
reserved for issuance pursuant to outstanding Options and (vii) options to
purchase 118,441 shares remain eligible for issuance pursuant to the Stock

above, 306,438 are subject to repurchase rights without acceleration in
connection with the Merger, and 23,334 are subject to repurchase rights with
acceleration in connection with the Merger. All of the outstanding shares of
Capital Stock are, and all shares of Capital Stock which may be issued
pursuant to the exercise of outstanding Options and Warrants will be, when
issued in accordance with the respective terms thereof, duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, in compliance with all
applicable laws. The rights, preferences and privileges of the Preferred
Stock are as set forth in the Charter. Since the date of the filing of the
Charter, there have not occurred any events that would cause any adjustment
or readjustment in the applicable conversion prices of such Preferred Stock.
Section 3.2(a) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete list
of all holders of Securities as of the date of this Agreement with the name,
number of and type of Securities held and, where applicable, the number,
exercise or repurchase price, vesting or repurchase schedule and acceleration
provisions applicable to such Security.   (b) Immediately prior to the
Effective Time, the authorized, issued and outstanding Capital Stock of the
Company shall be identical to that in clause (a) above except (i) the number
of outstanding shares of Common Stock may be increased upon the exercise of
currently outstanding Options that are or will vest prior to the Effective
Time in accordance with their terms on the date hereof; provided that, the
number of outstanding shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance pursuant
to Options decreases by the same number, (ii) the number of shares of Series

of the Company to which Parent consents in advance in writing pursuant to

true and complete list of all holders of Securities as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time with the name, number of and type of Securities held
and, where applicable, the number, exercise or repurchase price, vesting or
repurchase schedule and acceleration provisions applicable to such
Security.   (c) No Security will by its terms require an adjustment in
connection with the Merger. Neither the consummation of transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, nor any action taken or to be taken by the
Company in connection with such transactions, will result in (x) any
acceleration of exercisability or vesting, whether or not contingent on
the occurrence of any event on or after consummation of the Merger, in favor
of any Security, (y) any additional benefits for any optionee under any
Security, or (z) the inability of Parent after the Effective Time to exercise
any right or benefit held by the Company prior to the Effective Time with
respect to any Security assumed by Parent or any shares of Common Stock
previously issued upon exercise of a Security. The assumption by Parent of
Options in accordance with Section 2.2 hereof will not give rise to any event
described in clauses (x) through (z) in the immediately preceding sentence or
constitute a breach of the Stock Plan or any agreement entered into pursuant
to such plan.   (d) Except as set forth in this Section 3.2, (i) there are
no shares of Capital Stock of the Company authorized, issued or outstanding;
(ii) there are no existing options, warrants, calls, preemptive rights,
indebtedness having general voting rights or debt convertible into securities
having such rights ("Voting Debt") or subscriptions or other
rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments of any character, relating to
the issued or unissued Capital Stock of the Company obligating the Company
to issue, transfer or sell or cause to be issued, transferred or sold any
shares of Capital Stock or Voting Debt of, or other equity interest in, the
Company or securities convertible into or exchangeable for such shares or
equity interests, or obligating the Company to grant, extend or enter into
any such option, warrant, call, subscription or other right, agreement,
arrangement or commitment and (iii) there are no outstanding contractual
obligations of the Company to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any
shares, or the Capital Stock of the Company or to provide funds to make any
investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in any
other entity. Except as set forth in Section 3.2(a) hereof, the Company has
issued no shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock, other than (x) shares of
Common Stock issued on the exercise of Options or Warrants outstanding prior
to the date hereof or (y) shares of Capital Stock issued after the date
hereof to which Parent consents in advance in writing pursuant to Section 5.1
hereof.   (e) There are no voting trusts or other agreements or
understandings to which the Company is a party with respect to the voting
of the Capital Stock of the Company.   (f) Following the Effective Time, no
person will have any right to receive Securities of the Surviving Corporation
upon exercise of Securities or otherwise.    11    (g) No Indebtedness
of the Company contains any restriction upon (i) the prepayment of any of
such Indebtedness, (ii) the incurrence of Indebtedness by the Company, or
(iii) the ability of the Company to grant any lien on its properties or
assets. For purposes of this Agreement, "Indebtedness" shall mean (i) all

amount thereof, any accrued interest thereon and any prepayment premiums or
fees or termination fees with respect thereto and shall specifically exclude
trade payables and accruals incurred in the ordinary course of business.

or by which it or any of its properties or assets may be bound or   
12   (iii) violate any order, writ, injunction, decree, statute, rule or
regulation applicable to the Company, or its properties or assets.  
Section 3.5 Financial Statements.   (a) The Company has previously provided

the audited financial statements, the notes thereto (together, the "Financial

accountants. The Financial Statements are true and correct in all material
respects and fairly present, in accordance with United States generally
accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") consistently applied, the financial
position of the Company as of such dates and its results of operations and
cash flows for such fiscal periods except, in the case of such unaudited
statements, for normal recurring year end adjustments which adjustments will

footnotes.   (b) The Company maintains a system of internal accounting
controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that (i) transactions are
executed in accordance with management\'s general or specific authorizations;
(ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles and to maintain asset accountability; and (iii) access to assets
is permitted only in accordance with management\'s general and
specific authorization. Since January 1, 2002, neither the Company nor, to

accountant or representative of the Company has received or otherwise become
aware of any complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or
oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures,
methodologies or methods of the Company or of its internal controls over
financial reporting, including any complaint, allegation, assertion or claim
that the Company has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing
practices. There have been no instances of fraud, whether or not material,
that occurred during any period covered by the Financial Statements involving
the management of the Company or other employees or consultants of the
Company who have a role in preparation of the Financial Statements.   (c)

party or subject to the provisions of any order or decree of any Governmental
Entity. There is no action, suit, proceeding, arbitration or investigation

allocation agreement, Tax indemnification agreement, agreement where
liability is determined by reference to the Tax liability of a third party,

Disclosure Schedule contains a true, complete and correct list of each
employee benefit plan (including, without limitation, any "employee benefit
plan," as defined in section 3(3) of ERISA), and any employment, change of
control, bonus, pension, profit sharing, retirement, deferred compensation,
incentive compensation, stock ownership, stock purchase, stock option,
phantom stock, vacation, severance, disability, death benefit,
hospitalization, life or other benefits-related insurance, supplemental
unemployment benefits or other plan, program, policy, agreement, arrangement
or material understanding (whether formal or informal or whether or not
legally binding), (i) sponsored, maintained or contributed to or required to
be contributed to by the Company or by any trade or business, whether or
not incorporated (an "ERISA Affiliate"), that together with the Company would
be deemed a "single employer" within the meaning of section 4001(b)(1) ERISA,
for the benefit of    18   any current or former employee, director or
consultant of the Company, or (ii) with respect to which the Company could
have any liability (all the foregoing being herein referred to as "Benefit
Plans"). The Company has made available to Parent a true and correct copy of
all documents related to the Benefit Plans, including but not limited to, (u)
as they exist, the three most recent annual reports or Form 5500 Series
filings if required under ERISA, filed with the Internal Revenue Service (the
"IRS") with respect each Benefit Plan, (v) a copy of each written Benefit
Plan (including all amendments thereto) or a written description of any
Benefit Plan that is not otherwise in writing and the most recent Summary
Plan Description, any Summary of Material Modifications or Form 5500 Series
if required under ERISA, (w) each trust agreement and group annuity contract,
if any, relating to such Benefit Plan, (x) the most recent actuarial report
or valuation relating to each Benefit Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA or
providing post-retirement health and/or life insurance benefits, (y)
a current determination letter received from the Internal Revenue Service
with respect to each Benefit Plan intended to qualify under section 401(a) of
the Code and (z) all contracts relating to the Benefit Plans with respect to
which the Company, or any ERISA Affiliate may have any liability, including,
but not limited to, insurance contracts, investment management agreements,
subscription and participants agreements and record keeping agreements.  
(b) No Benefit Plans are subject to Title IV of ERISA. No event has occurred
and to the Company\'s knowledge, there exists no condition or set of
circumstances which are reasonably likely to occur in connection with which
the Company would be subject to any liability that would have a Company
Material Adverse Effect (except liability for benefits claims and funding
obligations payable in the ordinary course), under ERISA, the Code or any
other applicable law.   (c) With respect to Benefit Plans, in the
aggregate, there are no funded benefit obligations for which contributions
have not been made or properly accrued and there are no unfunded benefit
obligations which have not been accounted for by reserves, or otherwise
properly footnoted in accordance with GAAP in the Financial Statements.  
(d) Each of the Benefit Plans is and has been administered in all material
respects in compliance with its terms and with applicable laws and
regulations, including, but not limited to, ERISA, the Consolidated Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996, the Code and federal and state securities
laws.   (e) Each of the Benefit Plans that is intended to be a qualified
plan within the meaning of section 401(a) of the Code has been determined by
the IRS to be so qualified and nothing has occurred to cause the loss of such
qualified or tax-exempt status, or the Company has applied to the IRS for
such a determination prior to the expiration of the requisite period under
applicable Treasury Regulations or IRS pronouncements in which to apply for
such a determination and to make any amendments necessary to obtain
a favorable determination, or has been established under a standardized
prototype plan for which an IRS opinion letter has been obtained by the plan
sponsor and is valid as to the adopting employer. Each fund   
19   established under a Benefit Plan that is intended to satisfy the
requirements of section 501(c)(9) of the Code has so satisfied such
requirements.   (f) The Company has no obligation for retiree health,

related licenses) granting or restricting any right to use or practice any
rights under any Intellectual Property, whether the Company is the licensee
or licensor thereunder, and any written settlements relating to any

Liens, and the Company is listed in the records of the appropriate United
States, state, or foreign agency as the sole and exclusive owner of record

Section 3.15(e)(i) of the Disclosure Schedule, in each case, do not
infringe upon any Intellectual Property rights owned or controlled by any
third party (either directly or indirectly such as through contributory

suits pending or, to the Company\'s Knowledge, threatened, and the Company
has not received any written notice (or to the Company\'s Knowledge, any oral
notice) of a third party claim or suit (1) alleging that its activities or
the conduct of its businesses infringes upon, violates, or constitutes the
unauthorized use of the Intellectual Property rights of any third party or
(2) challenging the ownership, use, validity or enforceability of any
Intellectual Property owned, used or held for use by the Company in its
business, and there has been no such written claim (or, to the Company\'s

Knowledge, threatened in the past three (3) years against the Company or, to
the Company\'s Knowledge, any other person.   (f) There are no settlements,
forbearances to sue, consents, judgments, or orders or similar obligations
which (i) restrict the Company\'s rights to use any Intellectual Property,
(ii) restrict the Company\'s business in order to accommodate a third

Intellectual Property owned or controlled by the Company. The Company has not
licensed or sublicensed its rights in any material Intellectual Property
other than pursuant to the License Agreements, and no royalties, honoraria or
other fees are payable by the Company for the use of or right to use any
Intellectual Property, except pursuant to the License Agreements. The License
Agreements are valid and binding obligations of all parties thereto,
enforceable in accordance with their terms, and there exists no event or
condition which will result in a violation or breach of, or constitute (with
or without due notice or lapse of time or both) a default by the Company or,
to the Company\'s Knowledge, any other party under any such License
Agreement.   (g) The Company takes reasonable measures to protect the
confidentiality of Trade Secrets, including requiring its employees
and independent contractors having access thereto to execute written non-
disclosure agreements. To the Company\'s Knowledge, no Trade Secret has been
disclosed or authorized to be disclosed to any third party other than
pursuant to a non-disclosure agreement that adequately protects the
Company\'s proprietary interests in and to such Trade Secrets. Neither the
Company nor, to the Company\'s Knowledge, any other party to any non-
disclosure agreement relating to its Trade Secrets is in breach or default
thereof.   (h) No current or former partner, director, officer or employee
of the Company (or any of their respective predecessors in interest) will,
after giving effect to the transactions contemplated herein, own or retain
any rights in or to any of the Intellectual Property owned or, to the
Company\'s Knowledge, used by the Company. Each such current or
former partner, director, officer or employee of the Company who has, in each
case, been involved in the development or modification of any technology
or Intellectual Property owned or purported to be owned by the Company,
has executed a written agreement expressly assigning to the Company all
right, title and interest in any inventions and works of authorship and
all Intellectual Property rights therein.   (i) To the Company\'s
Knowledge, no third party is misappropriating, infringing, diluting, or
violating any Intellectual Property owned by the Company and no such   
22   claims have been brought or threatened against any third party by the
Company in the past six (6) years.   (j) The consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not result in the loss or
impairment of or payment of any additional amounts with respect to, nor
require the consent of any other person in respect of, the Company\'s right
to own, use, or hold for use any of the Intellectual Property as owned, used,
or held for use in the conduct of the business as currently conducted.
Neither this Agreement nor the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
will result in the Company or Parent or any of its Affiliates: (i) granting
to any third party any incremental right to or with respect to any
Intellectual Property owned by, or licensed to, any of them, (ii) being bound
by, or subject to, any incremental non-compete or other incremental
restriction on the operation or scope of their respective business, or (iii)
being obligated to pay any incremental royalties or other amounts, or offer
any incremental discounts, or being bound by any incremental "most favored
pricing" terms to any third party, (iv) attempting to procure from Parent or
any of its affiliates a license grant or covenant not to assert under any
contract. As used in this Section 3.15, an "incremental" right, non-compete,
restriction, royalty, "most favored pricing" term or discount refers to a
right, non-compete, restriction, royalty, "most favored pricing" term or
discount, as applicable, in excess of the rights, non-competes, restrictions,
royalties or discounts payable that would have been required to be offered or

otherwise used by the Company, and identifies which Software is owned,
licensed, leased, or otherwise used, as the case may be. Section 3.15(k) of
the Disclosure Schedule lists all Software sold, licensed, leased or
otherwise distributed by the Company to any third party, and identifies which

Software or the grant of incremental rights to a Person with regard to such
Source Code. No event has occurred, and no circumstance or condition exists,
that (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) will, or would
reasonably be expected to, result in the disclosure or delivery by the
Company or any person acting on its behalf to any person of any Source Code
in such out-licensed Software under any contract, and no material portions of
such Source Code has been disclosed, delivered or licensed to a third party
(other than deposits of Source Code with escrow agents pursuant to escrow
agreements in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices,
which deposits have not been released from escrow). With respect to the
Software set forth in Section 3.15(k) of the Disclosure Schedule which the
Company purports to own, such Software was either developed (i) by employees
of the Company within the scope of their employment, or (ii) by independent
contractors who have assigned their rights to the Company pursuant to written
agreements. In each agreement pursuant to which the Company has licensed its
Software to third parties, the Company has not (i) failed to limit its

rights to copy and to distribute and to sell to any party) all Software
developed by the Company, whether developed for itself (as part of its core
technology or otherwise) or on behalf of any third party.   (m) With
respect to the use of the Software in the conduct of the Company\'s business
as it is currently conducted, (i) no capital expenditures are necessary with

Company has not experienced any material defects in such Software, including
any material error or omission in the processing of any transactions other

Company in the conduct of its business. The Company takes reasonable measures
to ensure that such information is protected against unauthorized access,

reimburse each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation and any employee,
director, officer, affiliate, or agent of each of them (the "Indemnified
Parties") for any demand, claim, payment, obligation, action or cause of
action, assessment, loss, Tax, liability, damages (but excluding exemplary or
punitive damages other than such damages arising in connection with or
relating to patent or trademark laws), cost or expense (including reasonable
attorneys\' fees and expenses) or other damages (collectively, "Damages")
arising or relating to, directly or indirectly, from or in connection with:
(a) any inaccuracy in any of the warranties or representations of the Company
in this Agreement, (b) any matters set forth in Schedule B, attached hereto,
(c) any failure by the Company prior to the Effective Time to perform or

Promptly after receipt by an Indemnified Party under Section 9.1 of notice of
the commencement of any action or demand or claim by a third party (a "Third
Party Claim") which may give rise to Damages, such Indemnified Party shall,
if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party
under such Section, give notice to the Stockholder Representative (as defined
in the Escrow Agreement) of its assertion of such claim for indemnification
and of the commencement of the action of its assertion of such claim for
indemnification and of the commencement of the action or assertion of the
Third Party Claim with respect to which the claim for indemnification
pertains.   Section 9.3 Indemnity Period. No claim for
indemnification under Section 9.1 of this Agreement may be made unless notice
of such claim or related claim is given by the party seeking such
indemnification to the party from whom indemnification is sought on or prior
to the date that is eighteen (18) months following the Effective Time;
provided, however, that the indemnity period for claims for indemnification
from and against Damages arising, directly or indirectly, from or in
connection with (i) any inaccuracy in any of the warranties or
representations of the Company contained in Section 3.2 (Capitalization),
Section 3.3 (Authority Relative to this Agreement), Section 3.12 (Taxes),
Section 3.13 (Employee Benefits), and Section 3.24 (Brokers or Finders;
Merger Expenses), (ii) any willful or intentional misrepresentation by the
Company, (iii) any willful or intentional breach by the Company of
any covenant or agreement of the Company, or (iv) fraud, in each case, shall
be the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.   Section 9.4
Indemnification Basket. The provisions for indemnity contained in Section 9.1
shall become effective only in the event that the aggregate amount of all
indemnifiable damages for which the Stockholders are liable under this
Article IX exceeds $350,000 (the "Indemnification Basket"), and then only for
the amount by which such indemnifiable damages exceed the Indemnification
Basket; provided, however, that the Indemnification Basket shall not apply to
any claim for indemnification from and against Damages arising, directly or
indirectly, from or in connection with (i) any inaccuracy in any of the
warranties or representations of the Company of which with the Company had
knowledge at any time prior to the date on which such warranty or
representation is made, (ii) any willful or intentional misrepresentation by
the Company, (iii) any willful or intentional breach by the Company of any
covenant or agreement of the Company, or (iv) fraud. For purposes of
determining whether the Indemnification Basket has been satisfied with
respect to any breach of the representations and warranties contained in
Article III hereof that are qualified by a materiality or Material Adverse
Effect qualifier or standard, any such representation or warranty so
qualified shall be deemed breached if it is untrue or incorrect, without
giving effect to such materiality or Material Adverse Effect qualifier or
standard.   Section 9.5 Limitation on Indemnity. Following the
Effective Time, the sole recourse of the Indemnified Parties shall be the
Escrow Fund and recovery from the Escrow Amount shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Indemnified Parties; provided, however, that the
preceding limitation in this sentence shall not apply to or otherwise limit
any claim for indemnification from and against Damages arising, directly or
indirectly, from or in connection with (i) any inaccuracy in any of the
warranties or representations of the Company of which with the Company had
knowledge at any time prior to the date on which such warranty or
representation is made, (ii) any inaccuracy in any of the warranties or
representations of the    45   Company contained in Section 3.2
(Capitalization), Section 3.3 (Authority Relative to this Agreement), Section
3.12 (Taxes), Section 3.13 (Employee Benefits), and Section 3.24 (Brokers or
Finders; Merger Expenses), (iii) any willful or intentional misrepresentation
by the Company, (iv) any willful or intentional breach by the Company of any
covenant or agreement of the Company, or (v) fraud; provided, further, that
no Stockholder, other than a Stockholder that has committed or participated
in an act of fraud, shall be liable for indemnification obligations pursuant
to clause (v) of this Section 9.5 in an amount that exceeds such
Stockholder\'s pro rata portion of the Merger Consideration; provided, also,
that one-half of the then remaining amounts in the Escrow Fund not then
subject to a claim for indemnification shall be released on September 1,
2007. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent, and only to the extent,
there are available amounts in the Escrow Fund not subject to an unresolved
claim for indemnification or a resolved but unsatisfied claim for
indemnification, the Indemnified Parties shall attempt to recover first from
the Escrow Fund before seeking recovery from the Stockholders.   Section
9.6 The Stockholder Representative.   (a) The Stockholders will authorize,
designate and appoint, as part of their approval and adoption of this

Representative to act as the sole and exclusive agent, attorney-in-fact and
representative of each of the Stockholders by the consent of the Stockholders
and as such is hereby authorized and directed to (i) take any and all actions
(including without limitation executing and delivering any documents,
incurring any costs and expenses for the account of the Stockholders and
making any and all determinations required by this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement) which may be required in carrying out his duties under this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, (ii) exercise such other rights, power and
authority as are authorized, delegated and granted to the Stockholder
Representative under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and (iii) exercise
such rights, power and authority as are incidental to the foregoing. Any such
actions taken, exercises of rights, power or authority, and any decision or
determination made by the Stockholder Representative consistent therewith
shall be absolutely and irrevocably binding on each Stockholder as if such
Stockholder personally had taken such action, exercised such rights, power or
authority or made such decision or determination in such Stockholder\'s
individual capacity.   (b) The Stockholder Representative shall have
no duties towards the Stockholders, and shall not incur any liability to
the Stockholders, and the Stockholders shall have no claims, including those
that may arise in the future, against the Stockholder Representative for any
action or inaction taken or not taken by him in connection with his service
as the Stockholder Representative, except to the extent that such action or
inaction shall have been held by a court of competent jurisdiction to
constitute willful misconduct. The Stockholders shall severally indemnify and
hold the Stockholder Representative harmless against any loss, liability or
expense incurred without gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the
Stockholder Representative and arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance or administration of his duties hereunder, including the
reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel retained by the
Stockholders\' Agent ("Stockholder Representative Expenses"). Following the
termination date of the escrow, the resolution of all unresolved claims and
the satisfaction of all claims made by Indemnified Parties for Damages, the
Stockholder Representative shall have the right to recover Stockholder
Representative Expenses from the Escrow Fund prior to any distribution to the
Stockholders, and prior to any such distribution, shall deliver to the Escrow
Agent a certificate setting forth the Stockholder Representative Expenses
actually incurred.    46    (c) The Stockholder Representative shall
have reasonable access to information about the Surviving Corporation and
the reasonable assistance of Surviving Corporation\'s executive officer for
purposes of performing his duties and exercising his rights hereunder;
provided that the Stockholder Representative shall treat confidentially and
not disclose any nonpublic information from or about Surviving Corporation or
the Parent to anyone (except on a need to know basis to individuals who agree
in writing to treat such information confidentially); provided, further that
such access and assistance shall not interfere with or adversely affect the
Surviving Corporation\'s business.   Section 9.7 Actions of the Stockholder
Representative. A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder
Representative shall constitute a decision of all Stockholders and shall be
final, binding and conclusive upon each such Stockholder. The Escrow Agent
and Parent may rely upon any decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Stockholder Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction
of each and every such Stockholder. The Escrow Agent and the Parent are
hereby relieved from any liability to any person for any acts done by them in
accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder
Representative.   Section 9.8 No Right of Contribution. No Stockholder
shall have any right of contribution against the Company or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to any breach by the Company of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements. Each Stockholder
irrevocably grants, transfers and assigns to the Company, its right to sue
all other Stockholders for claims arising, directly or indirectly, from or in
connection with, any act of fraud for which, and to the extent that, such
Stockholder\'s maximum liability pursuant to Section 9.5 hereof, is less than
the amount of Damages claimed by an Indemnified Party.   Section 9.9 FIRPTA
Certificate. At or prior to Closing, the Company shall have delivered to
Parent a form of notice to the Internal Revenue Service in accordance with
the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.897-2(h)(2) in

AGREEMENT  ----------------   This ESCROW AGREEMENT (this "Agreement," or
"Escrow Agreement"), dated as of September ___, 2006, by and among EMULEX
CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), Steven F. Foster, as
Stockholder Representative, as defined below, and U.S. Bank National
Association, a national banking association, as escrow agent (the "Escrow
Agent"). Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement and not otherwise
defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Merger
Agreement (as defined below).    A. SIERRA LOGIC, INC., a Delaware
corporation (the "Company"), Parent, SHASTA ACQUISITION CORP., a Delaware
corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and the
Stockholder Representative have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger,
dated of even date herewith (the "Merger Agreement"), a copy of which is
attached hereto, pursuant to which Merger Sub will be merged with and into
the Company (the "Merger"), with the Company remaining as the surviving
corporation in the Merger.    B. Section 2.4 of the Merger Agreement
provides that within fifteen (15) business days after the Effective Time,
subject to Section 2.8 of the Merger Agreement with respect to Dissenting
Shares for which dissenters\' rights shall have been withdrawn or lost,
Parent will deposit in escrow (such deposit constituting the "Escrow Fund")
cash in the amount of fifteen percent (15%) of the aggregate Merger
Consideration (the "Escrow Amount"). The Escrow Amount shall be withheld from
each Stockholder (other than Stockholders holding Dissenting Shares) on a pro
rata basis (based upon the aggregate amount of the Merger Consideration that
each Stockholder is entitled to receive pursuant to Article II of the Merger
Agreement in respect of such holder\'s Capital Stock (other than Dissenting
Shares, if any) relative to the aggregate amount of the Merger Consideration
that all Stockholders are entitled to receive in respect of all Capital Stock
(other than Dissenting Shares, if any) as set forth in Appendix I) (such pro
rata amount, the Stockholder\'s "Pro Rata Share").    C. Steven F. Foster
has been elected by stockholders subject to the Escrow Agreement to act as
the sole and exclusive agent, attorney-in-fact and representative of
Stockholders to exercise the rights, powers and authority granted herein
("Stockholder Representative").    D. The parties to this Agreement desire
to establish the terms and conditions pursuant to which the Escrow Amount
will be deposited into, held in, and disbursed from the Escrow Fund.   
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:   70    1. Escrow.  
(a) Escrow Fund. The Escrow Agent agrees to accept delivery of the Escrow
Amount and hold such Escrow Amount as part of the Escrow Fund as collateral
for the indemnification obligations set forth in Article IX of the Merger
Agreement until the Escrow Agent is required to release the Escrow Property
(as defined below) pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the Merger
Agreement. For the purposes of this Agreement, subject to Section 4 hereof,
"Initial Termination Date" shall mean September 1, 2007 and "Termination
Date" shall mean the date and time which is eighteen (18) months following
the Effective Time. With its deposit of the Escrow Amount, Parent shall
deliver to the Escrow Agent a certificate setting forth the Closing Date and
the Effective Time.   (b) Indemnification. For purposes of this
Agreement, references to Parent will include all other Indemnified Parties,
as applicable. It is hereby agreed that the Escrow Fund will serve as
security for any Damages as set forth in Article IX of the Merger
Agreement.   2. Deposit of Escrow Amount: Release from Escrow.   (a)
Delivery of Escrow Amount. Parent shall deposit the Escrow Amount into the
Escrow Account with the Escrow Agent within fifteen (15) business days after
the Closing Date. The Escrow Agent may assume without inquiry that the Escrow
Amount deposited with it has been correctly calculated in accordance with the
requirements of the Merger Agreement and that no additional funds, other than
income earned with respect to the Escrow Amount, are required by the Merger
Agreement or this Agreement to be held by the Escrow Agent.   (b)
Confirmation of Deposit. The Escrow Agent shall provide to each of Parent and
the Stockholder Representative written confirmation promptly upon receipt of
the deposit made pursuant to Section 2(a) above.   (c) Stockholders\'
Accounts. The Escrow Agent will maintain for each Stockholder a spreadsheet
accounting record (each, an "Account") specifying the portion of the Escrow
Amount held for the record of each Stockholder pursuant to this Agreement.
The Escrow Amount received under Section 2(a) will be allocated to each
Stockholder\'s Account in accordance with such Stockholder\'s Pro Rata Share
in the Escrow Fund.   (d) Rights of Ownership. Any income received by
the Escrow Agent with respect to the Escrow Amount, while such Escrow Amount
is held in escrow under this Agreement shall be held in escrow in the same
manner as the Escrow Amount relating thereto, and shall collectively, with
the Escrow Amount, be considered to be "Escrow Property".   (e) Investment
of Escrow Property. The Escrow Agent shall hold the Escrow Property in escrow
and shall invest the Escrow Property and any interest or income thereon only
in the Escrow Agent\'s Insured Money Market Account as described in Appendix
II hereto ("IMMA"). As and when any portion of the Escrow Property and any
interest or income thereon is to be released under this Agreement, the Escrow
Agent shall not be liable for any loss of principal or income in connection
therewith unless such loss results from or arises in   71   connection
with the Escrow Agent\'s gross negligence, willful misconduct or breach of
this Agreement. All interest attributable to the Escrow Property shall be
added to and be part of, and any loss shall be charged to, the
Escrow Property for all purposes hereunder. At the time of delivery to
Stockholders of any of the Escrow Property that is distributable to
Stockholders hereunder, the Escrow Agent shall deliver to such Stockholders
any accrued but unpaid interest or other earnings on such amount of the
Escrow Property distributable to Stockholders hereunder (but not any accrued
and unpaid interest or other earnings on such amount of the Escrow Property
that is distributable to Parent hereunder, which shall instead be delivered
to Parent (the "Parent Escrow Earnings Amount")).   (f) Distribution to
Stockholders. Subject to Section 4 hereof with respect to the Merger
Consideration, (i) promptly after the Initial Termination Date, the Escrow
Agent will release from escrow to the Stockholders their Pro Rata Share of
(x) one-half of the Escrow Property less (y) (A) any Escrow Property
delivered to Parent in accordance with Section 4 hereof in satisfaction of
Claims, (B) any Escrow Property subject to delivery to Parent in accordance
with Section 4 hereof with respect to any then resolved but unsatisfied
Claims, and (C) any Escrow Property subject to any then pending
but unresolved Claims and (ii) promptly after the Termination Date, the
Escrow Agent will release from escrow to the Stockholders their Pro Rata
Share of the (x) remaining Escrow Property less (y)(A) any Escrow Property
delivered to Parent in accordance with Section 4 hereof in satisfaction of
Claims, (B) any Escrow Property subject to delivery to Parent in accordance
with Section 4 hereof with respect to any then resolved but unsatisfied
Claims, and (C) any Escrow Property subject to any then pending but
unresolved Claims. Any Escrow Property held as a result of clauses (i)(y)(C)
and (ii)(y)(C) above will be released to the Stockholders or released to
Parent (as appropriate) promptly upon resolution of each specific Claim
involved. All payments of Escrow Property to Stockholders shall be made by
check and in accordance with the payment provided by Stockholders on their
respective Letter of Transmittal which shall be delivered to the Escrow Agent
by Parent from time to time as and when received by Parent. Any Escrow
Property remaining in the Escrow Fund for which a Letter of Transmittal shall
not have been received by the Escrow Agent by the Termination Date shall be
released to Parent.   (g) Release. The Escrow Property will be held by
the Escrow Agent until required to be released to the Stockholders pursuant
to Section 2(f) above or to Parent in satisfaction of any Claims made by
Parent in accordance with Section 4 below. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, the Escrow Agent is authorized and directed to deliver any
or all of the Escrow Fund as directed from time to time in joint written
instructions signed by or on behalf of Parent and the Stockholder
Representative. Escrow Property shall be released to the respective
Stockholders in accordance with their respective Accounts.   (h) No
Encumbrance. No Escrow Property or any beneficial interest in the Escrow
Property may be pledged, sold, assigned, transferred, or otherwise
encumbered, including, without limitation, by operation of law, by
a Stockholder or be taken or reached by any legal or equitable process
in satisfaction of any debt or other liability of a Stockholder, prior to
the delivery to such Stockholder of such Stockholder\'s portion of the
Escrow Property by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the Merger Agreement.   72    (i)
Withdrawals. No part of the Escrow Property may be withdrawn from the Escrow
Fund established hereunder without prior written instructions to the Escrow
Agent signed by both Parent and the Stockholder Representative.   (j) Tax
Reporting. The parties hereto agree that the Stockholders shall be treated
for all Tax purposes as the owners of their Pro Rata Shares of the Escrow
Fund. Within thirty (30) days of the date hereof, the Stockholder
Representative shall furnish to the Escrow Agent Internal Revenue Service
Forms W-9 or Forms W-8BEN for each of the Stockholders. The parties agree
that the interest and other earnings attributable to the Escrow
Property shall be treated for U.S. federal, state and local tax purposes as
income of the Stockholders in the respective proportions indicated on
Appendix I; provided, however, that in the case of any particular taxable
year during which Parent receives the Parent Escrow Earnings Amount pursuant
to Section 2(e) hereof, then any interest or other earnings earned by the
Escrow Fund during such taxable year shall be allocated to Parent for U.S.
federal, state and local income tax purposes in an amount equal to the lesser
of (i) the Parent Escrow Earnings Amount or (ii) the amount of interest or
other earnings earned by the Escrow Fund during such taxable year.   3.
Notice of Claim. Each notice of a Claim by Parent (the "Notice of Claim")
will be in writing and delivered to the Escrow Agent and the Stockholder
Representative and will contain Parent\'s estimate of the
reasonably foreseeable maximum amount of the alleged Damages to the extent it
is known to Parent.   4. Resolution of Notice of Claim and Transfer of
Escrow Amount. Any Notice of Claim received by the Stockholder Representative
and the Escrow Agent pursuant to Section 3 above will be resolved as
follows:   (a) Uncontested Claims. In the event that the
Stockholder Representative does not contest a Notice of Claim in writing to
the Escrow Agent (with a copy to Parent) within thirty (30) calendar days
after a Notice of Claim containing a statement of the claimed Damages is
delivered to the Escrow Agent pursuant to Section 6 below, the Escrow Agent
will immediately transfer to Parent the portion of Escrow Property equal to
the amount of Damages specified in the Notice of Claim, and will notify the
Stockholder Representative of such transfer.   (b) Contested Claims. In the
event that the Stockholder Representative gives written notice contesting
all, or any portion of, a Notice of Claim to Parent and the Escrow Agent (a
"Contested Claim") within the 30-day period provided above, then matters that
are subject to Third Party Claims (as defined in the Merger Agreement)
brought against Parent or the Company in a litigation or arbitration will
await the final decision, award or settlement of such litigation or
arbitration, while matters that arise between Parent and the Stockholders (or
the Stockholder Representative) will be settled by binding arbitration
pursuant to this Section 4(b) ("Arbitrable Claims"). Any portion of the
Notice of Claim that is not contested will be resolved as set forth
in Section 4(a) above. The final decision of the arbitrator will be furnished
to the Escrow Agent, the Stockholder Representative and Parent in writing and
will constitute a final, conclusive and non-appealable determination of the
issue in question, binding upon the Stockholders, the Stockholder
Representative and Parent, and an order with   73    respect thereto
may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. After delivery of
written notice by the Stockholder Representative that the Notice of Claim is
contested by the Stockholder Representative, the Escrow Agent will continue
to hold in the Escrow Fund an amount sufficient to cover such
Claim (notwithstanding the occurrence of the Initial Termination Date or
Termination Date, as applicable) until: (i) execution of a settlement or
joint escrow instructions agreement by Parent and the Stockholder
Representative setting forth a resolution of the Notice of Claim, or (ii)
receipt of a copy of the final award of the arbitrator.   (i) Arbitration.
Any Arbitrable Claim and any other dispute arising out of or relating to this
Agreement shall be resolved by arbitration before a single arbitrator in
Costa Mesa, California and, except as herein specifically stated, in
accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration
Association (the "AAA Rules") then in effect. However, in all events, the
provisions contained herein shall govern over any conflicting rules which may
now or hereafter be contained in the AAA Rules. Any judgment upon the award
rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction
over the subject matter thereof. The arbitrator shall have the authority to
grant any equitable and legal remedies that would be available if any
judicial proceeding was instituted to resolve an Arbitrable Claim or such
dispute.   (ii) Selection of Arbitrator. The arbitrator shall be mutually
agreed upon by Parent and the Stockholder Representative.   (iii) Payment of
Costs. Parent and the Stockholder Representative on behalf of the
Stockholders as a group will each pay 50% of the initial compensation to be
paid to the arbitrator in any such arbitration and 50% of the costs of
transcripts and other normal and regular expenses of the arbitration
proceedings; provided, however, that (A) the prevailing party in any
arbitration will be entitled to an award of attorneys\' fees and costs, and
(B) all costs of arbitration resulting from any Claim shall be added to the
amount of such Claim and in each case, the arbitrator will be authorized to
make such determinations.   (iv) Exclusive Remedy. Except as
specifically otherwise provided in this Agreement or the Merger Agreement,
arbitration will be the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties for any
Arbitrable Claim or any other dispute arising out of or relating to this
Agreement.   (v) Escrow Agent Entitled to Rely. The Escrow Agent shall be
entitled to rely upon the final award of an arbitrator and if it complies
with any such final award, it shall not be liable to any of the parties
hereto or any other third party by reason of such compliance even though such
final award may be subsequently reversed, modified, set aside or vacated.  
(c) Payment of Claims. Any amount determined to be owed or payable to Parent
pursuant to this Section 4 or otherwise under this Agreement shall be
immediately released by the Escrow Agent to Parent out of the Escrow Property
then held by the Escrow Agent.   74    (d) No Exhaustion of Remedies.
Parent need not pursue or exhaust any other remedies that may be available to
it before proceeding in accordance with the provisions contained in this
Agreement. Subject to the limitations set forth in the Merger Agreement,
Parent may institute claims against the Escrow Property and in satisfaction
thereof may recover an amount, in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, without making any other claims directly against any Stockholders
or the Stockholder Representative, and without rescinding or attempting to
rescind the transactions effected by the Merger Agreement. The assertion of
any single Claim for indemnification hereunder will not bar Parent from
asserting any other claims hereunder.   5. Limitation of Escrow Agent\'s
Duties and Liability.   (a) The duties and responsibilities of the Escrow
Agent hereunder shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this
Escrow Agreement, and no other or further duties or responsibilities shall be
implied. The Escrow Agent shall not have any liability under, nor duty to
inquire into the terms and provisions of any agreement or instructions, other
than as outlined in this Agreement, including, without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Merger Agreement.   (b) The Escrow Agent
may rely and shall be protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any
written notice, instruction or request furnished to it hereunder and believed
by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party
or parties. The Escrow Agent shall be under no duty to inquire into or
investigate the validity, accuracy or content of any such document. The
Escrow Agent shall have no duty to solicit any items which may be due it
hereunder.   (c) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any action taken
or omitted by it in good faith unless a court of competent
jurisdiction determines that the Escrow Agent\'s willful misconduct or gross
negligence was the primary cause of any loss to Parent or any Stockholder.
The Escrow Agent may consult with counsel of its own choice and shall have
full and complete authorization and protection for any action taken or
omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in accordance with the opinion of
such counsel.   (d) Parent and the Stockholder Representative (solely
on behalf of the Stockholders) hereby agree to jointly and severally
indemnify the Escrow Agent for, and to hold it harmless against any loss,
liability or expense arising out of or in connection with this Agreement and
carrying out its duties hereunder, including the costs and expenses of
investigating or defending itself against any claim of liability, except in
the case of gross negligence or willful misconduct by the Escrow Agent.
Anything in this Escrow Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in no
event shall the Escrow Agent be liable for special, indirect or consequential
loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost
profits), even if the Escrow Agent has been advised of the likelihood of such
loss or damage and regardless of the form of action. The costs of enforcing
this indemnity shall also be shared equally by Parent and the Stockholder
Representative on behalf of the Stockholders. This right of indemnification
shall survive the termination of the Escrow Agreement and the removal or
resignation of the Escrow Agent.    75    (e) All interest or other
income earned under the Escrow Agreement shall be allocated and paid as
provided herein and reported by the recipient to the relevant tax authority
as having been so allocated and paid.   (f) The Escrow Agent shall not incur
any liability for following the instructions herein contained or expressly
provided for, or written instructions given jointly by Parent and the
Stockholder Representative.   (g) In the event that the Escrow Agent shall
be uncertain as to its duties or rights hereunder or shall receive
instructions, claims or demands from any party hereto which, in its opinion,
conflict with any of the provisions of this Agreement, it shall be entitled
to refrain from taking any action and its sole obligation shall be to keep
safely all Escrow Property until it shall be directed otherwise in writing by
all of the other parties hereto or by a final order or judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction, such final order or judgment to be accompanied by a
legal opinion of counsel for the presenting party satisfactory to the Escrow
Agent to the effect that such order or judgment is final and enforceable and
not subject to further appeal. The Escrow Agent shall act on such court order
and legal opinion without further question.   6. Notices. All notices and
other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given
if delivered personally or sent by facsimile transmission (receipt of which
is confirmed) or two business days after being mailed by registered or
certified mail (return receipt requested) or by overseas courier to the

Governing Law; Successors and Assigns. This Agreement will be governed by and
construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware
without regard to conflict of law principles and will be binding upon, and
inure to the benefit of, the parties hereto and their respective successors
and permitted assigns.   (b) Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in
two or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but all
of which together will constitute one and the same instrument.   (c) Entire
Agreement. This Agreement, together with the Merger Agreement, constitutes
the entire understanding and agreement of the parties with respect to the
subject matter contained herein, and supersedes all prior agreements or
understandings, written or oral, between the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof.   (d) Waivers. No waiver by any party hereto of
any condition or of any breach of any provision of this Agreement will be
effective unless in writing. No waiver by any party of any such condition or
breach, in any one instance, will be deemed to be a further or continuing
waiver of any such condition or breach or a waiver of any other condition or
breach of any other provision contained herein. The Stockholder
Representative is authorized to execute any and all waivers on behalf of each
of the Stockholders.   (e) Definitions. Capitalized words shall have
the meanings included in the Merger Agreement, and as defined in this
Escrow Agreement, and with further definitions as follows (except as
otherwise expressly provided or unless the context clearly requires
otherwise):    77    "Claim" shall mean any fact, circumstance,
or occurrence giving rise to Damages.   "Letter of Transmittal" shall mean
the letter of transmittal, in the form approved by Parent, that each
Stockholder shall complete, execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent in
connection with the surrender of Certificates evidencing shares of Capital
Stock.   8. Expenses. All reasonable fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent
incurred in the ordinary course of performing its responsibilities hereunder
will be paid in accordance with the fee schedule attached hereto as Appendix
III and will be shared equally by Parent and the Stockholder Representative,
except that fees and disbursements resulting from any Claim shall be added to
the amount of such Claim, and provided, that the portion of such fees and
expenses allocable to the Stockholder Representative shall be paid from the
Escrow Fund.   9. Successor Escrow Agent. In the event the Escrow
Agent becomes unavailable or unwilling to continue in its capacity herewith,
the Escrow Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties or
obligations hereunder by giving resignation to the parties to this Agreement,
specifying a date not less than thirty (30) days following such notice date
of when such resignation will take effect. Parent and the Stockholder
representative may jointly remove the Escrow Agent at any time with or
without cause by an instrument given to the Escrow Agent, which instrument
shall designate the effective date of such removal. Parent will designate a
successor Escrow Agent prior to the expiration of such period by giving
written notice to the Escrow Agent and the Stockholder Representative. Parent
may appoint a successor Escrow Agent without the consent of the Stockholders
or the Stockholder Representative so long as such successor is a bank with
assets of at least One-hundred Million Dollars ($100,000,000), and may
appoint any other successor Escrow Agent with the consent of the Stockholder
Representative, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. The Escrow
Agent will promptly transfer the Escrow Property to such designated
successor. If an instrument of acceptance by a successor escrow agent shall
not have been delivered to the Escrow Agent within thirty (30) days after
giving of notice of such resignation, the Escrow Agent may, at the expense of
Parent and the Stockholders, petition any court of competent jurisdiction to
appoint a successor Escrow Agent.   10. Amendment. This Agreement may be
amended by the written agreement of Parent, the Escrow Agent and the
Stockholder Representative (on behalf of each of the Stockholders), provided
that, if the Escrow Agent does not agree to an amendment agreed upon by
Parent and the Stockholder Representative, the Escrow Agent will resign and
Parent will appoint a successor Escrow Agent in accordance with Section 9
above.   11. USA Patriot Act Compliance. To help the government fight the
funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law
requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify and record information
that identifies each person who opens an account. For a non-individual person
such as a business entity, a charity, a trust or other legal entity the
Escrow Agent will ask for documentation to verify its formation and existence
as a legal entity. The Escrow Agent may also ask to see financial statements,
licenses, identification and authorization    78   documents from
individuals claiming authority to represent the entity or other relevant
documentation. Parent and the Stockholder Representative on behalf of the
Stockholders each agree to provide all such information and documentation
as to themselves as requested by Escrow Agent to ensure compliance with
federal law.     79     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have
duly executed this Agreement as of the day and year first written above.
