 (ii) Second, Purchaser shall pay to one or more accounts designated by Seller in writing on the Closing Date an amount equal to the fees and expenses incurred by or on behalf of Seller, Seller Owners, Seller Limited Partners and/or Holdings and its Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, payable by any such Persons to outside legal counsel, accountants, advisors, brokers and other third parties and unpaid as of immediately prior to the Closing, all as set forth on _Annex 2.01(a)(ii)_ ; and

 _SECTION 2.02 Post Closing Adjustment of the Purchase Price_. 

 

 Following the Closing and pursuant to _Section 2.02(a)_, the Purchase Price will be adjusted downward, on a dollar for dollar basis, to the extent that Holdings stockholder equity as of immediately prior to the Closing (but without giving effect to the payments contemplated by _Section 2.01(a)(i)_) as finally determined in accordance with GAAP, as in effect on the date hereof, applied on a basis consistent with the Company Parties past practices (to the extent applicable), except as 

     ##### 

  

    

otherwise set forth in _Annex 2.02_ (" _Stockholder Equity_ "), is less than
Forty-Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($47,500,000).
The Stockholder Equity shall be determined and calculated strictly in
accordance with  _Annex 2.02_ using the applicable line items set forth on
the Audited Closing Balance Sheet (as defined below) as agreed upon by the
parties in accordance with  _Section 2.02(a_ ). Following the Closing and
pursuant to _Section 2.02(a)_, the Purchase Price shall also be adjusted (x)
(A) upward, on a dollar for dollar basis, if the Final Closing Cash (as
defined below) exceeds the Estimated Closing Cash or (B) downward, on
a dollar for dollar basis, if the Estimated Closing Cash exceeds the Final
Closing Cash (any such adjustment, whether upward or downward, a " _Cash
Adjustment_ ") and (y) (A) upward, on a dollar for dollar basis, if the
Estimated Capital Leases Amount exceeds the Final Capital Leases Amount or
(B) downward, on a dollar for dollar basis, if the Final Capital Leases Amount
exceeds the Estimated Capital Leases Amount (any such adjustment, whether
upward or downward, a " _Capital Leases Adjustment_ "). 

   

 (a) _Determination of Final Purchase Price_. 

    

 (i) In order to conclusively determine the Stockholder Equity as of the Closing, Purchaser, with the cooperation of Seller, will cause a consolidated balance sheet of Holdings and its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Closing (but without giving effect to the payments contemplated by _Section 2.02(a)(i) and (ii)_) (the " _Proposed Closing Balance Sheet_ ") to be prepared as promptly as practicable following the Closing Date and in no event more than forty-five (45) days following the Closing Date and Purchaser will engage Crowe Horwath LLP (" _Crowe_ ") to perform an audit, in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, of the Proposed Closing Balance Sheet (as so audited, the " _Audited Closing Balance Sheet_ ") and will allow Crowe to independently select its audit team. The Audited Closing Balance Sheet shall set forth, among other things, the final amount of all cash and cash equivalents of Holdings and its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Closing (but without giving effect to the payments contemplated by _Section 2.01(a)(i)_) (the " _Audited Closing Cash_ "). The Proposed Closing Balance Sheet and the Audited Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared based upon the books and records of the Company Parties in accordance with GAAP and, to the extent applicable, consistent with the past practices of the Company Parties (but without giving effect to the payments contemplated by _Section 2.01(a)(i)_). The parties will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause Crowe to complete and deliver the Audited Closing Balance Sheet to Seller and Purchaser within sixty (60) days after Crowes receipt of the Proposed Closing Balance Sheet (the date of such delivery, the " _Closing Audit Date_ "). The parties shall cooperate with Crowe in connection with such audit, and shall provide Crowe with all books, records and other papers necessary for such purpose. The parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause Crowe to make available to the parties Crowes books, records and other papers related to the final amounts set forth on the Audited Closing Balance Sheet, including work papers, in connection with Crowes preparation of the Audited Closing Balance Sheet. 

   

 (ii) Within thirty (30) days after the Closing Audit Date, Purchaser shall deliver to Seller Purchasers calculation of (x) the Stockholder Equity, which shall be calculated based on the Audited Closing Balance Sheet, (y) the cash and cash equivalents of Holdings and its Subsidiaries, determined in accordance with GAAP as in 

   ##### 

  

   

effect on the date hereof, as of immediately prior to the Closing (and, for
the avoidance of doubt, without giving effect to the use of such cash and
cash equivalents in accordance with  _Section 2.01(a)(i)_), which shall be
calculated based on the Audited Closing Cash (the " _Proposed Cash Amount_
"), and (z) the aggregate amount outstanding on the capital leases of the
Company, determined in accordance with GAAP as in effect on the date hereof,
as of immediately prior to the Closing (the " _Proposed Capital
Leases Amount_ ") in each case together with reasonable documentation in
support thereof. Purchasers calculation of Stockholder Equity, the Proposed
Cash Amount and the Proposed Capital Leases Amount shall be final and binding
on the Parties unless within forty-five (45) days after Sellers receipt of
Purchasers calculation of Stockholder Equity, the Proposed Cash Amount and
the Proposed Capital Leases Amount Seller shall give Purchaser a notice of
objection (an " _Objection Notice_ "). The Objection Notice shall
specify each item Seller objects to in Purchasers calculations of
Stockholder Equity, the Proposed Cash Amount and/or the Proposed Capital
Leases Amount, together with a calculation of each disputed amount and
reasonable documentation in support thereof. Any item in
Purchasers calculation of Stockholder Equity, the Proposed Cash Amount or
the Proposed Capital Leases Amount that is not objected to in the Objection
Notice shall be deemed agreed and shall be final and binding on the
parties. 

   

 (iii) From and after the Closing Date and prior to the date the Objection Notice is required to be timely delivered, Purchaser shall make available to Seller and any of its accountants and advisors, upon reasonable request and during the Companys normal business hours, the Company Parties accounting personnel, (including the chief financial officer), and the books and records of the Company Parties and any other documents relating to the preparation of the Audited Closing Balance Sheet, Purchasers calculation of Stockholder Equity, the Cash Adjustment and the Capital Leases Adjustment, and shall use reasonable efforts to make available to Seller the Company Parties and Purchasers accountants, for the purposes of determining whether to deliver an Objection Notice. Purchaser agrees that following the Closing Date and prior to the completion of the Audited Closing Balance Sheet and the final determination of Stockholder Equity, the Cash Adjustment and the Capital Leases Adjustment in accordance with this _Section 2.02_, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company Parties to, preserve and not alter or destroy any of the books and records of any Company Party relating to the calculation of the Audited Closing Balance Sheet, the Cash Adjustment or the Capital Leases Adjustment. 

   

 (iv) In the event an Objection Notice is given, Purchaser and Seller, together with their respective accountants and other advisors, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any objection and arrive at a final determination. If Purchaser and Seller are unable to arrive at a final determination within twenty (20) days after an Objection Notice is given, the matter shall be submitted to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (the " _Independent Firm_ "). The Independent Firm shall make a final determination in writing as to all matters in dispute within thirty (30) days after its appointment, _provided_ , that, notwithstanding the Independent Firms determination of the Stockholder Equity, the Cash Adjustment and/or the Capital Leases Adjustment, for purposes hereof (A) the Stockholder Equity shall be neither less than the amount of Stockholder Equity as calculated by Purchaser and delivered to Seller pursuant 

   ##### 

  

   

to _Section 2.02(a)(ii)_ nor greater than the amount specified by Seller
in the Objection Notice, (B) the final amount of cash and cash equivalents of
Holdings and its Subsidiaries as of the Closing used to determine the Cash
Adjustment (calculated in accordance with the provisions set forth in this
_Section 2.02(a)_) shall be neither less than the amount of such cash and
cash equivalents as calculated by Purchaser and delivered to Seller pursuant
to _Section 2.02(a)(ii)_ nor greater than the amount specified by Seller in
the Objection Notice, and (C) the final aggregate amount outstanding on the
capital leases of the Company used to determine the Capital Leases

of Purchaser and the Company Parties. Purchaser and the Company Parties shall
indemnify and hold harmless each Historic Tax Indemnitee from and against
any Tax or other Loss for any Pre-Closing Tax Period arising as a direct or
indirect result of the filing of any Tax Return described in this _Section
5.03(b)_. As used in this Agreement, " _Historic Tax Indemnitee_ " shall mean
the Persons listed on _Annex 5.03(b)_. 

   

 (c) Seller shall cause to be timely filed all Tax Returns of the Company Parties that are due on or prior to the Closing Date. The applicable Company Party shall timely pay any Taxes shown to be due thereon. Purchaser shall file or cause to be filed all other Tax Returns required to be filed by the Company Parties in respect of any Pre-Closing Tax Period. Purchaser shall not cause or permit any Company Party to file an amended Tax Return, or to modify any Tax election, of any Company Party with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, unless (i) Seller consents in its sole discretion, or (ii) Purchaser receives and provides to Seller written advice of reputable Tax advisors, in substance reasonably acceptable to Seller, to the effect that such amended return or modification is required by law, or (iii) in the case of such a filing solely to claim a refund or credit of Taxes described in the proviso to the first sentence of _Section 5.03(f)_, Seller consents in its reasonable discretion. 

   

 (d) With respect to each Tax Return relating to a Company Party for a Pre-Closing Tax Period that is required to be filed by Purchaser pursuant to _Section 5.03(c)_, (i) all such Tax Returns shall be filed in accordance with the prior positions and practices of the Company Parties, unless Purchaser receives and provides to Seller written advice of reputable Tax advisors, in substance reasonably acceptable to Seller, that a change is required by law, and (ii) Purchaser shall provide each such Tax Return to Seller at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date of such Tax Return for Sellers review, and Purchaser shall make all changes reasonably requested by Seller. The applicable Company Party shall pay any Taxes shown to be due on any such Tax Return, to the extent that the aggregate unpaid Taxes of the Company Parties, as of the Closing Date, do not exceed the amount of the reserve for Taxes on the Audited Closing Balance Sheet (the " _Tax Reserve_ "). Seller shall remit to Purchaser in accordance with _Section 8.04_ the amount, if any, by which the Taxes shown to be due on any such Tax Return cause the unpaid Taxes of the Company Parties, as of the Closing Date, to exceed the amount of the Tax Reserve. With respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, upon Sellers reasonable request and at its expense, Purchaser shall, or shall cause the applicable Company Party to, initiate a claim for a refund of Taxes, or amend any Tax Return, of a Company Party. 

   

 (e) With respect to Tax Returns of the Company Parties for each Straddle Period, (i) all such Tax Returns shall be filed in accordance with the prior positions and practices

of the Company Parties, unless Purchaser, in consultation with reputable tax
advisors, determines that a change is required by law, and (ii) Purchaser
shall provide each such Tax Return, accompanied by an allocation in
accordance with _Section 8.04_ between Seller and Purchaser of the Taxes
shown to be due on such Tax Return, to Seller at least thirty (30) days prior
to the due date of such Tax Return for Sellers review. Each such Tax Return
and allocation shall be final and binding on Seller and Purchaser, unless,
within twenty (20) days after the date of receipt by Seller of such Tax
Return and allocation, Seller delivers to Purchaser a written request for
changes to such Tax Return or allocation. If Seller delivers such a request,
then Seller and Purchaser shall undertake in good faith to resolve the issues
raised in such request. If Seller and Purchaser are unable to resolve any
issue by the earlier of (i) ten (10) days after the date of receipt by
Purchaser of the request for changes or (ii) ten (10) days prior to the due
date (including any extension thereof) for filing of the Tax Return in
question, then Seller and Purchaser shall jointly engage the Independent Firm
(in the manner set forth in _Section 2.02_ ) to resolve such dispute, and the
decision of the Independent Firm shall be final. The applicable Company Party
shall pay any Taxes shown to be due on any such Tax Return, to the
extent that (i) such Taxes relate to the Post-Closing Tax Period or (ii) to
the extent that such Taxes relate to the Pre-Closing Tax Period, the
aggregate unpaid Taxes of the Company Parties, as of the Closing Date, do not
exceed the amount of the Tax Reserve. Seller shall remit to Purchaser
in accordance with _Section 8.04_ the amount, if any, by which the Taxes (as
relate to the Pre-Closing Tax Period) shown to be due on any such Tax Return
cause the unpaid Taxes of the Company Parties, as of the Closing Date, to
exceed the amount of the Tax Reserve. 

   

 (f) Subject to _Section 5.03(b)_, Seller shall be entitled to any refund or credit of Taxes (including any interest paid thereon) of the Company Parties for any Pre-Closing Tax Period and for the portion of any Straddle Period for which Seller is responsible pursuant to _Section 8.04_ ; _provided_ _however_ , that Purchaser and the Company Parties shall be entitled to any refund or credit of Taxes (including any interest paid thereon) of the Company Parties for any Pre-Closing Tax Period and for the portion of any Straddle Period for which Seller is responsible pursuant to _Section 8.04_ to the extent the refund or credit results from the carryback of net operating losses, if any, attributable to the Company Parties incurred in any taxable year or portion thereof during the period beginning the day after the Closing Date and ending on July 31, 2012. Purchaser will, and will cause the Company Parties to, execute such documents, take reasonable additional actions and otherwise reasonably cooperate as may be necessary for the Company Parties to perfect their rights in and obtain all Tax refunds and credits for which any such Company Party is eligible and to which Seller is entitled. None of Purchaser or any Company Party shall forfeit, fail to collect or otherwise minimize any Tax refund or credit to which Seller would be entitled under this Section, whether through any election to carry forward a net operating loss or otherwise. 

   

 (g) If (i) a Governmental Entity asserts a claim for Taxes against any Company Party and (ii) Seller could be responsible for any portion of those Taxes under _Section 8.04_ (any such claim, a _"Tax claim_ "), then the party hereto first receiving notice (whether directly, or indirectly through an Affiliate of such party) of such Tax claim shall promptly provide to the other parties hereto written notice specifying in reasonable detail the basis for such Tax claim and shall include a copy of the relevant portion of any correspondence received from the Governmental Entity in respect of such Tax claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the 

     ##### 

  

    

failure of such party to give such prompt and detailed notice shall not
relieve the other party of any of its obligations under _Section 8.04_,
except if and only to the extent that the other party is actually prejudiced
thereby. 

   

 (h) If, within sixty (60) days after Seller receives notice of a Tax claim (whether from a Governmental Entity or pursuant to _Section 5.03(a)_ ), Seller provides to Purchaser a written notice in which Seller elects to contest, and to control the defense or prosecution of, such Tax claim (an " _Election Notice_ "), then, subject to the provisions of this _Section 5.03_ , Seller shall have the right to defend or prosecute and the right to control, at its sole cost and expense, such Tax claim by all appropriate proceedings. For any Tax claim the defense or prosecution of which Seller controls (a " _Seller Controlled Proceeding_ "), (i) Seller shall defend or prosecute the Tax claim diligently and in good faith; (ii) Seller shall not, without the prior written consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, enter into any compromise or settlement of such Tax claim that would reasonably be expected to result in any material Tax for which Purchaser or any Company Party would be responsible pursuant to _Section 8.04(b)_ ; (iii) Seller shall inform Purchaser of all material developments and events relating to such Tax claim (including providing to Purchaser copies of relevant portions of all written materials relating to such Tax claim); (iv) Purchaser shall provide or cause to be provided to Seller any information reasonably requested by Seller relating to such Tax claim, and Purchaser shall otherwise cooperate with Seller and its representatives in good faith in order to contest effectively such Tax claim; (v) Purchaser or its authorized representative shall be entitled, at the expense of Purchaser, to attend, but not participate in or control, all conferences, meetings and proceedings relating to such Tax claim; and (vi) in the event that Purchaser reasonably withholds consent to a compromise or settlement pursuant to clause (ii) above, Purchaser shall be entitled to assume the defense or prosecution of such Tax claim, and, in any event, the liability of Seller in connection with such Tax claim shall not exceed the amount of the liability under the proposed settlement or compromise as to which Purchaser withheld consent. 

   

 (i) Purchaser shall control the defense or prosecution of any Tax claim that is not a Seller Controlled Proceeding (each, a " _Purchaser Controlled Proceeding_ "). For any Purchaser Controlled Proceeding, (i) Purchaser shall defend or prosecute the Tax claim diligently and in good faith; (ii) Purchaser shall not, without the prior written consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, enter into any compromise or settlement of such Tax claim that would reasonably be expected to result in any material Tax for which Seller would be responsible pursuant to _Section 8.04_ ; (iii) Purchaser shall inform Seller of all material developments and events relating to such Tax claim (including providing to Seller copies of relevant portions of all written materials relating to such Tax claim); (iv) if requested by Purchaser, Seller shall provide or cause to be provided to Purchaser any information reasonably requested by Purchaser relating to such Tax claim, and Seller shall otherwise cooperate in good faith with Purchaser and its authorized representatives in order to contest effectively such Tax claim; and (v) Seller or its authorized representatives shall be entitled, at the expense of Seller, to attend, but not participate in or control, all conferences, meetings and proceedings relating to such Tax claim. 

   

 (j) In the case of a Tax claim that relates to a Straddle Period, such Tax claim shall be prosecuted or defended and shall be controlled by (i) Seller, if the amount of Tax for 

     ##### 

  

    

which Seller is responsible under _Section 8.04(a)_ with respect to such Tax
claim is reasonably expected to equal or exceed the amount of Tax with
respect to such Tax claim for which Purchaser and the Company Parties are
responsible under _Section 8.04(b)_, and (ii) Purchaser, otherwise. The
reasonable documented costs incurred by Seller (in a proceeding described in
clause (i) of the preceding sentence) or by Purchaser (in a proceeding
described in clause (ii) of the preceding sentence) that are properly
attributable to the Tax claim shall be divided between and borne by the
parties in accordance with their relative share of the underlying Tax
liabilities under _Section 8.04_. In the case of any such Tax claim, (i) the
controlling party shall provide the noncontrolling party with a timely and
reasonably detailed account of each stage of such Tax Claim and a copy of
relevant portions of all documents relating to such Tax claim; (ii) the
controlling party shall consult with the noncontrolling party before taking
any significant action with respect to such Tax claim that would reasonably
be expected to affect adversely the noncontrolling party; (iii) the
controlling party shall consult with the noncontrolling party and offer the
noncontrolling party an opportunity to comment before submitting any written
materials prepared or furnished in connection with such Tax claim (including,
to the extent practicable, any documents furnished to the applicable
Governmental Entity in connection with any discovery request) to the extent
such materials concern matters in such Tax claim that would reasonably be
expected to affect adversely the noncontrolling party; (iv) unless the
noncontrolling party otherwise consents in writing, the controlling party
shall defend the Tax claim diligently and in good faith as if the controlling
party were the only party in interest in connection with such Tax claim to the
extent that such Tax claim might adversely affect the noncontrolling party,
and the noncontrolling party shall reasonably facilitate to the extent
requested by the controlling party, and shall not impede, the controlling
partys control of such Tax claim; and (v) the controlling party shall not
settle, compromise, abandon or discharge any such Tax claim without obtaining
the prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned, of the noncontrolling party, if such settlement,
compromise, abandonment or discharge would reasonably be expected to have an
adverse impact on the noncontrolling party. In the event that the
noncontrolling party reasonably withholds such consent pursuant to clause (v)
of the preceding sentence, the noncontrolling party shall be entitled to
assume the defense of such Tax claim; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the
original controlling partys liability in connection with such Tax
claim shall not exceed the amount that it would have been responsible for
under the proposed settlement, compromise, abandonment or discharge. 

   

 (k) In the case of any Tax audit, examination, contest or other proceeding (other than a Tax Proceeding that involves a Tax claim) (" _Tax Proceeding_ ") of any Company Party, to the extent that such Tax Proceeding would reasonably be expected to result in any non- _de minimis_ Tax to a Company Party for which Seller could reasonably be expected to be responsible pursuant to  _Section 8.04(a)_ : (i) Purchaser shall not, without the prior written consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, enter into any compromise or settlement of such Tax Proceeding, (ii) Purchaser shall inform Seller of all material developments and events relating to such Tax Proceeding (including providing to Seller copies of relevant portions of all written materials relating to such Tax Proceeding), (iii) such Tax Proceeding shall be defended or prosecuted diligently by Purchaser in good faith as if Purchaser were the only party in interest in such Tax Proceeding and (iv) Seller or its authorized representatives shall be entitled, at the expense of Seller, to attend, but not participate in or control, all conferences, meetings and proceedings relating to such Tax Proceeding. In the event that Seller reasonably withholds consent to a compromise or settlement pursuant to clause (i) of 

     ##### 

   

    

the previous sentence, Seller shall be entitled to assume the defense of such
Tax Proceeding;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the liability of Purchaser in
connection with such Tax Proceeding shall not exceed the amount of such
liability under the proposed settlement or compromise as to which Seller
withheld its consent. This _Section 5.03(k)_ shall not eliminate or reduce
any obligation of Purchaser imposed by other provisions of this _Section
5.03._  

   

 (l) Seller, Purchaser and the Company Parties shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by any another party to this Agreement, in connection with the filing of any Tax Return of a Company Party, in any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes of a Company Party, and in allowing Seller to review Tax Returns of the Company Parties for Pre-Closing Tax Periods and Straddle Periods. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other partys request) the provision of records and information that are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any materials provided hereunder. Seller, Purchaser, and the Company Parties agree to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company Parties and that relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a Straddle Period until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (and, if notified in writing by another party, any extensions thereof), and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any Governmental Entity. The parties agree to give each other party reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records, and if another party so requests, to give such other party possession of such books and records. Seller, Purchaser and the Company Parties further agree, upon request, to use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any Tax authority or any other Person or take any other action as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed on any party hereto (including with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement).

 _SECTION 8.03_ _Limitations on Indemnification_. 

     

 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement: 

   

 (a) Neither Seller nor any Seller Owner shall be obligated to indemnify any Purchaser Indemnified Person for breaches of representations and warranties pursuant to _Section 8.02(a)(i)_ (other than Fundamental Representations) and Purchaser shall not be obligated to indemnify any Seller Indemnified Person for breaches of representations and warranties pursuant to  _Section 8.02(b)(i)_ (other than Fundamental Representations), in each case, for any claim the Losses for which do not exceed Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000) (the " _Threshold_ "). 

   

 " _Fundamental Representations_ " means the representations and warranties set forth in  _Section 3.01_ (Organization, Good Standing), _Section 3.02_ (Capitalization; Subsidiaries), _Section 3.01A_ (Organization, Good Standing), _Section 3.02A_ (Title),  _Section 3.03A_ (Authority), _Section 3.07A_ (Ownership), _Section 3.01B_ (Organization, Good Standing), _Section 3.02B_ (Authority), _Section 4.01_ (Organization; Good Standing), _Section 4.02_ (Authority) and _Section 4.05_ (Capitalization of Purchaser). 

   

 (b) Neither Seller nor any Seller Owner shall be obligated to indemnify any Purchaser Indemnified Person for breaches of representations and warranties pursuant to _Section 8.02(a)(i)_ (other than Fundamental Representations) and Purchaser shall not be obligated to indemnify any Seller Indemnified Person for breaches of representations and warranties pursuant to  _Section 8.02(b)(i)_ (other than Fundamental Representations), in each case, until the Purchaser Indemnified Persons or the Seller Indemnified Persons, as applicable, have incurred aggregate Losses in excess of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) (the " _Deductible_ ") and then only in excess of the Deductible; _provided_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, no single Loss which is less than the Threshold shall be applied to satisfying the Deductible. 

   

 (c) The maximum amount of all monetary Losses (the " _Cap_ ") subject to indemnification by Seller and Seller Owners, on the one hand, or Purchaser, on the other hand, pursuant to this  _Article VIII_ shall be as follows: 

    

 (i) For Losses arising out of, resulting from or attributable to breaches of representations and warranties (other than Fundamental Representations) for which indemnification pursuant to _Section 8.02(a)(i)_ or _Section 8.02(b)(i)_, as applicable, is available, Fifteen Million Dollars ($15,000,000) in the aggregate; 

   

 (ii) For all other Losses for which indemnification is available pursuant to pursuant to _Section 8.02(a),_ _Section 8.02(b)_, _Section 8.04(a)_ or _Section 8.04(b)_ (other than those subject to the Cap set forth in _Section 8.03(c)(i)_), the Purchase Price. In no event shall Sellers and Seller Owners, on the one hand, or Purchasers, on the other hand, indemnification obligations under this Agreement exceed, in the aggregate, the Purchase Price. 

   

The value of Equity Consideration to be included in the Purchase Price for the
purposes of  _Section 8.03(c)_ shall be equal to the product of 4,300,000
_multiplied by_ the per share average closing price for the ten (10)

 (e) In any case where a Purchaser Indemnified Person recovers under insurance policies or from Collateral Sources any amount in respect of a matter for which such Purchaser Indemnified Person previously was indemnified pursuant to this Agreement, such Purchaser Indemnified Person shall promptly pay over to Seller the amount so recovered but not in excess of the sum of (i) any amount previously so paid to or on behalf of such Purchaser Indemnified Person in respect of such matter, and (ii) any amount expended by Seller in pursuing or defending any claim arising out of such matter. 

   

 (f) In any case where a Seller Indemnified Person recovers under insurance policies or from Collateral Sources any amount in respect of a matter for which such Seller Indemnified Person previously was indemnified pursuant to this Agreement, such Seller Indemnified Person shall promptly pay over to Purchaser the amount so recovered but not in excess of the sum of (i) any amount previously so paid to or on behalf of such Seller Indemnified Person in respect of such matter, and (ii) any amount expended by Purchaser in pursuing or defending any claim arising out of such matter.

 (h) In valuing a Loss, no adjustment shall be made as a result of any multiple, increase factor, or any other premium over fair market value, book or historical value which may have been paid by Purchaser for the Purchased Stock whether or not such multiple, increase factor or other premium had been used by Purchaser at the time of, or in connection with, calculating or preparing its proposed purchase price for the Purchased Stock. 

   

 _SECTION 8.04_ _Tax Indemnification_. 

  

 (a) Seller and each Seller Owner shall, jointly and severally, indemnify Purchaser Indemnified Persons and hold them harmless from and against, any loss, claim, liability, expense, or other damage attributable to (i) all Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) of the Company Parties for all taxable periods ending on or before the

    ##### 

  

    

Closing Date and the portion through the end of the Closing Date for any
taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (" _Pre-
Closing Tax Period_ "), (ii) all Taxes of any member of an affiliated,
consolidated, combined or unitary group of which the Company Parties (or
any predecessor of any of the foregoing) is or was a member on or prior to
the Closing Date, including pursuant to Treasury Regulation §1.1502-6 or any
analogous or similar state, local, or non-U.S. law or regulation, and (iii)
any and all Taxes of any Person (other than the Company Parties) imposed on
the Company Parties as a transferee or successor, by contract (other than (x)

credit of Taxes described in the proviso to the first sentence of  _Section
5.03(f)_ to which Purchaser or the Company Parties are entitled (to the extent
such refund or credit is not already accounted for in the Tax Reserve).
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in calculating the
Taxes for which Seller and Seller Owners, on the one hand, and Purchaser and
the Company Parties, on the other hand, are responsible for pursuant to 
_Section 8.04(a)_ and _Section 8.04_(b), any items of income and gain that
arise after the Closing on the Closing Date and that are not in the ordinary

immediately succeeding the Closing Date. Seller and Seller Owners shall
reimburse Purchaser for any Taxes of the Company Parties that are

 (i) In the case of any Taxes based on the income or receipts of the Company Parties that are payable with respect to a taxable period that includes but does not end on the Closing Date (each, a " _Straddle Period_ "), the portion of such Taxes allocable to (x) the portion of the Straddle Period ending on or before the Closing Date (for which Seller shall be responsible under _Section 8.04(a)_) and (y) the portion of the Straddle Period beginning on the day next succeeding the Closing Date (for which Purchaser shall be responsible under _Section 8.04(b)_) shall be determined on the basis of a deemed closing at the end of the Closing Date of the books and records of the Company Parties. 

   

 (ii) In the case of any Taxes (other than Taxes covered by clause (A) above) of the Company Parties that are payable with respect to a Straddle Period, the portion of such Taxes allocable to the portion of such period ending on or before the 

   ##### 

  

   

Closing Date (for which Seller shall be responsible under _Section 8.04(a)_)
shall be equal to the product of such Taxes multiplied by a fraction the
numerator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period from the
beginning of the Straddle Period through and including the Closing Date and
the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period,
and the remaining such Taxes shall be allocable to the portion of the
Straddle Period beginning on the day next succeeding the Closing Date (for
which Purchaser shall be responsible under _Section 8.04(b_). 

  

 _SECTION 8.05_ _Indemnification Procedures_.

   

 (a) If Purchaser, on the one hand, or Seller, on the other hand, shall receive notice of any matter which such party or any of its officers, directors Subsidiaries, employees, agents, Subsidiaries or affiliates (any of the foregoing, an " _Indemnitee_ "), has determined has given, or, with respect to any matters other than a breach of a representation or warranty set forth in _Section 3.24_ , is reasonably likely to result in, a right of indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnitee shall promptly give the indemnifying party (the " _Indemnitor_ ") written notice of such claim, stating the amount of the Losses, if known, and method of computation thereof, all with reasonable particularity and including documentary proof, if available, and containing a reference to the provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such right of indemnification is claimed or arises; _provided_ , _however_ , that failure to so notify the Indemnitor shall not relieve the Indemnitor from any liability which it may have on account of the claim, except to the extent the Indemnitor shall have been actually and materially prejudiced by such failure. 

   

 (b) If an Indemnitee shall receive notice of any claim or proceeding initiated by a third party which is or may be subject to indemnification (other than in the case of a Tax claim or Tax Proceeding, which shall be governed by the provisions of _Section 5.03_) (each, a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the Indemnitee shall promptly give the Indemnitor written notice of such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that failure to so notify the Indemnitor shall not relieve the Indemnitor from any liability which it may have on account of the Third Party Claim, except to the extent the Indemnitor shall have been actually and materially prejudiced by such failure. If the Indemnitor acknowledges in writing its obligation to indemnify the Indemnitee hereunder against all Losses that may result from such Third Party Claim and the Indemnitee is reasonably satisfied that the Indemnitor has sufficient funds available to pay any Losses resulting from such Third Party Claim, then the Indemnitor shall be entitled, at its option, to assume and control the defense of such claim by counsel of its own choice and at its own expense,  _provided_ that the Indemnitor and its counsel shall proceed with diligence and good faith with respect thereto and Indemnitor shall be obligated to post any bonds required in connection with such Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnitee shall have the right to control the defense of such Third Party Claim and employ separate counsel in such Third Party Claim and the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnitor if: (i) the Indemnitor has failed to promptly assume the defense and employ counsel, (ii) the Indemnitor fails to conduct the defense of the applicable Third Party Claim with diligence and good faith, (iii) the Third Party Claim seeks an injunction or other equitable relief or is a criminal proceeding, (iv) settlement of, or an adverse judgment with respect to, the Third Party Claim is, in the good faith judgment of the Indemnitee, likely to establish a precedential custom or practice adverse to the continuing business interests or the reputation of the Indemnitee, or (v) the named parties to any such Third Party Claim (including any impleaded parties) include such Indemnitee and any Indemnitor, and such Indemnitee shall have been advised by its counsel that there is a conflict of 

     ##### 

  

    

interest between the Indemnitor and such Indemnitee with respect to such Third
Party Claim or with respect to any legal defense which may be available;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnitor shall not in such event be
responsible hereunder for the fees and expenses of more than one firm of
separate counsel (in addition to local counsel) in connection with any claim
or proceeding. 

   

 (c) In the event the Indemnitor exercises its right to undertake the defense of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnitee shall cooperate with the Indemnitor in such defense and make available to the Indemnitor witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in its possession or under its control relating thereto as are reasonably requested by the Indemnitor. Similarly, in the event the Indemnitee is, directly or indirectly, conducting the defense against any Third Party Claim, the Indemnitor shall cooperate with the Indemnitee in such defense and make available to the Indemnitee witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in its possession or under its control relating thereto as are reasonably requested by the Indemnitee. No Third Party Claim may be settled by the Indemnitor without the written consent of the Indemnitee, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. No Third Party Claim which is being defended in good faith by the Indemnitee alone, or jointly with the Indemnitor, shall be settled by the Indemnitee without the written consent of the Indemnitor, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

Purchaser will indemnify and hold Seller and Seller Owners harmless from and against any and all liabilities (including but not limited to reasonable attorneys fees) to which it may be subjected by reason of any finders, brokers, financial advisors, investment bankers or similar fee or commission with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to the extent such fee is attributable to any action undertaken by Purchaser or its Subsidiaries (including the Company Parties after the Closing).
