<PAGE>

Estimated Cash Purchase Price less sixty million dollars ($60,000,000) (the
"Escrow Amount"), which the Purchaser shall deposit into the Escrow Account and
which shall be held in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. The
"Unadjusted Cash Purchase Price" under this Agreement shall be eight hundred
twenty-five million dollars ($825,000,000), provided that, the following occur:

                      (i)   the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors in
     the Chapter 11 Case (The "Creditor's Committee") and the Official Equity
     Committee in the Chapter 11 Case (the "Equity Committee") shall have

     declared the highest or otherwise best offer following the conclusion of
     the auction held on October 11, 2001, with the support and approval of the

          (b) The Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser prior to the Closing
Date, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to make such delivery not less
than five days prior to the scheduled Closing Date, a notice setting forth the
Seller's good faith calculation of the Working Capital of the Business as of a
date not more than 10 days prior to the Closing Date and certifying to such
estimates.  If such estimate reflects a Working Capital Deficiency, the amount
of such Working Capital Deficiency shall be subtracted from the Unadjusted Cash
Purchase Price and if such estimate reflects a Working Capital Surplus, the
amount of such Working Capital Surplus shall be added to the Unadjusted Cash
Purchase Price.  The Unadjusted Cash Purchase Price as so adjusted shall be the
"Estimated Cash Purchase Price."

Purchase Price shall be adjusted following the Closing as follows:

                             (i)   if the amount of the Working Capital of the
     Business (determined in accordance with this Section 1.6) as of the Closing
     Date is less than thirty six million, one hundred thousand dollars
     ($36,100,000), the Unadjusted Cash Purchase Price shall be decreased by an
     amount equal to such difference (the "Working Capital Deficiency") and the
     Unadjusted Cash Purchase Price, as so adjusted, will be the Cash Purchase
     Price;

                             (ii)  if the amount of the Working Capital of the
     Business (determined in accordance with this Section 1.6) as of the Closing
     Date is greater than thirty six million, one hundred thousand dollars
     ($36,100,000), the Unadjusted Cash Purchase Price shall be increased by an
     amount equal to such difference (the "Working Capital Surplus") and the
     Unadjusted Cash Purchase Price, as so adjusted, will be the Cash Purchase
     Price; and

                             (iii)  if the amount of the Working Capital of
     Business (determined in accordance with this Section 1.6) as of the Closing
     Date is equal to thirty six million, one hundred thousand dollars
     ($36,100,000), the Unadjusted Cash Purchase Price will be the Cash Purchase
     Price.

The Purchaser shall pay the Seller the amount of any positive difference between
the Cash Purchase Price and the Estimated Cash Purchase Price.  The Seller shall
return to the Purchaser the amount of any positive difference between the
Estimated Cash Purchase Price and the Cash Purchase Price.  Any amounts required
to be paid or returned pursuant to this Section 1.6(a) (i) by the Purchaser
shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts
specified by the Seller and (ii) by the Seller shall be paid to the Purchaser
from the Escrow Account, in each case within five business days after the amount
of Working Capital is agreed to by the Seller and the Purchaser or any remaining
disputed items are ultimately determined by the Accountants.

          (b) As used herein, the term "Working Capital" shall mean, as
reflected on the Working Capital Statement, the sum of cash held by the
Transferred Subs, accounts receivable (excluding that portion of accounts
receivable which is aged more than 120 days as of the Closing Date), and earned
in advance of

                                       11
<PAGE>

billing minus deferred revenue and accounts payable with respect to the
Transferred Subs, but, with respect to such of the foregoing as are related to
the Seller or a Selling Sub (and not a Transferred Sub), only to the extent such
accounts receivable constitute Acquired Assets; it being understood that cash
held by the Seller and the Selling Subs are not Acquired Assets and should not
be included in Working Capital but that cash held by a Transferred Sub should be
included in Working Capital. The term "Working Capital Statement" shall mean the
statement of Working Capital of the Business to be prepared by the Seller as of
the Closing Date in accordance with this Section 1.6 and to be delivered to the
Purchaser as promptly as practicable and in any event within 30 days after the

using the same accounting principles, procedures, policies and methods that were
used to prepare the Balance Sheet, and the Seller shall certify in writing to
the Purchaser on the delivery date of the Working Capital Statement that the
Working Capital Statement was so prepared.

          (c) During the preparation of the Working Capital Statement and the
period of any dispute within the contemplation of this Section 1.6, to the
extent reasonably necessary for the preparation of the Working Capital
Statement, the Purchaser shall and shall cause the Transferred Subs and any
other Affiliates of the Purchaser to (i) provide the Seller and the Seller's
authorized representatives with reasonable access to the books, records,
facilities and employees of the Business, (ii) provide the Seller as promptly as
practicable after the Closing Date (but in no event later than 10 business days
after the Closing Date) with financial information consistent with the Seller's
existing financial reporting requirements for the Business for the period
ending on the Closing Date and (iii) cooperate fully with the Seller and the
Seller's authorized representatives, including the provision on a timely basis
of all information necessary or useful in preparing the Working Capital
Statement.

          (d) The Working Capital Statement shall be final and binding on the
parties unless, within 15 days after delivery to the Purchaser, written notice
is given by the Purchaser to the Seller and the Escrow Agent of its objection
setting forth in reasonable detail the Purchaser's basis for objection.  The
Purchaser may dispute items reflected on the Working Capital Statement only on
the basis that such items were not arrived at in conformity with the accounting
principles, procedures, policies and methods that were used to prepare the
Balance Sheet.  If notice of objection is given, the parties shall consult with
each other with respect to the objection.  Any amount that is not in dispute
will promptly be paid by the party obligated to make such payment hereunder to
the party entitled to receive such payment hereunder.  If the parties are unable
to reach agreement within 15 days after the notice of objection has been given,
the dispute shall be submitted, as promptly as practicable, for resolution to
Deloitte & Touche (the "Accountants").  Each party

                                       12
<PAGE>

agrees to execute, if requested by the Accountants, a reasonable engagement
letter. The Accountants will make a determination, based solely on presentations
by the Seller and the Purchaser and not by independent review, as to (and only
as to) each of the items in dispute, which determination will be (i) in writing,
(ii) furnished to each of the parties hereto as promptly as practicable after
the items in dispute have been referred to the Accountants, (iii) made in
accordance with this Agreement and (iv) conclusive and binding upon each of the
parties hereto. In connection with their determination of the disputed items,
the Accountants will be entitled to rely on the accounting records and similar
materials prepared in connection with the preparation of the Working Capital
Statement, and the fees and expenses of the Accountants will be paid one-half by
the Purchaser and one-half by the Seller. Each of the Purchaser and the Seller
will use reasonable efforts to cause the Accountants to render their decision as
soon as reasonably practicable (but in no event later than 30 days following the
expiration of the 15-day period provided above for the Purchaser and the Seller
to resolve disputes prior to submission to the Accountants), including without
limitation by promptly complying with all reasonable requests by the Accountants
for information, books, records and similar items.

          Section 1.7  Allocation of Purchase Price for Tax Purposes.  The

shall provide the Seller with an allocation of the Cash Purchase Price and the
Assumed Liabilities among the Acquired Assets, Assumed Liabilities and the
Interests within 90 days after the Closing Date in accordance with Section 1060
of the Code.  The Seller shall have the right to propose changes to such
allocations, provided that the Purchaser shall have ultimate discretion to
reject any such proposals unless such rejection would be unreasonable.  The
Seller and the Purchaser shall be bound by such allocation (and if necessary,
any adjusted allocation), and shall file, or cause to be filed, a Form 8594 and
all applicable federal, state, local, provincial and foreign income, franchise
and excise Tax Returns in a manner that is consistent with such allocation.  If
the allocation is disputed by any Taxing Authority, the party receiving notice
of such dispute shall promptly notify the other party hereto concerning the
existence of such dispute and the parties shall consult with each other with
respect to all issues related to the allocation in connection with such dispute.
If the IRS proposes a different allocation, either party may file amended
returns based on such allocation.

United States issued by a reputable title insurance company (the "Title
Company") which commits the Title Company to issue a Title Policy for each such
owned Real Property as of the Closing Date in the amount corresponding to the
value for the particular property set forth on Schedule 1.9 attached hereto
which insures the Purchaser (or its subsidiary) and its successors and assigns

Purchaser any surveys of the Real Property in its possession.

          Section 1.10  Trademarks and Tradenames.  It is expressly agreed that

validly existing and in good standing (or its equivalent) under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization and has the requisite power
and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its

existing and in good standing or to have such power and authority could not be
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.  The jurisdiction of
incorporation or organization of each Transferred Sub is set forth on Schedule
A.  Each of the Seller and each Business Sub is duly qualified or licensed to do
business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction
in which the nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so duly qualified, licensed
and in good standing could not be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect.  Attached to the Seller Disclosure Schedule is a complete and correct
copy of the organizational documents of the Seller and each Business Sub, as
currently in effect.

          Section 3.2  Capitalization of Business Subs.  (a) The authorized and
outstanding equity interests of each Transferred Sub are set forth on Schedule

forth on Schedule B.  All of the equity interests of each Business Sub are owned
beneficially and of record by the Seller or a direct or indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Seller as set forth on Schedule A or Schedule B.  There are no
existing (i) options, warrants, calls, subscriptions or other rights,
convertible securities, agreements or commitments of any character obligating a
Business Sub to issue, transfer or sell any equity interests in such Business
Sub or securities convertible into or exchangeable for such equity interests,
(ii) contractual obligations of a Business Sub to repurchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire any equity interests in such Business Sub or (iii) voting
trusts or similar agreements to which a Business Sub is a party with respect to
the voting of equity interests in such Business Sub.  At the Closing, except as
set forth on Schedule A or Schedule B, none of the Business Subs will hold any
equity interest in any other entity.

          (b) At the Closing, the company books of the Transferred Subs will
show the beneficial owners of all the issued shares in the Transferred Subs as
the registered holders of such shares.

corporate action.  This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by the Seller, and upon the entry of the Section 363/365 Order

applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium and other laws
affecting creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect and to general
equitable principles. At the Closing, each Ancillary Agreement executed and
delivered by the Seller will have been duly and validly executed and delivered
by the Seller and upon the entry of the Section 363/365 Order (assuming each
such Ancillary Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the
Purchaser or its permitted designee), each such Ancillary Agreement will

in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization,
insolvency, moratorium and other laws affecting creditors' rights generally from
time to time in effect and to general equitable principles.

authorizations, declarations, and filings referred to in Section 3.4 have been
made or obtained and shall remain in full force and effect and the conditions
set forth in Article VI shall have been satisfied, at the Closing neither the
execution, delivery, or performance of this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements by the Seller, nor the consummation by the Seller of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, nor compliance by the Seller with any of the
provisions hereof or thereof will (a) conflict with or result in any breach of
any provisions of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Seller or
the organizational documents of the Business Subs, (b) result in a violation, or
breach of, or constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of time) a default
(or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation, vesting, payment,

conditions or provisions of any contract, agreement or arrangement that is
included as an Acquired Asset or any material note, bond, mortgage, deed of
trust, security interest, indenture, license, contract, agreement, plan or other
instrument or obligation to which the Seller or one of the Business Subs is a

(c) violate any order, writ, injunction, decree, statute, rule or regulation
applicable to the Seller, the Business Subs, the Interests or the Acquired
Assets, except in the case of clauses (b) or (c) for violations, breaches,
defaults, terminations, cancellations, accelerations, creations, impositions,
suspensions or revocations that (i) could not be reasonably likely to have a
Material

default or violation of any term, condition or provision of (i) its articles of
incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents or (ii) any statute,
law, rule, regulation, judgment, decree, order, arbitration award, concession,
grant, franchise, permit or license or other governmental authorization or
approval applicable to the Seller or a Business Sub by which their respective
assets and properties are bound or to the Interests or the Acquired Assets, but
excluding from the foregoing clause (ii), defaults or violations which could not
be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect or which become
applicable as a result of the business or activities in which the Purchaser is
or proposes to be engaged or as a result of any acts or omissions by, or the
status of any facts pertaining to, the Purchaser. Notwithstand ing the
foregoing, this Section 3.7 shall not apply to Environmental Laws, which are
exclusively the subject of the representations and warranties in Section 3.18.

               (b) Except as could not be reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect, each of the Seller and each Business Sub currently

by the Seller or a Selling Sub (or in the case of the Transferred Subs, the
assets held by the Transferred Subs) and the conduct of the Business, and all
such Permits are in full force and effect. Except as could not be reasonably
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect, as of the Effective Date, neither the
Seller nor any Business Sub has received any written notice from any
Governmental Entity and no proceeding is pending, or, to the knowledge of the
Seller or a Transferred Sub, threatened, revoking, modifying or refusing to
renew any Permit or providing notice of violations under any Permit.

          Section 3.8  Books and Records.  The books, records and accounts of
the Seller and each Business Sub maintained with respect to the Business

Business, maintained any bank account for the Business or used any of the funds
of Seller or any Business Sub in the conduct of the Business except for

(ii) Excluded Assets, (iii) tangible and intangible assets currently leased or
owned by the Transferred Subs and (iv) the assets and rights made available
pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement and the Trademark License
Agreement, taken together, constitute substantially all of the tangible and
intangible assets that are required to conduct the Business as of the Effective

constitutes a representation or warranty that the Business can or will be
operated at the existing performance levels following the Closing Date) or are

assets currently leased or owned by the Transferred Subs are in good operating
condition and repair, ordinary wear and tear excepted.

affecting any site of employment or facility related to the Business or (iii)

               (c)     If requested by the Purchaser, the Seller shall under-
take to provide prior to Closing and within a reasonable period of time
following such request, a complete and accurate list (redacted where necessary
for the purposes of applicable data protection or privacy laws) of the following
information for each (i) Transferred Employee; (ii) Transferred Sub Employee;

or layoff status: employer; name; job title; current compensation paid or
payable and any change in compensation since March 31, 2001; accrued but unused
vacation; and service history.

               (d)     To the knowledge of Seller, Transferred Subs or
Mismatched Employers, no former or current (i) Transferred Employee; (ii)
Transferred Sub Employee; or (iii) Mismatched Employee is a party to or
otherwise bound by any agreement or arrangement, including any confidentiality,
non-competition or proprietary rights agreement, between such employee or
director and any other Person, including the Seller, Transferred Subs and
Mismatched Employers, that in any way adversely affected, affects, or will
affect (i) the employee's right to perform his duties as an employee of the
Business or (ii) the ability of the Purchaser to conduct the Business.

               (e)     All employees who are engaged primarily in the

complete and correct list of all material employee benefit plans as defined in
Section 3(3) of ERISA ("Employee Benefit Plans") and of all other material
employee arrangements and commitments, whether or not employee benefit plans
(including, without limitation, sick leave, vacation pay, severance pay, salary
continuation for

                                       35

disability, consulting or other compensation arrangements, retirement plans,
deferred compensation plans, bonus plans, incentive compensation plans, stock
option or other stock incentive plans, equity compensation plans, employee stock
purchase plans, medical, dental and vision plans, life insurance and educational
assistance programs) sponsored or maintained by the Seller or an ERISA
Affiliate, or to which the Seller or an ERISA Affiliate contributes or is
required to contribute, or with respect to which the Seller or an ERISA
Affiliate is a party for the benefit of, or has any liability, contingent or
otherwise in relation to, any Transferred Employee, Mismatched Employee or any
employee or former employee of any of the Transferred Subs, except any
statutory plan, benefit or contribution obligation (collectively the "Seller
Plans"). As used herein, "ERISA Affiliate" shall refer to any trade or business,
whether or not incorporated, under common control with the Seller within the
meaning of Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code and, for the avoidance of
doubt, is to be deemed to refer to each of the Business Subs. Except as set
forth in Schedule 3.22, the Seller has made available to the Purchaser, where
applicable, complete and correct copies of (i) all Seller Plans, (ii) all
related summary plan descriptions and any subsequent summaries of material
modifications, (iii) the most recent financial statements, (iv) the most recent
annual reports (Form 5500 series in the case of Seller Plans in the United
States), (v) the most recent IRS determination letter for all plans qualified
under Code section 401(a), (vi) appropriate evidence of tax-favored or tax-
exempt status for Seller Plans outside the United States, (vii) the three most
recent actuarial reports, (viii) a copy of each trust agreement or other funding
arrangement, (ix) all material correspondence within the last three years with
governmental and regulatory authorities relating to any Seller Plan and (x) all
current material handbooks, manuals, Collective Bargaining Agreements and
similar documents governing employment policies, practices and procedures.

          (b) With respect to each Employee Benefit Plan required to be listed
on Schedule 3.22(a) which is subject to the laws of the United States, to the
knowledge of Seller:  (i) each Employee Benefit Plan has been operated in
material compliance with its terms and with the applicable provisions of ERISA,
the Code, applicable securities laws and all other applicable laws and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder; (ii) each Employee Benefit Plan which is
intended to be qualified within the meaning of Code section 401(a) is so
qualified and is, as most recently amended, the subject of a favorable
determination letter as to its qualification and nothing has occurred, whether
by action or failure to act, that could reasonably be expected to cause the loss
of such qualification; (iii) all contributions required under the terms of such
plans or under applicable law have been made within the time required by law and
the terms of the plans; (iv)  there have been no "prohibited transactions" (as
described in Section 4975 of the Code or in Part 4 of Subtitle B of Title I of
ERISA) which are not exempt.

                                       36
<PAGE>

          (c) Neither Seller nor any ERISA Affiliate has ever maintained,
contributed or been obligated to contribute to a "Multiemployer Plan" (as such
term is defined by Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) or to any Employee Benefit Plan
which is subject to the minimum funding requirements of Part 3 of Subtitle B of
Title I of ERISA or subject to Section 412 of the Code.  None of the
Transferring Subs has, or would, as a result of ceasing to participate in one of
the Seller Plans as a result of the Acquisition, have, any special liability to
contribute to or make payments in respect of a Seller Plan in which it had
ceased to participate.

          (d) None of the Seller, the Transferred Subs or any Selling Sub and,
in relation to Mismatched Employees, no Affiliate or subsidiary of Seller is
bound by any Collective Bargaining Agreement or any other agreement or legally
binding arrangement (including under custom and practice) to maintain, with
respect to any employee, any benefit plan.

          (e) In respect of any Seller Plan: (i) all reports and information
required to be provided to applicable Governmental Entities, or to plan
participants and their beneficiaries with respect to that Seller Plan have been
so provided except where the failure to do so would not result in a Material
Adverse Effect; (ii) there are no inquiries, proceedings, claims or suits
pending or threatened by any Governmental Entity or by any participant or
beneficiary against any of the Seller Plans, the assets of any of the trusts of
or under such Seller Plans or the Seller Plan sponsor or the Seller Plan
administrator, or against any fiduciary of any of such Seller Plans with respect
to the design, operation or administration of the Seller Plans, other than
routine claims for benefits.

          (f) To the knowledge of the Seller, the consummation of the
transactions contemplated herein will not, either alone or in combination with
another event, (i) entitle any Transferred Employee, Mismatched Employee or any
current or former employee, officer, director, consultant or agent of any
Transferred Sub to severance pay, unemployment compensation or any other payment
or benefit, or (ii) except as set forth in Schedule 3.22(f), accelerate the time
of payment or vesting of, or increase the amount of, compensation or benefits
due to any such individual.

          (g) Other than continuation of benefit coverage under group health
plans as is required by applicable law, the cost of which is fully paid by the
former employee or his or her dependent, none of the Seller or the Business Subs
or, in relation to Mismatched Employees, any Affiliate or subsidiary of Seller
maintains retiree life or retiree health plans providing for continuing coverage
for

                                       37
<PAGE>

any employee or any beneficiary of an employee after the employee's termination
of employment.

               (h)      With respect to all of the Seller Plans which are
subject to laws other than those of the United States: (i) each such Seller Plan
is in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulatory requirements,
including relevant tax laws, and the requirement of any trust deed or other
governing document or applicable custom or practice, under which they are
established; (ii) each Seller Plan which is intended to have tax-favored or tax-
exempt status has received all necessary certificates and approvals from the
relevant tax authority and nothing has occurred, whether by action or failure to
act, that could reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such approval; (iii)
all employer and employee contributions to each such Seller Plan required by law
or by the terms of such plan have been timely made, or, if applicable, accrued
in accordance with normal accounting practices; (iv) the fair market value of
the assets of each funded plan, the liability of each insurer for any plan
funded through insurance or the book reserve established for any plan, together
with any accrued contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide for the
accrued benefit obligations, as of the Closing, with respect to all current and
former participants in such plan; (v) there have been no restricted or
prohibited transactions in relation to any Seller Plan with the Seller, any
Affiliate of the Seller or any person connected with the Seller or any of its
Affiliates.

          Section 3.23  Brokers.  Except for Goldman, Sachs, & Co., no Person is
entitled to any brokerage, financial advisory, finder's or similar fee or
commission payable by the Seller in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of
the Seller.

          Section 3.24  Accuracy.  No representation or warranty made by
Seller in this Agreement or pursuant hereto (a) contains any untrue statement of
any material fact, or (b) omits to state any fact that is necessary to make the
statements made, in the context in which made, not false or misleading in any
material respect.

                                  ARTICLE IV

                REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE PURCHASER

<PAGE>

own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted. The Purchaser is duly qualified as a foreign corporation to do
business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of
its properties owned or held under lease or the nature of its activities make
such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified and in
good standing could not be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect
on the Purchaser.

          Section 4.2  Authority Relative to this Agreement.  The Purchaser has
the corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements and to carry out its obligations hereunder and thereunder.  The
execution, delivery, and performance of this Agreement and each of the Ancillary
Agreements by the Purchaser and the consummation by the Purchaser of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly authorized by all
requisite corporate actions.  This Agreement has been duly and validly executed
and delivered by the Purchaser.  At the Closing, each of the Ancillary
Agreements will be duly and validly executed and delivered by the Purchaser.
Assuming this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the
Seller, this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the
Purchaser, enforceable against the Purchaser in accordance with its terms, and
upon the Closing (assuming each of the Ancillary Agreements will constitute a
valid and binding obligation of the Seller) each of the Ancillary Agreements
will constitute a valid and binding agreement of the Purchaser, enforceable
against the Purchaser in accordance with  its respective terms, in each case
subject to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium and
other laws affecting creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect and
to general equitable principles.

          Section 4.3  Consents and Approvals.  Except for consents, approvals,
authorizations, declarations, filings or registrations which may be required
under the HSR Act or similar antitrust or competition legislation in any other
applicable jurisdiction, no consent, approval or authorization of, or
declaration, filing or registration with, any Governmental Entity is required to
be made or obtained by the Purchaser in connection with the execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

          Section 4.4  No Violations.  Neither the execution, delivery or
performance of this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements by the Purchaser, nor
the consummation by the Purchaser of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, nor compliance by the Purchaser with any of the provisions hereof or
thereof, will (a) conflict with or result in any breach of any provisions of the
articles or certificate of incorporation, as the case may be, or bylaws of the
Purchaser, (b)

                                       39

result in a violation or breach of, or constitute (with or without due notice or
lapse of time) a default (or give rise to any right of termination,
cancellation, acceleration, vesting, payment, exercise, suspension, or
revocation) under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond,
mortgage, deed of trust, security interest, indenture, license, contract,
agreement, plan or other instrument or obligation to which the Purchaser is a
party or by which the Purchaser or the Purchaser's properties or assets may be
bound or affected, (c) violate any order, writ, injunction, decree, statute,
rule or regulation applicable to the Purchaser or the Purchaser's properties or
assets, (d) result in the creation or imposition of any encumbrance on any asset
of the Purchaser or (e) cause the suspension or revocation of any permit,
license, governmental authorization, consent or approval necessary for the
Purchaser to conduct its business as currently conducted, except in the case of
clauses (b), (c), (d) and (e) for violations, breaches, defaults, terminations,
cancellations, accelerations, creations, impositions, suspensions or revocations
that could not individually or in the aggregate be reasonably likely to have a
material adverse effect on the Purchaser.

          Section 4.5  Brokers.  Except for Broadview Int'l LLC, no Person is
entitled to any brokerage, financial advisory, finder's or similar fee or
commission payable by the Purchaser in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of
the Purchaser.

          Section 4.6  Financing.  As of the Execution Date and on the Closing
Date the Purchaser will have sufficient funds available to deliver the
Unadjusted Cash Purchase Price to the Seller and consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.  Upon the consummation of the Acquisition, (i)
the Purchaser will not be insolvent, (ii) the Purchaser will not be left with
unreasonably small capital, (iii) the Purchaser will not have incurred debts
beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature and (iv) the capital of the

                                       45

          Section 5.7  Additional Matters.  Subject to the terms and conditions
herein provided, each of the parties hereto agrees to use all commercially
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause
to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and
regulations to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and to vest in the Purchaser or a Transferred Sub all rights in
and to the assets and properties of the Business (other than Excluded Assets) in
accordance with this Agreement, including, without limitation;  the execution of
appropriate separate purchase agreements in any jurisdiction requiring such an
agreement to complete the transactions contemplated hereby; the subsequent
transfer of any Acquired Assets which are not transferred at the Closing; and
the execution and delivery of such further documentation as either party may
reasonably require at or after the Closing. The obligations of each of the
Purchaser and the Seller pursuant to this Article V shall be subject to any
orders entered or approvals or authorizations granted by the Bankruptcy Court
and the Bankruptcy Code.

          Section 5.8  Employment of Business Employees.  (a)  Subject to the
agreed upon reduction in force set forth in Section 5.18, within five (5)
business days before the issuance of the Section 363/365 Order by the Bankruptcy
Court approving the Acquisition by the Purchaser, the Purchaser shall make
offers of employment, effective as of the Closing Date, to (i) substantially all
of the employees of the Seller who are primarily engaged in the operation of the
Business, including, specifically, all employees who may be subject to the
Assumed SIP Guarantees (those who accept such offers are referred to
collectively as the "Transferred Employees") and (ii) substantially all of the
employees of the Seller's Affiliates and subsidiaries (other than the
Transferred Subs) who are primarily engaged in the Business in respect of
jurisdictions where the Business is operated by a Transferred Sub and who would
not otherwise transfer to Purchaser's group or a Transferred Sub automatically
by operation of law as a result of the Acquisition and who have been identified
by Seller in a letter to Purchaser (those who accept such offers are referred to
collectively as the "Mismatched Employees"), on terms and conditions that, with
respect to retention bonus, are equivalent in all material respects to the
retention bonus currently offered to each such employee by the Seller, Trans-

                                       47
<PAGE>

ferred Sub and Mismatched Employer, with respect to salary, sales commissions
and annual bonus are substantially similar in all material respects to those
currently offered to similarly situated employees of Purchaser, and with respect
to other matters, are, subject to any overriding legal and regulatory
requirements, substantially similar, in the aggregate, in accordance with
Purchaser's established policies, including, but not limited to, eligibility
requirements, to those currently offered to similarly situated employees of
Purchaser. For the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser is not hereby obligated to
employ any of the Transferred Employees or Mismatched Employees for any
particular period.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchaser shall not be liable for any amount
of any sales commissions, annual bonus or retention bonus attributable to any
period prior to the Closing.  The Seller shall pay all amounts accrued by any
Transferred Employee or Mismatched Employee under the Seller's Incentive
Compensation Plan, Seller's or Mismatched Employers' sales commission plans, the
Seller's Key Performance Award Plan or the Seller's Special Management
Incentive Plan (collectively, the "Incentive Plans") with respect to any full or
partial calendar month ending on or before the Closing.  The provisions of the
preceding sentence shall apply only to liability to pay bonuses under the plans
described in this Section 5.8(a) and all other compensation and benefits payable
to such Transferred Employees and Mismatched Employees shall be payable to the
same by their respective employers during the respective periods of employment.

Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement, the Purchaser shall recognize,
honor and assume the liability for each such Transferred Employees and
Mismatched Employee's accrued but unused vacation and sick time with the Seller,
Transferred Subs and Mismatched Employers, as accrued as of the Closing.

          (b) With respect to each employee of the Transferred Subs
("Transferred Sub Employee"), the Purchaser agrees to cause each Transferred Sub
to provide all employees of such Transferred Sub with salary, sales commissions,
annual bonus and retention bonus, which are substantially equivalent to those
currently offered to each such employee by the Seller and Transferred Sub and
with respect to other matters, which are substantially similar, in the
aggregate, to those currently offered to each such employee by the Seller and
Transferred Sub, which terms and conditions will continue after the Closing Date
for at least as long as is required by applicable law.  For avoidance of doubt,
Purchaser shall cause the Transferred Subs to be liable for any amount of sales
commissions, annual bonus and retention bonus and special management incentive
bonus accrued by any Transferred Sub Employee prior to or after the Closing.

                                       48
<PAGE>

          (c) Seller shall use its commercially reasonable endeavors to
encourage all Mismatched Employees to accept Purchaser's offer of employment.
Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser, its subsidiaries and
Affiliates (including the Transferred Subs) against any and all claims, losses,
damages, expenses, obligations and liabilities (including costs of collection,
attorneys' fees and other costs of defense) which the Purchaser, its
subsidiaries or Affiliates (including the Transferred Subs) may incur in
connection with any termination of employment by Seller and the respective
Mismatched Employer of any employee of Seller or a Mismatched Employee who does
not accept Purchaser's offer of employment.

          (d) As used hereinafter, the term "Business Employees" shall mean,
collectively, the Transferred Employees, Mismatched Employees and Transferred
Sub Employees.  Except as agreed between the Seller and Purchaser, effective as
of the Closing Date, the Business Employees shall cease participation in all of
the Seller Plans and, subject to the Purchaser's standard policies, including
but not limited to eligibility requirements, commence participation in plans
sponsored or established by the Purchaser (or the appropriate assignee for
purposes of Section 1.11) including, but not limited to health, life insurance
and disability plans ("Purchaser Plans").  The Purchaser shall recognize and
give credit for all service by each Business Employee with the Seller or any
predecessor or Affiliate of Seller for purposes of eligibility, vesting and
benefits under the Purchaser's employee benefits plans and policies, including
but not limited to, flexible time off including vacation, sick leave, personal
or family leave and retirement benefits, except for benefit accruals under any
of Purchaser's defined benefit plans and to the extent such credit would result
in duplication of benefits.  Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement,
the Purchaser shall provide or cause the Transferred Subs to provide to each
Business Employee whose employment is involuntarily terminated within six (6)
months of the Closing Date severance benefits that are equivalent to those
currently offered to each such employee by the Seller, Transferred Sub or
Mismatched Employer. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement, those of
the Purchaser Plans which are health benefit plans shall not, with respect to
any Business Employee or any dependents of such employee, limit or otherwise
restrict participation thereunder for reason of any pre-existing condition
limitation or waiting period in any such Purchaser Plan. Purchaser shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to accommodate the direct rollover of eligible
rollover distributions made to any Transferred Employees, including loans, from
the Comdisco Retirement Plan to the SunGard Data Systems Inc. Savings Plan,
subject to administrative feasibility. In

                                       49
<PAGE>

accordance with Purchaser's policies and stock option plans, the Purchaser shall
issue stock options to key Business Employees. The Purchaser shall recognize and
give credit for medical plan deductibles paid under Seller's plans by
Transferred Employees who are subject to medical plan deductibles.

              (e)       The Purchaser shall indemnify and hold the Seller, the
Selling Subs and their subsidiaries and Affiliates harmless from and against any
and all claims, losses, damages, expenses, obligation and liabilities (including
costs of collection, attorneys' fees and other costs of defense) which the
Seller, the Selling Subs or their subsidiaries or Affiliates may incur in
connection with any suit or claim or violation brought against the Seller, the
Business Subs or their subsidiaries or Affiliates under the WARN Act or any
similar national, multi-national, state or local law that relates to actions
taken by the Purchaser on or after the Closing Date with regard to any site of
employment or one or more facilities or operating units within any site of
employment of the business of the Purchaser. The Seller shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Purchaser, the Transferred Subs and their respective subsidiaries
and Affiliates against any such claims losses, damages, expenses, obligations,
and liabilities referred to in the previous sentence that relates to actions
taken by the Seller or the Business Subs prior to the Closing Date.

              (f)       If requested by Purchaser Seller shall undertake to
provide prior to Closing and within a reasonable period of time following such
request, accurate details of all material employment practices, policies,
contracts, programs or arrangements applicable to employees and former employees
of the Transferred Subs, together with summaries of all material employment
rights and benefits applying to such individuals by virtue of custom and
practice.

               (g)      The Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to cause
the entry of an order approving the Incentive Plans with respect to amounts
payable to the Transferred Employees and the Mismatched Employees (the
"Retention Order"), such that the Retention Order becomes a Final Order on or
prior to the entry of the Section 363/365 Order.

          Section 5.9   Termination of Consent Decree.  Effective on the Closing
Date, the Seller and the Purchaser shall terminate the consent decree dated

affiliates, and shall exchange mutual releases with respect thereto (the "Mutual
Release").

               (b)      the Purchaser shall allow the Seller and any of its
directors, officers, employees, counsel, representatives, accountants and
auditors access to the Transferred Employees, employees of the Transferred Subs
and other employees of the Purchaser or its subsidiaries engaged in the
operation of the Business and all business records and files of the Sellers, the

Affiliates shall solicit for employment or hire any Transferred Employees,

<PAGE>

Affiliate released from such guaranty and, if requested by the assured parties,

Purchaser. The respective obligations of each party to effect the transactions

                                       53
<PAGE>

contemplated by this Agreement shall be subject to the satisfaction of the
following conditions:

          (a) The Bankruptcy Court shall have entered in the Bankruptcy Case the
Section 363/365 Order (together with any related findings of fact or conclusions
of law) approving this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby no
later than November 5, 2001.  The Section 363/365 Order shall not have been
vacated, stayed, amended, reversed or modified.  The Section 363/365 Order shall
contain (or be accompanied by) findings of fact and conclusions of law by the
Bankruptcy Court that, among other things, find and conclude that (y) the
transactions contemplated hereby are in good faith and otherwise satisfy the
provisions of Sections 363 and 365, including Section 363(m) of the Bankruptcy
Code and (z) that the Seller has complied with the notice requirements of Rules
2002, 6004, 6006 and 9014 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure and any
applicable rules of the Bankruptcy Court with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

          (b) the waiting period applicable to the Acquisition, if any, under

waiting and other time periods (including any extensions thereof) under any
applicable legislation or regulation of any relevant foreign jurisdiction shall

any intention to revoke, suspend or adversely restrict or modify any of the
same;

          (c) no action, suit or proceeding (including any proceeding over
which the Bankruptcy Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. (S) 157(b) and (c))
brought by any Governmental Entity shall be pending to enjoin, restrain or
prohibit the Acquisition, or that would be reasonably likely to prevent or make
illegal the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
For the avoidance of doubt, the ongoing investigation by the Antitrust Division
of the U.S. Department of Justice, relating to the sale of the Business to
Purchaser, by itself, would not be deemed a "proceeding" under this Section
6.1(c); and

                                       54
<PAGE>

decree or ruling, and there shall not be any statute, rule or regulation,

an executory contract of the Seller under Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code;
(b) that the Seller may assume each contract in accordance with Section 365 of
the Bankruptcy Code; (c) that the Seller may assign each contract in accordance
with Sections 363 and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code and any provisions in any
contract that prohibit or condition the assignment of such contract constitute
unenforceable anti-assignment provisions which are void and of no force and
effect; (d) that all other requirements and conditions under Section 363 and 365
of the Bankruptcy Code for the assumption by the Seller and assignment to the
Purchaser of each contract have been satisfied; (e) that upon Closing, in

the Closing, each contract shall remain in full force and effect; (f) the

debtor party under each contract as well as to any sublicensees, subtenants and
landlords. The Section 363/365 Order, and any related findings of fact and
conclusions of law, with respect to the matters set forth in this Section
6.1(e)) shall be in form and substance satisfactory to the Purchaser. All

               (c)     there shall not have occurred a Material Adverse Effect

reimburse the Purchaser Indemnitees for, any and all claims, liabilities,

reasonable attorneys' and accountants' fees incurred in the investigation or
defense of any of the same or in asserting any of their respective right

                                       58

     substituting the reference to "the Effective Date" in Section 3.12 with
     "the Closing Date"), Section 3.13 or Section 3.18;

                         (ii)   any breach by the Seller of any covenant or

     to the professional fees of advisers and administrators reasonably
     appointed by the Trustees for the purpose of completing the winding up of
     the CDRS Pension Plan, and any liability incurred either directly or by
     virtue of any indemnity owed to the Trustees under Rule 25 of the Rules of
     the CDRS Pension Plan (as amended by a deed of indemnity dated June 1,
     1998) by Comdisco Continuity Services (UK) Limited in respect of the
     failure by the employer of any member or former member of the CDRS Pension
     Plan to pay the correct national insurance contributions in respect of any
     member or former member employed by it;

                         (iv)   all Excluded Liabilities;

                         (v)    all TSA Losses (as defined in the Transition

                         (vi)   the four underground storage tanks (the "USTs")
     located beneath the parking lot at the 81 Sophers Lane, Poole, Dorset,
     England property and the potential contamination of soil and groundwater
     horizons at the premises known as Unit 1, Sterling Park, Gatwick Road,
     Crawley, West Sussex (the "Crawley Premises") and identified on Schedule
     3.18, including, without limitation, (A) the removal and proper disposal
     of the USTs and any fuel or other substances contained within the USTs; (B)
     the collection of soil and, to the extent required by applicable
     Environmental Law or to the extent required by customary practice as
     determined in the reasonable judgment of a qualified environmental
     consultant to be selected by the Seller, groundwater samples, in order to
     determine if there has been a release of Hazardous Substances into the
     environment from the USTs or upon the Crawley Premises; (C) if there has
     been a release of Hazardous Substances into the environment, the
     delineation of the extent of any such contamination and the development of
     a remedial plan with respect to such contamination; (D) implementation of
     an

                                       59
<PAGE>

     appropriate remedial plan with respect to any such release, taking into
     account applicable Environmental Laws and the current use of the real
     property; and (E) to the extent required by applicable Environmental Laws,
     notifying the appropriate Governmental Entity regarding the removal of the
     USTs and/or the environmental investigation and obtaining, if available, a
     no further action letter or closure letter from said Governmental Entity
     with respect to the USTs or the Crawley Premises, as applicable. The
     Seller's indemnification of the Purchaser with respect to the USTs is
     subject to the following conditions. The Seller shall have the right to
     manage and control the aforementioned tasks with respect to the USTs and
     the Crawley Premises. The Purchaser shall grant to the Seller the necessary
     access to the real property to allow the Seller and its representatives to
     perform the removal of the USTs and/or environmental investigation and, if
     necessary, remediation associated with the USTs or the Crawley Premises,
     as applicable and the Purchaser shall fully cooperate with the Seller in
     the performance of this work. The Seller shall provide reasonable notice to
     the Purchaser of the Seller's intent to conduct any work on the property.
     The Seller shall make reasonable commercial efforts to perform the work
     hereunder in a manner which will not materially disrupt the Purchaser's
     operations, provided, that nothing herein shall constitute a right of the
     Purchaser to interfere with the Seller's performance of said work if the
     Seller is unable to perform said work without interfering with the
     Purchaser's operations. The Seller shall provide copies of all
     correspondence and reports received from and submitted to any Governmental
     Entity and shall provide the Purchaser with a reasonable opportunity to
     submit comments on the Seller's reports prior to the submission of such
     reports to said Governmental Entity. The Purchaser shall have the right to
     retain, at its own expense, its own attorneys, experts, and other
     representatives to oversee the Seller's performance of the work and to
     review any correspondence or reports generated in connection with said
     work;

                         (vii)  the employment by Comdisco Continuity Services
     (France) S.A. of Francois Lukitsch and the termination of such employment;

                         (viii) the termination of employment of any of the
     employees of Comdisco Continuity Services (UK) Limited or of any other
     Transferred Sub as referred to in Section 5.18;

                                       60
<PAGE>

                         (ix)   any adjustment allocable by Revenue Canada to
     Comdisco Services (Canada) Limited as a result of the final determination
     of the transfer pricing audit currently being conducted by Revenue Canada
     with respect to tax plans 1997, 1998 and 1999;

                         (x)    any penalties, fines, or adjustments resulting
     from the final determination of the document review of the Comdisco
     Retirement Plan by the U.S. Department of Labor, Pension and Welfare
     Benefits Administration ("DOL") pursuant to the notice from the DOL to the
     Seller dated July 9, 2001, including, without limitation, any losses
     resulting from the disqualification of such plan as a result of such
     review; and

                         (xi)   each incident of a casualty loss of Acquired
     Assets in excess of $500,000 per incident (and if the aggregate of all
     such casualties exceeds $1,000,000, all amounts in excess of $1,000,000)
     occurring prior to the Closing Date for which insurance proceeds are not
     paid to the Purchaser pursuant to Section 5.17 prior to July 26, 2002.

               (b)       By the Purchaser.  The Purchaser covenants and agrees
to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Seller, the Selling Subs, their
Affiliates and the officers, directors, employees, agents, advisers and
representatives of each such Person (collectively, the "Seller Indemnitees")
from and against any and all Losses resulting from or arising out of:

                         (i)    any inaccuracy of any representation or
     warranty made by the Purchaser;

                         (ii)   any breach by the Purchaser of any covenant or
     agreement made or contained herein; and

                         (iii)  the Assumed Liabilities.

               (c)       Indemnification Procedures.  In the case of any claim
asserted by a third party against a party entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement (the "Indemnified Party"), written notice (which notice shall describe
the claim in reasonable detail, shall include all written materials related to
such claim and shall, if practicable, contain an estimate of the Losses that
have been or may be

                                       61
<PAGE>

sustained by the Indemnified Party) shall be given by the Indemnified Party to
the party required to provide indemnification (the "Indemnifying Party")
promptly after such Indemnified Party has actual knowledge of any claim as to
which indemnity may be sought, and the Indemnified Party shall permit the
Indemnifying Party (at the expense of such Indemnifying Party) to assume the
defense of any claim or any litigation resulting therefrom, provided that (i)
the counsel for the Indemnifying Party who shall conduct the defense of such
claim or litigation shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party,
(ii) the Indemnified Party may participate in such defense at such Indemnified
Party's expense, and (iii) the omission by any Indemnified Party to give notice
as provided herein shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
indemnification obligation under this Agreement except to the extent that such
omission results in a failure of actual notice to the Indemnifying Party and
such Indemnifying Party is prejudiced as a result of such failure to give
notice. Except with the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, no Indemnifying Party, in the
defense of any such claim or litigation, shall consent to entry of any judgment
or order, interim or otherwise, or enter into any settlement that provides for
injunctive or other nonmonetary relief affecting the Indemnified Party or that
does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by each claimant or
plaintiff to such Indemnified Party of a release from all liability with
respect to such claim or litigation. In the event that the Indemnified Party
shall in good faith determine that the conduct of the defense of any claim
subject to indemnification hereunder or any\proposed settlement of any such
claim by the Indemnifying Party might be expected to affect adversely the
ability of the Purchaser to conduct its business, or that the Indemnified Party
may have available to it one or more defenses or counterclaims that are
inconsistent with one or more of those that may be available to the Indemnifying
Party in respect of such claim or any litigation relating thereto, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right at such time to take over and assume
control over the defense, settlement, negotiations or litigation relating to any
such claim at the sole cost of the Indemnifying Party; provided that if the
Indemnified Party does so take over and assume control, the Indemnified Party
shall not settle such claim or litigation without the written consent of the
Indemnifying Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. In the event
that the Indemnifying Party does not accept the defense of any matter as above
provided, the Indemnified Party shall have the full right to defend against any
such claim or demand and shall be entitled to settle or agree to pay in full
such claim or demand. In any event, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party shall cooperate in the defense of any claim or litigation subject to this
Section 8.1 and the records of each shall be available to the other with respect
to such defense.

                                       62
<PAGE>

          (d) Indemnification Limitations.  No indemnification under Section
8.1(a)(i) shall be required with respect to any individual item of Loss unless
the aggregate of all Losses of the Purchaser Indemnitees described in Section
8.1(a) of this Agreement shall exceed $3,000,000, in which case the Seller shall
be liable only for the Losses in excess of such amount.  No Indemnification
under Section 8.1(a)(iii) shall be required unless the aggregate of all Losses
of the Purchaser Indemnitees shall exceed $200,000.  The Purchaser Indemnitees
shall not be entitled to recover from the Seller more than $15,000,000 in the
aggregate pursuant to Section 8.1(a)(v).  The Purchaser Indemnitees shall not be
entitled to recover more than $500,000 from the Seller in the aggregate with
respect to indemnification under Section 8.1(a)(vi).  The Purchaser Indemnitees
shall not be entitled to recover from the Seller more than $45,000,000 in the
aggregate, pursuant to this Section 8.1.

          (e) Remedies Exclusive; Limitations on Remedies in this Agreement.
The Seller's obligation to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnitees pursuant to this
Agreement shall not exceed the amount of funds held for such purpose in the
Escrow Account, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement but subject to Article VII, the Purchaser and the Seller acknowledge
and agree (i) that the sole and exclusive monetary recourse or monetary remedy
of the Purchaser Indemnitees with respect to a breach or inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty made by the Seller hereunder, any breach by the
Seller of any covenant or agreement hereunder and all Excluded Liabilities shall
be indemnification in accordance with the provisions of this Article VIII, (ii)
that the Escrow Account is the sole source of funding for any claims for
indemnification by any Purchaser Indemnitee pursuant to this Article VIII and
(iii) that once any funds have been released out of the Escrow Account to the
Seller as expressly contemplated by this Agreement, such funds shall cease to be
subject to any claims for indemnification by any Purchaser Indemnitee pursuant
to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement.

          (f) Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants and
Agreements.

               (i) The Seller's Representations, Warranties, Covenants and
     Agreements.  Except for the representations and warranties of the Seller
     contained in Sections 3.2(b), 3.9, 3.12, 3.13 and 3.18, the representations
     and warranties of the Seller shall not survive Closing.  The
     representations and warranties of the Seller contained in Sections 3.2(b),
     3.9, 3.12, 3.13 and 3.18 shall survive the execution and delivery of this
     Agreement, any examination by or on behalf of the parties hereto and the
     completion of the transactions contemplated herein, for a period ending on
     August 1, 2002 (the

                                       63
<PAGE>

     "Expiration Date"). The covenants and agreements of the Seller set forth in
     this Agreement shall survive in accordance with their terms. All claims for
     indemnification for breaches by the Seller of any representations,
     warranties, covenants and/or agreements under this Agreement must be
     asserted in a written notice to the Seller prior to the Expiration Date and
     if any such claim is not made before the Expiration Date, the Purchaser
     acknowledges and agrees that it shall not be entitled to indemnification
     pursuant to this Section 8.1. So long as a Purchaser Indemnitee asserts a
     claim for indemnification before the Expiration Date, such Purchaser
     Indemnitee shall be deemed to have preserved its rights to indemnification
     pursuant to this Section 8.1 regardless of when such claim is ultimately
     liquidated.

               (ii)  Purchaser's Representations, Warranties, Covenants and
     Agreements.  The representations and warranties of the Purchaser contained
     in this Agreement shall not survive Closing.  The covenants and agreements
     of the Purchaser set forth in this Agreement shall survive in accordance
     with their terms.

          (g) Indemnification Adjustment.  The amount of any Losses shall be
reduced by any amount received by an Indemnified Party under any insurance
coverage or from any other party alleged to be responsible therefor (net of any
cost of recovery), and such Indemnified Party shall either (i) use commercially
reasonable efforts to collect any amounts available under such insurance
coverage or from such other party alleged to have responsibility or (ii) assign
to the Indemnifying Party responsible for reimbursing such Losses all of its
rights to collect under any insurance coverage or from any other party alleged
to be responsible therefor, provided, however, that such Indemnifying Party
shall be under no obligation to accept any such assignment, if such collection
rights are non-assignable or if such Indemnifying Party reasonably determines
that the assignment of such rights would materially decrease the amount of funds
(net of any cost of recovery) that such Indemnifying Party would otherwise be
entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 8.1(g) with respect to such Losses.
If an Indemnified Party receives an amount under insurance coverage or from such
other party with respect to Losses at any time subsequent to any indemnification
provided by this Section 8.1, then such Indemnified Party shall promptly
reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any payment made to the Indemnified Party
by such Indemnifying Party (net of any cost of recovery) in connection with
providing such indemnification up to such amount received by the Indemnified
Party.  In addition, no Indemnified Party shall be entitled to any duplication
of reimbursement or indemnification with respect to any Losses which constitute

                                       64
<PAGE>

a breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained herein.

          Section 8.2  Transfer Taxes; Section 338 Election. (a) The Seller and
the Purchaser will use reasonable efforts and cooperate in good faith to exempt
the sale, conveyance, assignments, transfers and deliveries to be made to the
Purchaser hereunder from any sales, use, transfer, documentary, registration,
recording and other similar Taxes (collectively, "Transfer Taxes") payable in
connection with such sale, conveyance, assignments, transfers and deliveries, to
the extent provided by Section 1146(c) of the Bankruptcy Code.  In the event
that any Transfer Taxes are assessed or are required to be paid to secure the
admissibility for any legal purpose of an instrument with respect to such sale,
conveyance, assignments, transfers or deliveries, such Transfer Taxes shall be
paid one half by the Purchaser and one half by the Seller.

               (b) The Purchaser may make the election provided in Section 338
of the Code with respect to its purchase of the equity interests in one or more
of the Transferred Subs.

standard overnight carrier or when delivered by hand, or (c) the expiration of
