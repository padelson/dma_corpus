CONVERSION OF SHARES

 

Section 3.01. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Vistana, Merger Sub or any
holder of the capital stock of Starwood, Vistana, Merger Sub or ILG:

(a) _Conversion of Vistana Capital Stock_.

(i) Each share of Vistana Common Stock issued and outstanding as of the
Effective Time (other than shares canceled in accordance with _Section
3.01(a)(ii)_) shall be automatically converted into the right to receive a
number of shares or, subject to _Section 3.03_, fraction of a share of ILG
Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio, subject to adjustment in accordance
with _Section 3.01(a)(iv)_.

(ii) Each share of Vistana Common Stock held by Vistana as treasury stock or
by ILG, in each case, immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled and shall cease to exist and no stock or other consideration shall be
issued or delivered in exchange therefor.

 



20 (iii) Each share of Vistana Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, when converted in accordance with this _Section
3.01_, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of such shares shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the shares of ILG
Common Stock as provided in _Section 3.01(a)(i)_ and any dividends or
distributions and other amounts payable in accordance with _Section 3.02(c)_.

 

(iv) The Exchange Ratio and any other similarly dependent items shall be
adjusted to reflect fully the appropriate effect of any stock split, split-
up, reverse stock split, stock dividend or distribution of ILG Common Stock or
Vistana Common Stock, or securities convertible into any such securities,
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other like change with
respect to ILG Common Stock or Vistana Common Stock having a record date
occurring on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective
Time, other than the Internal Reorganization; _provided_ that nothing in
this  _Section 3.01(a)(iv)_ shall be construed to permit Starwood, Vistana
or ILG to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by
the terms of this Agreement.

 

(b) _Merger Sub Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, each share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub (" _Merger Sub Common Stock_
") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
automatically converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

(c) _ILG Common Stock_. Each share of ILG Common Stock that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to and at the Effective Time shall remain
outstanding following the Effective Time.

(d) _Exchange Ratio True-Up_. If the percentage of outstanding shares of ILG
Common Stock to be received by former Vistana shareholders with respect to
Qualified Vistana Common Stock would be less than 50.5% (the " _Threshold
Percentage_ ") of all outstanding ILG Common Stock (determined without regard
to any adjustment pursuant to this Section 3.01(d)) then upon Starwoods
election, the aggregate number of shares of ILG Common Stock into which the
shares of Vistana Common Stock are converted pursuant to  _Section
3.01(a)(i)_ shall be increased such that the number of shares of ILG Common
Stock to be received by former Vistana shareholders with respect to Qualified
Vistana Common Stock equals the Threshold Percentage. If any such increase is
required, then the Distribution Date Payment shall be decreased by an amount
equal to product of $19.08 multiplied by the number of additional shares of
ILG Common Stock required to be issued pursuant to the true-up set forth in
this  _Section 3.01(d)_ solely by reason of such actions taken by Starwood
or its Affiliates; _provided_ , however, that the preceding clause shall not
apply if ILG acted in a way that caused the failure to meet the Threshold
Percentage in the absence of the increase in ILG Common Stock issued pursuant
to this _Section 3.01(d)_.

 



21 Section 3.02. _Distribution of Per Share Merger Consideration_.

 

(a) _Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Starwood will appoint a bank or
trust company reasonably acceptable to ILG as distribution agent (the "
_Agent_ "). Prior to or at the Effective Time, ILG shall deposit with the
Agent, for the benefit of Persons who received shares of Vistana Common Stock
in the Distribution and for distribution in accordance with this  _Article
III_ , through the Agent, book-entry authorizations representing the shares of
ILG Common Stock (such shares of ILG Common Stock, together with any dividends
or distributions and other amounts payable in accordance with  _Section
3.02(c)_, being hereinafter referred to as the " _Distribution Fund_ ")
issuable pursuant to _Section 3.01_ upon conversion of outstanding shares of
Vistana Common Stock. The Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions,
deliver the ILG Common Stock contemplated to be issued pursuant to _Section
3.01_ from the shares of ILG Common Stock held in the Distribution Fund. If
ILG deposits such shares into the Distribution Fund prior to the Effective
Time and the Merger is not consummated, the Agent shall promptly return such
shares to ILG. The Distribution Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

 

(b) _Distribution Procedures_. At the Effective Time, all issued and
outstanding shares of Vistana Common Stock shall be converted into the right
to receive shares of ILG Common Stock pursuant to, and in accordance with, the
terms of this Agreement. Immediately thereafter, the Agent shall distribute
the shares of ILG Common Stock into which the shares of Vistana Common Stock
that were distributed in the Distribution have been converted pursuant to the
Merger, which shares shall be distributed on the same basis as the shares of
Vistana Common Stock were distributed in the Distribution and to the Persons
who received Vistana Common Stock in the Distribution. Each Person entitled
to receive Vistana Common Stock in the Distribution shall be entitled to
receive in respect of the shares of Vistana Common Stock distributed to such
Person a book-entry authorization representing the number of whole shares of
ILG Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this
_Section 3.02(b)_ (and cash in lieu of fractional shares of ILG Common Stock,
as contemplated by  _Section 3.03_) (and any dividends or distributions and
other amounts pursuant to _Section 3.02(c)_). The Agent shall not be entitled
to vote or exercise any rights of ownership with respect to ILG Common Stock
held by it from time to time hereunder, except that it shall receive and hold
all dividends or other distributions paid or distributed with respect thereto
for the account of Persons entitled thereto.

 

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Undistributed Shares_. No dividends or
other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to
ILG Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid
with respect to any shares of ILG Common Stock that are not able to be
distributed by the Agent promptly after the Effective Time, whether due to a
legal impediment to such distribution or otherwise. Subject to the effect of
applicable Laws, following the distribution of any such previously
undistributed shares of ILG Common Stock, there shall be paid to the record
holder of such shares of ILG Common Stock, without interest, (i) at the time
of the distribution, to the extent not previously paid, the amount of cash
payable in lieu of fractional shares of ILG Common Stock to which such holder
is entitled pursuant to _Section 3.03_ and the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid
with respect to such whole shares of ILG Common Stock, and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date therefor, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to the
distribution of such shares and a payment date subsequent to the distribution
of such shares payable with respect to such whole shares of ILG Common Stock.
ILG shall deposit in the Distribution Fund all such dividends and
distributions.

 



22 (d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Vistana Common Stock_. All shares of ILG
Common Stock issued in respect of shares of Vistana Common Stock (including
any cash paid in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 3.03_) shall
be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such shares of Vistana Common Stock.

(e) _Termination of Distribution Fund_. Any portion of the Distribution Fund
made available to the Agent that remains undistributed to the former
stockholders of Vistana on the one-year anniversary of the Effective Time
shall be delivered to ILG, and any former stockholders of Vistana who have not
received shares of ILG Common Stock in accordance with this  _Article III_
shall thereafter look only to ILG for payment of their claim for ILG Common
Stock and any dividends, distributions or cash in lieu of fractional shares
with respect to ILG Common Stock (subject to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law).

(f) _No Liability_. Neither Starwood, the Surviving Corporation, ILG, Merger
Sub, the Agent nor any other Person shall be liable to any holder of Vistana
Common Stock or any holder of shares of Starwood Common Stock for shares of
ILG Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto or with
respect to Vistana Common Stock) or cash properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law.

(g) _Closing of Transfer Books_. From and after the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of Vistana shall be closed and no transfer shall be made of any
shares of capital stock of Vistana that were outstanding as of the Effective
Time.

 

(h) _Tax Withholding_. ILG or the Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any holder of Vistana Common Stock such amounts as are required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental
Authority, such withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the recipient.

 

Section 3.03. _Fractional Shares_.

 

(a) No fractional shares of ILG Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger,
but in lieu thereof each holder of Vistana Common Stock otherwise entitled to
a fractional share of ILG Common Stock will be entitled to receive, from the
Agent in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 3.03_, a cash
payment in lieu of such fractional share of ILG Common Stock representing
such holders proportionate interest, if any, in the proceeds from the sale
by the Agent (reduced by any fees of the Agent attributable to such sale) in
one or more transactions of shares of ILG Common Stock equal to the excess of
(A) the aggregate number of shares of ILG Common Stock to be delivered to the
Agent by ILG pursuant to _Section 3.02(a)_ over (B) the aggregate number of
whole shares of ILG Common Stock to be distributed to the holders of shares of
Vistana Common Stock pursuant to _Section 3.02(b)_ (such excess, the

 



23  " _Excess Shares_ "). Starwood, Vistana, ILG and Merger Sub acknowledge that
payment of the cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares of ILG
Common Stock was not separately bargained-for consideration but merely
represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of avoiding the expense and
inconvenience to ILG that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of
fractional shares of ILG Common Stock. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, the Agent, as agent for the holders of Vistana Common Stock
that would otherwise receive fractional shares of ILG Common Stock, shall sell
the Excess Shares at then prevailing prices on the NASDAQ in the
manner provided in the following paragraph.

(b) The sale of the Excess Shares by the Agent, as agent for the holders of
Vistana Common Stock that would otherwise receive fractional shares of ILG
Common Stock, shall be executed on the NASDAQ and shall be executed in round
lots to the extent practicable. Until the proceeds of such sale or sales have
been distributed to the holders of Vistana Common Stock, the Agent shall hold
such proceeds in trust for the holders of Vistana Common Stock that would
otherwise receive fractional shares of ILG Common Stock (the " _Common Shares
Trust_ "). The Agent shall determine the portion of the Common Shares Trust
to which each holder of Vistana Common Stock shall be entitled, if any, by
multiplying the amount of the aggregate proceeds comprising the Common Shares
Trust by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional
share interest to which such holder of Vistana Common Stock would otherwise be
entitled and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional
share interests to which all holders of Vistana Common Stock would otherwise
be entitled.

(c) As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if
any, to be paid to holders of Vistana Common Stock in lieu of any fractional
shares of ILG Common Stock, the Agent shall make available such amounts to
such holders of shares of Vistana Common Stock without interest, subject to
and in accordance with _Section 3.02_.

 

Section 3.04. _Starwood Equity Awards_. Each Starwood Time-Based Stock Award
and Starwood Performance Share held by a Vistana Employee as of the Effective
Time shall be treated as set forth in the Employee Matters Agreement.

required to be filed or furnished by ILG after the date of this Agreement
and prior to the Closing, the " _ILG SEC Documents_ "). As of their
respective dates (and if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date
of this Agreement, then on the date of such filing), the ILG SEC Documents
complied in all material respects, and each other form, report, schedule,
registration statement and definitive proxy statement filed by ILG or any of
its Subsidiaries after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time (the "
_Additional ILG SEC Documents_ ") will comply in all material respects, with
the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may
be, and, subject to the last sentence of this _Section 6.08(a)_, none of such
ILG SEC Documents when filed contained, or will contain, an untrue statement
of a material fact or omitted, or will omit, to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The audited
consolidated financial statements and unaudited consolidated interim financial
statements included in the ILG SEC Documents and the Additional ILG SEC
Documents fairly present in all material respects, or will fairly present in
all material respects, the financial position of ILG and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and the results of operations
and changes in cash flows, changes in stockholders equity or
other information included therein for the periods or as of the respective
dates then ended, in each case except as otherwise noted therein and subject,
in the case of unaudited interim statements, to normal year-end audit
adjustments. Each of the financial statements (including the related notes)
of ILG included in the ILG SEC Documents and such other financial statements
have been or will be prepared in accordance with GAAP, consistently applied,
except as otherwise noted therein. Since December 31, 2014, ILG has timely
filed all reports, registration statements and other filings required to be
filed with the SEC under the rules and regulations of the SEC. There is no
undisclosed material Liability of ILG and the ILG Subsidiaries of a type
required to be reflected or reserved for on a consolidated balance sheet of
ILG and its consolidated Subsidiaries or in the notes thereto prepared in
accordance with GAAP, except for (i) Liabilities reflected or 

 



46  reserved for in the financial statements of ILG included in the ILG SEC
Documents or disclosed in the notes thereto; (ii) Liabilities that have arisen
since June 30, 2015 in the ordinary course operation of business of ILG and
the ILG Subsidiaries; (iii) Liabilities arising out of or in connection with
this Agreement, the Transaction Documents and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby; or (iv) Liabilities that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and would not have an ILG Material Adverse Effect.

(b) ILG has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures and
internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are defined in
paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 and paragraph (e) of Rule
15d-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under
the Exchange Act. ILGs disclosure controls and procedures are designed to
ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to be
disclosed by ILG in the reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information is
accumulated and communicated to ILGs management as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
and the related rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or under the
Exchange Act (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "). ILGs management has completed an
assessment of the effectiveness of ILGs disclosure controls and procedures
and, to the extent required by applicable Law, presented in any applicable
ILG SEC Document that is a report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q, or any amendment
thereto, its conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls
and procedures as of the end of the period covered by such report or
amendment based on such evaluation. Based on ILGs managements most recently
completed evaluation of ILGs internal control over financial reporting prior
to the date hereof, (i) ILG had no significant deficiencies or material
weaknesses in the design or operation of its internal control over financial
reporting that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect ILGs ability
to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (ii) ILG
does not have knowledge of any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in ILGs internal
control over financial reporting. ILG is in compliance in all
material respects with (i) the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act and (ii) the applicable listing and corporate governance rules and
regulations of the NASDAQ.

60  any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives are not and will not
be deemed to be representations or warranties of ILG or Merger Sub, and no
representation or warranty is made as to the accuracy or completeness of any

and subject to, the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Separation
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents.

Section 7.03. _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _IRS Supplemental Ruling_. Prior to the Effective Time, Starwood may, in
its discretion seek the IRS Supplemental Ruling. In such event, ILG shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to assist Starwood in obtaining the IRS
Supplemental Ruling. Starwood shall prepare and submit to the IRS supplemental
materials relating to the IRS Supplemental Ruling 

 



66  that Starwood determines are necessary or appropriate to obtain the
requested rulings from the IRS (each, an " _IRS Submission_ "), and Starwood
shall provide ILG with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on each
material IRS Submission prior to the filing of such IRS Submission and shall,
in good faith, consider any comments provided by ILG on each such material IRS
Submission. Starwood shall provide ILG with copies of each IRS Submission as
filed with the IRS promptly following the filing thereof and shall keep ILG
apprised of any developments in connection with the IRS Supplemental Ruling.

 

(b) _Tax Opinions_. Starwood and Vistana shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the delivery of the Distribution Tax Opinion and the Merger
Tax Opinions. In rendering such opinions, Starwood Tax Counsel and ILG Tax
Counsel shall be permitted to rely upon customary representations and
covenants, including those contained in certificates of Starwood, Vistana, ILG
and others, reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to Starwood Tax
Counsel and ILG Tax Counsel (such representations and covenants, the " _Tax
Representations_ "). Each of Starwood, Vistana and ILG shall deliver to
Starwood Tax Counsel and ILG Tax Counsel for purposes of such opinions
customary Tax Representations. Starwood, ILG and Vistana, if required, shall
as of the date for filing the Registration Statement, execute and deliver to
Starwood Tax Counsel and ILG Tax Counsel the Tax Representations dated and
executed as of the applicable filing date.

Section 7.04. _Preparation of the Registration Statements, Proxy Statement
and Schedule TO; ILG Shareholders Meeting_.

(a) _Registration Statements; Proxy Statement; Schedule TO_. As promptly as
practicable after the execution of this Agreement, to the extent such filings
are required by Law in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (i) ILG, Starwood and Vistana shall jointly prepare and ILG shall
file with the SEC, the Proxy Statement to be sent to the shareholders of ILG
relating to the ILG Shareholders Meeting and the Registration Statement, in
which the Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus, in
connection with the registration under the Securities Act of the shares of
ILG Common Stock to be issued in the Merger; (ii) ILG, Starwood and Vistana
shall jointly prepare and Starwood shall file with the SEC the Vistana
Registration Statement and (iii) if the Distribution is effected in whole or
in part as an exchange offer, Starwood shall prepare and file with the SEC,
when and as required, a Schedule TO and other filings pursuant to Rule 13e-4
under the Exchange Act (collectively, the " _Schedule TO_ ").

(b) Each of ILG, Starwood and Vistana shall use its reasonable best efforts to
have the Registration Statement and the Vistana Registration Statement
declared effective as promptly as practicable after such filing (including by
responding to comments of the SEC) and, prior to the effective date of the
Registration Statement and the Vistana Registration Statement, each of ILG,
Starwood and Vistana shall take all action reasonably required (other than
qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so
qualified or filing a general consent to service of process in any such
jurisdiction) to be taken under any applicable securities Laws in connection
with the issuance of ILG Common Stock and the Distribution. As promptly as
practicable after the Vistana Registration Statement shall have become
effective, Starwood shall cause the Distribution Documents to be mailed to
Starwoods shareholders. As promptly as practicable after the Registration
Statement shall have become effective, ILG shall cause the 

 



67  Proxy Statement to be mailed to its shareholders. No filing of, or amendment
or supplement to, the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement will be
made by ILG without providing Vistana with a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment thereon (and such comments shall be reasonably considered by ILG).
No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Vistana Registration
Statement or the Schedule TO, if applicable, will be made by Starwood or
Vistana without providing ILG with a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment thereon (and such comments shall be reasonably considered by
Starwood).

 

(c) If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to
ILG, Starwood or Vistana, or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or
officers, should be discovered by ILG, Starwood or Vistana which should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement, the Proxy
Statement, the Vistana Registration Statement or the Schedule TO, so that
any such document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the
party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party
and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall
be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by Law,
disseminated to the shareholders of ILG. Each party shall notify the other
party promptly of the time when the Registration Statement or the Vistana
Registration Statement has become effective, and of the issuance of any stop
order or suspension of the qualification of the shares of ILG Common
Stock issuable in connection with the Merger or shares of Vistana Common
Stock issuable in the Distribution for offering or sale in any jurisdiction.
In addition, each party agrees to provide the other party and their respective
counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall inform the other party
of any oral comments, that such party or its counsel may receive from time to
time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Registration Statement, the
Proxy Statement, the Vistana Registration Statement or the Schedule TO
promptly after receipt of such comments, and any written or oral responses
thereto. Each party and their respective counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review any such written responses and each party shall give
due consideration to the additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by
the other party and their respective counsel.

 

(d) _ILG Shareholders Meeting_.

 

(i) Subject in all respects to _Section 7.04(d)(iii)_, ILG shall establish a
record date for, and, as soon as practicable following the effectiveness of
the Registration Statement, duly call and give notice of and convene and hold
a meeting of its shareholders (the " _ILG Shareholders Meeting_ ") for the
purpose of seeking the ILG Shareholder Approval; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that ILG may, after consultation with Starwood, and, in the case of clause (C)
below upon the reasonable request of Starwood shall, postpone or adjourn the
ILG Shareholders Meeting (A) if a quorum has not been established; (B) to
allow reasonable additional time for the filing and mailing of any
supplemental or amended disclosure which the ILG Board has determined in good
faith after consultation with outside counsel is necessary under applicable
Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and
reviewed by ILGs shareholders prior to the ILG Shareholders Meeting; (C) to
allow reasonable additional time to solicit additional proxies, if and to the
extent the requisite ILG Shareholder Approval would not otherwise be obtained;
or (D) if required by Law; _provided_ ,

 



68   _however_ , that the ILG Shareholders Meeting shall not be postponed or
adjourned for more than ten (10) Business Days in the aggregate from the
originally scheduled date of the ILG Shareholders Meeting unless requested by
Starwood, but in no event shall such meeting be postponed or adjourned for
more than the earlier of fifteen (15) Business Days in the aggregate from the
originally scheduled date of the ILG Shareholders Meeting and the last
eligible date prior to having to establish a new record date for such meeting.
In addition, ILG may postpone or adjourn the ILG Shareholders Meeting with the
prior written consent of Starwood. ILG shall advise Starwood on a daily basis
during each of the last five (5) Business Days prior to the date of the ILG
Shareholders Meeting as to the aggregate tally of proxies received by ILG with
respect to the ILG Shareholder Approval and at additional times upon
the reasonable request of Starwood.

(ii) ILG shall, through the ILG Board, make the ILG Recommendation and include
such ILG Recommendation in the Proxy Statement (subject to _Section 7.09_)
and use its reasonable best efforts to (A) solicit from its shareholders
proxies in favor of the approval of the ILG Share Issuance and (B) take all
other action necessary or advisable to secure the ILG Shareholder Approval.
Except as expressly permitted in _Section 7.09(b)_, neither the ILG Board nor
any committee thereof shall (w) withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify, or
propose publicly to withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify, in a manner
adverse to Starwood or Vistana, the approval, determination of advisability,
or recommendation by the ILG Board of, the ILG Share Issuance, (x) make, or
permit any director or executive officer to make, any public statement in
connection with the ILG Shareholders Meeting by or on behalf of the ILG Board
or such committee that would reasonably be expected to have the same effect,
(y) approve, determine to be advisable, or recommend, or propose publicly to
approve, determine to be advisable, or recommend, any Competing Proposal or
(z) enter into or permit or authorize ILG or any Affiliate of ILG to enter
into any Contract with respect to a Competing Proposal (the actions specified
in the foregoing clauses (w), (x) and (y) being referred to as an " _ILG
Adverse Recommendation Change_ " and (z) an " _Adverse Acquisition Agreement_
").

 

(iii) Notwithstanding any ILG Adverse Recommendation Change, unless this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the obligations of the
parties hereunder shall continue in full force and effect. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, unless this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms, the ILG Share Issuance shall be submitted to
the shareholders of ILG for approval at the ILG Shareholders Meeting whether
or not (x) the ILG Board shall have effected an ILG Adverse Recommendation
Change or (y) any Competing Proposal shall have been publicly proposed or
announced or otherwise submitted to ILG or any of its Representatives.

Section 7.05. _Listing_. As promptly as practicable following the date
hereof, ILG shall make application to NASDAQ for the listing of the shares of
ILG Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and use all reasonable best efforts to cause such shares to be
approved for listing on NASDAQ, subject to official notice of issuance.

 



69 Section 7.06. _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party will use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to
do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in
doing or causing to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
this Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as practicable
after the date hereof, including (i) preparing and filing as promptly as
practicable all documentation to effect all necessary applications, notices,
petitions and filings and to obtain as promptly as practicable all Consents
set forth in Section 4.04 of the Starwood Disclosure Schedule, Section 5.05 of
the Vistana Disclosure Schedule and Section 6.05 of the ILG Disclosure
Schedule that are required to be obtained or made at or prior to the
Effective Time and all other material consents, waivers, licenses, orders,
registrations, approvals, permits, rulings, authorizations and clearances
necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third party and/or any
Governmental Authority in order to consummate the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the " _Approvals_
"), (ii) taking all reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain all
Approvals (including ILG providing a guarantee of Vistanas obligations as
reasonably necessary to obtain such Approvals) and (iii) taking reasonable
efforts to share information protected from disclosure under the attorney-
client privilege, work product doctrine, joint defense privilege or any other
privilege pursuant to this _Section 7.06_ in a manner so as to preserve the
applicable privilege; _provided_ , that, with respect to Approvals from third
parties (other than Governmental Authorities) required under existing
Contracts, such efforts shall not include any requirement or obligation of any
Party to make any payment to any such third party or assume any Liability not
otherwise required to be paid or assumed by the applicable party pursuant to
the terms of an existing Contract or offer or grant any financial
accommodation or other benefit to such third party not otherwise required to
be made by the applicable party pursuant to the terms of an existing
Contract. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 7.06_,
materials provided to the other party or its outside counsel may be redacted
to remove references concerning valuation. In furtherance and not
in limitation of the foregoing, each Party agrees to make (i) an appropriate
filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect
to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable, and in any
event within 20 Business Days after the date hereof, (ii) appropriate
filings, if any are required, with foreign regulatory authorities in
accordance with other applicable Competition Laws, with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable and (iii) all
other necessary filings with other Governmental Authorities relating to the
Merger, and, in each case, to supply as promptly as practicable any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to such
applicable Laws or by such authorities and to use reasonable best efforts to
cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under
the HSR Act and the receipt of the Approvals under such other applicable
Laws or from such authorities as soon as practicable. In connection with and
without limiting the foregoing, each of ILG and Merger Sub, on the one hand,
and Starwood and Vistana, on the other hand, shall, in connection with the
efforts referenced in this _Section 7.06_ to obtain all Approvals, use its
reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in
connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any
investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a
private party, (ii) promptly inform the other party of any communication
received by such party from, or given by such party to, the Antitrust Division
of the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ "), the Federal Trade Commission
(the " _FTC_ ") or any other Governmental Authority and of any material
communication received or given in

 



70  connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding
any of the transactions contemplated hereby (and in each case, if any such
communication is in writing, share a copy with the other party) and (iii)
permit the other party to review in advance any communication to be given by
it to, and consult with each other in advance of any meeting or material
telephone call with, the DOJ, the FTC or any such other Governmental
Authority or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any
other Person, and to the extent permitted by the DOJ, the FTC or such other
applicable Governmental Authority or other Person, give the other party
the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences.

(b) Without limiting this _Section 7.06_, but subject to the next sentence
of this _Section 7.06(b)_, each Party will take, or to cause to be taken, any
and all steps and to make any and all undertakings necessary to avoid or
eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust, merger control,
competition or trade regulation Law that may be asserted by any Governmental
Authority with respect to the Merger so as to enable the Closing to occur as
soon as reasonably possible, including proposing, negotiating, committing to,
and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the
sale, divestiture, licensing or disposition of such assets or businesses of
Vistana (or the Vistana Subsidiaries) or ILG (or the ILG Subsidiaries), as
applicable, or otherwise taking or committing to take action that limits
Vistanas or the Vistana Subsidiaries or ILGs or the ILG Subsidiaries, as
applicable, freedom of action with respect to, or their ability to retain, any
of the businesses, product lines or assets of Vistana (or the Vistana
Subsidiaries) or ILG (or the ILG Subsidiaries) in each case, as may be
required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any
injunction, temporary restraining order, or other order in any suit or
proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of preventing the Closing;
_provided_ that, no sale divestiture, license or disposition or action that
affects ILG or Vistana or their business may be agreed without the consent of
ILG and the effectiveness of any such sale, divestiture, license or
disposition or action or commitment shall be contingent on consummation of the
Merger. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligations of this _Section
7.06(b)_ (i) shall not apply to each of the Parties if compliance with this
_Section 7.06(b)_ would be materially adverse to the business, financial
condition or results of operations of ILG and the ILG Subsidiaries (including,
for purposes of this sentence, Vistana and the Vistana Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole) and (ii) for the avoidance of doubt, shall not require Starwood to
agree to any sale, divestiture, licensing or disposition of any assets or
businesses, or restriction or change in the ownership, conduct or operations
of any assets or businesses, that are not included in the Vistana Business.

 

Section 7.07. _Access to Information_. Starwood shall, and shall cause the
Vistana Entities, on the one hand, and ILG shall, and shall cause the ILG
Subsidiaries, on the other hand, afford to the other party and to its
respective Representatives, reasonable access, during normal business hours,
during the Interim Period, in such manner as to not interfere with ILGs
and its Subsidiaries or the Vistana Entities (as applicable) normal
operation, the properties, books and records, Contracts and appropriate
senior-level officers and employees of ILG and the ILG Subsidiaries or the
Vistana Entities (as applicable), and shall furnish such party and its
respective Representatives with financial and operating data of ILG and the
ILG Subsidiaries or the Vistana Entities (as applicable) and other information
concerning the affairs of ILG and the ILG Subsidiaries or the Vistana
Entities (as applicable), in each case, as such party and its Representatives
may reasonably request solely for the purpose of preparing for the operation
of ILG and the surviving corporation post-Closing; _provided_  that (a) such
investigation shall only be upon reasonable notice and at the sole cost and
expense of the investigating party; (b) no

 



71  Party nor its Representatives shall be permitted to perform any
environmental sampling, including sampling of soil, groundwater, surface
water, building materials, or air or wastewater emissions; and (c) that
nothing in this Agreement shall require any Party to permit any inspection or
disclose any information to any other Party that (i) would unreasonably
interfere with the conduct of such Partys business or result in damage to
property (other than immaterial damage), except with such other Partys
written consent (which may be withheld or denied at its sole discretion), (ii)
would cause a violation of any Law or any confidentiality obligations and
similar restrictions that may be applicable to such information or (iii)
would cause a risk of a loss of attorney-client privilege or other disclosure
privilege to the first Person ( _provided_ that the Person that would
otherwise be required to disclose information to the other shall take any and
all reasonable action necessary to permit such disclosure without such loss of
privilege or violation of agreement or Law). The parties hereby agree that the
provisions of the Confidentiality Agreements shall apply to all information
and material furnished by any party or its Representatives thereunder and
hereunder and that nothing in this Section 7.07 shall require Starwood to
provide access to any of its businesses or any information other than with
respect to the Vistana Business. The Confidentiality Agreements shall survive
any termination of this Agreement. All requests for such access to any Party
shall be made to such Party or its designated Representative. Vistana will
make available to ILG prior to the Closing true and complete copies of the
Organizational Documents of the Vistana Subsidiaries.

 

Section 7.08. _D andO Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, ILG agrees that it shall indemnify and
hold harmless each present and former director, officer and employee of any
Vistana Entity against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining
to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest
extent that Starwood or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Vistana
Entities), as the case may be, would have been permitted under the
Organizational Documents of Vistana in effect on the date hereof to indemnify
such Person (including promptly advancing expenses as incurred to the fullest
extent permitted under such Organizational Documents). Without limiting the
foregoing, ILG shall cause the Vistana Entities (i) to maintain for a period
of not less than six (6) years from the Effective Time provisions in their
respective Organizational Documents concerning the indemnification and
exoneration (including provisions relating to expense advancement) of the
Vistana Entities respective former and current officers, directors,
employees and agents that are no less favorable to those Persons than the
provisions of the Organizational Documents of Starwood or any of its
Subsidiaries (including the Vistana Entities), as applicable, in each case, as
of the date hereof and (ii) not to amend, repeal or otherwise modify such
provisions in any respect that would adversely affect the rights of those
Persons thereunder, in each case, except as required by Law.

 

(b) ILG shall procure (i) a prepaid, non-cancelable six (6)-year "tail" policy
commencing on the Closing Date containing terms not less favorable than the
terms of directors and officers liability insurance covering those Persons
who are currently covered by the directors and officers liability insurance
policies of Starwood or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Vistana
Entities) with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the

 



72  Effective Time or (ii) an endorsement under ILGs existing directors and
officers liability insurance policy to provide such coverage. If any claim is
asserted or made within such six (6)-year period, then any insurance required
to be maintained under this _Section 7.08_ shall be continued in respect of
such claim until the final disposition thereof.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, this
_Section 7.08_ shall survive the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all
successors and assigns of ILG and Vistana. In the event that ILG or Vistana or
any of their respective successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of ILG or
Vistana, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in
this _Section 7.08_.

 

Section 7.09. _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) ILG shall immediately cease, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and
Representatives to immediately cease, any discussions or negotiations with
any Person that may be ongoing with respect to a Competing Proposal, or any
proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Competing Proposal,
and shall request to have returned promptly any confidential information that
has been provided in any such discussions or negotiations. From the date
hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time or the date of termination of
this Agreement in accordance with _Article IX_, ILG shall not, and shall
cause its respective Subsidiaries and Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage (including by way of
furnishing information which has not been previously publicly disseminated)
any Competing Proposal or any proposal which would reasonably be expected to
lead to a Competing Proposal, or (ii) engage in any discussions or
negotiations regarding any Competing Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that
(x) ILG may ascertain facts from the Person making an unsolicited Competing
Proposal for the sole purpose of the ILG Board informing itself about the
terms of such Competing Proposal and the Person that made it and (y) if, prior
to obtaining the ILG Shareholder Approval and following the receipt of a bona
fide written Competing Proposal made after the date hereof that the ILG Board
determines in good faith (after receiving advice of its financial advisor and
of its outside legal counsel) is or could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal and that was not, directly or indirectly, solicited,
initiated or encouraged in violation of this _Section 7.09_, the ILG Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that
a failure to take action with respect to such Competing Proposal would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to ILGs shareholders under applicable
Law, ILG may, in response to such Competing Proposal and subject to
compliance with _Section 7.09(c)_, (A) furnish information with respect to
ILG to the Person making such Competing Proposal pursuant to an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement and (B) engage in discussions or negotiations with
such Person regarding such Competing Proposal; provided, that ILG may only
take the actions described in the foregoing clauses (A) and (B) if it has
provided Starwood and Vistana with notice of its intent to take such action at
least one (1) Business Day prior to taking the first of any such actions.
Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 7.09_, ILG shall not, and
shall cause its respective Subsidiaries and Representatives not to, from and
after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time or
the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article
IX_ , directly or indirectly (1) approve, endorse, recommend or enter into,
or 

 



73  publicly propose to approve, endorse, recommend or enter into, any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement, merger agreement or similar definitive agreement (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) with respect to any Competing Proposal;
(2) take any action to make the provisions of any takeover statute or the ILG
Rights Agreement inapplicable to any transactions contemplated by a Competing
Proposal; or (3) terminate, amend, release, modify or knowingly fail to
enforce any provision of, or grant any permission, waiver or request under,
the ILG Rights Agreement or any standstill, confidentiality or similar
agreement entered into by the applicable party in respect of or in
contemplation of a Competing Proposal (other than to the extent the ILG Board
determines in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that failure to take any of such actions under clause (3) would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law), or (4) propose
to do any of the foregoing.

 

(b) In addition to the provisions of _Section 7.09(a)_, prior to receipt of
the ILG Shareholder Approval, the ILG Board may (I) in response to any bona
fide written Competing Proposal that was not, directly or indirectly,
solicited, initiated or encouraged in violation of this _Section 7.09_,
effect an ILG Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 9.01(i)_ solely in order to concurrently enter into an
Adverse Acquisition Agreement, or both, or (II) in response to an Intervening
Event, effect an ILG Adverse Recommendation Change, in the case of each
of clauses (I) and (II), if and only if (i) (A) in the case of a Competing
Proposal, the ILG Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with ILGs
outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Competing
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or (B) in the case of an Intervening
Event, if the ILG Board (x) determines in good faith that an Intervening Event
has occurred and is continuing and (y) concludes in good faith, after
consultation with ILGs outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; (ii) the ILG Board provides Starwood
and Vistana four (4) Business Days prior written notice of its intention to
take such action (an " _Alternative Notice_ "), which notice shall include the
information with respect to such Competing Proposal that is specified in 
_Section 7.09(c)_ as well as a copy of such Competing Proposal, or the facts
and circumstances relating to any such Intervening Event, as applicable (it
being agreed that neither the delivery of such notice by ILG nor any
public announcement thereof that ILG determines it is required to make under
applicable Law shall constitute an ILG Adverse Recommendation Change unless
and until ILG shall have failed at or prior to the end of the period referred
to in clause (iii) below (and, upon the occurrence of such failure, such
notice and such public announcement shall constitute an ILG Adverse
Recommendation Change) to publicly announce that it (A) is recommending the
ILG Share Issuance and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
(B) in the case of a Competing Proposal, has determined that such Competing
Proposal (taking into account (x) any modifications or adjustments made to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement agreed to by the other party in
writing and (y) any modifications or adjustments made to such other Competing
Proposal) is not a Superior Proposal and has publicly rejected such Competing
Proposal); (iii) during the four (4) Business Days following such written
notice (the " _Negotiation Period_ "), if requested by Starwood or Vistana,
the ILG Board and its Representatives have negotiated in good faith with
Starwood and Vistana regarding any revisions to the terms of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement proposed by Starwood or Vistana in response to
such Competing Proposal or Intervening Event; and (iv) at the end of the four
(4) Business Day period described in the foregoing clause (iii), the

 



74  ILG Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with ILGs outside
legal counsel and financial advisors (and taking into account any adjustment
or modification of the terms of this Agreement to which Starwood and Vistana
have agreed in writing), that any Competing Proposal continues to be a
Superior Proposal and, after consultation with ILGs outside legal counsel,
that the failure to make an ILG Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to
such Competing Proposal or Intervening Event or to terminate this Agreement in
order to concurrently enter into an Adverse Acquisition Agreement would be
inconsistent with the exercise by the ILG Board of its fiduciary duties to
the shareholders of ILG under applicable Law. Any material amendment or
modification to any Competing Proposal or to the facts and circumstances
relating to any Intervening Event shall require a new Alternative Notice and a
new Negotiation Period commencing from the date of receipt of such new
Alternative Notice; _provided_ , that with respect to each subsequent written
notice related to a material amendment or modification, references to the four
(4) Business Day period above shall be deemed to be references to two (2)
Business Days.

(c) In addition to the obligations set forth in _Section 7.09(a)_ and 
_Section 7.09(b)_, ILG shall promptly, and in any event no later than 24
hours, after it receives (i) any Competing Proposal or written indication by
any Person that it is considering making a Competing Proposal, (ii) any
request for non-public information relating to ILG or its Subsidiaries other
than requests for information in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice and unrelated to a Competing Proposal or (iii) any inquiry
or request for discussions or negotiations regarding any Competing Proposal,
notify Starwood in writing of any of the foregoing occurrences, the identity
of the Person making such request, inquiry or Competing Proposal and a copy of
such request, inquiry or Competing Proposal (or where no such copy is
available, a reasonably detailed description of such request, inquiry or
Competing Proposal), including any modifications thereto. ILG shall keep
Starwood and Vistana reasonably informed on a current basis (and in any event
no later than 24 hours after the occurrence of any material changes,
developments, discussions or negotiations) of the status of any request,
inquiry or Competing Proposal (including the terms and conditions thereof and
of any modification thereto), and any material developments, discussions and
negotiations, including furnishing copies of any written inquiries, material
correspondence and draft documentation, and written summaries of any material
oral inquiries or discussions. ILG agrees that, subject to applicable
restrictions under applicable Law, it shall, prior to or substantially
concurrent with the time it is provided to any third parties, provide to
Starwood and Vistana any non-public information concerning ILG or its
Subsidiaries that ILG provided to any third party in connection with any
Competing Proposal which was not previously provided to Starwood and Vistana.

 

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the ILG Board from
taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or making a statement contemplated
by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange
Act (and such disclosure shall not be deemed to be an ILG
Adverse Recommendation Change), so long as any such disclosure includes the
ILG Recommendation without any modification or qualification thereof and
continues the prior recommendation of the ILG Board.

 



75 (e) Any failure of ILGs Subsidiaries or their Representatives to comply with
this  _Section 7.09_ (as if such Subsidiaries or Representatives were
directly subject to this _Section 7.09_) shall be deemed a breach of this
_Section 7.09_ by ILG.

 

(f) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Competing Proposal_ " shall mean, other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, any proposal or offer from a third party
relating to (A) a merger, reorganization, sale of assets, share exchange,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, dissolution,
liquidation, joint venture or similar transaction involving ILG; (B) the
acquisition (whether by merger, consolidation, equity investment, joint
venture or otherwise) by any Person of twenty percent (20%) or more of the
consolidated assets of ILG and the ILG Subsidiaries, as determined on a book-
value or fair-market-value basis; (C) the purchase or acquisition after the
date hereof, in any manner, directly or indirectly, by any Person of twenty
percent (20%) or more of the issued and outstanding shares of the ILG Common
Stock or any other Interests in ILG, (D) any purchase, acquisition, tender
offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any Person
(other than Liberty Interactive Corporation and its Affiliates) beneficially
owning twenty percent (20%) or more of the shares of ILG Common Stock or any
other Interests of ILG or any of its Subsidiaries, (E) any purchase,
acquisition, tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result
in Liberty Interactive Corporation and its Affiliates beneficially owning
thirty-five percent (35%) or more of the shares of ILG Common Stock or any
other Interests of ILG or any of its Subsidiaries or (F) any combination of
the foregoing.

 

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide written Competing Proposal
(except the references therein to "20%" shall be replaced by "50%") made by a
third party which was not solicited by ILG or any of its Representatives in
violation of _Section 7.09(a)_ and which, in the good faith judgment of the
ILG Board after consultation with its outside financial and legal advisors,
taking into account the various legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the
Competing Proposal, (A) if accepted, is reasonably likely to be consummated on
a timely basis and (B) if consummated, would result in a transaction that is
more favorable to ILGs shareholders from a financial point of view, than the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, and after giving effect
to all adjustments or modifications to the terms thereof which may be agreed
in writing to be made by Starwood (including pursuant to _Section 7.09(b)_).

 

Section 7.10. _Public Announcements_. The Parties agree that, from the date

any Party may make announcements from time to time in one or more filings of
a Current Report on Form 8-K that announces the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or as may be required by applicable Law or any securities exchange
on which the securities of any Party is listed (and the Parties shall provide
the other with reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such filings
prior to making such filings), and (ii) each Party may make announcements from
time to time to their respective employees, customers, owners, suppliers and
other business relations and otherwise as such Party may

 



76  reasonably determine is necessary to comply with the requirements of any
agreement to which such Party is a party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Parties shall cooperate to prepare a joint press release to be issued on or
promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) after the date hereof
and a joint press release to be issued on the Closing Date. The Parties agree
to keep the terms of this Agreement confidential, except to the extent and to
the Persons to whom disclosure is required by applicable Law or for purposes
of compliance with financial reporting obligations; _provided_ , that the
Parties may disclose such terms to their respective Representatives, in each
case, as necessary in connection with the ordinary conduct of their respective
businesses (so long as such Persons agree to, or are bound by Contract or
professional or fiduciary obligations to, keep the terms of this Agreement
confidential and so long as each Party shall be responsible to the other
Parties for breach of this _Section 7.10_ or such confidentiality obligations
by the recipients of its disclosure).

 

Section 7.11. _Defense of Litigation_. ILG shall keep Starwood apprised in the
defense of any Action brought by shareholders of ILG or in the name of ILG
against ILG and/or its directors relating to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including the Merger provided, that prior to the Effective
Time, ILG shall not compromise, settle, come to an arrangement regarding or
agree to compromise, settle or come to an arrangement regarding any Action
arising or resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
consent to the same, without the prior written consent of Starwood (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to the extent (a) such Action
includes Starwood or any of its Subsidiaries, directors or officers as named
defendants or (b) such compromise, settlement or arrangement would reasonably
be expected to have a material adverse effect on the ability of the Parties
to perform their respective obligations hereunder, or to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby in a timely manner.

 

Section 7.12. _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, ILG and
Vistana shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any
dispositions of Vistana Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to Vistana Common Stock) or acquisitions of ILG Common Stock

from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who
is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act

the Exchange Act, such steps to be taken in accordance with applicable SEC
rules and regulations and interpretations of the SEC staff.

accordance with the terms of the Separation Agreement. Each of Starwood and
Vistana shall effect such amendments, filings or other actions with respect
to its respective Organizational Documents as are necessary to effect the
Distribution in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

 

Section 7.15. _Exchange Offer_. If Starwood consummates the Exchange Offer and
Starwoods shareholders subscribe for less than all of the Vistana Common
Stock in the Exchange Offer, Starwood shall distribute, _pro rata_ to its
shareholders, any unsubscribed Vistana Common Stock on the Distribution Date
immediately following the consummation of the Exchange Offer so that Starwood
will be treated for U.S. federal income Tax purposes as having distributed all
of the Vistana Common Stock to its shareholders.

 

Section 7.16. _Takeover Statutes_. If any "fair price," "moratorium," "control
share acquisition" or other form of antitakeover statute or regulation shall
become applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, ILG and Merger Sub
and their respective boards of directors shall use all reasonable efforts to
grant such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably necessary so

informed of any discussions with such beneficiaries in which Starwood does not

requested by Starwood and such Affiliates so as to put Starwood and such
Affiliates in the same position as if ILG, and not Starwood, had performed or
were performing such obligations.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Parties
acknowledge and agree that at any time on or after the Closing Date, (i)

consummates such transaction;  _provided_ , that, solely for purposes of this
_Section 9.03(b)(ii)_, the term "Competing Proposal" shall have the meaning
set forth in _Section 7.09(f)(i)_, except that all references to 20% and 35%
shall be changed to 50%.

Any Termination Fee due under this _Section 9.03(b)_ or _Section 9.01(i)_
shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds.

(c) ILG shall pay to Starwood its Expenses (i) in an amount not to exceed
$15,000,000, if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 9.01(f)_
or (ii) in an amount not to exceed $30,000,000, if this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to _Section 9.01(e)_, and Starwood shall pay to ILG its
Expenses in an amount not to exceed $30,000,000, if this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to _Section 9.01(d)_. Any Expenses of Starwood or ILG due
under this _Section 9.03(c)_ shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately
available funds no later than two Business Days after receipt by the
recipient Party of an itemized statement identifying such Expenses.

(d) The parties each agree that the agreements contained in this _Section
9.03_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this
Agreement. Accordingly, if a party fails to pay any amounts due under this
_Section 9.03_ and, in order to obtain such payment, Starwood or ILG, as the
case may be, commences a suit that results in a judgment against such party
for such amounts, such party shall pay interest on such amounts from the date
payment of such amounts were due to the date of actual payment at the rate
equal to the prime rate published in the Wall Street Journal for the relevant
period, together with the costs and expenses of the other party (including
reasonable legal fees and expenses) in connection with such suit.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event that
the Termination Fee is payable and actually paid to Starwood in accordance
with this  _Section 9.03_, payment of such Termination Fee shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy of Starwood and its Affiliates against ILG or ILGs
shareholders, directors, officers, Affiliates and other Representatives, for
any loss or damage based upon, arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or the negotiation, execution or performance hereof or the transactions
contemplated hereby, except in the case of Fraud or Willful Breach (but
subject to _Section 9.03(f)_ below) and except for any claims under the
Confidentiality Agreements.

 



84 (e) Solely for purposes of establishing the basis for the amount thereof, and
without in any way increasing the amount of the Termination Fee, expanding
the circumstances in which the Termination Fee is to be paid or restricting or
modifying the other rights of any party hereunder, in the event of the valid
termination of this Agreement under circumstances in which the Termination
Fee is payable pursuant to this _Section 9.03_, it is agreed that the
Termination Fee is liquidated damages, and not a penalty, and the payment
thereof in such circumstances is supported by due and sufficient
consideration; provided, that no payment of the Termination Fee shall be
considered in lieu of, or a replacement or substitution for, damages incurred
in the event of Fraud or Willful Breach (but subject to _Section
9.03(f)_ below). For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this _Section 9.03_, the Termination Fee shall only be
payable once.

 

(f) After Starwood has received the Termination Fee, Starwood shall only be
permitted to bring an action for damages against ILG or ILGs shareholders,
directors, officers, Affiliates or other Representatives for any loss or
damage based upon, arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
negotiation, execution or performance hereof or the transactions contemplated
hereby, if Starwood claims in such action that ILG has committed Willful
Breach or Fraud. Starwood shall only be entitled to payment of any damages in
such action to the extent it is finally determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction that such damages exceed the amount of the Termination Fee (and
in such event, Starwood shall only be entitled to payment of the amount of
such damages in excess of the Termination Fee). If it is finally determined by
a court of competent jurisdiction that ILG did not commit Willful Breach or
Fraud, Starwood shall promptly following the date of such determination pay to
ILG its Expenses incurred in connection with defending such action by wire
transfer of immediately available funds. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, in no circumstances shall any Party be
liable to any other Person for any (i) special, exemplary, or punitive damages
or (ii) consequential damages, except in the case of this clause, (ii),
to the extent such damages are reasonably foreseeable.

Section 10.03. _Amendments and Waivers_.

 

(a) Any Party may, at any time prior to the Closing, by action taken by its
board of directors, or officers thereunto duly authorized, waive any of the
terms or conditions of this Agreement or (without limiting _Section
10.03(b)_) agree to an amendment or modification to this Agreement by an
agreement in writing executed in the same manner (but not necessarily by the
same Persons) as this Agreement; _provided_ , that after the ILG Shareholder
Approval has been obtained, no amendment or waiver shall be made that pursuant
to applicable Law requires further approval or adoption by the shareholders of
ILG without such further approval or adoption. No waiver by any of the
Parties of any breach hereunder, whether intentional or not, shall be deemed
to extend to any prior or subsequent breach hereunder or affect in any way any
rights arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence. No
waiver by any of the Parties of any of the provisions hereof shall be
effective unless explicitly set forth in writing and executed by the Party
sought to be charged with such waiver.

 

(b) This Agreement may be amended or modified in whole or in part, only by a
duly authorized agreement in writing executed by the Parties in the same
manner as this Agreement and which makes reference to this Agreement.

Section 10.04. _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_.

(a) This Agreement, and all Actions (whether in contract or tort) that may be
based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the negotiation,
execution or performance hereof (including any claim or cause of action based
upon, arising out of or related to any representation or warranty made in or
in connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this
Agreement) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Law of
the State of Delaware, without regard to the choice of law or conflicts of law
principles thereof. The Parties expressly waive any right they may have,
now or in the future, to demand or seek the application of a governing Law
other than the Law of the State of Delaware.

(b) Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for
itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if such court shall not have
jurisdiction, any federal court of the United States of America sitting in
Delaware, and any appellate court from any appeal thereof, in any Action
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Transaction Documents or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or for recognition
or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the parties
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence any such
Action except in such courts, (ii) agrees that any claim in respect of any
such Action may be heard and

 



87  determined in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, to the
extent permitted by Law, in such federal court, (iii) waives, to the fullest
extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now
or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such Action in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware or such federal court and (iv) waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to
the maintenance of such Action in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware or such federal court. Each of the Parties agrees that a final
judgment in any such Action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in
other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided
by Law. Each Party irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner
provided for notices in _Section 10.02_. Nothing in this Agreement will
affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other
manner permitted by Law.

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY
OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, AND ANY OF THE
TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH
PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY
OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH
WAIVERS, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH
WAIVERS, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED
TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 10.05(c)_.

 

Section 10.05. _Assignment; Parties in Interest_. No Party may assign its
rights or delegate its duties under this Agreement without the written
consent of the other Parties. Any attempted assignment or delegation in breach
of this Section 10.05 shall be null and void. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective
permitted successors and assigns. Nothing expressed or implied in this
Agreement is intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give any Person,
other than the Parties, any rights or remedies under or by reason of this
Agreement, except as provided in Section 7.08.

Section 10.06. _Captions; Counterparts_. The captions in this Agreement are
for convenience only and shall not be considered a part of or affect the
construction or interpretation of any provision of this Agreement. This
Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts (including by electronic
or .pdf transmission), each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of
which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Delivery of any
signature page by facsimile, electronic or pdf. transmission shall be binding
to the same extent as an original signature page.

 

Section 10.07. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Transaction Documents
and the Confidentiality Agreements, including any related annexes, exhibits
and schedules, as well as any other agreements and documents referred to
herein and therein, shall together constitute the

 



88  entire agreement between the Parties relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby and supersede any other agreements, whether written or
oral, that may have been made or entered into by or among any of the Parties
or any of their respective Affiliates relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby.

Section 10.08.  _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or any
Transaction Document, or the application of any provision to any Person or
circumstance, is held invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent
jurisdiction, the other provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect. The Parties further agree that if any provision contained
herein is, to any extent, held invalid or unenforceable in any respect under
the Laws governing this Agreement, they shall take any actions necessary to
render the remaining provisions of this Agreement valid and enforceable to the
fullest extent permitted by Law and, to the extent necessary, shall amend or
otherwise modify this Agreement to replace any provision contained herein
that is held invalid or unenforceable with a valid and enforceable provision
giving effect to the intent of the Parties.

 

Section 10.09. _Specific Performance_. In the event of any actual or
threatened default in, or breach of, any of the terms, conditions and
provisions of this Agreement or any other Transaction Document, the Party who
is, or is to be, thereby aggrieved shall have the right to specific
performance and injunctive or other equitable relief in respect of its rights
under this Agreement or such Transaction Document. The Parties agree that the
remedies at law for any breach or threatened breach, including monetary
damages, are inadequate compensation for any loss and that any defense in any
Action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate is
waived. Any requirements for the securing or posting of any bond with such
remedy are waived by each of the Parties to this Agreement.
