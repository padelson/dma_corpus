Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the restrictions in this

the payment of any consideration) under which the Buyer shall obtain the economic claims, rights

party hereto to perform any covenants or agreements in this Agreement in connection with obtaining
the China Approval, the non-defaulting party shall retain all its indemnity and other rights set
out in this Agreement with respect to such failure to perform its agreements hereunder. If at any
time, the Buyer, in its reasonable discretion determines that the China Approval is not obtainable
with commercially reasonable efforts, and that the business of Q-Tech can be effectively
transferred to the Buyer through the transfer of assets and the assumption of liabilities of
Q-Tech, the Parent shall, upon the request of the Buyer, cooperate with all of the Buyer&#146;s

this <U>ARTICLE XIII</U> in respect of a claim that does not involve a Third Party Claim being

<U>Section&nbsp;13.1</U> and <U>Section&nbsp;13.2</U> (a &#147;<U>Valid Other Claim Notice</U>&#148;), must certify

indemnified party shall be entitled to participate fully in all substantive deliberations regarding
the Environmental Breach and any Remedial Action with respect thereto. The Seller shall only be
responsible for Remedial Actions that are required to be undertaken by an Environmental Law and
only for such Remedial Action as represents the least stringent response required by an
Environmental Law based on the use of the property as of the Closing Date and may include the
imposition of institutional or engineering controls provided that such controls do not result in
any material interference with the operation of the Business Unit as of the Closing Date. As used
in this Agreement, &#147;<U>Remedial Action</U>&#148; means the defense of any Action, the investigation,

Notwithstanding the foregoing, this <U>Section&nbsp;13.5(a)</U> shall not prevent any party from
pursuing remedies of specific performance or injunctive relief, declaratory judgment or any other
non-monetary equitable remedies available to them under applicable Law. All amounts payable by one
party in indemnification of the other shall be considered an adjustment to the Base Purchase Price.

of profits, diminution in value, punitive or consequential damages that are incurred or suffered by
a third party and payable by the indemnified party with respect to the Third Party Claim of such
third party; provided, however that for purposes of this Agreement, in the event of a breach of
this Agreement by the Buyer that causes the Closing not to occur, the Seller may recover, to the
extent the Seller satisfies its burden of proof of damages under applicable Law, the difference
between the Purchase Price and the amount received by the Seller in a subsequent sale of the
Business Unit or other appropriate measures of direct damages to compensate the Seller for the loss
of the benefit of its bargain.

have against any other parties (excluding the Buyer&#146;s and its Affiliates&#146; rights under any
insurance policies) with respect to the subject matter underlying such indemnification claim. The
indemnified party and its Affiliates shall cooperate with the indemnifying party in the pursuit of
such rights and shall promptly turn over to the indemnifying party any payments (up to the amount
of the Indemnification Payment) received in respect of such rights.
