 _PURCHASE AGREEMENT_  

   

 THIS PURCHASE AGREEMENT made as of this 18th day of December, 2009 (this " _Agreement_ ") by and among ENPRO INDUSTRIES, INC., a North Carolina corporation (the " _Parent_ "), COLTEC INDUSTRIES, INC., a Pennsylvania corporation (the " _Seller_ "), FULCRUM ACQUISITION LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the " _Buyer_ "), and ATLAS COPCO (CHINA) INVESTMENT COMPANY LTD. (the " _Chinese Buyer_ "): 

  

 _WITNESSETH:_  

   

 WHEREAS, the Seller desires to sell the Business Unit to the Buyer, and the Buyer and the Chinese Buyer desire to acquire the Business Unit, by purchasing the U.S. Assets and the China Equity Capital, respectively, in exchange for the Purchase Price, as set forth herein. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the respective representations, warranties, mutual covenants and agreements hereinafter set forth, the Parent, the Seller, the Buyer and the Chinese Buyer hereby covenant and agree as follows: 

  

 Capitalized terms have the meaning assigned thereto in _ARTICLE XVI_ and otherwise in this Agreement. 

  

ARTICLE I 

   

PURCHASE AND SALE OF ASSETS AND EQUITY CAPITAL  

  

 Section 1.1 _Purchase and Sale of Assets and Equity Capital_. On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, (a) on the Closing Date and at the Closing, the Seller shall sell, assign, convey and transfer to the Buyer, and the Buyer shall acquire from the Seller, all of the Sellers right, title and interest in and to the U.S. Assets, and (b) on the China Closing Date, the Seller shall sell, assign, convey and transfer to the Chinese Buyer, and the Chinese Buyer shall acquire from the Seller, all of the Sellers right, title and interest in and to the China Equity Capital. 

  

 Section 1.2 _Purchase Price and Payment_. 

  

 (a) The aggregate purchase price for the U.S. Assets and the China Equity Capital (the " _Purchase Price_ ") shall be equal to USD 190,000,000 (the " _Base Purchase Price_ ")  _plus_ the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities. The Base Purchase Price shall be adjusted as provided in _ARTICLE II._  

   

 (b) The purchase price for the China Equity Capital shall be equal to USD 5,800,000 (the " _China Base Purchase Price Amount_ "). The Chinese Buyer shall pay an amount equal to the amount of cash and cash equivalents held by Q-Tech as of the Closing Date (the " _China Cash Payment_ ") at the same time as the Chinese Buyer pays the China Base Purchase Price Amount. The Chinese Buyer shall make such payment in cash to the Parent as

soon as practicable after the Chinese Buyer obtains approval from the China
State Administration of Foreign Exchange to remit overseas such payment. 

   

 (c) The Buyer shall pay the Base Purchase Price, less the China Base Purchase Price Amount in cash to the Seller, on the Closing Date. 

   

 The Chinese Buyers obligation to pay the China Base Purchase Price Amount and the China Cash Payment as set forth herein shall be absolute and without any right of set-off by the China Buyer or its Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event the China Closing Date does not occur prior to the China Outside Date, the Buyer shall pay to the Parent the China Base Purchase Price Amount (but not the China Cash Payment) on the China Outside Date. 

  

 Section 1.3 _Excluded Assets_. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Buyer acknowledges that, as a result of the purchase of the U.S. Assets and the China Equity Capital, neither the Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall have any right, title or interest in or to any of the Excluded Assets. 

  

 Section 1.4 _Assumed Liabilities and Obligations_. On the Closing Date and at the Closing, the Seller shall assign to the Buyer, and the Buyer shall assume and agree to thereafter pay, satisfy, perform and discharge, when due, the Assumed Liabilities.

TOTAL NET ASSET VALUE ADJUSTMENT  

  

 Section 2.1 _Closing Balance Sheet_. As promptly as practicable, but in any event within 60 days following the Closing Date, the Seller shall prepare and deliver to the Buyer a closing balance sheet of the Business Unit as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ "). The Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP applied consistently with past practices of the Business Unit as evidenced by the balance sheets included in the Financial Statements, subject to the exceptions to GAAP disclosed in _Section 2.1_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule. Along with the Closing Balance Sheet, the Seller 

   ##### 

  

    

will deliver to the Buyer the computation of the Total Net Asset Amount as of
the Effective Time as calculated from the Closing Balance Sheet. As used in
this Agreement, the term " _Total Net Asset Amount_ " means the net book
value of the U.S. Assets and the assets held by Q-Tech as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time less the net book value of the Assumed
Liabilities and the liabilities of Q-Tech as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time (and shall exclude the Excluded Assets and Retained
Liabilities) determined based on the Closing Balance Sheet, provided that the
Total Net Asset Amount shall exclude all additions to accumulated
depreciation or amortization recognized after December 31, 2009. Each party
shall provide the other party and its representatives with reasonable access
to books and records and relevant personnel during preparation of the
Closing Balance Sheet and the resolution of any disputes that may occur
pursuant to this _ARTICLE II_. 

  

 Section 2.2 _Disputes_. 

  

 (a) Subject to clause (b) of this _Section 2.2_, the Closing Balance Sheet and the Total Net Asset Amount calculation delivered by the Seller to the Buyer shall be deemed to be and shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties hereto. If the Seller fails to timely deliver the Closing Balance Sheet within such 60 day period provided in _Section 2.1_, then the Buyer shall have the right, at any time thereafter, upon 20 days prior notice to Seller to prepare the Closing Balance Sheet and calculate the Total Net Asset Amount; provided, however, that if Seller prepares and delivers to Buyer the Closing Balance Sheet and the calculation of Total Net Asset Amount (together with all related work papers) within said 20 day period, then Buyer shall not have the right to prepare the Closing Balance Sheet or calculate the Total Net Asset and the terms and provisions of this ARTICLE II __ (including, without limitation, the other provisions of this  _Section 2.2_) shall continue to be applicable with respect to the Closing Balance Sheet and calculation of Total Net Asset Amount prepared by Seller. If Buyer prepares the Closing Balance Sheet and calculation of Total Net Asset Amount pursuant to the foregoing provision, then Seller shall have the same rights, pursuant to this _Section 2.2_, with respect to the Buyers calculations and Closing Balance Sheet items as Buyer would have had with respect to Sellers preparation of same and the provisions of _Section 2.2(b)_ and clause (i) of _Section 2.3_ shall apply mutatis mutandis, with the Buyer having the rights and obligations of Seller specified thereunder and vice versa. 

   

 (b) If the Buyer has any dispute with respect to the Total Net Asset Amount as calculated from the Closing Balance Sheet, the Buyer shall notify the Seller in writing of each disputed item, specifying the amount thereof in dispute and setting forth, in reasonable detail, the nature of such dispute and the basis therefor, within 60 days of the Sellers delivery of the Closing Balance Sheet to the Buyer. In the event of such a dispute, the Seller and the Buyer shall in good faith attempt to resolve any such dispute, and any resolution by them as to any disputed amounts shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties hereto for all purposes, including for purposes of  _ARTICLE XIII_ , with respect to the Total Net Asset Amount and the items covered thereby. If the parties are unable to resolve any such dispute within 30 days after notice is given by the Buyer to the Seller pursuant to the preceding sentence, the parties shall submit the items remaining in dispute for resolution to the Independent Accountant. Promptly, but no later than 30 days after the dispute is submitted to the Independent Accountant, the Independent Accountant shall determine, based solely on presentations by the Seller and the Buyer, and not by independent review, only those issues remaining in dispute and shall render a 

   ##### 

  

   

report as to the dispute and the resulting computation of the Total Net Asset
Amount and the adjustment or adjustments provided for in _Section 2.3_ based
on the Closing Balance Sheet, if any, which shall be final, binding and
conclusive on the parties. In resolving any disputed item, the Independent
Accountant shall be bound by the provisions of this _ARTICLE II_ and may not
assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item
claimed by either party or less than the smallest value for such item claimed
by either party. The fees, costs and expenses of the Independent Accountant
(i) shall be borne by the Buyer in the proportion that the aggregate dollar
amount of such remaining disputed items so submitted that are unsuccessfully
disputed by the Buyer (as finally determined by the Independent Accountant)
bears to the aggregate dollar amount of such items so submitted (taking into
account any offers of compromise made at least 10 days prior to submission to
the Independent Accountant) and (ii) shall be borne by the Seller in the
proportion that the aggregate dollar amount of such remaining disputed items
so submitted that are successfully disputed by the Buyer (as finally
determined by the Independent Accountant) bears to the aggregate dollar amount
of such items so submitted (taking into account any offers of compromise made
at least 10 days prior to submission to the Independent Accountant). Whether
any dispute is resolved by agreement among the parties or by the Independent
Accountant, changes to the Total Net Asset Amount shall be made hereunder
only for items which the Buyer has disputed as provided herein. The Seller and
the Buyer each shall make available to the other (upon the request of the
other) their work papers generated internally in connection with the
preparation or review of the Closing Balance Sheet. Any amounts payable
pursuant to this _ARTICLE II_ which are not in dispute (the amount otherwise
payable net of any disputed amount) shall be paid in accordance with _Section
2.3_, notwithstanding that other amounts may remain in dispute. 

   

 (c) As used in this Agreement, " _Independent Accountant_ " means RSM McGladrey, Inc., or in the event of a conflict, another nationally recognized independent public accounting firm that currently does not audit and has not audited within the past two years the Seller or the Buyer, or any of their respective Affiliates, as shall be agreed upon by the Seller and the Buyer or, if an agreement cannot be reached within 10 days of the expiration of the 30-day period set forth in the third sentence of _Section 2.2(b)_, as shall be selected by the American Arbitration Association upon the request of either the Seller or the Buyer. 

   

 Section 2.3 _Total Net Asset Amount Adjustment_. The Closing Balance Sheet and the calculation of Total Net Asset Amount shall be deemed final for the purposes of this _Section 2.3_ upon the earliest of (i) the failure of the Buyer to deliver to the Seller a notice of dispute within 60 days of the Sellers delivery of the Closing Balance Sheet to the Buyer, (ii) the resolution of all disputes, pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)_ , by the Seller and the Buyer, and (iii) the resolution of all disputes, pursuant to  _Section 2.2(b)_, by the Independent Accountant. Within three Business Days of the Closing Balance Sheet being deemed final, the adjustment or adjustments of the Base Purchase Price shall be made as follows: 

  

 (a) in the event that the Total Net Asset Amount calculated with respect to the Closing Balance Sheet exceeds USD 48,500,000, then the Buyer shall pay to the Seller the amount of such excess as set forth below; and 

    ##### 

  

     

 (b) in the event that the Total Net Asset Amount calculated with respect to the Closing Balance Sheet is less than USD 47,500,000, then the Seller shall pay to the Buyer the amount of such deficiency as set forth below. 

   

 Any payment required to be made pursuant to this _Section 2.3_ shall be made in cash within three Business Days of the final determination of any such adjustment or adjustments pursuant to the first sentence of this _Section 2.3_, such payment to be made by wire transfer in immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated by the party to which payment is due.

 (c) The Buyer shall be entitled, at its sole cost and expense, to have the Owned Real Property and Dixon, California Leased Property and the China Leased Property surveyed and to conduct physical inspections (but not invasive testing, sampling or any other similar procedures, without the Sellers prior written consent which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and subject to a written access agreement to be agreed by the parties) of the Owned Real Property and the Dixon, California Leased Property and the China Leased Property, and the improvements located thereon, at times that are reasonably acceptable to the Seller; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Seller expressly consents to the invasive testing at such Owned Real Property or Dixon, California Leased Property and the China Leased Property pursuant to protocols as mutually agreed by the Buyer and the Seller (which protocols shall be sufficient to permit the finalization of such studies by the Final Environmental Studies Delivery Date as provided in _Section 12.2(g)_ and pursuant to environmental sampling and data compilation procedure and scope which, at a minimum, shall include such procedures and scope as are in conformity with, or, if the Buyer and the Seller otherwise agree, the functional equivalent of, generally accepted standards of Phase I and Phase II environmental studies) (the " _Environmental Studies_ "). The Buyer shall provide not less than three Business Days prior notice to Seller of each proposed entry upon any such property and coordinate scheduling with Seller. Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Seller and its employees, agents and representatives, from and against any and all liabilities, costs and damages arising from any activities of the Buyer or its employees, agents or representatives in connection with diligence on the Owned Real Property or Dixon, California Leased Property and the China Leased Property prior to the Closing Date. The Buyer and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts promptly after the date hereof to develop mutually acceptable procedures and protocols to produce the Final Environmental Studies. 

  

 (d) The Buyer shall promptly provide the Seller with a draft of every Environmental Study prior to the finalization of such Environmental Study, and shall permit the Seller sufficient time to review and comment on such drafts prior to finalization, provided the Seller shall provide such comments within five Business Days of receipt. The Buyer shall not unreasonably refuse to incorporate the Sellers comments or corrections in any final Environmental Study, provided that such comments from the Seller shall be deemed accepted by the Buyer if the Buyer does not object to such comments within five Business Days of receipt. Upon conclusion of such review and comment period between the Buyer and the Seller, the Buyer shall promptly finalize and deliver to the Seller a copy of each final Environmental Study (the " _Final Environmental Studies_ "). In no event shall the Buyer have any right to deliver any Final Environmental Study after the earlier of the Closing Date or the Final Environmental Study Delivery Date. Any Environmental Matter identified in the Final Environmental Studies that either is (a) reasonably likely to be a violation of Environmental Law and such violation of 

   ##### 

  

    

Environmental Law was caused by the Seller or any of its Affiliates or,
assuming the Seller is currently the owner or the operator of such real
property, a violation for which the Seller would be responsible to remedy
under applicable Law or (b) reasonably likely to be a violation
of Environmental Law and such violation of Environmental Law materially and
adversely affects the operation of the Business Unit as operated on the
Closing Date, in the case of United States real property and the China
Closing Date, in the case of China real property, shall be an "
_Interim Period Environmental Issue_ " and shall be a Retained Liability
hereunder (except to the extent the Closing occurs following the exercise by
the Seller of its right to cap its aggregate liability for any Response
Actions to the Response Action Cap pursuant to _Section 14.1(g)_, in
which case, such Interim Period Environmental Issues shall become Assumed
Liabilities to the extent of any obligations or liabilities in excess of the
Response Action Cap). 

  

 (e) Any investigation by the Buyer shall be conducted in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the normal operations of the Business Unit, in accordance with any confidentiality requirements of the Seller and in accordance with applicable Law. 

  

 Section 6.2 _Operation of the Business Unit_. Except as contemplated by this Agreement or as indicated on _Section 6.2_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, during the period from the date hereof to the Closing Date and with respect to Q-Tech, the China Closing Date, the Seller and the Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to, and shall cause Q-Tech to, use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct the business of the Business Unit only in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices, and use commercially reasonable efforts (which shall not require payments of money to third parties outside of the ordinary course of business) to preserve intact the Business Unit and related relationships with distributors, customers, suppliers, and other third parties, and keep available the services of the present Business Unit Employees. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, except as otherwise contemplated by the Agreement or as described in _Section 6.2_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, between the date hereof and the Closing Date and, with respect to Q-Tech, the China Closing Date, as applicable, without the prior written consent of the Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and the granting of which shall comply with applicable Law, the Seller and the Parent, with respect to the Business Unit, shall not and shall cause Q-Tech not to: 

  

 (i) make any change in the outstanding capital stock of Q-Tech or the Seller or the certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or similar organizational documents of Q-Tech or the Seller;

 (iii) knowingly do any act, or knowingly omit to do any reasonable act, that will cause a material breach or default in any of the Material Contracts; 

  

 (iv) mortgage, pledge or grant a security interest in any of the U.S. Assets, the assets of Q-Tech or the China Equity Capital; 

   #####

 (vi) make any change to or increase the compensation paid (other than periodic raises in the ordinary course of business not exceeding the budgeted increases set forth in _Section 6.2_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, or as may be required under the Contracts existing as of the date hereof) or benefits offered by the Seller or Q-Tech to any of the Business Unit Employees other than with respect to the Retained Employees and other than pursuant to the Retention Agreements; 

  

 (vii) maintain insurance coverage at levels consistent with presently existing levels so long as such insurance is available at commercially reasonable rates; 

  

 (viii) (a) make, change or revoke any Tax election, (b) file any amendment to a Tax Return, (c) adopt or change in any material respect any Tax accounting method, (d) prepare any Tax Returns which include the income or assets of Q-Tech in a manner which is not consistent in all material respects with the past practice of the treatment of the items relating to Q-Tech and the Seller, or (e) enter into any settlement or closing agreement with a taxing authority, in each case except to the extent (1) required by applicable Law, (2) such item does not relate to either of Q-Tech or the Seller, or (3) as would not affect the amount of Tax for which the Buyer is otherwise responsible for pursuant to this Agreement; 

  

 (ix) plan, announce, implement or effect any reduction in force, lay-off, early retirement program, severance program or other program or effort concerning the termination of employment of Business Unit Employees (other than routine employee terminations for cause or due to poor performance); 

  

 (x) hire any new Business Employee with an annual base salary and annual target bonus opportunity in excess of USD 100,000 in the aggregate; or 

  

 (xi)enter into any agreement to do any of the foregoing. 

  

 Section 6.3 _Filings and Approvals_. 

  

 (a) The Seller and the Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to make, as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement but no later than January 5, 2010, all filings required by Law to be made by it to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (including all filings under the HSR Act). Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, the Seller shall cooperate with the Buyer with respect to all filings that the Buyer is required by Law to make in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 (b) The Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to make, as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement but no later than January 5, 2010, all filings required by Law to be made by it to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (including all filings under the HSR Act). Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, the Buyer 

   ##### 

  

    

shall cooperate with the Seller with respect to all filings that the Seller is
required by Law to make in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby. 

  

 (c) The Buyer and the Seller shall each request early termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act. 

  

 (d) Without limiting the foregoing, the Seller and the Buyer shall each use all reasonable best efforts to resolve any objections asserted by any Governmental Authority challenging the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Law. Such reasonable best efforts shall include an obligation by the Buyer to divest or hold separate any product line or business if necessary in order to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act or to obtain the relevant approvals under the HSR Act or any other competition or merger control Laws or to resolve or settle any objection or litigation of any Governmental Authority or to have lifted, vacated, reversed or overturned any Governmental Order;  _provided_ that the Buyer specifically shall not be required to so divest or hold separate any product line or business or to otherwise take any similar actions that would cause the HSR Commitment to exceed USD 5,000,0000. If efforts to resolve any objections are unsuccessful and any Governmental Authority institutes any Action challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Law, the Seller and the Buyer shall cooperate with each other and use reasonable best efforts to contest and resist vigorously any such Action and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of any such transactions and the Buyer shall reimburse the Seller, Q-Tech and the Parent for all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by either of them in connection with any such Action or in connection with any request for additional information or documentary material pursuant to HSR Act Section 18a(e)(1)(a) from any Governmental Authority; provided, however, that the Buyer shall only be responsible to reimburse the Seller for the attorneys fees of any legal counsel jointly engaged by the Buyer and the Seller. 

  

 Section 6.4 _No Negotiation_. Until such time, if any, as this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _ARTICLE XIV_ , the Seller and the Parent shall refrain, and shall cause each of their Affiliates to refrain from, either directly or indirectly, soliciting offers from, negotiating or entering into agreements with, any Person (other than the Buyer) to acquire, lease or license all or any part of the Business Unit, and from offering all or any part of the Business Unit to, any Person (other than the Buyer) other than as expressly permitted in _Section 6.2_ , and from providing to any such Person (other than the Buyer) access to the Business Units properties, books, records, financial statements, contracts and documents. 

  

 Section 6.5 _Confidentiality; No Hire_. The Seller, the Buyer and the Parent agree that the Confidentiality Agreement dated February 10, 2009 between the Buyer and the Parent (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") shall remain in full force and effect and binding upon the Seller and the Buyer (a) at all times prior to the Closing and (b) after any termination of this Agreement, and each agrees to comply with the terms of such Confidentiality Agreement. From the date hereof until November 18, 2011, the Buyer shall not hire (except upon the Closing) the Business Units president or any of his direct reports. From the date hereof until May 18, 2011, the Buyer shall not hire (except upon the Closing) any other employee of the Business Unit identified in the materials provided by the Seller with respect to the Business Unit or with whom 

   ##### 

  

    

the Buyer or its representatives have come into contact in connection with the
due diligence process or the transactions contemplated hereby, provided
however that hiring any such employees shall not constitute a violation of
the foregoing restriction if such hiring is a result of general solicitations
for employment. 

  

 Section 6.6 _Efforts to Satisfy Closing Conditions_. Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, (a) the Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consents necessary to assign each Material Contract and the consents set forth in _Section 6.6_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, and the Buyer agrees to reasonably cooperate with the Seller in obtaining any such consent (provided that neither party shall be required to pay any amounts in order to obtain such consents), and (b) the parties shall otherwise use reasonable best efforts to cause the conditions in _ARTICLE XII_ to be satisfied on or before the Closing Date. With respect to the preceding subsection (a) the Sellers efforts shall include communicating with the landlord of the Dixon, California leased premises, with regard to assignment of that lease and the appropriate form of assignment promptly after the date hereof, and not unreasonably withholding or delaying the Sellers agreement to any terms of such assignment provided by the landlord that are consistent with the terms of such lease existing on the date hereof. 

  

 Section 6.7 _Cooperation_. The parties hereto shall generally cooperate with each other and do such other acts and things in good faith as may be reasonable, necessary or appropriate timely to effectuate the intent and purposes of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Seller and Parent shall and shall cause Q-Tech to cooperate with the Buyer and the Chinese Buyer to obtain the China Approvals. 

  

 Section 6.8 _Zhang Retention Agreement_. The Buyer and the Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the execution and delivery by Jordan Zhang on a retention or employment agreement in substantially the form exchanged between the Buyer and the Seller most recently to the date hereof. If on the China Outside Date the China Closing has not occurred, the Buyer shall promptly reimburse Q-Tech for amounts paid to Jordan Zhang pursuant to such agreement (as agreed by the parties hereto) by Q-Tech (without regard to any amendment thereto, unless consented to by the Chinese Buyer). 

  

ARTICLE VII 

   

POST-CLOSING COVENANTS OF THE SELLER AND PARENT  

  

 The Seller and the Parent hereby covenant and agree with the Buyer as follows: 

  

 Section 7.1 _Noncompetition_. In the event of the Closing, then for a period of four (4) years after the Closing Date (the " _Noncompete Period_ "), the Parent shall not, and shall cause its controlled affiliates not to, sell, manufacture or distribute any of the Products set forth in _Section 7.1_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (the " _Competitive Products_ ") to customers anywhere in the world;  _provided_ that the foregoing restriction shall not restrict either the Parent or any of its controlled Affiliates from acquiring or combining with a business that provides, sells, manufactures or distributes Competitive Products (or providing, selling, manufacturing or distributing Competitive Products as a result of such acquisition or combination), so long as the 

   ##### 

  

    

sale of Competitive Products does not exceed 20% of the net annual sales of
the acquired business as of the date of acquisition or combination.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parent or any of its controlled Affiliates
may acquire or combine with a business or Person that has sales
of Competitive Products exceeding 20% of its net annual sales if the Parent
or such controlled Affiliate, as applicable, uses commercially reasonable
efforts to divest the portion of such business that sells such Competitive
Products within two (2) years after its acquisition. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the restrictions in this 
_Section 7.1_ shall not prohibit either the Parent or any of its controlled
Affiliates from (i) conducting any business conducted by such Person as of
the date of this Agreement (other than the business conducted by the Business
Unit), including, specifically, the business of the Sellers Compressor
Products International (CPI) business; (ii) selling any Competitive Product
after such time as the Buyer (including its successors and assigns with
respect to the Business Unit) ceases to sell or attempt to sell such
Competitive Product; (iii) holding or having an economic, non-controlling
interest in up to five percent (5%) of the outstanding issued share capital of
a company listed on any recognized national stock exchange; or (iv) at the
request of the Buyer, fulfilling for the benefit of the Buyer or on its
behalf any obligation pursuant to this Agreement or any agreement to be
entered into pursuant to this Agreement. The obligations of the Parent
and its controlled Affiliates pursuant to this _Section 7.1_ shall
terminate: (A) as to any such Affiliate, at such time as such Person ceases
to be a controlled Affiliate of the Parent; (B) as to any transferee of the
Parent or any of its controlled Affiliates that purchases a business
or division of the Parent or any of its controlled Affiliates, upon the
closing of such purchase; and (C) in the event of a change in control of the
Parent that would be required to be reported under Item 5.01 of Form 8-K
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The parties
agree, because damages would be an inadequate remedy, that a party seeking to
enforce this _Section 7.1_ may be entitled to specific performance and
injunctive relief as remedies for any breach thereof, in addition to other
remedies available at law or in equity. 

  

 Section 7.2 _Nonsolicitation of Hired Employees_. For the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the second anniversary of the Closing Date, neither the Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall solicit the employment of or employ any Hired Employee or any employee of Q-Tech as of the Closing Date, or engage any Hired Employee or any employee of Q-Tech as of the Closing Date as an independent contractor; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not prevent the Parent or any of its Affiliates from interviewing or hiring a Hired Employee or an employee of Q-Tech (i) who has responded to a job posting or advertisement in a publication of general circulation or a job-posting website, so long as such posting or advertisement is not specifically directed at or provided to the Hired Employees, (ii) whose employment with the Buyer is terminated for any reason (other than for cause) or (iii) with the Buyers prior written consent. 

  

 Section 7.3 _Modification of Covenants_. If a final judgment of a court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction determines that any term or provision contained in _Sections 7.1_ and  _7.2_ is invalid or unenforceable, then the parties agree that the court or tribunal will have the power (i) to reduce the scope, duration or geographic areas of the term or provision, (ii) to delete specific words or phrases and/or (iii) to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision. The Seller and the Parent acknowledge that _Sections 7.1_ and _7.2_ are reasonable and necessary to protect and preserve the Buyer and its 

   ##### 

  

    

Affiliates legitimate business interests and the value of the U.S. Assets and
Q-Tech and to prevent any unfair advantage conferred on the Seller and the
Parent and/or their Affiliates. 

  

 Section 7.4 _China Approval_. If the China Approval is not obtained prior to the Closing, the Closing shall nonetheless take place and, thereafter, the Parent and the Buyer shall cooperate in any lawful and reasonable arrangement reasonably proposed by the Buyer (not including the payment of any consideration) under which the Buyer shall obtain the economic claims, rights and benefits under, and shall bear all the costs, liabilities and burdens with respect to, the operation of Q-Tech (the equity ownership of which shall not be transferred to the Chinese Buyer until the China Closing Date and shall be held separate by the Parent until the China Approval is received at which time it shall be transferred to the Chinese Buyer); provided that the Buyer shall pay or satisfy all the costs, expenses, obligations and liabilities incurred by Q-Tech in connection with any such alternative arrangements (other than legal fees incurred by the Parent and Q-Tech in connection with documenting and negotiating such arrangement, which shall be borne by the Parent). Notwithstanding the provisions of the previous sentence, no cash or other consideration will be transferred between Q-Tech and the Parent, on one hand, and the Buyer and the Chinese Buyer, on the other hand, as contemplated in the previous sentence until the China Closing Date. During the period between Closing and the China Closing Date, the parties further agree to operate Q-Tech in accordance with the terms set forth in _Section 7.4_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule. In the event the failure to obtain the China Approval is the result of a failure by a party hereto to perform any covenants or agreements in this Agreement in connection with obtaining the China Approval, the non-defaulting party shall retain all its indemnity and other rights set out in this Agreement with respect to such failure to perform its agreements hereunder. If at any time, the Buyer, in its reasonable discretion determines that the China Approval is not obtainable with commercially reasonable efforts, and that the business of Q-Tech can be effectively transferred to the Buyer through the transfer of assets and the assumption of liabilities of Q-Tech, the Parent shall, upon the request of the Buyer, cooperate with all of the Buyers reasonable directives in that regard so as to effectively convey, directly or beneficially, the business of Q-Tech to the Chinese Buyer. 

  

 Section 7.5 _Further Assurances_. From and after the Closing, upon reasonable request of the Buyer or the Chinese Buyer, and at the Buyers or Chinese Buyers expense, the Seller and the Parent shall do, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such further acts, assurances, deeds, assignments, transfers, conveyances, and other instruments and papers as may be reasonably required to assign, transfer, convey and deliver to and vest in the Buyer ownership of the U.S. Assets, the China Equity Capital and the assets of Q-Tech consistent with the terms of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 7.6 _Payment by Chinese Buyer_. The Chinese Buyer will exercise its best endeavors to obtain the approvals required in order to pay the China Base Purchase Price Amount and China Cash Payment to the Parent as soon as allowed by Law after the China Closing Date. 

   #####

 (i) The Buyer shall not dispose of or destroy any of the books and records included in the U.S. Assets and shall cause Q-Tech not to dispose or destroy any of the books and records included in the assets of Q-Tech relating to periods prior to the Closing (" _Books and Records_ ") without first offering to turn over possession thereof to the Seller by written notice to the Seller at least 90 days prior to the proposed date of such disposition or destruction. 

  

 (ii) The Buyer shall allow the Seller and its agents access to all Books and Records on reasonable notice and at reasonable times at the principal places of the Business Unit or at any location where any Books and Records are stored, and the Seller shall have the right, at its own expense, to make copies of any Books and Records; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such access or copying shall be had or done in such a manner so as not to unduly interfere with the normal conduct of the Buyers businesses. 

  

 (iii) The Buyer shall make available to the Seller upon written request (A) the Buyers personnel to assist the Seller in locating and obtaining any Books and Records, and (B) any of the Buyers personnel whose assistance or participation is reasonably required by the Seller or any of its Affiliates in anticipation of or preparation for, or for depositions or testimony in, existing or future Actions or other matters in which the Seller or any of its Affiliates are involved. The Seller shall reimburse the Buyer for the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by it in performing the covenants contained in this _Section 8.1(a)(iii)_. 

  

 (iv) The Seller shall allow the Buyer and its agents to access any of the books and records, including, without limitation, any Tax Returns and information and documentation in support thereof, that relate directly or indirectly to the Business Unit in the Sellers possession, on reasonable notice and at reasonable times at any location where such books and records are stored and the Buyer shall have the right, at its own expense, to make copies of such books and records; provided, however, that any such access or copying shall be had or done in such a manner so as to not unduly interfere with the normal conduct of the Sellers business.

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) Provided that the Seller notifies the Buyer in writing prior to the expiration of the Information Maintenance Period, the Information Maintenance Period shall be extended in the event that any Action has been either commenced or is pending against the Seller or its Affiliates with respect to the Business Unit or threatened at the termination of such Information Maintenance Period, and such extension shall continue until any such Action has been settled through judgment or otherwise or is no longer pending or threatened. 

  

 Section 8.2 _Use of the Seller s Names or Reputation_. Except as specifically set forth herein, the Buyer and its Affiliates shall not operate the Business Unit utilizing, based on or taking advantage of the trademarks, tradenames, servicemarks, or the name, reputation or corporate goodwill of the Parent, the Seller or any of its Affiliates (including, but not limited to, the names "EnPro" and "Coltec"), except for the limited purposes of the sale and use of products and related literature in existence as of the Closing Date and otherwise for a reasonable period as may be necessary for the Buyer to remove the Sellers names (not included in the U.S. Assets) from use in and by the Business Unit, which the Buyer will accomplish as soon as is reasonably practicable, but no later than 180 days after the Closing Date. 

  

 Section 8.3 _Performance Bonds and Guarantees_. 

  

 (a) Prior to the Closing, the Buyer agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Seller to be relieved of the performance bonds, surety bonds, bank guarantees, letters of credit and/or corporate guarantees relating to the Business Unit as listed in _Section 8.3_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (or in the case of corporate guarantees, the Buyer itself), in each case reasonably satisfactory to the Seller, to replace (or, to the extent required, as described above, to collateralize) any performance bonds, surety bonds, bank guarantees, letters of credit and/or corporate guarantees given by the Seller or any of its Affiliates in respect of the Business Unit (in each case, or portions thereof) remaining outstanding on the Closing Date with respect to which the Seller or any of its Affiliates will have any liability after the Closing. To the extent that the Seller and its Affiliates are not absolutely and unconditionally relieved of all such liabilities and obligations on or prior to the Closing Date, the Buyer agrees to continue to take any and all commercially reasonable actions necessary to absolutely and unconditionally relieve the Seller and its Affiliates of all such liabilities and obligations as promptly as practicable after the Closing Date and in any event shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller in connection with any damage or liability suffered by it in connection with any such obligation not released on or before the Closing Date, except for the Retained Liabilities. 

  

 (b) To the extent the Buyer was not notified prior to Closing by the Seller of any performance bonds, surety bonds, bank guarantees, letters of credit and/or corporate guarantees required to be replaced or collateralized in accordance with _Section 8.3(a)_, the Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to replace or collateralize any such performance bonds, surety bonds, bank guarantees, letters of credit and/or corporate guarantees as promptly as practicable following notification of the existence of any such performance bonds, surety bonds, bank guarantees, letters of credit and/or corporate guarantees so as to absolutely and unconditionally relieve Seller and its Affiliates of all liabilities and obligations thereunder and in any event shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller in connection with any damage or liability suffered by it in connection with any such obligation not released on or before the Closing Date. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 8.4 _Waiver of Bulk Sales Act_. The Buyer and the Seller waive compliance with any applicable bulk sale or bulk transfer law or other analogous legislation in force in any jurisdiction of the United States in which the U.S. Assets are located. The Seller shall be responsible for any liability resulting from its failure to comply with any such sale or bulk transfer law. 

  

 Section 8.5 _Air Perfection_. The Seller shall fulfill its obligations under the Air Perfection Escrow Agreements pursuant to the terms thereof, and the obligation to pay the retention amounts to which the Air Perfection Escrow Agreements relate shall be a Retained Liability. In the event the Air Perfection Employees agree in a writing, a copy of which has been received by the Buyer, to satisfy the Air Perfection Indemnity Claims by releasing a portion of the escrow thereunder to the Seller, the Seller shall have the right to do so in accordance with such writing and the retention amounts owed by the Seller to such Air Perfection Employees pursuant to the Air Perfection Escrow Agreements shall be reduced by the amount consented to by the Air Perfection Employees in such writing. The Seller shall authorize payment under the Air Perfection Escrow Agreement on May 23, 2010 pursuant to the terms thereof and the rights to any remaining escrow amount (after any indemnity release mentioned in the preceding sentence), including the escrow funds, not payable to the Air Perfection Employees shall be the property of the Buyer and the Seller shall release the same to the Buyer to the extent it has the right to do so pursuant to the Air Perfection Escrow Agreement. 

  

ARTICLE IX 

   

FURTHER COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES  

  

 Section 9.1 Nonassignable Contracts and Permits. 

  

 (a) Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as an attempt to assign to the Buyer any Contract, Environmental Permit or Permit which is by Law or its terms nonassignable or the assignment of which would constitute a violation of Law or Contract. 

  

 (b) If, as of the Closing, an attempted assignment of any Contract related to the Business Unit would be ineffective or would affect either the Sellers rights thereunder so that the Buyer would not in fact receive all such rights, the Seller shall cooperate with the Buyer in a mutually acceptable arrangement, at the Sellers cost, to provide for the Buyer the benefit (including the economic benefit) of such Contract (other than legal title). If and so long after the Closing as such assignment shall not have been made, the Seller shall (i) to the extent that such action shall not result in violation of such Contract, transfer to the Buyer all assets and rights, including all monies, received in respect of such Contract, to the extent the same would otherwise have been U.S. Assets, and hold such Contract in trust for the Buyer, and (ii) to the extent that the provisions of clause (i) above are not sufficient to transfer all of the benefits (including the economic benefit) of such Contract (other than legal title), or any such Contract has been cancelled as a result of the attempted assignment, take such actions (which, without limitation, may include entering into subcontracting arrangements with the Buyer) as are commercially reasonable to provide all of the benefits (or the equivalent thereof, including the economic benefit) of such Contract (other than legal title), to the extent the same would 

   ##### 

  

    

otherwise have been U.S. Assets to the Buyer. With respect to any transfer,
subcontract or assignment of the Contracts made to the Buyer by the Seller
hereunder, the Buyer hereby agrees to assume, perform, discharge when due,
and indemnify the Seller from and against all obligations and liabilities of
the Seller with respect to the applicable underlying Contract. Nothing in
this  _Section 9.1_ shall be deemed to limit the Buyers assumption of the
Assumed Liabilities with respect to any Contract. 

  

 (c) The Buyer shall obtain, at its own expense, on or prior to the Closing (or as soon thereafter as practicable), all non-assignable material Permits and all non-assignable material Environmental Permits required by any Governmental Authority with respect to the U.S. Assets, Q-Tech or the Business Unit, in each case, without any guaranty or liability of the Seller with respect thereto, whether material or immaterial. Subsequent to the Closing, the Seller shall have the right to cancel any such non-assignable Permits and Environmental Permits and bonds or guarantees related thereto which are applicable to the U.S. Assets, Q-Tech or the Business Unit but are unable to be assigned within 180 days following the Closing.

Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 9.5_ to the contrary, if the Seller has exercised its right to cap the aggregate expense of all Response Actions pursuant to _Section 14.1(g)_, then the Seller shall be responsible for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the Response Actions to the extent, but not in excess of, USD 5,000,0000 (the " _Response Action Cap_ ").

Action within the time prescribed by applicable Law; provided, further,
however, that if the Seller has exercised its rights under _Section 14.1(g)_

 (c) The Buyer shall indemnify the Seller Parties and hold them harmless from and against all Damages that are incurred or suffered by them (i) by reason of, relating to or resulting from (A) the breach by the Buyer of any of the representations or warranties made by the Buyer herein or (B) in the event of the Closing, any breach of any of the representations or warranties made by the Buyer herein as though made on the Closing Date (unless such representation or warranty expressly relates to an earlier date, in which case it will be deemed made on such date), (ii) by reason of, or resulting from the failure by the Buyer to perform or comply with any of its covenants or agreements herein, or (iii) by reason of, or resulting from the failure to pay, discharge or satisfy the Assumed Liabilities. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of the Closing, each representation and warranty made by the Buyer in this Agreement shall be deemed made on the Closing Date, unless such representation or warranty expressly relates to an earlier date, in which case it will be deemed to be made on such date. 

   

 (d) Any recovery by the Seller Parties for indemnification pursuant to _Section 13.2(c)_ shall be limited as follows: (i) the Seller Parties shall not be entitled to any recovery unless a claim for indemnification is made in accordance with _Section 13.3_, so as to constitute a Valid Claim Notice; (ii) the Seller Parties shall not be entitled to recover any amount for indemnification claims under _Section 13.2(c)(i)_, except to the extent that the amount of Damages for all such breaches exceeds the Deductible, in which event (subject to clause (iii) below) the entire amount that the Seller Parties are entitled to recover in respect of such Damages in excess of the Deductible shall be payable; and (iii) the maximum amount recoverable by the Seller Parties for indemnification claims under _Section 13.2(c)(i)_ shall in the aggregate be equal to an amount equal to the Cap; provided that neither the Deductible nor the Cap shall apply to any breach of any representations or warranties set forth in _Section 5.1_ (Organization; Good Standing), _Section 5.2_ (Approval) and _Section 5.8_ (Fees), as to which the Buyer will be liable in full from the first dollar. No Damages shall be included in determining whether the Deductible has been reached unless a Valid Claim Notice seeking indemnification for such Damages has been given by the Seller to the Buyer in accordance with  _Section 13.3(b)_. None of the limitations set forth in this _Section 13.2(d)_ shall apply to any indemnification claims under _Section 13.2(c)(ii)_, or _Section 13.2(c)(iii)_. 

   

 Section 13.3 _Procedures for Claims_. 

  

 (a) (i) In order for an indemnified party to be entitled to any indemnification provided for under this _ARTICLE XIII_ in respect of, arising out of or involving a claim made by any third party, including a Governmental Authority, against the indemnified party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the indemnified party must notify the indemnifying party in writing of the Third Party Claim (a " _Third Party Claim Notice_ ") promptly following receipt by such indemnified party of written notice of the Third Party Claim, which notification, to be a valid Third Party Claim Notice, with the effect set forth in _Section 13.1_ and _Section 13.2_ (a " _Valid Third Party Claim Notice_ "), must be accompanied by a copy of the notice of the third party claimant to the indemnified party asserting the Third Party Claim; _provided_ , that the failure to provide such notice promptly (so long as a Valid Third Party Claim Notice is given before the expiration of the applicable period set forth in _Section 13.1_) shall not affect the obligations of the indemnifying party hereunder except to the extent the indemnifying party is prejudiced thereby. The indemnified party shall deliver to the indemnifying party copies of all other notices and documents (including court papers) received by the indemnified party relating to the Third Party Claim. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (ii) The indemnifying party shall have the right to defend against any such Third Party Claim (including to conduct any proceedings or settlement negotiations) with counsel of its own choosing if (A) the indemnifying party provides written notice to the indemnified party that the indemnifying party intends to undertake such defense, (B) the indemnifying party conducts the defense of the Third Party Claim actively and diligently with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party, and (C) if the indemnifying party is a party to the Third Party Claim, the indemnified party has not determined, reasonably and in good faith, after consultation with legal counsel, that joint representation would be inappropriate because of a conflict of interest. The indemnified party shall have the right to participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim and to employ its own counsel (it being understood that, if all of the conditions set forth in clauses (A) to (C) above remain satisfied, the indemnifying party shall control such defense), at the indemnified partys own expense. Prior to the time the indemnified party is notified by the indemnifying party as to whether the indemnifying party will assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the indemnified party shall take all actions reasonably necessary to timely preserve the collective rights of the parties with respect to such Third Party Claim, including responding timely to legal process. If the indemnifying party shall decline to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim (or shall fail to notify the indemnified party of its election to defend such Third Party Claim) within 30 days after the giving by the indemnified party to the indemnifying party of a Valid Third Party Claim Notice with respect to the Third Party Claim or if any of the conditions set forth in clauses (A) to (C) above are no longer satisfied, the indemnified party shall defend against the Third Party Claim and the indemnifying party shall be liable to the indemnified party for all reasonable fees and expenses incurred by the indemnified party in the defense of the Third Party Claim, including the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel employed by the indemnified party, if and to the extent that the indemnifying party is responsible to indemnify for such Third Party Claim. Regardless of which party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the parties agree to cooperate with one another in connection therewith. Such cooperation shall include providing records and information that are relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees and officers available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder and to act as a witness or respond to legal process. Whether or not the indemnifying party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the indemnified party shall not admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such Third Party Claim without the indemnifying partys prior written consent. If the indemnifying party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, no compromise or settlement of such claim may be effected by the indemnifying party without the indemnified partys consent unless (A) there is no finding or admission of any violation of Law or any violation of the rights of any Person and no material adverse effect on the indemnified party with respect to any other claims that may be made against it, (B) the sole relief provided is monetary damages, is fully paid by the indemnifying party, and (C) the indemnified party is fully released. Notwithstanding anything in this  _Section 13.3(a)(ii)_ to the contrary, if such third party claim would give rise to Damages and less than 50% of such Damages are indemnifiable by the indemnifying party pursuant to this  _ARTICLE XIII_ because of the Deductible or the Cap, the indemnified party may elect to retain control of such defense, and the indemnifying party shall be responsible for the cost and expense of the indemnified party to the extent required pursuant to this _ARTICLE XIII_. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) In order for an indemnified party to be entitled to any indemnification provided for under this _ARTICLE XIII_ in respect of a claim that does not involve a Third Party Claim being asserted against such indemnified party (an " _Other Claim_ "), the indemnified party must promptly notify the indemnifying party in writing of such Other Claim (the " _Other Claim Notice_ "), which notification, to be a valid Other Claim Notice, with the effect set forth in  _Section 13.1_ and _Section 13.2_ (a " _Valid Other Claim Notice_ "), must certify that the indemnified party has in good faith already sustained some (though not necessarily all) or will sustain Damages with respect to such claim. The failure by any indemnified party to notify the indemnifying party promptly (so long as a Valid Other Claim Notice is given before the expiration of the applicable period set forth in _Section 13.1_) shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability that it may have to such indemnified party under _Section 13.2_ , except to the extent that the indemnifying party has been prejudiced by such failure. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in respect of any Asbestos Claim, the procedures set forth in _Section 13.3_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule shall apply. 

   

 Section 13.4 _Environmental Indemnification_. 

  

 (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _ARTICLE XIII_ , the Buyer agrees that the Buyers right to indemnification pursuant to _Section 13.2(a)_ as a result of breaches of representations and warranties contained in _Section 4.20_ (Environmental Matters) or with respect to Retained Liabilities (but only with respect to subsections (vi) and (vii) of the definition thereof) (collectively, " _Environmental Breach_ "), shall be the sole and exclusive remedies (including any contribution Action) of the Buyer with respect to any Environmental Matters whatsoever. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _ARTICLE XIII_ , the Seller agrees that the Sellers right to indemnification pursuant to _Section 13.2(a)_ with respect to Assumed Liabilities (but only with respect to subsections (x) of the definition thereof), shall be the sole and exclusive remedies (including any contribution Action) of the Seller with respect to any Environmental Matters whatsoever. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding any provisions herein to the contrary, in respect of any Environmental Breach for which a Valid Claim Notice has been submitted by an indemnified party, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to undertake and control all Remedial Action with respect thereto, and the indemnified party shall be entitled to participate fully in all substantive deliberations regarding the Environmental Breach and any Remedial Action with respect thereto. The Seller shall only be responsible for Remedial Actions that are required to be undertaken by an Environmental Law and only for such Remedial Action as represents the least stringent response required by an Environmental Law based on the use of the property as of the Closing Date and may include the imposition of institutional or engineering controls provided that such controls do not result in any material interference with the operation of the Business Unit as of the Closing Date. As used in this Agreement, " _Remedial Action_ " means the defense of any Action, the investigation, removal or remediation of Hazardous Materials, and the obtaining of any Environmental Permits, all to the extent arising under, and required by, any Environmental Law. 

    ##### 

  

     

 Section 13.5 _Other Provisions_. 

  

 (a) Except for (i) claims of fraud or (ii) as otherwise expressly provided in the Ancillary Documents (and then only with respect to breaches of that Ancillary Document and not this Agreement), the indemnification provided in this _ARTICLE XIII_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by the Parent, the Seller or the Buyer in this Agreement or otherwise with respect to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section 13.5(a)_ shall not prevent any party from pursuing remedies of specific performance or injunctive relief, declaratory judgment or any other non-monetary equitable remedies available to them under applicable Law. All amounts payable by one party in indemnification of the other shall be considered an adjustment to the Base Purchase Price. 

   

 (b) In no event shall the Buyer, the Parent or the Seller be liable for loss of profits, diminution in value, punitive or consequential damages incurred by an indemnified party hereunder, it being understood that the Buyer, the Parent and the Seller shall only be liable for such damages (subject to the limitations on liability set forth in this _ARTICLE XIII_ ) to the extent loss of profits, diminution in value, punitive or consequential damages that are incurred or suffered by a third party and payable by the indemnified party with respect to the Third Party Claim of such third party; provided, however that for purposes of this Agreement, in the event of a breach of this Agreement by the Buyer that causes the Closing not to occur, the Seller may recover, to the extent the Seller satisfies its burden of proof of damages under applicable Law, the difference between the Purchase Price and the amount received by the Seller in a subsequent sale of the Business Unit or other appropriate measures of direct damages to compensate the Seller for the loss of the benefit of its bargain. 

   

 (c) Upon making any payment to an indemnified party for any indemnification claim under this Agreement, the indemnifying party shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment (an " _Indemnification Payment_ "), to any rights which the indemnified party or its Affiliate may have against any other parties (excluding the Buyers and its Affiliates rights under any insurance policies) with respect to the subject matter underlying such indemnification claim. The indemnified party and its Affiliates shall cooperate with the indemnifying party in the pursuit of such rights and shall promptly turn over to the indemnifying party any payments (up to the amount of the Indemnification Payment) received in respect of such rights. 

   

 (d) The amount of any Damages shall be computed net of any recoverable insurance proceeds from a third party insurance company that is not an Affiliate of the indemnified party or any of its Affiliates and any Tax benefits to be actually received by the indemnified party in connection therewith. 

   

 (e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Buyer shall have no right to any indemnification under this _ARTICLE XIII_ for any matter if the Total Net Asset Amount calculated with respect to the Closing Balance Sheet was reduced for such matter (to the extent of such reduction). 

    ##### 

  

     

 (f) All breaches of representations or warranties shall, for purposes of calculating Damages under _Section 13.2(a)_ and _Section 13.2(c)_, be determined without giving effect to any qualification in the representations and warranties of the Seller, the Buyer or the Chinese Buyer as to materiality, in all material respects, Material Adverse Effect, Buyer Material Adverse Effect or words of similar effect. For the avoidance of doubt, such qualifications shall be given effect for the purposes of determining whether a breach of a representation or warranty has occurred. 

   

 (g) The parties agree that the following matters shall be deemed, without any further action by the parties, disclosed by the Seller as exceptions to each representation in _ARTICLE IV_  (whether or not there currently is a Seller Disclosure Schedule with respect to such a representation) for all purposes, including indemnification: 

   

 (i) Matters arising between the date hereof and the Closing Date and, with respect to Q-Tech between the date hereof and the China Closing Date, that result from or relate to the matters set forth in subsections (a) through (g) of the definition of "Material Adverse; and 

  

 (ii) Any action taken or not taken by the Seller at the Buyers request or with the Buyers consent, in which case the action (and such action only) shall be deemed disclosed, but the consequences of such action shall be deemed disclosed only to the extent disclosed to the Buyer prior to undertaking such action; 

  

 (iii) Consequences of the Sellers or Q-Techs inability to enter into a transaction as a result of the Buyers withholding of a consent requested of the Buyer pursuant to Section 6.2. 

  

 (h) In the event of Closing, then as of the China Closing Date, Q-Tech hereby releases the Seller and its Affiliates from any and all claims, debts, liabilities, and causes of action, of whatever kind or nature, known or unknown and the Seller and its Affiliates releases Q-Tech from any and all claims, debts, liabilities, and causes of action, of whatever kind or nature, known or unknown, in each case, except for Intercompany Trade Accounts Payable and Intercompany Trade Accounts Receivable.

   ##### 

  

    

decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and non-appealable (any
such order, decree, ruling or other action, a " _Final Order_ "); provided
that the party seeking to terminate this Agreement shall have used all
reasonable best efforts to challenge such order, decree, ruling or other
action; or (ii) if the Effective Time shall not have occurred on or
before June 18, 2010 (the " _Outside Date_ "), provided, that, a party may
not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 14.1(b)(ii)_ if its
failure to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement results in the
failure of the Effective Time to occur by such time, provided, however, that
the Outside Date shall be extended day-by-day for each day during which any
party shall be subject to a nonfinal order, decree, ruling or action
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (excluding with respect to the purchase and
sale of the China Equity Capital), provided further, however, that the
Outside Date shall not be extended past August 18, 2010; 

  

 (c) by the Seller, if the Buyer breaches any provision of this Agreement, including a failure to perform a covenant or a misrepresentation (disregarding all materiality and Buyer Material Adverse Effect qualifications), and such breach or misrepresentation both (i) remains uncured for a period of 30 days after the Buyer receives written notice of such breach, and (ii) would, or would likely constitute a Buyer Material Adverse Effect; 

  

 (d) by the Buyer, if the Seller breaches any provision of this Agreement, including a failure to perform a covenant or a misrepresentation (disregarding all materiality and Material Adverse Effect qualifications), and such breach or misrepresentation both (i) remains uncured for a period of 30 days after the Seller receives written notice of such breach, and (ii) would, or would likely constitute a Material Adverse Effect; 

  

 (e) by the Buyer at any time a Material Adverse Effect exists; 

  

 (f) by the Seller at any time a Buyer Material Adverse Effect exists; or 

  

 (g) by the Buyer, if the Seller exercises its right to cap the Sellers obligation for the costs and expenses of the Response Action as provided in this _Section 14.1(g)_. The Seller shall have the right to limit its obligation to pay all costs and expenses associated with the Response Actions to an aggregate amount of USD 5,000,000, by providing the Buyer with a written notice to that effect at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date; _provided,_   _however_ , that the Seller shall be afforded ten (10) Business Days from the delivery of the Final Environmental Studies to the Seller prior to the exercise of its right under this _Section 14.1(g)_ ; _provided further,_ (i) if the Seller is unable to, or otherwise does not, give at least five (5) Business Days notice as provided in this Section, the Closing Date, at the election of the Buyer, shall be postponed so as to permit no less than five (5) Business Days between the date of such notice and the Closing Date, and (ii) the Closing Date shall be postponed, as necessary, to provide the Seller such ten (10) Business Day period after delivery of the Final Environmental Studies.

 (a) The terminating party shall give prompt written notice thereof to the other parties, and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be abandoned, without further action by any of the parties hereto; 

  

 (b) All further obligations of the parties hereunder shall terminate, except that the obligations in _Sections 6.5_ (Confidentiality; No Hire), _15.3_ (Public Announcements), _15.8_ (Governing Law) and _15.12_ (Expenses) hereof shall survive; 

  

 (c) All filings, applications and other submissions relating to the transactions contemplated herein shall, to the extent practicable, be withdrawn from the agency or other Person to which made; and 

  

 (d) In the event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in _Section 14.1_, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other party or parties specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is made, and this Agreement (except as set forth in _Section 14.2(b)_) shall forthwith become null and void, and there shall be no liability on the part of the Seller, the Buyer and the Parent; provided, however, that nothing in this _Section 14.2_ shall relieve any party from liability for any breach (occurring prior to any such termination) of any of the covenants, representations or agreements set forth in this Agreement. 

  

 (e) To the extent that the Seller notifies the Buyer in writing no less than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date of the existence of a Material Adverse Effect (describing the Material Adverse Effect in reasonable detail) and the Seller qualifies its representations and warranties therein by stating that such Material Adverse Effect has occurred (which would cause one of the Buyers conditions to close the transactions contemplated hereby not to be fulfilled and would give the Buyer the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 14.1(c))_ and the Buyer nonetheless closes the transactions contemplated hereby, then, the Buyer may not seek indemnification hereunder with respect to such Material Adverse Effect; provided, however, that if the Seller is unable to, or otherwise does not, give at least five (5) Business Days notice as provided in this Section the Closing Date, at the election of the Buyer, shall be postponed so as to permit no less than five (5) Business Days between the date of such notice and the Closing Date.

Unless the context requires otherwise, the words "include," "including" and variations thereof mean "including, without limitation," and the words "hereof," "hereby," "herein," "hereunder" and similar terms refer to this Agreement as a whole and not any particular Section or Article in which such words appear.
