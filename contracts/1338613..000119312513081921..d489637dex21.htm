of evaluating the merits and risks of its investment in the Contributed Interests and is capable of bearing the economic risk of such investment. Regency is an &#147;accredited investor&#148; as that term is defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D
(without regard to Rule 501(a)(4)) promulgated under the Securities Act. The Regency Parties are acquiring the Contributed Interests for investment for their own account and not with a view toward or for sale in connection with any distribution
thereof, or with any present intention of distributing or selling the Contributed Interests. Neither of the Regency Parties has any Contract or arrangement with any Person to sell, transfer or grant participations to such Person or to any third
Person, with respect to the Contributed Interests. The Regency Parties acknowledge and understand that (i)&nbsp;the acquisition of the Contributed Interests has not been registered under the Securities Act in reliance on an exemption therefrom and
(ii)&nbsp;the Contributed Interests will, upon such acquisition, be characterized as &#147;restricted securities&#148; under state and federal securities laws. The Regency Parties agree that the Contributed Interests may not be sold, transferred,
offered for sale, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of except (A)&nbsp;in accordance with the requirements of the SUGC Company Agreement or (B)&nbsp;pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act or pursuant to an
available exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, and in compliance with other applicable state and federal securities laws. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:8%"><FONT

and the business, properties, prospects, and financial condition of the Company (to the extent the Contributor possessed such information). The foregoing, however, does not modify the representations and warranties of the Contributor in <U>Article
