Pipeline will execute and deliver to the Regency Parties, the following
documents, so long as all of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ (other
than those conditions which by their terms are only capable of being satisfied
at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or due waiver of those
conditions) have been satisfied or waived by the Party or Parties entitled to
waive such conditions:

(i) _Gomez Lateral_. A Conveyance and Bill of Sale and an Assignment of
Easement, Rights of Way, and Permits providing for the conveyance of the Gomez
Lateral by ETC Texas Pipeline to Southern Union Gas Services, Ltd.,
substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit G_ .

 



4 2.5 _Contribution Consideration Adjustment._

 

(a) The " _Contribution Consideration Adjustment Amount_ " shall be an amount
determined as follows:

 

(i) The Contribution Consideration Adjustment Amount shall be increased by the
amount (if any) by which the Net Working Capital of the Acquired Companies on
a consolidated basis as of the Closing Date (" _Closing Date Net Working
Capital_ ") exceeds $0 (the " _Net Working Capital Threshold_ ");

 

(ii) The Contribution Consideration Adjustment Amount shall be decreased by
the amount (if any) by which the Net Working Capital Threshold exceeds the
Closing Date Net Working Capital;

(iii) The Contribution Consideration Adjustment Amount shall be decreased by
the amount (if any) by which the Long-Term Debt of the Acquired Companies on a
consolidated basis as of the Closing Date (" _Closing Date Long-Term Debt_ ")
exceeds $0 (the " _Long-Term Debt Threshold_ ");

(iv) The Contribution Consideration Adjustment Amount shall be increased by
the amount (if any) by which the Capex Amount exceeds the Base Capex Amount;

(v) The Contribution Consideration Adjustment Amount shall be decreased by
the amount (if any) by which the Base Capex Amount exceeds the Capex Amount;
and

(vi) The Contribution Consideration Adjustment Amount shall be decreased by
the Estimated Preceding Quarter Distribution Amount (if any) and the Estimated
Pro Rata Closing Quarter Distribution Amount, in each case as determined in
accordance with _Sections 2.6(a)_ or _(b)_.

(b) Not later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Contributor shall prepare and deliver to Regency a preliminary settlement
statement (the " _Estimated Adjustment Statement_ ") setting forth (i) an
estimated consolidated balance sheet of the Acquired Companies as of the
Closing Date, which balance sheet was prepared in accordance with GAAP,
applied consistently with the Acquired Companies past practices (including
its preparation of the Company Financial Statements) (the " _Estimated
Closing Date Balance Sheet_ ") based on the most recent financial information
of the Acquired Companies reasonably available to the Contributor, (ii) a
calculation of the difference, if any, between the Net Working Capital shown
on the Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet (" _Estimated Net Working Capital_
") and the Net Working Capital Threshold, (iii) a calculation of the
difference, if any, between the Long-Term Debt shown on the Estimated Closing
Date Balance Sheet (" _Estimated Closing Date Long-Term Debt_ ") and the Long-
Term Debt Threshold, (iv) a calculation of the difference, if any, between the
estimated Capex Amount and the Base Capex Amount, (v) an estimated
calculation of the Estimated Preceding Quarter Distribution Amount, if any,
and the Estimated Pro Rata Closing Quarter Distribution Amount; and (vi) an
estimated calculation of the Contribution 

 



5  Consideration Adjustment Amount. The Estimated Adjustment Statement shall be
prepared consistent with a methodology agreed to by the Parties for the
preparation of the Estimated Adjustment Statement. Regency shall have the
right, following Regencys receipt of the Estimated Adjustment Statement, to
object thereto by delivering written notice to the Contributor no later than
two Business Days before the Closing Date. To the extent Regency timely
objects to the Estimated Adjustment Statement (or any component thereof),
Regency and the Contributor shall attempt to resolve their differences;
_provided_ that, if Regency and the Contributor are unable to resolve any
such dispute prior to the Closing Date, then the Contributors calculations
as reflected in the Estimated Adjustment Statement shall control for purposes
of all payments to be made at Closing. To the extent Regency and the
Contributor resolve any of their differences prior to the Closing, then the
Parties shall jointly agree on a revised Estimated Adjustment Statement that
will control for purposes of the payments to be made at the Closing. The
estimated Contribution Consideration Adjustment Amount that controls for
purposes of the payments to be made at the Closing is referred to herein as
the " _Estimated Contribution Consideration Adjustment Amount_." If the
Estimated Contribution Consideration Adjustment Amount is (i) a positive
number, then the Cash Consideration to be distributed by Regency at Closing
shall be increased by the amount of the Estimated Contribution Consideration
Adjustment Amount or (ii) a negative number, then the Cash Consideration to
be distributed by Regency at Closing shall be reduced by the absolute value of
the Estimated Contribution Consideration Adjustment Amount.

(c) As promptly as practicable after the Closing, but in no event later than
45 days following the Closing Date, the Contributor shall prepare and deliver
to Regency a statement (the " _Final Adjustment Statement_ ") setting forth
(i) a consolidated balance sheet of the Acquired Companies as of the Closing
Date, which balance sheet will be prepared using the same accounting methods,
policies, practices and procedures used in the preparation of the Estimated
Closing Date Balance Sheet (the " _Final Closing Date Balance Sheet_ ") based
on the most recent financial information of the Acquired Companies reasonably
available to the Contributor, (ii) a calculation of the difference, if any,
between the Net Working Capital shown on the Final Closing Date Balance Sheet
and Estimated Net Working Capital, (iii) a calculation of the difference, if
any, between the Closing Date Long-Term Debt shown on the Final Closing Date
Balance Sheet and Estimated Closing Date Long-Term Debt, (iv) a calculation of
the difference, if any, between the actual Capex Amount and the estimated
Capex Amount, and (v) the final calculation of the Contribution Consideration
Adjustment Amount; provided, however, that the calculation of the difference
between the Actual Preceding Quarter Distribution Amount and the Estimated
Preceding Quarter Distribution Amount and the calculation of the difference
between the Actual Pro Rata Closing Quarter Distribution Amount and the
Estimated Pro Rata Closing Quarter Distribution Amount shall be determined in
accordance with _Section 2.6(c)_ and  _Section 2.6(d)_, respectively. The
Final Adjustment Statement shall be prepared consistent with the methodology
and example agreed to by the Parties for the preparation of the Estimated
Adjustment Statement. In order for the Contributor to prepare the Final
Closing Date Balance Sheet and the calculations required in the Final
Adjustment Statement, Regency and the Acquired Companies shall, and Regency
shall cause the Acquired Companies to, (i) permit the Contributor and
its Representatives to have reasonable access during normal business hours to
the books, records and other documents (including working papers, schedules,
financial statements, memoranda, etc.) (the " _Books and Records_ ") of
the Acquired Companies, and shall cooperate with the Contributor and its
Representatives in seeking to obtain work papers from

 



6  Regency and the Acquired Companies, reasonably necessary for the preparation
of the Final Closing Date Balance Sheet and such calculations, and provide the
Contributor with copies thereof (as reasonably requested by the Contributor)
and (ii) provide the Contributor and its Representatives with reasonable
access during normal business hours to the Acquired Companies employees and
accountants as reasonably requested by the Contributor. At any time during
the 30-day period following receipt of the Final Adjustment Statement (the "
_Review Period_ "), Regency may deliver to the Contributor a written report
containing any changes that Regency proposes be made to the Final Adjustment
Statement, accompanied with any such supporting documentation, if available,
and describing in reasonable detail the basis for the proposed changes (such
written report, an " _Objection Notice_ "). Upon Regencys request, the
Contributor shall provide to Regency and its Representatives such
documentation and other data, and, during normal business hours, access to its
officers, employees, agents and other personnel as is reasonably necessary to
enable Regency and its Representatives to appropriately review the Final
Closing Balance Sheet and Final Adjustment Statement. Regency shall be deemed
to have waived any rights to object to the Final Adjustment Statement unless
Regency delivers an Objection Notice to the Contributor within the Review
Period and, if the Review Period expires without Regency so delivering an
Objection Notice, then the Final Adjustment Statement shall become final and
binding for all purposes of this Agreement. If Regency delivers an Objection
Notice to the Contributor during the Review Period, then the Contributor and
Regency shall negotiate in good faith to resolve their disagreement and to
agree on the amount of the actual Contribution Consideration Adjustment
Amount. If the Contributor and Regency cannot reach agreement within 30 days
after the date on which Regency delivered such Objection Notice to the
Contributor, then the Contributor and Regency shall refer the
remaining disputed matters necessary to the final determination of the
Contribution Consideration Adjustment Amount to BDO, or if BDO is unable or
unwilling to perform its obligations under this _Section 2.5(c)_, such other
nationally-recognized independent accounting firm as is mutually agreed on by
the Contributor and Regency (the " _Accounting Firm_ "). The Accounting Firm
shall, if requested by the Contributor and Regency, resolve any disputes under
this  _Section 2.5(c)_. Each Party shall deliver simultaneously to the
Accounting Firm (i) the Objection Notice and such work papers, invoices and
other reports and information relating to the disputed matters as the
Accounting Firm may request and (ii) such Partys proposed resolution of the
disputed matters and any materials it wishes to present to justify the
resolution it so presents. Each Party shall be afforded the opportunity to
discuss the disputed matters with the Accounting Firm. The Accounting Firm
shall act as an expert (and not as an arbitrator) for the limited purpose of
determining the specific items identified by the Contributor and Regency as
being items that are in dispute, and whether and to what extent, if any, the
Contribution Consideration Adjustment Amount requires adjustment as a result
of the resolution of those disputed matters (applying GAAP consistently with
the Acquired Companies past practices). The Accounting Firm may not award
damages or penalties and shall not have authority to address matters not in
dispute between the Contributor and Regency or not necessary to the
determination of the final Contribution Consideration Adjustment Amount. The
Accounting Firms determination shall be made within 30 days after submission
of the disputed matters to the Accounting Firm and shall be final and binding
on all Parties, without right of appeal. In determining the proper amount of
the Contribution Consideration Adjustment Amount, the Accounting Firm shall
not increase the Contribution Consideration Adjustment Amount more than the
increase proposed by the Contributor nor decrease the Contribution
Consideration Adjustment Amount more than the decrease proposed

 



7  by Regency, as applicable. Each Party shall each bear its own legal fees and
other costs of presenting its case to the Accounting Firm. The Contributor and
Regency shall each bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the Accounting
Firm incurred in resolving such disputed matters. The Contribution
Consideration Adjustment Amount as finally determined pursuant to this
_Section 2.5(c)_ shall be referred to as the " _Final Contribution
Consideration Adjustment Amount_."

(d) Within five days after the earlier of (i) the expiration of the Review
Period without delivery of any Objection Notice and (ii) the date on which the
Contributor and Regency, or the Accounting Firm, as applicable, finally
determine the Final Contribution Consideration Adjustment Amount (A) if the
Final Contribution Consideration Adjustment Amount exceeds the Estimated
Contribution Consideration Adjustment Amount (such excess, the " _Contributor
Adjustment Distribution_ "), Regency shall wire transfer in
immediately available funds an amount equal to the Contributor Adjustment
Distribution to an account designated by the Contributor and (B) if the
Estimated Contribution Consideration Adjustment Amount exceeds the Final
Contribution Consideration Adjustment Amount (such excess, the " _Regency
Adjustment Contribution_ "), the Contributor shall wire transfer in
immediately available funds an amount equal to the Regency Adjustment
Contribution to an account designated by Regency. 

2.6 _Pro Ration of Distributions._

 

(a) If the Closing occurs after the last day of the calendar quarter (the "
_Preceding Quarter_ ") immediately prior to the calendar quarter (the "
_Closing Quarter_ ") in which the Closing Date occurs but prior to the Record
Date for the distribution in respect of the Preceding Quarter, then at the
Closing, the Estimated Contribution Consideration Adjustment Amount (and
therefore the Cash Consideration) shall be reduced by (i) an amount equal to
the product of (a) the number of Acquired Common Units multiplied by (b) $0.46
(unless prior to the Closing, Regency shall have declared its cash
distribution in respect of the Preceding Quarter, in which event such number
in this clause (b) shall be the cash distribution amount declared per Regency
Common Unit) (such aggregate amount being referred to herein as the "
_Estimated Preceding Quarter Distribution Amount_ ") and (ii) an amount equal
to the product of (A) the number of Acquired Common Units multiplied by (B)
$0.46 multiplied by (C) a fraction, (1) the numerator of which is the number
of days in the Closing Quarter commencing on the first day of the Closing
Quarter and ending on and including the Closing Date and (2) the denominator
of which is the total number of days in the Closing Quarter (such aggregate
amount calculated in accordance with this clause (ii) being referred to herein
as the " _Estimated Pro Rata Closing Quarter Distribution Amount_ ").

 

(b) If the Closing occurs after the Record Date for the cash distribution by
Regency on its Common Units in respect of the Preceding Quarter, then at the
Closing, the Estimated Contribution Consideration Adjustment Amount (and
therefore the Cash Consideration) shall be reduced by an amount equal to the
Estimated Pro Rata Closing Quarter Distribution Amount, and no
adjustment shall be made pursuant to _Section 2.6(a)_.

(c) If the Closing occurs within the period specified in  _Section 2.6(a)_,
unless the actual declared per unit distribution in respect of the Preceding
Quarter is used to determine the

 



8  Estimated Preceding Quarter Distribution Amount, then not later than the
second Business Day following Regencys declaration of its cash distribution
in respect of the Preceding Quarter, Regency shall prepare and deliver to the
Contributor a calculation of the Actual Preceding Quarter Distribution Amount
(as defined below). Within two Business Days after such delivery, (i) if the
Actual Preceding Quarter Distribution Amount exceeds the Estimated Preceding
Quarter Distribution Amount, then the Contributor shall wire transfer in
immediately available funds the amount of such excess to an account designated
by Regency and (ii) if the Estimated Preceding Quarter Distribution Amount
exceeds the Actual Preceding Quarter Distribution Amount, then Regency shall
wire transfer in immediately available funds the amount of such excess to an
account designated by the Contributor.

 

(d) Not later than the second Business Day following Regencys declaration of
its cash distribution in respect of the Closing Quarter, Regency shall
prepare and deliver to the Contributor a calculation of the Actual Pro Rata
Closing Quarter Distribution Amount (as defined below). Within two Business
Days of such delivery, (i) if the Actual Pro Rata Closing
Quarter Distribution Amount exceeds the Estimated Pro Rata Closing Quarter
Distribution Amount, the Contributor shall wire transfer in immediately
available funds an amount equal to such excess to an account designated by
Regency and (ii) if the Estimated Pro Rata Closing Quarter Distribution
Amount exceeds the Actual Pro Rata Closing Quarter Distribution Amount,
Regency shall wire transfer in immediately available funds an amount equal to
such excess to an account designated by the Contributor.

(e) " _Actual Preceding Quarter Distribution Amount_ " means the product of
(i) the number of Acquired Common Units multiplied by (ii) the actual per-
unit cash distribution amount declared on the Regency Common Units in respect
of the Preceding Quarter.

(f) " _Actual Pro Rata Closing Quarter Distribution Amount_ " means the
product of (i) the number of Acquired Common Units multiplied by (ii) the
actual per-unit cash distribution amount declared on the Regency Common Units
in respect of the Closing Quarter multiplied by (iii) a fraction, (A) the
numerator of which is the number of days in the Closing Quarter commencing on
the first day of such quarter and ending on and including the Closing Date
and (B) the denominator of which is the total number of days in the Closing
Quarter.

2.7 _Adjustment to Contribution Consideration_. All adjustments to the Cash
Consideration pursuant to this Agreement and amounts paid pursuant to _Section
2.6_ shall be deemed to be adjustments to the Final Contribution
Consideration.

2.8 _Borrowing by Regency; Tax Treatment of Regency Contribution
Consideration_. Prior to the Closing, but no more than ninety (90) days prior
to the Closing, Regency shall incur a new and separate borrowing (which may be
in the form of a new credit facility, senior debt or any combination thereof)
that will be used by Regency exclusively to pay the Cash Consideration, as
adjusted, and other expenses or disbursements directly related to the Closing
(the " _Regency Debt_ ") and Regency Subsidiary Guarantor shall enter into
the Guarantee of Collection with Regency with respect to the Regency Debt. In
the event Regency receives the proceeds from the Regency Debt prior to the
Closing, such proceeds shall be deposited and held separate from other cash
items of Regency until distributed to Contributor at the time of the Closing.
Immediately prior to the effective time of the Closing, PEPL Holdings shall
enter into

 



9  the Support Agreement with Regency Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to which
PEPL Holdings shall provide contingent residual support to Regency Subsidiary
Guarantor (on a nonrecourse basis to Contributor) with respect to Regency
Subsidiary Guarantors obligations to Regency under the Guarantee of
Collection to support the payment of the Regency Debt. The Parties intend that
for United States federal income tax purposes (i) the contribution of the
Contributed Interests shall be treated as a contribution by Contributor to
Regency of the assets of the Company (and the assets of the Subsidiaries of
the Company that are also treated as disregarded entities of Contributor) in
a transaction consistent with the requirements of Section 721(a) of the Code;
(ii) the receipt by Contributor of the Cash Consideration shall be treated as
a distribution to Contributor by Regency under Section 731 of the Code; (iii)
the distribution of the Cash Consideration to Contributor shall be made out of
the proceeds of the Regency Debt and shall qualify as a "debt-financed
transfer" under Section 1.707-5(b) of the Treasury Regulations; and
(iv) Contributors allocable share of the Regency Debt under Sections 1.752-2
and 1.707-5(a)(2)(i) of the Treasury Regulations shall be the allocable amount
of the Regency Debt as determined under Section 1.707-5(b)(2) of the
Treasury Regulations. Accordingly, such consideration is not expected to be
taken into account in determining whether Contributor received money or other
consideration for disguised sale purposes. Any Cash Consideration in excess of
the amount treated as a "debt-financed transfer" shall be treated (i) as a
reimbursement of Contributors preformation expenditures with respect to the
assets of the Company (and the assets of the Subsidiaries of the Company)
within the meaning of Section 1.707-4(d) of the Treasury Regulations to the
extent applicable (accordingly, such cash is not expected to be taken into
account in determining whether Contributor received money or other
consideration for disguised sale purposes), and (ii) in a transaction subject
to treatment under Section 707(a) of the Code, and its implementing Treasury
Regulations, as in part a sale, and in part a contribution, by Contributor of
the assets of the Company (and the assets of the Subsidiaries of the Company)
to the extent Section 1.707-4(d) of the Treasury Regulations is inapplicable.
The Parties agree to file all Tax Returns and otherwise act at all times in a
manner consistent with this intended treatment of the contribution of the
Contributed Interests, the Cash Consideration, and the Regency Debt, including
disclosing the distribution of the Cash Consideration in accordance with the
requirements of Section 1.707-3(c)(2) of the Treasury Regulations; 
_provided_ that, notwithstanding the foregoing, Regency shall not be required
to take any position in any taxable year to the extent Regency determines in
good faith after consulting with tax counsel that such position is not
supported by current law or actual facts and circumstances. Contributor shall
reimburse Regency and its Affiliates for all of their costs and expenses
(including legal fees) relating to a new credit facility (but not for a debt
offering) as contemplated by this  _Section 2.8_. Contributor agrees that it
shall be solely liable for any Taxes attributable to the receipt by
Contributor of the Cash Consideration and the Acquired Units.

duly

 



10  qualified, registered or licensed to do business as a foreign entity and is
in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the property owned, leased or
operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so duly qualified,
registered or licensed and in good standing would not reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or to prevent or materially delay
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents
to which the Contributor is, or will be, a party or to materially impair the
Contributors ability to perform its obligations under the
Transaction Documents to which it is, or will be, a party. The Contributor

against the Contributor in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws relating to or affecting
creditors rights generally and subject, as to enforceability, to
legal principles of general applicability governing the availability of
equitable remedies, including principles of commercial reasonableness, good
faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether such enforceability is
considered in a Proceeding in equity or at law) (collectively, " _Creditors 
Rights_").

3.3 _Non-Contravention._  

(a) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.3(a)_ of the Contributor Disclosure
Schedule, the execution, delivery and performance by the Contributor of the
Transaction Documents to which the Contributor is, or will be, a party and the

right of termination, cancellation, modification, amendment or acceleration
(with or without the giving of notice, or the passage of time or both) under
any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any Contract to which

termination, cancellation, modification, amendment or acceleration as would
not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or
prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by the Transaction Documents to which the Contributor is, or will be, a party
or to materially impair the Contributors ability to perform its obligations
under the Transaction Documents to which it is, or will be, a party.

 

(b) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.3(b)_ of the Contributor Disclosure
Schedule, the execution, delivery and performance of the Transaction

and the consummation by the Contributor of the transactions contemplated
thereby does not and will not: (i) result in any breach or violation of
any provision of the Organizational Documents of any Acquired Company; (ii)
constitute a breach, violation or default (or an event that with the giving of
notice or the passage of time or both would give rise to a breach, violation
or default) under, or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation,
modification, amendment or acceleration (with or without the giving of notice,
or the passage of time or both) under any of the terms, conditions or
provisions of any Contract to which any Acquired Company is a party or by
which any property or assets of the Acquired Companies are bound or affected;

asset of the Acquired Companies; or (v) cause any Acquired Company to become
subject to, or to become liable for the payment of, any Tax, except, in the
cases of clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv), for such breaches, violations,
defaults or rights of termination, cancellation, modification, amendment or
acceleration or Liens, as would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

 

3.4 _Governmental Approvals._ Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.4_ of the
Contributor Disclosure Schedule, no declaration, filing or registration with,
or notice to, or authorization, consent or approval of, any Governmental
Authority is necessary for the consummation by the Contributor of the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents to which it is, or
will be, a party, other than (a) filings under the HSR Act; (b) filings,
notices, and approvals required by the FCC pursuant to the Communications Act

authorizations, consents or approvals that have been obtained or made or that
would in the ordinary course be made or obtained after the Closing, or which,
if not obtained or made, would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect or to prevent or materially delay the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents to which
the Contributor is, or will be, a party or to materially impair the
Contributors ability to perform its obligations under the Transaction
Documents to which it is, or will be, a party.

Interests and the business, properties, prospects, and financial condition of
the Company (to the extent the Contributor possessed such information). The
foregoing, however, does not modify the representations and warranties of the
Contributor in _Article III_ and such representations and warranties
constitute the sole and exclusive representations and warranties of the
Contributor to the Regency Parties in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

that would result in the nonsatisfaction of a condition precedent to the
Regency Parties obligation to consummate this Agreement, the Regency Parties,
at their option, may either terminate this Agreement or proceed to close this
Agreement on the Closing Date, in which event the Contributor shall pay or
assign to the Regency Parties (together with the amount of any deductible or
self-insured retention) the proceeds from any insurance policies covering the
assets or properties subject to the Material Casualty Event to the extent such
proceeds are received by or payable to the Contributor and have not been used
in or committed to the restoration or replacement of the assets or properties
subject to the Material Casualty Event as of the Closing Date. This _Section
5.15_ will provide the exclusive remedy for each of the Parties for any and
all claims relating (directly or indirectly) to any Material Casualty Event.

5.16 _Non-Compete_

(a) During the three (3) year period following the Closing Date, Contributor
shall not, and shall cause the Contributors Affiliates not to, directly or
indirectly, in any of the geographic areas identified on _Schedule 5.16_
(each, a " _Restricted Area_ "): (i) acquire, own any interest in, control, or
operate a natural gas gathering, treating, processing, compression or storage
system (a " _Competing Business_ ") or (ii) for the purpose of conducting or
engaging in a Competing Business, call upon, solicit, advise or otherwise do,
or attempt to do, business with any clients, suppliers, customers or
accounts relating to the business of the Acquired Companies. The preceding
sentence shall not apply in the case of Contributors or any of Contributors
Affiliates acquisition, directly or indirectly, of an entity or a business
(the " _Acquisition Target_ ") that includes a Competing Business in the
event that (A) Contributor or Contributors Affiliate makes an Offer (as
defined herein) and complies fully with the provisions of  _Section 5.16(b)_
or (B) Contributor makes a good faith determination that the portion of such
Acquisition Target constituting the Competing Business is not commercially
reasonably separable from the Acquisition Target, taken as a whole, and the
Competing Business constitutes less than 15% of the Acquisition Targets
assets or operations;

(b) (i) If Contributor or any of Contributors Affiliates acquires an
Acquisition Target that includes a Competing Business subject to the
noncompetition provisions of _Section 5.16(a)_, then not later than six (6)
months after the consummation of the acquisition by Contributor or any of
Contributors Affiliates of the Acquisition Target that includes such
Competing Business, Contributor shall notify Regency in writing of such
acquisition and offer Regency the opportunity to purchase such Competing
Business in accordance with this _Section 5.16(b)_ (the " _Offer_ "). The
Offer shall set forth preliminary terms relating to the sale and purchase of
the Competing Business. As soon as practicable, but in any event within sixty
(60) days after receipt of the Offer, Regency shall notify Contributor in
writing that either (A) Regency has elected, with the approval of the Regency
Conflicts Committee, not to purchase the Competing Business, in which event
Contributor or Contributors Affiliates, as applicable, shall be forever free
to continue to own or operate such Competing Business, or (B) Regency has
elected to 

 



47  negotiate the purchase of the Competing Business, in which event the
procedures outlined in this _Section 5.16(b)(ii) and (iii)_ shall apply. In
the event that Regency fails to deliver a written notice pursuant to _Section
5.16(b)(i)(A)_ or _(B)_ within sixty days after receipt of the Offer or after
giving such written notice fails to consummate the purchase of the Competing
Business, Regency shall be deemed to have elected not to purchase the
Competing Business with the approval of the Regency Conflicts Committee, and
Contributor or Contributors Affiliates, as applicable, shall be forever free
to continue to own or operate such Competing Business.

(ii) If Contributor or Contributors Affiliates, as applicable, and Regency
(with the concurrence of the Regency Conflicts Committee) are able to agree
on the fair market value of the Competing Business that is subject to the
Offer and the other terms of a definitive agreement within sixty (60) days
after Contributors receipt of Regencys election to negotiate the purchase
of the Competing Business, Regency shall purchase the Competing Business for
the agreed upon fair market value and other terms as soon as commercially
practicable after such definitive agreement has been reached.

(iii) If Contributor or Contributors Affiliates, as applicable, and Regency
are unable to agree on the fair market value of the Competing Business or the
other terms of a definitive agreement within sixty (60) days after
Contributors receipt of Regencys election to negotiate the purchase of the
Competing Business, Contributor and Regency will engage a mutually agreed
upon, nationally recognized investment banking firm to determine the fair
market value of the Competing Business and/or the other terms on which
Contributor and Regency are unable to agree. Such investment banking firm
will determine the fair market value of the Competing Business and/or the
other terms on which Contributor and Regency are unable to agree within thirty
(30) days of its engagement and furnish Contributor and Regency
its determination. Once the investment banking firm has submitted its
determination of the fair market value of the Competing Business and/or the
other terms on which Contributor and Regency are unable to agree, Regency will
have the right, but not the obligation, subject to the approval of the
Regency Conflicts Committee, to purchase the Competing Business that is
subject to the Offer on the agreed-upon terms and as otherwise determined by
the investment banking firm. If Regency elects to purchase the Competing
Business, then it shall purchase, and Contributor shall sell (or cause
Contributors Affiliates to sell, if applicable) the Competing Business on the
agreed-upon terms and as otherwise determined by the investment banking firm
as soon as commercially practicable after such determination and the fees of
the investment banking firm will be split equally between Contributor and
Regency. If Regency fails to elect to purchase the Competing Business within
fifteen (15) days of the receipt of such terms from the investment banking
firm, (i) Regency will be deemed to have elected, with the approval of the
Regency Conflicts Committee, not to purchase the Competing business, (ii) the
fees of the investment banking firm will be paid solely by Regency and (iii)
Contributor or Contributors Affiliates, as applicable, shall be forever free
to continue to own or operate such Competing Business.

 

(c) In the event that the covenants in this _Section 5.16_ shall be
determined by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable by
reason of its extending for too great of time or over too great a geographical
area or by reason of its being too extensive in any other respect, they shall
be interpreted to extend only over the maximum period of time for which they
may be enforceable and/or over the maximum geographical area as to which they
may be enforceable and/or to the maximum extent in all other respects as to
which they may be enforceable, all as determined by such court in such action.

  



48 (d) Contributor acknowledges that a breach of the covenants contained in
this  _Section 5.16_ will cause irreparable damage to the Regency Parties,
the Company, their Subsidiaries or their businesses, the exact amount which
will be difficult to ascertain, and that remedies at law for any such breach
will be inadequate. Accordingly, Contributor agrees that if it, its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates breach any of the covenants contained in this
_Section 5.16_, in addition to any other remedy which may be available at law
or in equity, Regency shall be entitled to specific performance and
injunctive relief, without posting a bond or any other security.

(e) Each of ETE, ETP and Holdco severally agrees (and agrees to cause its
respective Affiliates) to comply with the terms and conditions of this
_Section 5.16_. Each of ETE and ETP is executing this Agreement for the sole
purposes of agreeing to this  _Section 5.16_ and _Section 5.20_. Holdco is
executing this Agreement for the sole purposes of agreeing to this _Section
5.16_ and _Section 5.9_.

 

5.17 _Hedges._ Contributor shall terminate on or prior to Closing any hedges,
swaps, collars or any other derivative contracts that hedge against the price
of any commodity or interest rate with respect to the Acquired Companies.

5.18  _Employee Matters._

(a) Following the date hereof and prior to the Closing Date, Regency shall, or
shall cause the Acquired Companies or another Affiliate of Regency to offer
to employ as a direct employee of Regency, the Acquired Companies or another
Affiliate of Regency each employee of Contributor (i) who is assigned to, and
devotes substantially all of his or her time to, providing services to the
Acquired Companies, each of whom shall be identified by Contributor in a list
to be provided to Regency within thirty (30) days after the Execution Date
(collectively, the " _Dedicated Employees_ "), which list shall include the
name, title, business location and annual compensation of each Dedicated
Employee, (ii) who devotes some, but less than substantially all, of his or
her time to providing services to the Acquired Companies, each of whom
Contributor and Regency shall identify by mutual agreement prior to the
Closing Date (collectively, the " _Shared Employees_ "), and (iii) who,
without regard to whether he or she is a Dedicated Employee or a Shared
Employee, is listed in _Schedule 5.18(a)(iii)_ of the Contributor Disclosure
Schedule (collectively, the " _Listed Employees_ ", and together with the
Dedicated Employees and Shared Employees, the " _Offered Employees_ "). Such
offers shall be for employment with substantially the same title and position,
and with (i) a base pay or salary rate at least equal to the base pay or
salary rate as in effect with respect to each such Offered Employee
immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii) bonus opportunities and
employee benefits no less favorable in the aggregate than the bonus
opportunities and employee benefits offered or provided to similarly situated
employees of Regency and its Affiliates. Both the offers from Regency or its
Affiliates and any acceptances thereof by the Offered Employees shall be
contingent upon the consummation of the transaction contemplated in this
Agreement and effective upon the Closing Date. Offered Employees who accept
such offers of employment from Regency or its Affiliates are referred to
herein as " _Transferred Employees_." Such employment of Transferred Employees
as direct employees of Regency, the Acquired Companies or another Affiliate
of Regency (as applicable) shall commence effective as of the Closing Date.

 



49 (b) For a period of at least 12 months following the Closing Date, Regency
shall, or shall cause the Acquired Companies or another Affiliate of Regency
to, provide each Transferred Employee with (i) a base pay or salary rate at
least equal to the base pay or salary rate as in effect with respect to such
Transferred Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii) bonus
opportunities and employee benefits no less favorable in the aggregate than
the bonus opportunities and employee benefits offered or provided to similarly
situated employees of Regency and its Affiliates. The Transferred Employees
shall receive credit for all periods of employment and/or service with
Contributor and its Affiliates prior to the Closing Date for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual under all plans, programs and
arrangements made available to such Transferred Employees, except for purposes
of benefit accruals under defined benefit pension plans unless required by
Applicable Law. For the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs,
each Transferred Employee will accrue an amount of vacation time equal to
that which a similarly situated employee of Regency and its Affiliates (with
tenure that includes all of such Transferred Employees periods of employment
and/or service with Contributor and its Affiliates prior to the Closing Date)
would accrue under the policies of Regency and its Affiliates.

(c) Regency shall be responsible for all continuation coverage under Section
601 et seq. of ERISA (" _COBRA Obligations_ ") and any state continuation
coverage requirements accrued after the Closing Date with respect to
the Transferred Employees and their beneficiaries, provided such Transferred
Employees enroll in a group health plan sponsored by Regency or one of its
Affiliates. Contributor agrees that it shall retain responsibility for COBRA
Obligations to all employees and their beneficiaries who are not Transferred
Employees for whom a "qualifying event" under COBRA occurs or has occurred.

(d) Regency shall not assume or otherwise be responsible for any liability,
claim, loss, severance, bonus or benefit accrued or owed under any Company
Benefit Plan or otherwise with respect to any employee that (1) does not
become a Transferred Employee, irrespective of the date of accrual of such
liability, or (2) becomes a Transferred Employee, only to the extent such
liability, claim, loss, severance, bonus or benefit has accrued on or prior
to the Closing Date. Contributor and not Regency shall be responsible for any
severance payments that become due under any Company Benefit Plan of
Contributor or its Affiliates to an employee whose employment with Contributor
or its Affiliates is terminated in conjunction with the transaction
contemplated in this Agreement either because (1) the employee is not an
Offered Employee and, as such, does not receive an offer of employment from
Regency the Acquired Companies or another Affiliate of Regency or (2) the
Offered Employee receives an offer of employment from Regency, the Acquired
Companies or another Affiliate of Regency, but elects not to accept such
offer.

 

(e) In the event that any Transferred Employee is required to forfeit equity
in Contributor or one of Contributors Affiliates in order to accept an offer
of employment from Regency, Regency shall use commercially reasonable best
efforts to ensure that such Transferred Employee(s), receives equity in
Regency or one of its Affiliates of substantially equal value.

 

(f) Nothing herein express or implied by this Agreement shall (i) confer upon
any employee, including but not limited to any Offered Employee or
Transferred Employee, or legal representative thereof, any rights or remedies,
including any right to employment or benefits for any specified period, of any
nature or kind whatsoever, under or by reason of this Agreement, or (ii) be
deemed to amend any employee benefit plan of Contributor, Regency or any of
their Affiliates.

 



50 5.19 _Use of the Company s Names and Marks._

 

(a) With respect to the phase-out of the use of the Companys Names and Marks,
the Regency Parties agree as follows: (i) as soon as practicable following
the Closing, but in no event later than ten Business Days after Closing,
Regency shall, and after the Closing shall cause the Acquired Companies to,
change the names of the Acquired Companies to a name that does not include
any of Companys Names and Marks or comprise any colorable imitations thereof;
and (ii) as soon as practicable following the Closing, but in no event later
than 90 days after Closing, Regency shall, and after the Closing shall cause
the Acquired Companies to, cease and permanently discontinue any and all uses
of any of the Companys Names and Marks and any colorable imitations thereof,
and remove or cover all of the Companys Names and Marks from or on,
or destroy, any publications, signage, corporate letterhead, invoices,
stationery, business cards, marketing materials, website content or other
materials in the Companys possession or under its control bearing any of the
Companys Names and Marks (other than any existing correspondence, files,
contracts and other similar instruments and any Books and Records that bear
the Companys Names or Marks), and provide Contributor with written
confirmation thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Regency shall have a
period of up to twelve (12) months from the Closing to cause the Acquired
Companies to permanently remove the Companys Names and Marks from pipeline
markers on the assets of the Acquired Companies. 

(b) In no event shall Regency or any of its Affiliates (including, after
Closing, the Acquired Companies) use any of the Companys Names and Marks
after Closing in any manner or for any purpose different from the use of such
of the Companys Names and Marks by the Acquired Companies preceding the
Closing, and none of them shall affix or include any of the Companys Names
and Marks, or any colorable imitations thereof, on any publications, signage,
corporate letterhead, invoices, stationery, business cards, marketing
materials, website content or other materials that are created or produced
after the Closing.

(c) Regency expressly acknowledges and confirms that Contributor is not
transferring or assigning, and Regency shall not receive, any right, title or
interest in or to the Companys Names and Marks, except the limited right to
use for the sole purpose of permitting Regency to complete the phase-out in
strict compliance with this  _Section 5.19_. Furthermore, all use of the
Companys Names and Marks hereunder during the phase-out period shall be at
all times subject to Contributors direction and control and any and all use
thereof by Regency or the Acquired Companies hereunder shall inure to the
exclusive benefit of Contributor, and Buyer shall, and after the Closing shall
cause the Acquired Companies to, comply with Contributors instructions and
direction at all times.

 

5.20 _Shared Services_. __The Parties will cooperate in good faith to
negotiate, on mutually agreed upon terms, definitive documentation regarding
items listed on _Exhibit F_.

 



51 5.21 _Release from Credit Support Instruments._ Regency shall
use commercially reasonable best efforts to, and shall cause its Affiliates
to use commercially reasonable best efforts to, secure the unconditional
release, as of the Closing Date, of Contributor and its Affiliates from the
credit support instruments set forth in _Schedule 5.21_ to the extent, but
only to the extent, that such instruments provide credit support to any of the
Acquired Companies (the " _Acquired Companies Credit Support_ "), including
effecting such release by providing guarantees or other credit support for
obligations of the Acquired Companies, and Regency shall use commercially
reasonable best efforts to, and shall cause its Affiliates to use commercially
reasonable best efforts to, be substituted in all respects for Contributor
and each of its Affiliates that provide the Acquired Companies Credit Support,
so that Regency shall be solely responsible for the obligations of such
Acquired Companies Credit Support. Contributor shall use its commercially
reasonable best efforts to assist Regency in its efforts to secure the release
of the Acquired Companies Credit Support; _provided_ that Regencys failure to
effect any such release by providing guarantees or other credit support for
obligations of the Acquired Companies shall relieve Contributor from its duty
to assist Regency in such efforts with respect to any such release. To the
extent Regency is unable to obtain release for any Acquired Companies
Credit Support as of the Closing, Regency shall indemnify Contributor and its
Affiliates for any and all Losses arising from or relating to the Acquired
Companies Credit Support Instruments arising after the Closing Date. In the
event that any Acquired Companies Credit Support has not been terminated and
Contributor or any of its Affiliates has not been released as of the Closing
Date, Contributor and/or such Affiliate shall be permitted to terminate such
Acquired Companies Credit Support as promptly as possible under the terms of
each applicable credit support instrument.

5.22 _Delivery of Audited 2012 Financial Statements_. Contributor shall
deliver to Regency as soon as reasonably practicable but no later than March
31, 2013 true and complete copies of audited consolidated balance sheets of
the Acquired Companies as of December 31, 2012 and the related audited
statements of operations, changes in parent equity and cash flows for the year
ended December 31, 2012 (collectively, the " _Audited 2012 Financial
Statements_ "). Between the Execution Date and the Closing Date, Contributor
shall deliver to Regency as soon as reasonably practicable after the end of
each fiscal quarter (but no later than forty (40) days after the end of each
fiscal quarter) of the Acquired Companies unaudited consolidated balance
sheets of the Acquired Companies as of the end of each such quarter and the
related unaudited statements of operations, changes in parent equity and cash
flows for the period then ended, in each case with SAS 100 reviews by the
appropriate Audit Firm.

5.23 _Contributor Capital Expenditure Budget_. __No later than five (5) days
prior to the end of each calendar quarter between the Execution Date and the
Closing Date, Contributor shall deliver to the Regency Parties a detailed
capital expenditure budget for the following calendar quarter in a form
substantially similar to the information with respect to the first calendar
quarter of 2013 that is contained in Schedule 3.11(c) of the Contributor
Disclosure Schedules.

further_ that the Deductible applicable to Losses arising in respect of
_Sections 3.9_ and _4.8_ shall be $2,000,000.

_Section 4.15_ ( _Taxes_ ) and _Section 4.16_ ___(Employee Benefits;
Employment and Labor Matters)_ shall survive the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and shall continue in full force and effect until ninety (90)
days after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, including
any extensions thereof (which shall be deemed to be the Expiration Date with
respect to such representations and warranties) and (C) any covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement that by their terms are to be performed
after the Closing Date shall survive until fully discharged. 

(ii) No action for a breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty
contained herein (other than representations or warranties that survive for a
longer period or indefinitely pursuant to the proviso to _Section 8.3(d)(i)_)
shall be brought after the Expiration Date, except for claims of which a Party
has received a Claim Notice setting forth in reasonable detail the claimed
misrepresentation or breach of warranty with reasonable detail, prior to the
Expiration Date.

(iii) For purposes of this _Article VIII_ , all qualifications of the
representations and warranties contained in _Article III_ and _Article IV_ by
materiality (whether by reference to the terms "material," "Company Material
Adverse Effect," "Regency Material Adverse Effect"), other than those
contained in _Section 3.10(b)_ and _Section 4.9(c)_, shall be disregarded.

 

(e) _Calculation of Losses_.

(i) In calculating amounts payable to any Contributor Indemnitee or Regency
Indemnitee (each such person, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") for a claim for
indemnification hereunder, the amount of any indemnified Losses shall be
determined without duplication of any other Loss for which an indemnification
claim has been made or could be made under any other representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement and shall be computed net of (A) payments actually
recovered by the Indemnified Party under any insurance policy with respect to
such Losses or from any other Person alleged to be responsible therefore and
(B) any prior or subsequent actual recovery by the Indemnified Party from any
Person with respect to such Losses.

(ii) The Indemnified Party must use commercially reasonable best efforts to
mitigate in accordance with applicable Law any Loss for which the Indemnified
Party seeks indemnification under this Agreement, including cooperating with
the Indemnifying Party to take all commercially reasonable measures
to mitigate the consequences of the related breach.

(iii) Contributor shall have no obligation to indemnify the Regency Parties
or their Affiliates pursuant to _Section 8.1_ to the extent Losses result or
arise from environmental invasive testing of soil, water or any other parts of
the environment that 

 



59  can contain contaminants with respect to any assets of the Acquired
Companies (" _Environmental Test_ "), unless (A) such Environmental Test is
(w) required by Environmental Laws, (x) requested by a Governmental Authority
with authority under Environmental Laws, (y) requested by a prospective or
direct or indirect purchaser of, or third party providing financing for,
Regency or any of its Affiliates, or any of the Acquired Companies or (z)
necessary in connection with a bona fide expansion, reconfiguration,
maintenance, dismantling, or repair of the assets of any of the Acquired
Companies, or (B) there exists visual (or other sensory) or physical evidence
that is manifest and would cause a reasonably prudent Person to suspect that
there exists pollution or contamination in the soil or groundwater.

 

(iv) The Contributor shall have no obligation to indemnify the Regency Parties
or their Affiliates pursuant to  _Section 8.1_ with respect to any Losses or
alleged Losses to the extent that such Losses or alleged Losses were taken
into account in the determination of Closing Date Net Working Capital.

 

(v) Except as required by applicable Law following a final determination
within the meaning of Section 1313 of the Code, any indemnity payment under
this Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment to the Final Contribution
Consideration for Tax purposes.

(f) _Waiver of Certain Damages_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, in no event shall any Party be liable for punitive, damages or any
multiples of earnings damages of any kind or nature, regardless of the form
of action through which such damages are sought, except for any such damages
recovered by any third party against an Indemnified Party in respect of which
such Indemnified Party would otherwise be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to the terms hereof.

(g) _Sole and Exclusive Remedy_.

 

(i) After the Closing, _Article VIII_ will provide the exclusive remedy for
each of the Parties for any and all claims relating (directly or indirectly)
to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including any
misrepresentation, breach of representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement or other claim arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (other than the post-Closing reconciliations pursuant to
_Section 2.5_ and _Section 2.6_ and other than equitable remedies as they
relate to breaches of covenants or other agreements contained herein to the
extent such covenants or agreements are to be performed after the Closing),
regardless of applicable Law or the legal theory under which such liability or
obligation may be sought or imposed, whether sounding in contract or tort,
or whether at law or in equity or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing herein shall preclude any Party from asserting a claim of Fraud or
willful misconduct.

 

(ii) Except as specifically set forth in this Agreement, effective as of the
Closing, Regency waives any rights Regency or its Affiliates may have against
the Contributor, whether at law or in equity, relating to claims for
contribution and other rights of recovery arising out of or relating to any
Environmental Law (whether now or hereinafter in effect).

 



60 8.4 _Indemnification Procedures._

 

(a) Each Indemnitee agrees that promptly after it becomes aware of facts
giving rise to a claim by it for indemnification pursuant to this _Article
VIII_ , such Indemnitee must assert its claim for indemnification under this
_Article VIII_ (each, a " _Claim_ ") by providing a written notice (a " _Claim
Notice_ ") to the Indemnifying Party allegedly required to provide
indemnification protection under this _Article VIII_ specifying, in reasonable
detail, the nature and basis for such Claim ( _e.g._ , the underlying
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement alleged to have been
breached). Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Indemnitees failure to send or
delay in sending a third party Claim Notice will not relieve the Indemnifying
Party from liability hereunder with respect to such Claim except to
the extent the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by such failure or
delay and except as is otherwise provided herein, including in _Section
8.3(e)_.

(b) In the event of the assertion of any third party Claim for which, by the
terms hereof, an Indemnifying Party is obligated to indemnify an Indemnitee,
the Indemnifying Party will have the right, at such Indemnifying Partys
expense, to assume the defense of same including the appointment and selection
of counsel on behalf of the Indemnitee so long as such counsel is reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnitee. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the
defense of any such third party Claim, it shall, within 30 days of its receipt
of the Claim Notice, notify the Indemnitee in writing of its intent to do so.
The Indemnifying Party will have the right to settle or compromise or take
any corrective or remediation action with respect to any such Claim by all
appropriate Proceedings, which Proceedings will be diligently prosecuted by
the Indemnifying Party to a final conclusion or settled at the discretion of
the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnitee will be entitled, at its own cost, to
participate with the Indemnifying Party in the defense of any such Claim. If
the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any such third-party Claim but
fails to diligently prosecute such Claim, or if the Indemnifying Party does
not assume the defense of any such Claim, the Indemnitee may assume control of
such defense and if it is determined pursuant to the procedures set forth in
_Article IX_ that the Claim was a matter for which the Indemnifying Party is
required to provide indemnification under the terms of this _Article VIII_ ,
the Indemnifying Party will bear the reasonable costs and expenses of such
defense (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party may not assume the defense of the third-
party Claim (but will be entitled at its own cost to participate with the
Indemnified Party in the defense of any such Claim) if the potential Losses
under the third-party Claim could reasonably and in good faith be expected to
exceed, in the aggregate when combined with all claims previously made by the
Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party under this _Article VIII_ , the
maximum amount for which the Indemnifying Party may be liable pursuant to
_Section 8.3(c)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent the Parties are
not in agreement with respect to the calculation of potential Losses, the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the defense of the third-
party Claim in accordance herewith until the Parties have agreed or a final
non-appealable judgment has been entered into, with respect to the
determination of the potential Losses.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Indemnifying Party will not be permitted to settle, compromise, take any
corrective or remedial action or enter

 



61  into an agreed judgment or consent decree that: (i) subjects the Indemnitee
to any criminal liability, (ii) requires an admission of guilt, wrongdoing or
fault on the part of the Indemnitee, (iii) imposes any continuing obligation
on the Indemnitee, (iv) does not include an unconditional release of the
Indemnitee, or (v) requires any payment from the Indemnitee, in each case
without the Indemnitees prior written consent.

8.5 _No Reliance_. THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE CONTRIBUTOR
CONTAINED IN  _ARTICLE III_ CONSTITUTE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE CONTRIBUTOR TO THE REGENCY PARTIES IN
CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. THE

within the State of Delaware) or that any such Proceeding brought in any such

also agrees that any final and non-appealable judgment against a Party hereto
in connection with any Proceeding shall be conclusive and binding on such
Party and that such award or judgment may be enforced in any court of
competent jurisdiction, either within or outside of the United States. A
certified or exemplified copy of such award or judgment shall be conclusive
evidence of the fact and amount of such award or judgment.

9.3 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY
IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.

ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, TO IT
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY
AND (IV) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG

document will be construed against the Party drafting such agreement or
document.

ARTICLE II

 

 _REGISTRATION RIGHTS_

Section 2.01 _Shelf Registration_.

(a) _Shelf Registration_. At the option and upon the request of the holders
of a majority of the Common Units covered by this Agreement, Regency shall
prepare and file a registration statement under the Securities Act to permit
the public resale of the Registrable Securities from time to time as
permitted by Rule 415 (or any similar provision then in force) of the
Securities Act (the " _Shelf Registration Statement_ "). Regency shall use its
reasonable best efforts to file the Shelf Registration Statement within 45
days of any such request and cause it to be effective as soon as reasonably
practicable thereafter (the " _Shelf Registration_ "); _provided_ , _however_
, that Regency shall not be required to effect more than three registrations
pursuant to this Section 2.01(a). The Shelf Registration Statement filed
pursuant to this Section 2.01(a) shall be on such appropriate registration
form of the Commission as shall be selected by Regency; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if a prospectus supplement will be used in connection with
the marketing of an Underwritten Offering from the Shelf Registration
Statement and the Managing Underwriter at any time shall notify Southern
Union in writing that, in the sole judgment of such Managing Underwriter,
inclusion of detailed information to be used in such prospectus supplement is
of material importance to the success of the Underwritten Offering of
such Registrable Securities, Regency shall use its reasonable best efforts to
include such information in such a prospectus supplement. Regency will cause
the Shelf Registration Statement filed pursuant to this Section 2.01(a) to be
continuously effective under the

 



-2-   Securities Act until all Registrable Securities covered by the Shelf
Registration Statement have been distributed in the manner set forth and as
contemplated in the Shelf Registration Statement or there are no longer any
Registrable Securities outstanding (the " _Effectiveness Period_ "). The Shelf
Registration Statement when declared effective (including the documents
incorporated therein by reference) will comply as to form with all applicable
requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and will not contain
an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading. If Regency determines in good faith that the requested
registration would be materially detrimental to Regency because such
registration would (x) materially interfere with a significant acquisition,
reorganization or other similar transaction involving Regency, (y) require
premature disclosure of material information that Regency has a bona fide
business purpose for preserving as confidential or (z) render Regency unable
to comply with requirements under applicable securities laws, then Regency
shall have the right to postpone such requested registration for a period of
not more than three months after receipt of Southern Unions request, such
right pursuant to this Section 2.01(b) not to be utilized more than twice in
any twelve-month period.

(b) _Delay Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, Regency may, upon written notice to any Selling Holder whose
Registrable Securities are included in the Shelf Registration Statement,
suspend such Selling Holders use of any prospectus which is a part of the
Shelf Registration Statement (in which event the Selling Holder shall
discontinue sales of the Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf
Registration Statement) if Regency (i) is pursuing a financing, acquisition,
merger, reorganization, disposition or other similar transaction and
determines in good faith that its ability to pursue or consummate such a
transaction would be materially adversely affected by any required disclosure
of such transaction in the Shelf Registration Statement or (ii) has
experienced some other material non-public event the disclosure of which at
such time, in the good faith judgment of Regency would materially adversely
affect Regency. Upon disclosure of such information or the termination of the
condition described above, Regency shall provide prompt notice to the Selling
Holders whose Registrable Securities are included in the Shelf Registration
Statement, and shall promptly terminate any suspension of sales it has put
into effect and shall take such other actions to permit registered sales of
Registrable Securities as contemplated in this Agreement.

Section 2.02 _Underwritten Offering_. In the event that the Selling Holders
holding a majority of the Common Units covered by this Agreement elect to
dispose of Registrable Securities under the Shelf Registration Statement
pursuant to an Underwritten Offering, Regency shall enter into an underwriting
agreement in customary form with the Managing Underwriter or Underwriters,
which shall include, among other provisions, indemnities to the effect and to
the extent provided in Section 2.07, and shall take all such other reasonable
actions as are requested by the Managing Underwriter in order to expedite or
facilitate the registration and disposition of the Registrable Securities. In
connection with any Underwritten Offering under this Agreement, Regency shall
be entitled to select the Managing Underwriter or Underwriters, subject to the
consent of Southern Union not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. No
Selling Holder may participate in such Underwritten Offering unless such
Selling Holder agrees to sell its Registrable Securities on the basis provided
in such underwriting agreement and completes and executes all questionnaires,
powers of attorney, indemnities and other documents reasonably required under
the terms of such underwriting agreement. Each Selling Holder may, at its
option, require that any or all of the representations and warranties by, and
the other agreements on the part of, Regency to and for the benefit of such
underwriters also be made to and for such Selling Holders benefit and that
any or all of the conditions precedent to the obligations of such underwriters
under such underwriting agreement also be conditions precedent to its
obligations. No Selling Holder shall be required to make any representations
or warranties to or agreements with Regency other than representations,
warranties or agreements regarding such Selling Holder and its ownership of
the securities being registered on its behalf and its intended method of
distribution and any other representations required by law. If any Selling
Holder disapproves of the terms of an underwriting, such Selling Holder may
elect to withdraw therefrom by notice to Regency and the Managing
Underwriter; _provided_ , _however_ , that such notice of withdrawal must be
made before or at the time of pricing of such offering in order to be
effective. No such withdrawal or abandonment shall affect Regencys
obligation to pay Registration Expenses.

 



-3-  Section 2.03 _Registration Procedures_. In connection with its
obligations contained in Section 2.01, Regency will, as expeditiously as
possible:

(a) prepare and file with the Commission such amendments and supplements to
the Shelf Registration Statement and the prospectus used in connection
therewith as may be necessary to keep the Shelf Registration Statement
effective for the Effectiveness Period and as may be necessary to comply with
the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all
securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement;

(b) furnish to each Selling Holder (i) as far in advance as reasonably
practicable before filing the Shelf Registration Statement or any supplement
or amendment thereto, upon request, copies of reasonably complete drafts of
all such documents proposed to be filed (including furnishing or making
available exhibits and each document incorporated by reference therein to the
extent then required by the rules and regulations of the Commission), and
provide each such Selling Holder the opportunity to object to any information
pertaining to such Selling Holder and its plan of distribution that is
contained therein and make the corrections reasonably requested by such
Selling Holder with respect to such information prior to filing the Shelf
Registration Statement or supplement or amendment thereto, and (ii) such
number of copies of the Shelf Registration Statement and the prospectus
included therein and any supplements and amendments thereto as such Persons
may reasonably request in order to facilitate the public sale or other
disposition of the Registrable Securities covered by such Shelf Registration
Statement;

 

(c) if applicable, use its reasonable best efforts to register or qualify the
Registrable Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement under the
securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as the Selling Holders or,
in the case of an Underwritten Offering, the Managing Underwriter, shall
reasonably request, provided that neither Regency nor its general partner
will be required to qualify generally to transact business in any jurisdiction
where it is not then required to so qualify or to take any action which would
subject it to general service of process in any such jurisdiction where it is
not then so subject;

(d) promptly notify each Selling Holder and each underwriter, at any time when
a prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the
Securities Act, of (i) the filing of the Shelf Registration Statement or any
prospectus or prospectus supplement to be used in connection therewith, or any
amendment or supplement thereto, and, with respect to such Shelf Registration
Statement, when the same has become effective; and (ii) any written comments
from the Commission with respect to any filing referred to in clause (i) and
any written request by the Commission for amendments or supplements to the
Shelf Registration Statement or any prospectus or prospectus supplement
thereto;

(e) immediately notify each Selling Holder and each underwriter, at any time
when a prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the
Securities Act, of (i) the happening of any event as a result of which the
prospectus or prospectus supplement contained in the Shelf Registration
Statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact
or omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in light of the
circumstances then existing; (ii) the issuance or threat of issuance by the
Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Shelf
Registration Statement, or the initiation of any proceedings for that
purpose; or (iii) the receipt by Regency of any notification with respect to
the suspension of the qualification of any Registrable Securities for sale
under the applicable securities or blue sky laws of any jurisdiction.
Following the provision of such notice, Regency agrees to as promptly as
practicable amend or supplement the prospectus or prospectus supplement or
take other appropriate action so that the prospectus or prospectus supplement
does not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, in light of the circumstances then
existing, and to take such other action as is necessary to remove a stop
order, suspension, threat thereof or proceedings related thereto;

(f) furnish to each Selling Holder copies of any and all transmittal letters
or other correspondence with the Commission or any other governmental agency
or self-regulatory body or other body having jurisdiction (including any
domestic or foreign securities exchange) relating to such offering of
Registrable Securities;

 



-4-  (g) in the case of an Underwritten Offering, furnish upon request
and addressed to the underwriters and to the Selling Holders, (i) an opinion
of counsel for Regency, dated the effective date of the closing under the
underwriting agreement, and (ii) a "comfort letter", dated the effective date
of the applicable registration statement or the date of any amendment or
supplement thereto and a letter of like kind dated the date of the closing
under the underwriting agreement, in each case, signed by the independent
public accountants who have certified Regencys financial statements included
or incorporated by reference into the applicable registration statement, and
each of the opinion and the "comfort letter" shall be in customary form and
cover substantially the same matters with respect to such registration
statement (and the prospectus and any prospectus supplement included therein)
as are customarily covered in opinions of issuers counsel and in accountants
letters delivered to the underwriters in Underwritten Offerings of
securities, and such other matters as such underwriters may reasonably
request;

(h) otherwise use its reasonable best efforts to comply with all applicable
rules and regulations of the Commission, and make available to its security
holders, as soon as reasonably practicable, an earnings statement covering the
period of at least 12 months, but not more than 18 months, beginning with the
first full calendar month after the effective date of such registration
statement, which earnings statement shall satisfy the provisions of Section
11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158 promulgated thereunder;

(i) make available to the appropriate representatives of the Managing
Underwriter and Selling Holders access to such information and Regency
personnel as is reasonable and customary to enable such parties to establish a
due diligence defense under the Securities Act; _provided_ that Regency need
not disclose any information to any such representative unless and until such
representative has entered into a confidentiality agreement with Regency;

(j) cause all such Registrable Securities registered pursuant to this
Agreement to be listed on each securities exchange or nationally recognized
quotation system on which similar securities issued by Regency are then
listed;

(k) use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Registrable Securities to
be registered with or approved by such other governmental agencies or
authorities as may be necessary by virtue of the business and operations of
Regency to enable the Selling Holders to consummate the disposition of such
Registrable Securities; 

(l) provide a transfer agent and registrar for all Registrable Securities
covered by such registration statement not later than the effective date of
such registration statement; and

(m) enter into customary agreements and take such other actions as are
reasonably requested by the Selling Holders or the underwriters, if any,
including participation in "roadshows," as are reasonably required in order to
expedite or facilitate the disposition of such Registrable Securities.

Each Selling Holder, upon receipt of notice from Regency of the happening of
any event of the kind described in subsection (e) of this Section 2.03, shall
forthwith discontinue disposition of the Registrable Securities until such
Selling Holders receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended
prospectus contemplated by subsection (e) of this Section 2.03 or until it is
advised in writing by Regency that the use of the prospectus may be resumed,
and has received copies of any additional or supplemental filings incorporated
by reference in the prospectus, and, if so directed by Regency, such Selling
Holder will, or will request the managing underwriter or underwriters, if any,
to deliver to Regency (at Regencys expense) all copies in their possession or
control, other than permanent file copies then in such Selling Holders
possession, of the prospectus covering such Registrable Securities current at
the time of receipt of such notice.

Section 2.04 _Cooperation by Holders_. Regency shall have no obligation to
include in the Shelf Registration Statement units of a Holder who has failed
to timely furnish such information which, in the opinion of counsel to
Regency, is reasonably required in order for the Shelf Registration Statement
or any prospectus or prospectus supplement thereto, as applicable, to comply
with the Securities Act.

 



-5-  Section 2.05 _Restrictions on Public Sale by Holders of Registrable
Securities_. Each Holder of Registrable Securities who is included in the
Shelf Registration Statement agrees not to effect any public sale or
distribution of the Registrable Securities during the lock-up period contained
in a prospectus supplement filed with the Commission with respect to the
pricing of an Underwritten Offering, provided that (i) Regency gives written
notice to such Holder of the date of the commencement and termination of such
period with respect to any such Underwritten Offering and (ii) the duration
of the foregoing restrictions shall be no longer than the duration of the
shortest restriction generally imposed by the underwriters on Regency or on
the officers or directors or any other unitholder of Regency on whom
a restriction is imposed.

Section 2.06 _Expenses._

 

(a) _Certain Definitions_. " _Registration Expenses_ " means all expenses
incident to Regencys performance under or compliance with this Agreement to
effect the registration of Registrable Securities in a Shelf Registration, and
the disposition of such securities, including, without limitation, all
registration, filing, securities exchange listing fees, all registration,
filing, qualification and other fees and expenses of complying with securities
or blue sky laws, fees of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority,
transfer taxes and fees of transfer agents and registrars, all
word processing, duplicating and printing expenses, the fees and
disbursements of counsel and independent public accountants for Regency,
including the expenses of any special audits or "comfort letters" required by
or incident to such performance and compliance. Except as otherwise provided
in Section 2.07 hereof, Regency shall not be responsible for legal fees
incurred by Holders in connection with the exercise of such Holders rights
hereunder. In addition, Regency shall not be responsible for any " _Selling
Expenses_ ," which means all underwriting fees, discounts and selling
commissions allocable to the sale of the Registrable Securities.

 

(b) _Expenses_. Regency will pay all Registration Expenses in connection with
any Shelf Registration Statement filed pursuant to Section 2.01(a) of this
Agreement, whether or not the Shelf Registration Statement becomes effective
or any sale is made pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement. Each Selling
Holder shall pay all Selling Expenses in connection with any sale of its
Registrable Securities hereunder.

Section 2.07 _Indemnification._

 

(a) _By Regency_. In the event of a registration of any Registrable Securities
under the Securities Act pursuant to this Agreement, Regency will indemnify
and hold harmless each Selling Holder thereunder, its directors and officers
and each underwriter pursuant to the applicable underwriting agreement with
such underwriter and each Person, if any, who controls such Selling Holder or
underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act,
against any losses, claims, damages, expenses or liabilities (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) (collectively, " _Losses_ "), joint
or several, to which such Selling Holder or underwriter or controlling Person
may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise,
insofar as such Losses (or actions or proceedings, whether commenced or
threatened, in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the
Shelf Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or final
prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereof, or
arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state
therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein (in the case of a prospectus, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, and will reimburse
each such Selling Holder, its directors and officers, each such underwriter
and each such controlling Person for any legal or other expenses reasonably
incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such Loss
or actions or proceedings; _provided_ , _however_ , that Regency will not be
liable in any such case if and to the extent that any such Loss arises out of
or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission
or alleged omission so made in conformity with information furnished by such
Selling Holder, such underwriter or such controlling Person in writing
specifically for use in the Shelf Registration Statement or any prospectus
contained therein or any amendment or supplement thereof. Such indemnity shall
remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on
behalf of such Selling Holder or any such director, officer or controlling
Person, and shall survive the transfer of such securities by such Selling
Holder.

 



-6-  (b) _By Each Selling Holder_. Each Selling Holder agrees severally
and jointly to indemnify and hold harmless Regency, its directors and
officers, and each Person, if any, who controls Regency within the meaning of
the Securities Act or of the Exchange Act against any Losses to the same
extent as the foregoing indemnity from Regency to the Selling Holders, but
only with respect to information regarding such Selling Holder furnished in
writing by or on behalf of such Selling Holder expressly for inclusion in the
Shelf Registration Statement or any prospectus contained therein or any
amendment or supplement thereof relating to the Registrable Securities;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the liability of each Selling Holder shall not
be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the proceeds (net of any
Selling Expenses) received by such Selling Holder from the sale of the
Registrable Securities giving rise to such indemnification.

(c) _Notice_. Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party hereunder of
notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a
claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party
hereunder, notify the indemnifying party in writing thereof, but such
indemnified partys failure to so notify the indemnifying party shall not
relieve the indemnifying party from any liability which it may have to
any indemnified party other than under this Section 2.07. The indemnifying
party shall be entitled to participate in and, to the extent it shall wish, to
assume and undertake the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory
to such indemnified party and, after notice from the indemnifying party to
such indemnified party of its election so to assume and undertake the defense
thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party
under this Section 2.07 for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by such
indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable
costs of investigation and of liaison with counsel so selected; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, (i) if the indemnifying party has failed to assume the
defense and employ counsel or (ii) if the defendants in any such action
include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and counsel to
the indemnified party shall have concluded that there may be reasonable
defenses available to the indemnified party that are different from or
additional to those available to the indemnifying party, or if the interests
of the indemnified party reasonably may be deemed to conflict with the
interests of the indemnifying party, then the indemnified party shall have the
right to select a separate counsel and to assume such legal defense and
otherwise to participate in the defense of such action, with the
reasonable expenses and fees of one such separate counsel (firm) and other
reasonable expenses related to such participation to be reimbursed by the
indemnifying party as incurred. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, no indemnified party shall settle any action brought against it
with respect to which it is entitled to indemnification hereunder without the
consent of the indemnifying party, unless the settlement thereof imposes no
liability or obligation on, and includes a complete and unconditional release
from all liability of, the indemnifying party.

(d) _Contribution_. If the indemnification provided for in this Section 2.07
is held by a court or government agency of competent jurisdiction to be
unavailable to Regency or any Selling Holder or is insufficient to hold it
harmless in respect of any Losses, then each such indemnifying party, in lieu
of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or
payable by such indemnified party as a result of such Losses as between
Regency, on the one hand, and such Selling Holder, on the other hand, in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of Regency, on the
one hand, and of such Selling Holder, on the other, in connection with the
statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses, as well as any
other relevant equitable considerations; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no
event shall such Selling Holder be required to contribute an aggregate amount
in excess of the dollar amount of proceeds (net of Selling Expenses) received
by such Selling Holder from the sale of Registrable Securities giving rise to
such indemnification. The relative fault of Regency, on the one hand, and each
Selling Holder, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among
other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material
fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact has been
made by, or relates to, information supplied by such party, and the parties
relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct
or prevent such statement or omission. The parties hereto agree that it would
not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this paragraph were to
be determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation
which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the
first sentence of this paragraph. The amount paid by an indemnified party as a
result of the Losses referred to in the first sentence of this paragraph
shall be deemed to include any legal and other expenses reasonably incurred by
such indemnified party in connection with

 



-7-   investigating or defending any Loss which is the subject of this paragraph.
No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of
Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from
any Person who is not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

(e)  _Other Indemnification_. The provisions of this Section 2.07 shall be in
addition to any other rights to indemnification or contribution which an
indemnified party may have pursuant to law, equity, contract or otherwise.

 

Section 2.08 _Rule 144 Reporting_. With a view to making available the
benefits of certain rules and regulations of the Commission that may permit
the sale of the Registrable Securities to the public without registration,
Regency agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to:

(a) Make and keep public information regarding Regency available, as those
terms are understood and defined in Rule 144 of the Securities Act, at all
times from and after the date hereof;

 

(b) File with the Commission in a timely manner all reports and other
documents required of Regency under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act
at all times from and after the date hereof; and

(c) So long as a Holder owns any Registrable Securities, furnish to such
Holder forthwith upon request a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly
report of Regency, and such other reports and documents so filed as such
Holder may reasonably request in availing itself of any rule or regulation of
the Commission allowing such Holder to sell any such securities without
registration.

Section 2.09  _Transfer or Assignment of Registration Rights_. The rights to
cause Regency to include Registrable Securities in a Shelf Registration
Statement may be transferred or assigned by Southern Union to one or more
transferee(s) or assignee(s) of such Registrable Securities, provided that
(a) such transferee or assignee is an Affiliate of Southern Union or receives
at least 20% of the Common Units covered by this Agreement, (b) Regency is
given written notice prior to any said transfer or assignment, stating the
name and address of each such transferee and identifying the securities with
respect to which such registration rights are being transferred or assigned,
and (c) each such transferee or assignee assumes in writing responsibility
for its portion of the obligations of Southern Union under this Agreement.

Section 2.10  _Information by Holder_. Any Holder or Holders of Registrable
Securities included in any registration statement shall promptly furnish to
Regency such information regarding such Holder or Holders and the distribution
proposed by such Holder or Holders as Regency may reasonably request and as
shall be required in connection with any registration, qualification or
compliance referred to herein.

and Regency shall cause representation letters, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the its independent auditors, to be executed and
delivered to the independent auditors in connection with obtaining any such
consent.

 



-9-  (c) Regency shall provide access upon reasonable notice during

reimburse Regency for any cost or expenses incurred by Regency in connection
with the foregoing.

(d) Southern Union and its Affiliates shall not, directly or indirectly,
disclose to any Person any confidential Information provided to Southern Union
pursuant to this Section 3.02 (" _Information_ "), which has not become
generally available to the public, other than as a result of a breach of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) in the event that Southern Union
or any of its Affiliates is required by Law or applicable stock exchange
rules to disclose any Information, such party shall (1) notify Regency as
promptly as practicable of the existence, terms and circumstances surrounding
such a request, so that Regency may either waive such partys compliance with
the terms of this Section 3.2 or seek an appropriate protective order or other
remedy and (2) if Regency seeks such a protective order, to provide such
cooperation as Regency may reasonably request (at Regencys sole expense) and
(B) the Parties acknowledge and agree that Southern Union or its Affiliates
may be required to include or incorporate into its financial statements the
financial information described on Schedule I and Southern Union and any such
Affiliate shall not publicly disclose such Information in its financial
statements until Regency has publicly filed its financial statements
containing such information. In the event that Regency waives compliance
(in whole or in part) with the terms of this Section 3.02, or such protective
order or other remedy is denied, as a result of which Southern Union or its
Affiliate is nonetheless legally compelled to disclose such Information,
Southern Union or its Affiliate, as the case may be, shall furnish only that
portion of the Information that its legal counsel advises is legally required,
and Southern Union or its Affiliate shall exercise its reasonable best efforts
to preserve the confidentiality of the remainder of the Information. In no
event shall Southern Union or its Affiliate oppose action by Regency to obtain
a protective order or other relief to prevent the disclosure of Information or
to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be afforded the
Information.

Section 3.03 _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall inure to the
benefit of and be binding upon the permitted successors and assigns of each of
the parties, including subsequent Holders of Registrable Securities to the
extent permitted herein.

 

Section 3.04 _Assignment of Rights_. All or any portion of the rights and
obligations of Southern Union under this Agreement may be transferred or
assigned by Southern Union only in accordance with Section 2.09 of this
Agreement.

 

Section 3.05 _Recapitalization, Exchanges, etc. Affecting the Common Units_.
The provisions of this Agreement shall apply to the full extent set forth
herein with respect to any and all units of Regency or any successor or assign
of Regency (whether by merger, consolidation, sale of assets or otherwise)
which may be issued in respect of, in exchange for or in substitution of, the
Registrable Securities, and shall be appropriately adjusted for combinations,
recapitalizations and the like occurring after the date of this Agreement.

Section 3.06 _Specific Performance_. Damages in the event of breach of this
Agreement by a party hereto may be difficult, if not impossible, to ascertain,
and it is therefore agreed that each such Person, in addition to and without
limiting any other remedy or right it may have, will have the right to an
injunction or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction,
enjoining any such breach, and enforcing specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, and each of the parties hereto hereby waives any and all
defenses it may have on the ground of lack of jurisdiction or competence of
the court to grant such an injunction or other equitable relief. The existence
of this right will not preclude any such Person from pursuing any other
rights and remedies at law or in equity which such Person may have.

 



-10-  Section 3.07 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number
of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which counterparts, when so executed and delivered, shall be deemed to
be an original and all of which counterparts, taken together, shall constitute
but one and the same Agreement.

Section 3.08 _Headings_. The headings in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only and shall not limit or otherwise affect the meaning hereof.

Section 3.09 _Governing Law_. The laws of the State of Delaware shall govern
this Agreement without regard to principles of conflict of laws.

Section 3.10 _Severability of Provisions_. Any provision of this Agreement
which is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or
unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof or
affecting or impairing the validity or enforceability of such provision in any
other jurisdiction.

 

Section 3.11 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement is intended by the parties as
a final expression of their agreement and intended to be a complete and
exclusive statement of the agreement and understanding of the parties hereto
in respect of the subject matter contained herein. There are no restrictions,
promises, warranties or undertakings, other than those set forth or referred
to herein with respect to the rights granted by Regency set forth herein. This
Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings between the
parties with respect to such subject matter.

 

Section 3.12 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended only by means of a
written amendment signed by Regency and the Holders of a majority of the then
outstanding Registrable Securities; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such
amendment shall materially and adversely affect the rights of any Holder
hereunder without the consent of such Holder.

 

Section 3.13 _No Presumption_. In the event any claim is made by a party
relating to any conflict, omission, or ambiguity in this Agreement, no
presumption or burden of proof or persuasion shall be implied by virtue of the
fact that this Agreement was prepared by or at the request of a particular
party or its counsel.

the Class F Common Units under Section 6.1(a) and (b).

(ii) _Distributions_. The Class F Common Units shall not have the right to

determined for the taxable year (or portion thereof) to which this allocation
of gain relates; and

(C) Unitholders holding Class F Common Units shall be entitled to receive
allocations pursuant to Sections 6.1(c)(i)(D) through 6.1(c)(i)(G) as
Unitholders, but Class F Common Units shall not be deemed to be Common Units
for the purposes of determining whether or not any of the First Liquidation
Target Amount, the Second Liquidation Target Amount or the Third Liquidation
Target Amount has been achieved.

 

(iv) A _llocation of Net Termination Loss to Class F Common Unitholders_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6.1(c)(ii), with respect

(v) _Voting Rights_.

the voting rights of the Common Units and shall vote with the Common Units as
a single class, so that each Class F Common Unit will be entitled to one vote

Each reference in the Partnership Agreement to a vote of holders of Common
Units shall be deemed to be a reference to the holders of Common Units and
Class F Common Units.

 



6 (B) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in addition to all
other requirements imposed by Delaware law, and all other voting rights
granted under this Agreement, the affirmative vote of seventy-five percent
(75%) of the Class F Common Units, voting separately as a class with one vote
per Class F Common Unit, shall be necessary on any matter that adversely
affects any of the rights, preferences and privileges of the Class F Common
Units in any respect.

(vi) _Certificates_.

(A) The Class F Common Units shall be evidenced by certificates in such form
as the General Partner may approve and, subject to the satisfaction of any
applicable legal, regulatory and contractual requirements, may be assigned or
transferred in a manner identical to the assignment and transfer of other
Units; unless and until the General Partner determines to assign the
responsibility to another Person, the General Partner will act as the
registrar and transfer agent for the Class F Common Units. The certificates
evidencing Class F Common Units shall be separately identified and shall not
bear the same CUSIP number as the certificates evidencing Common Units.

 

(B) In addition to any legend required by the Partnership Agreement to be
included on any certificate representing Class F Common Units (or Common
Units issuable upon conversion thereof) a legend shall be placed on the
certificates representing the Class F Common Units (and the Common Units
issuable upon conversion thereof) as required by, and until eligible to be
removed as provided in, Section 5.11 of the Contribution Agreement.

(vii) _Conversion_. Each Class F Common Unit will automatically convert into
Common Units on a one-for-one basis on the close of business on the first
Business Day after the record date for the Quarter preceding the Quarter in
which the second anniversary of the Contribution Agreement Closing
Date occurs (the " _Class F Conversion Date_ "). The holder of any Class F
Common Unit shall surrender the certificates evidencing such Class F Common
Units for conversion at the office of the General Partner. In such case, the
Partnership shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at
such office to the Person in whose name the surrendered Class F Common Units
were registered one or more certificates evidencing Common Units, registered
in the name of such Person, for the number of Common Units to which such
Person shall be entitled as aforesaid.

(g) Section 6.1(d)(iii)(A) is amended and restated to read in its entirety:

(A) If the amount of cash or the Net Agreed Value of any property distributed
(except (x) for any difference resulting from the application of Section
5.15(b)(ii) or (y) cash or property distributed or deemed distributed pursuant
to Section 12.4) to any Unitholder with respect to its Units for a taxable
year is greater (on a per Unit basis) than the amount of cash or the Net
Agreed Value of property distributed to the other Unitholders with respect to
their Units (on a per Unit basis), then (1) each Unitholder receiving such
greater cash or property distribution shall be allocated gross income in an
amount equal to the product of (aa) the amount by which the

 



7  distribution (on a per Unit basis) to such Unitholder exceeds the
distribution (on a per Unit basis) to the Unitholders receiving the smallest
distribution and (bb) the number of Units owned by the Unitholder receiving
the greater distribution; and (2) the General Partner shall be allocated gross
income in an aggregate amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(aa) the quotient determined by dividing (x) the General Partners Percentage
Interest at the time in which the greater cash or property distribution occurs
by (y) the sum of 100 less the General Partners Percentage Interest at the
time in which the greater cash or property distribution occurs times (bb) the
sum of the amounts allocated in clause (1) above.

(h) Article VI is amended to add a new Section 6.1(d)(xv) as follows:

(xv) _Allocations for Class F Common Units_.

 

(B) With respect to any taxable period of the Partnership ending upon, or
after, a Book-Up Event or a Book-Down Event occurring no earlier than the
taxable year during which the Class F Common Units convert into Common Units
or a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Partnership
occurring after the date of issuance of Class F Common Units, Partnership
items of income, gain, loss or deduction for such taxable period shall be
allocated (1) to the Partners holding Class F Common Units or converted Class
F Common Units that are Outstanding as of the time of such event in proportion
to the number of Class F Common Units or converted Class F Common Units held
by such Partners, and/or (2) to the Partners holding Common Units (other than
Class F Common Units or converted Class F Common Units) that are Outstanding
as of the time of such event in proportion to the number of Common Units held
by such Partners, until the Capital Account of each Class F Common Unit or
converted Class F Common Unit is equal to the Per Unit Capital Amount for a
then outstanding Common Unit (other than a converted Class F Common Unit).

(C) With respect to any taxable period of the Partnership ending upon, or
after, the transfer of converted Class F Common Units to a Person that is not
an Affiliate of the holder, Partnership items of income, gain, loss or
deduction for such taxable period shall be allocated (1) to the Partners
transferring (or receiving, as applicable) such converted Class F Common
Units in proportion to the number of converted Class F Common Units
transferred (or received, as applicable) by such Partners, and/or (2) to the
Partners holding Common Units (other than Class F Common Units or converted
Class F Common Units) that are Outstanding as of the time of such event in
proportion to the number of Common Units held by such Partners, until the
Capital Account of such converted Class F Common Unit is equal to the Per Unit
Capital Amount for a then outstanding Common Unit (other than a converted
Class F Common Unit).

(i) Article VI is amended to add a new Section 6.7(g) as follows:

(g) A Unitholder holding a Class F Common Unit that has converted into a
Common Unit pursuant to Section 5.15 shall be required to provide notice to
the General Partner of the proposed transfer of the converted Class F Common
Unit within 30 days prior to such proposed transfer and in no event later than
the last Business Day of the calendar year during which such transfer occurs,
unless (x) the transfer is to an Affiliate of the holder or (y) by virtue of
the application of Section 6.1(d)(xv)(B) to a prior transfer of the Unit or
the application of Section 6.1(d)(xv)(A), the General Partner has previously
determined, based on advice of counsel, that

 



8  the converted Class F Common Unit should have, as a substantive matter, like
intrinsic economic and federal income tax characteristics of an Initial Common
Unit. In connection with the condition imposed by this Section 6.7(g), the
General Partner shall take whatever steps are required to provide economic
uniformity to the converted Class F Common Units in preparation for a transfer
of such Units, including the application of Section 5.5(c)(iii) and/or
Section 6.1(d)(xv)(B); _provided, however,_ that no such steps may be taken
that would have a material adverse effect on the Unitholders holding Common
Units represented by Common Unit Certificates (for this purpose the
allocations of income, gain, loss and deductions with respect to Class F
Common Units or Common Units will be deemed not to have a material adverse
effect on the Unitholders holding Common Units).

 

Section 3\. _Ratification of Partnership Agreement_. Except as expressly
modified and amended herein, all of the terms and conditions of
the Partnership Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.

Section 4\. _General Authority_. The appropriate officers of the General
Partner are hereby authorized to make such clarifying and conforming changes
as they deem necessary or appropriate, and to interpret the Partnership
Agreement, to give effect to the intent and purposes of this Amendment.

 

Section 5\. _Governing Law_. This Amendment shall be construed in accordance
with and governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to
principles of conflicts of laws.

To be revised once the form of debt to be issued is determined. 
 A G R E E M E N T S

 

NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged by the Guarantor, the Guarantor
agrees as follows:

1. _Guarantee_. Subject to the terms herein, the Guarantor guarantees to the Holders and the Trustee full and prompt collection of the principal amount due under the Supported Debt, but not any accrued and unpaid interest thereon or any fees or other amounts of any kind whatsoever that shall be due to the Holders by Regency (the " _Liabilities_ "). 

2. _Guarantee of Collection_. This is a guarantee of collection only, and not a guarantee of payment. Notwithstanding any other term or condition of this Guarantee to the contrary, the Guarantor shall not be obligated to make any payment pursuant to this Guarantee unless and until each of the following has occurred: (i) the Trustee or other Holder must use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain judgment against Regency, (ii) the Trustee or other Holder must use commercially reasonable efforts to execute on any judgment obtained against Regency, (iii) following execution of any such judgment, a portion of the sums due under the Supported Debt constituting Liabilities must remain unpaid, (iv) if no bankruptcy proceeding has been commenced with respect to Regency, the Trustee or other Holder shall have brought an action in a court of law having proper subject matter jurisdiction against Regency to collect such Liabilities, obtained a final and non-appealable judgment by such court against Regency in respect of such Liabilities and levied execution of such judgment against the property of Regency, and as a result of such execution received less than payment in full in cash or property of such Liabilities, and (v) if a bankruptcy proceeding has been commenced with respect to Regency, the closing of the bankruptcy proceeding after its administration under 11 U.S.C. Section 350(a) shall have occurred and the Trustee or other Holder shall have received, after all distributions contemplated by such bankruptcy proceeding or otherwise, less than payment in full in cash or property in respect of such Liabilities. For these purposes, the value of any payment made in property shall be equal to the fair market value of such property at the time of such payment. 

3. _Termination of Guarantee_. This Guarantee shall remain in effect and will not terminate until the Liabilities have been paid in full. 

4. _Waivers_. The Guarantor waives (i) notice of acceptance of this Guarantee, (ii) all presentments and protests, and (iii) notice of dishonor. 

5. _Obligations Absolute_. Except as set forth in this Guarantee, the Guarantors obligations are in all respects absolute and unconditional and will not be impaired, modified, released or limited by any occurrence or condition whatsoever, including, without limitation, (i) any modification, discharge, renewal or extension of the Liabilities or the Supported Debt, or any amendment, modification or stay of the Trustees or other Holders rights under the Supported Debt which may occur in any bankruptcy or reorganization case or proceeding concerning Regency, whether permanent or temporary and whether or not assented to by the Trustee or other Holder, (ii) any notice of withdrawal of this Guarantee, at any time and from time to time before, at or after maturity of the Supported Debt, (iii) any determination that any signatures on behalf of Regency on the Supported Debt are not genuine or that the Supported Debt is not the legal, valid and binding obligation of Regency, or (iv) any defenses that Regency may have as to any sums due under the Supported Debt. 

 



2 6. _Waiver of Subrogation_. Until the Liabilities have been paid in full, the Guarantor irrevocably waives, relinquishes and renounces any right of subrogation, contribution, indemnity, reimbursement or any claim whatsoever which the Guarantor may have against Regency or any other guarantors liable on the Supported Debt arising out of, or in any way connected with, the documents evidencing, guaranteeing or otherwise relating to the Supported Debt (the " _Supported Debt Documents_ "). The Guarantor will not assert any such claim against Regency or any such guarantor, in any proceeding, legal or equitable, including any bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization proceeding, before the Trustee and the Holders are paid in full for the Liabilities. This provision will inure to the benefit of and will be enforceable by the Trustee, the Holders, Regency and any such guarantors, and their successors and assigns, including any trustee in bankruptcy or debtor-in-possession. This provision will not prevent the Guarantor from asserting a claim against Regency or any such guarantors once the Liabilities have been fully paid to the Trustee and the Holders. Once the Liabilities have been paid in full, if the Guarantor has made any payment to the Trustee and the Holders under this Guarantee, then the Trustee and the Holders will assign to the Guarantor, to the extent of such payment, the Trustees and the Holders interest in the Supported Debt Documents and any judgments against Regency. 

 

7. _Reinstatement of Guaranteed Liabilities_. The Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that the Guarantors obligations hereunder shall apply to and continue with respect to any amount paid to the Trustee and the Holders on the Liabilities which is subsequently recovered from the Trustee and the Holders for any reason whatsoever (including, without limitation, as a result of any bankruptcy, insolvency or fraudulent conveyance proceeding), notwithstanding the fact that the Liabilities may have been previously paid in full or this Guarantee terminated, or both. 

 

8. _Assignment_. The Trustee and the Holders may, from time to time, whether before or after any withdrawal of this Guarantee, without notice to the Guarantor, assign or transfer any or all of the Liabilities or any interest therein; and, notwithstanding any such assignment or transfer or any subsequent assignment or transfer thereof, such Liabilities shall be and remain Liabilities for purposes of this Guarantee, and each and every immediate and successive assignee or transferee of any of the Liabilities or of any interest therein shall, to the extent of the interest of such assignee or transferee in the Liabilities, be entitled to the benefits of this Guarantee to the same extent as if such assignee or transferee were the Trustee or other Holder; _provided, however_ , that, unless the Trustee or Holders shall otherwise consent in writing, the Trustee and the Holders shall have an unimpaired right, prior and superior to that of any such assignee or transferee, to enforce this Guarantee, for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, as to that portion of the Liabilities which the Trustee and the Holders have not assigned or transferred. 

9. _Cumulative Rights; No Waiver_. Each and every right granted to the Trustee and the Holders hereunder or under any other document delivered hereunder or in connection herewith, or allowed it by law or equity, shall be cumulative and may be exercised from time to time subject only to the limitations set forth in this Guarantee. No failure on the part of the Trustee and the Holders to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise by the Trustee or other Holder of any right preclude any other or future exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. 

 



3 10. _Interpretation and Construction_. Each reference herein to the Trustee and the Holders shall be deemed to include their respective successors and assigns, and each reference to Regency and the Guarantor and any pronouns referring thereto as used herein shall be construed in the singular or plural as the context may require and shall be deemed to include the successors and assigns of Regency and the Guarantor, all of whom shall be bound by the provisions hereof. All references herein to Regency shall be deemed to include any successor or successors, whether immediate or remote, to Regency. 

11. _Continuing Guarantee_. Subject to the limitations herein, this instrument is intended to be a full, complete and continuing guarantee to the Trustee and the Holders to the extent of and for the Liabilities owing by Regency to the Trustee and the Holders from time to time and to be valid and continuous without other or further notice to the Guarantor, notwithstanding the death, disability or dissolution of Regency or any other guarantor, until notice in writing of withdrawal of this Guarantee, signed by the parties hereto or any of them or by the legal representative(s) of a deceased party, has actually been given to the Trustee and the Holders, and then only as to the party or parties signing such notice and to transactions subsequent to the time of such notice; _provided, however_ , that no such notice of withdrawal shall affect or impair any of the agreements and obligations of the Guarantor hereunder with respect to any and all Liabilities existing at the time of actual receipt of such notice by the Trustee and the Holders until paid in full; and shall not affect or impair the Trustees or other Holders right to recover all expenses paid or incurred by the Trustee or other Holder endeavoring to enforce this Guarantee against the Guarantor. All of the agreements and obligations of the Guarantor under this Guarantee shall, notwithstanding any such notice of withdrawal, remain in effect until all such Liabilities and all such expenses shall have been paid in full. 

 

12. _Subsequent Guaranties_. No subsequent guarantee by the Guarantor or any other person of the Liabilities shall be deemed to be in lieu of or to supersede this Guarantee, unless otherwise expressly provided therein. The obligation under this Guarantee shall be in addition to any obligation of the Guarantor as endorser of any obligations of Regency. 

 

13. _Governing Law_. THIS GUARANTEE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS TO THE EXTENT THE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION WOULD BE REQUIRED THEREBY. 

14\. _Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_. The Guarantor
irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any New York State court
or federal court of the United States of America sitting in New York County,
and any appellate court from any thereof, for the purposes of any proceeding
arising out of this Guarantee or the transactions contemplated hereby (and
agrees that no such proceeding relating to this Guarantee or the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be brought by it except in such courts). The
Guarantor irrevocably and unconditionally waives (and agrees not to plead or
claim) any objection to the laying of venue of any proceeding arising out of
this Guarantee or the transactions contemplated hereby in any New York State
court or federal court of the United States of America sitting in New York
County, and any

 



4  appellate court from any thereof, or that any such proceeding brought in any
such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. The Guarantor also
agrees that any final and non appealable judgment against it in connection
with any proceeding shall be conclusive and binding on it and that such award
or judgment may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction, either
within or outside of the United States. A certified or exemplified copy of
such award or judgment shall be conclusive evidence of the fact and amount of
such award or judgment. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY
ACTION OR PROCEEDING TO ENFORCE OR TO DEFEND ANY RIGHTS UNDER THIS GUARANTEE
SHALL BE TRIED BEFORE A COURT AND NOT BEFORE A JURY.

15. _Entire Agreement_. This Guarantee constitutes the entire agreement with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, oral or written, between the parties related thereto.

consent of the Support Provider, Regency shall not be entitled, prior to the
third (3rd) anniversary of the date of this Support Agreement, to (i) repay
any principal amount of the Supported Debt or (ii) refinance through an
exchange offer or otherwise all or any portion of the Supported Debt, unless,
in the case of (ii) above, Regency (x) simultaneously replaces such Supported
Debt with at least an equivalent amount of new indebtedness (such new
indebtedness, the " _Refinancing Supported Debt_ ") with substantially similar
covenants providing for no earlier amortization of principal than the
amortization contemplated by the applicable maturity date of any such
Supported Debt (any such date, a " _Maturity Date_ ") and (y) permits Support
Provider at its sole discretion to provide support to Regency Subsidiary
Guarantor in furtherance of the Regency Subsidiary Guarantee in support of
the Refinanced Supported Debt, on the terms and subject to the conditions set

Supported Debt is repaid or refinanced after the third (3rd) anniversary of
the date of this Support Agreement and prior to the applicable Maturity Date,
Support Provider may at its sole discretion enter into and provide for a
guarantee of collection and/or of payment for the principal amount of all or
a portion of any debt of Regency.

(b) _Actions Upon Maturity Date_. Upon the applicable Maturity Date of any
Supported Debt and payment in full of the aggregate principal amount of such
Supported Debt, no additional Regency Subsidiary Guarantee shall be permitted
to be made by Regency Subsidiary Guarantor with respect to such
Supported Debt. Any Supported Debt subject to the Regency Subsidiary
Guarantee may be retired or refinanced with debt that is not subject to the
Regency Subsidiary Guarantee commencing at any time on or after the scheduled
Maturity Date for such Supported Debt.

(c) _Extinguishment of Supported Debt_. Regency shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to extinguish any applicable outstanding Supported Debt on
the Maturity Date. Regency Subsidiary Guarantor shall release the Support
Provider from any liability or obligation under this Agreement related to the
Supported Debt on the applicable Maturity Date for such Supported Debt and
shall enter into and execute such documents and instruments as the Support
Provider may reasonably request in order to evidence such release, and Regency
shall cause Regency Subsidiary Guarantor to take such actions.

Guarantor shall not (i) create, incur, assume or permit to exist any
Indebtedness (as defined below) other than the Regency Subsidiary Guarantee or
(ii) consummate any transactions other than the Regency Subsidiary Guarantee
of the Supported Debt; _provided that_ Regency Subsidiary Guarantor may
guarantee other public debt of Regency to the extent Regency Subsidiary
Guarantor is required to do so as a subsidiary of Regency and Support Provider
shall have no liability for such other public debt or the obligations of
Regency Subsidiary Guarantor

 



3  with respect to such public debt. As used in this Section 6(d),
"Indebtedness" shall mean (A) all obligations for borrowed money, (B) all
obligations evidenced by bonds, debentures, notes or similar instruments, (C)
all obligations under conditional sale or other title retention agreements
relating to property or assets, (D) all obligations issued or assumed as the
deferred purchase price of property or services, (E) all guarantees of
Indebtedness of others, (F) all capital lease obligations, (G) all obligations
with respect to hedging and swap agreements, (H) the principal component of
all obligations, contingent or otherwise, as an account party in respect of
letters of credit and (I) the principal component of all obligations in
respect of bankers acceptances.

7\. _Covenants of Support Provider_.

(a) _Net Worth_. Support Provider hereby represents to Regency Subsidiary
Guarantor and Regency that its existing net worth is equal to or greater than
the aggregate principal amount of the Supported Debt and in the event Support
Provider disposes of, transfers, or conveys any of its assets, except with
respect to distributions permitted in clause (b) below, it shall promptly
replace such assets with assets having a net fair market value (after taking
into account any Indebtedness to be assumed by the Support Provider in
connection with any such transaction) substantially equivalent to or greater
than the net fair market value (after taking into account any Indebtedness to
be assumed by the Support Provider in connection with any such transaction) of
the disposed assets.

(b) _Distributions_. Support Provider shall be entitled to make distributions
of available cash with respect to its equity interests provided Support
Provider shall not make a distribution of cash or property to the extent such
distribution would constitute a Fraudulent Conveyance (as defined in Section
10) in light of Support Providers obligations under this Agreement or
otherwise impair Support Providers ability to satisfy its obligations under
this Agreement.

8\. _Covenants of the Parties to Maintain Tax Treatment_. For so long as any
Regency Subsidiary Guarantee is outstanding, the Parties hereto hereby agree
that:

 

(a) Unless otherwise required by law, it is the intent of the Parties to treat
Southern Union as the sole partner bearing the economic risk of loss with
respect to the Supported Debt pursuant to Treasury Regulation § 1.752-2;
_provided that_ , notwithstanding the foregoing, Regency shall not be required
to take such position in any taxable year to the extent Regency determines in
good faith after consulting with tax counsel that such position is not
supported by current law or actual facts and circumstances.

(b) It is the intent of the Parties, that the distribution to Southern Union
by Regency of the Cash Consideration (as such term is defined in the
Contribution Agreement) be treated as a distribution under Section 731 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and neither
Regency nor any partner of Regency shall take a position inconsistent with
such treatment unless otherwise required by law;  _provided that_ ,
notwithstanding the foregoing, Regency shall not be required to take such
position in any taxable year to the extent Regency determines in good faith
after consulting with tax counsel that such position is not supported
by current law or actual facts and circumstances.

 



4 (c) Neither Regency nor Regency Subsidiary Guarantor shall (i) modify the
Regency Subsidiary Guarantee so as to eliminate or limit the ultimate
recourse liability of the Support Provider with respect to the Supported Debt,
(ii) merge or consolidate with, or intentionally take any action that would
cause, Regency Subsidiary Guarantor to become a corporation for U.S. federal
income tax purposes or (iii) except as required by the Supported Debt, cause
or permit any other corporation, partnership, person or entity to assume,
guarantee, indemnify against or otherwise incur any liability with respect to
any Supported Debt.

(d) In the event a subsidiary of Regency that is regarded as separate and
apart from Regency for U.S. federal income tax purposes, including but not
limited to Pueblo Holdings, Inc. and Pueblo Midstream Gas Corporation, becomes
a Subsidiary Guarantor (as such term is defined in the [Senior Notes
Indenture/New Credit Facility]) of the Supported Debt or otherwise guarantees
the Supported Debt, the Support Provider agrees to indemnify such subsidiary
for any amounts that the subsidiary is required to pay pursuant to its
guarantee of the Supported Debt.

 

(e) In the event a partner of Regency guarantees or otherwise incurs any
liability with respect to the Supported Debt, the Support Provider agrees to
indemnify such partner for any amounts that the partner is required to pay
pursuant to its guarantee or liability with respect to the Supported Debt.

9\. _Subrogation_. To the extent that the Support Provider shall have made any
payments under this Agreement, the Support Provider shall be subrogated to,
and shall acquire, all rights of Regency Subsidiary Guarantor against Regency
with respect to such payments, including without limitation, (a) all rights of
subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification, and
(b) all rights to participate in any claim or remedy of Regency Subsidiary
Guarantor or any trustee on behalf of Regency Subsidiary Guarantor against
Regency, whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity or under
contract, statute or common law, including, without limitation, the right to
take or receive from Regency, directly or indirectly, in cash or other
property or by set-off or in any other manner, payment or security on account
of such claim, remedy or right.

 

10\. _Fraudulent Conveyance_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, it is intended that this Agreement not constitute a
Fraudulent Conveyance (as defined below). Consequently, the Support Provider
agrees that if this Agreement would, but for the application of this sentence,
constitute a Fraudulent Conveyance, this Agreement shall be valid and
enforceable only to the maximum extent that would not cause this Agreement to
constitute a Fraudulent Conveyance, and this Agreement shall automatically be
deemed to have been amended accordingly at all relevant times. For purposes of
this Section 10, the term "Fraudulent Conveyance" means a fraudulent
conveyance under Section 548 of the United States Bankruptcy Code or a
fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under the provisions of any
applicable fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer law or similar law of
any state, nation or other governmental unit, as in effect from time to time.

11\. _Cumulative Rights; No Waiver_. Each and every right granted to Support
Provider hereunder or under any other document delivered hereunder or in
connection herewith, or allowed it by law or equity, shall be cumulative and
may be exercised from time to time

 



5  subject only to the limitations set forth in this Agreement. No failure on
the part of Support Provider to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any
right shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise by Support Provider of any right preclude any other or future
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right.

12\. _Amendments; Waivers_.

(a) Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, this Agreement may not be
