ARTICLE II. 

TREATMENT OF SECURITIES 

   

    Section 2.1 _ Treatment of Capital Stock_.  

  

  

 (a) _ Treatment of Hurricane Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parties or holders of any securities of Hurricane or of Merger Sub, subject to _Section 2.1(d) _and _Section 2.5_, each Hurricane Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (but excluding Hurricane Shares to be cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_) shall be automatically converted into the right to receive 1.2196 (such number, the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable Cyclone Shares (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). From and after the Effective Time, all such Hurricane Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each applicable holder of such Hurricane Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor upon the surrender of such Hurricane Shares in accordance with _Section 2.2_, including the right to receive, pursuant to _Section 2.5_, cash in lieu of fractional Cyclone Shares, if any, which would otherwise be issuable in respect of such Hurricane Shares pursuant to this _Section 2.1(a) _(the " _Fractional Share Consideration_ "), together with the amounts, if any, payable pursuant to _Section 2.2(f)_. 

  

 (b) _ Cancellation of Hurricane Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, all Hurricane Shares owned by Hurricane, Cyclone, Merger Sub or by any of their respective direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

  

 (c) _ Treatment of Merger Sub Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, each issued and outstanding share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Merger Sub shall be automatically converted into, and become, one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation and such shares, collectively, shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (d) _ Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration shall be adjusted appropriately, without duplication, to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Hurricane Shares or 

  

      

  

Cyclone Shares, as applicable), reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with
respect to the Hurricane Shares or Cyclone Shares outstanding after the date
hereof and prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing
in this _Section 2.1(d)_ shall be construed to permit Cyclone, Hurricane or
any of their respective Subsidiaries to take any action with respect to its
securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

  

  

    
 Section 2.2 _ Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_.  

  

  

 (a) _ Exchange Fund_. Prior to the Effective Time, Cyclone or Merger Sub shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to Hurricane to act as the exchange agent in connection with the Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). The Exchange Agent shall also act as the agent for Hurricane\'s stockholders for the purpose of receiving and holding their Certificates and Book-Entry Shares and shall obtain no rights or interests in the shares represented thereby. At or prior to the Effective Time or as otherwise contemplated by _Exhibit C_, Cyclone or the Surviving Corporation shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent (i) evidence of Cyclone Shares issuable pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ in book-entry form equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration (excluding any Fractional Share Consideration), and (ii) cash in immediately available funds in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Fractional Share Consideration and any dividends or other distributions on Cyclone Shares in accordance with _Section 2.2(f)_ (such evidence of book-entry shares of Cyclone Shares and cash amounts, together with any dividends or other distributions with respect thereto, the " _Exchange Fund_ "), in each case, for the sole benefit of the holders of Hurricane Shares. In the event the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to pay the aggregate Fractional Share Consideration and any dividends or other distributions on Cyclone Shares in accordance with _Section 2.2(f)_, HurricaneCyclone shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly deposit additional funds with the Exchange Agent in the amount required to make such payment. HurricaneCyclone shall cause the Exchange Agent to make, and the Exchange Agent shall make, delivery of the Merger Consideration, including payment of the Fractional Share Consideration and any amounts payable in respect of dividends or other distributions on Cyclone Shares in accordance with _Section 2.2(f)_, out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose that is not expressly provided for in this Agreement. The cash portion of the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by HurricaneCyclone; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that any investment of such cash shall in all events be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S. government, in commercial paper rated P-1 or A-1 or better by Moody\'s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor\'s Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker\'s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available), and no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this _Article II_. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall, upon request by HurricaneCyclone, be paid to HurricaneCyclone on the earlier of (A) six months after the Effective Time or (B) the full payment of the Exchange Fund. 

   

 (b) _ Procedures for Surrender_. Promptly after the Effective Time, HurricaneCyclone shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause the Exchange Agent to mail (and make available for collection by hand) to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Hurricane Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") or non-certificated Hurricane Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") and whose Hurricane Shares were converted pursuant to _Section 2.1_ into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the 

  

      

  

Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent
and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Cyclone may
reasonably specify and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in
exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration issuable and payable in
respect of such Hurricane Shares pursuant to _Section 2.1_, including any
amount payable in respect of Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with
_Section 2.5_, and any dividends or other distributions on Cyclone Shares in
accordance with _Section 2.2(f)_. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or an
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share for cancellation to
the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by
HurricaneCyclone or the Surviving Corporation, together with such letter of
transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to
such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the applicable Merger Consideration
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_, any Fractional Share
Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of _Section 2.5_, and any amounts that such holder has the right
to receive in respect of dividends or other distributions on Cyclone Shares
in accordance with _Section 2.2(f)_ for each Hurricane Share formerly
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, to be mailed (or
made available for collection by hand if so elected by the surrendering
holder) within five (5) business days following the Exchange Agent\'s receipt
of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry
Share, letter of transmittal and such other documents, and the Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall be
forthwith cancelled. The Exchange Agent shall accept such Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with
such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose
to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange
practices. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is
registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment that (A) the
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in
proper form for transfer and (B) the Person requesting such payment shall
have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to
the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax either has been
paid or is not required to be paid. Payment of the applicable Merger
Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the
Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this _Section 2.2_, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration as contemplated by this
_Article II_, including any amount payable in respect of Fractional Share
Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.5_, and any dividends or other
distributions on Cyclone Shares in accordance with _Section 2.2(f)_, without
interest thereon.

  

 (c) _ Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Hurricane Shares_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of Hurricane shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Hurricane Shares on the records of Hurricane. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Hurricane Shares except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement. 

  

 (d) _ Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability_. At any time following six (6) months after the Effective Time, HurricaneCyclone shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to HurricaneCyclone any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) remaining in the Exchange Fund that have not been disbursed, or for which disbursement is pending subject only to 

  

      

  

the Exchange Agent\'s routine administrative procedures, to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be
entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation and HurricaneCyclone
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general
creditors thereof with respect to the applicable Merger Consideration,
including any amount payable in respect of Fractional Share Consideration in
accordance with _Section 2.5_, and any dividends or other distributions on
Cyclone Shares in accordance with _Section 2.2(f)_, payable upon due
surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and compliance with the
procedures in _Section 2.2(b) _, without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) none of the Surviving Corporation,
HurricaneCyclone or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of a
Certificate or Book-Entry Share for any Merger Consideration or other amounts
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law and (ii) any portion of the Merger Consideration,
including any amount payable in respect of Fractional Share Consideration in
accordance with _Section 2.5_, that remains undistributed to the holders of
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares as of immediately prior to such time that
the Merger Consideration or such cash would otherwise escheat to, or become
the property of, any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of HurricaneCyclone, free and clear of
all claims or interests of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  

 (e) _ Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof and, if required by HurricaneCyclone or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such holder of a bond in such amount as HurricaneCyclone or the Exchange Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to any such Certificates, the applicable Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.1_, including any amount payable in respect of Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.5_, and any dividends or other distributions on Cyclone Shares in accordance with _Section 2.2(f)_. 

  

 (f) _ Dividends or Distributions with Respect to Cyclone Shares_. No dividends or other distributions with respect to Cyclone Shares with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share with respect to the Cyclone Shares issuable hereunder, and all such dividends and other distributions shall be paid by Cyclone to the Exchange Agent and shall be included in the Exchange Fund, in each case until the surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) in accordance with this Agreement. Subject to applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate or Book-Entry Share (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) there shall be paid to the holder thereof, without interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such Cyclone Shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time, but prior to such surrender, and with a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such Cyclone Shares. 

  

      

                                    

    

    
 Section 2.3 _ Treatment of Hurricane Equity Awards_.  

  

  

 (a) As of the Effective Time, each option to purchase Hurricane Shares (a " _Hurricane Option_ ") granted under any Hurricane Equity Plan that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall be assumed by Cyclone and shall be converted into an option (a " _Cyclone Option_ ") to acquire Cyclone Shares in accordance with this _Section 2.3_. Each such Hurricane Option as so assumed and converted into a Cyclone Option shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to the Hurricane Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (but taking into account any changes thereto provided for in the applicable Hurricane Equity Plan, in any applicable award agreement or in such Hurricane Option, by reason of this Agreement or the Transactions). As of the Effective Time, each such Hurricane Option as so assumed and converted into a Cyclone Option shall be for that number of whole Cyclone Shares determined by multiplying the number of Hurricane Shares subject to such Hurricane Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share, at a per share exercise price determined by dividing the per share exercise price of such Hurricane Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that each Hurricane Option (A) which is an "incentive stock option" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code) shall be adjusted in accordance with the requirements of Section 424 of the Code and (B) shall be adjusted in a manner which complies with Section 409A of the Code. 

  

 (b) As of the Effective Time, each outstanding restricted stock unit and any associated rights to the issuance of additional Hurricane Shares upon the achievement of Hurricane performance goals (the " _Hurricane RSUs_ ") under any Hurricane Equity Plan that is not then vested shall be assumed by Cyclone and shall be converted into a restricted stock unit award for Cyclone Shares (the " _Cyclone RSUs_ ") with associated rights to the issuance of additional Cyclone Shares in accordance with this _Section 2.3_. Each Cyclone RSU as so assumed and converted shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to the applicable Hurricane RSUs immediately prior to the Effective Time (but taking into account any changes thereto, including any necessary changes to any issuance provisions, provided for or permitted in the applicable Hurricane Equity Plan, in any applicable award agreement or in such Hurricane RSUs, by reason of this Agreement or the Transactions). To the extent any such Hurricane RSUs are subject to performance vesting or other performance conditions, following the Effective Time, the HurricaneCyclone Board of Directors, or an applicable committee thereof, may make such equitable adjustments, if any, to the applicable performance goals or conditions relating to the Cyclone RSUs received by the holder of such Hurricane RSU, as the HurricaneCyclone Board of Directors (or such committee thereof) may determine to be necessary or appropriate as a result of the consummation of the Transactions, and, in each case, subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable Hurricane Equity Plans and such Cyclone RSUs. As of the Effective Time, the number of Cyclone Shares underlying each such Cyclone RSU as so assumed and converted (which shall be rounded (x) up to the nearest whole share if half a share or more or (y) down to the nearest whole share if less than half a share) shall be equal to the product of (i) the applicable number of Hurricane Shares subject to such award, multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio. For the avoidance of doubt, Cyclone shall have the ability to adjust any dividend equivalent rights under any Hurricane Equity Plan, in any award agreement or in any Hurricane RSUs, to reflect the changes or adjustments contemplated to the corresponding Hurricane RSUs by reason of this Agreement or the Transactions. 

  

 (c) As of the Effective Time, each outstanding share of restricted stock (collectively, the " _Hurricane Restricted Shares_ ") granted under any Hurricane Equity Plan that is not then vested shall be assumed by Cyclone and shall be converted into restricted shares of Cyclone (" _Cyclone_

  

      

  

 _Restricted Shares_ ") in accordance with this _Section 2.3_. Each Cyclone
Restricted Share as so assumed and converted shall continue to have, and
shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to the
applicable Hurricane Restricted Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time
(but taking into account any changes thereto provided for in the applicable
Hurricane Equity Plan, in any applicable award agreement or in such Hurricane
Restricted Shares, by reason of this Agreement or the Transactions). As
of the Effective Time, the number of Cyclone Shares underlying each such
Cyclone Restricted Share as so assumed and converted (which shall be rounded
(x) up to the nearest whole share if half a share or more or (y) down to the
nearest whole share if less than half a share) shall be equal to the product
of (i) the applicable number of Hurricane Shares subject to such
award, multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio.

  

 (d) As of the Effective Time, each outstanding phantom share (collectively, the " _Hurricane Phantom Shares_ ") granted under any Hurricane Equity Plan that is not then vested shall be assumed by Cyclone and shall be converted into phantom shares of Cyclone (" _Cyclone Phantom Shares_ ") in accordance with this _Section 2.3_. Each Cyclone Phantom Share as so assumed and converted shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to the applicable Hurricane Phantom Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time (but taking into account any changes thereto provided for in the applicable Hurricane Equity Plan, in any applicable award agreement or in such Hurricane Phantom Shares, by reason of this Agreement or the Transactions). As of the Effective Time, the number of Cyclone Shares underlying each such Cyclone Phantom Share as so assumed and converted (which shall be rounded (x) up to the nearest whole share if half a share or more or (y) down to the nearest whole share if less than half a share) shall be equal to the product of (i) the applicable number of Hurricane Shares subject to such award, multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio. 

   

 (e) Prior to the Effective Time, Hurricane shall (i) adopt such resolutions as are necessary to effect the treatment of the Hurricane Options, Hurricane Restricted Shares, Hurricane RSUs, and Hurricane Phantom Shares (collectively, the " _Hurricane Equity Awards_ ") as contemplated by this _Section 2.3_ and (ii) to the extent any Hurricane Equity Award does not provide for accelerated vesting of such Hurricane Equity Award upon an involuntary termination following a change in control (as defined in the Huntsman Corporation 2016 Stock Incentive Plan), amend such Hurricane Equity Award to provide that upon an involuntary termination of service of a holder of a Hurricane Equity Award at any time following the Effective Time, other than for cause, all Hurricane Equity Awards (A) as to which vesting depends solely on the satisfaction of a service obligation by the holder of the Hurricane Equity Award to HurricaneCyclone or any of its Subsidiaries shall become fully vested; or (B) as to which vesting depends upon the satisfaction of one or more performance objectives, shall immediately vest and all performance objectives shall be calculated based on either, as determined by the HurricaneCyclone Board of Directors in its sole discretion, (1) actual performance against the stated performance objectives as of the Closing Date or (2) deemed target performance pro-rated based on the number of days elapsed in the applicable performance period until the Closing Date. At the Effective Time, Cyclone shall assume all obligations of Hurricane under the Hurricane Equity Plans, each outstanding Hurricane Equity Award and the agreements evidencing the grants thereof and shall administer and honor all such awards in accordance with the terms and conditions of such awards and the Hurricane Equity Plans pursuant to which they were granted (subject to the adjustments required by reason of this Agreement or the Transactions or such other adjustments or amendments made by Cyclone in accordance with such terms and conditions). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, with respect to the Hurricane Equity Awards held by individuals who will be members of the Executive Committee of HurricaneCyclone, to the extent the Parties mutually agree that alternative treatment of such Hurricane Equity Awards is required as a result of applicable Law, the Parties will negotiate the terms of such alternative treatment in good faith and, to the extent permissible under applicable Law, preserve the intent of the treatment contemplated by this _Section 2.3_. 

  

      

  

 (f) At the Effective Time, all Cyclone Equity Awards shall continue on their terms and conditions and HurricaneCyclone shall administer all Cyclone Equity Awards in accordance with the terms and conditions of such awards and the Cyclone Equity Plans pursuant to which they were granted (subject to the adjustments required by reason of this Agreement or the Transactions or such other adjustments or amendments made by HurricaneCyclone in accordance with such terms and conditions). 

   

 (g) At the Effective Time, Cyclone shall assume all rights and obligations in respect of each Hurricane Equity Plan and will be able to grant stock awards, to the extent permissible by applicable Law under the terms of the Hurricane Equity Plans if Cyclone elects to assume the share reserves of such Hurricane Equity Plans as of the Effective Time, except that: (i) stock covered by such awards shall be Cyclone Shares; (ii) all references in such Hurricane Equity Plan to a number of Hurricane Shares shall be amended or deemed amended to refer instead to a number of Cyclone Shares determined by multiplying the number of referenced Hurricane Shares by the Exchange Ratio, and rounding the resulting number down to the nearest whole number of Cyclone Shares; and (iii) the HurricaneCyclone Board of Directors or a committee thereof shall succeed to the authority and responsibility of the Hurricane Board of Directors or any committee thereof with respect to the administration of such Hurricane Equity Plan. Hurricane and Cyclone shall cooperate in connection with the preparation of registration statements on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate form, including a Form F-1 or Form F-3) with respect to the Hurricane Equity Awards and the Cyclone Equity Awards, in order to file such forms as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time. 

  

 (h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Article II_, any payment to which a current or former employee of Hurricane or any Subsidiary of Hurricane becomes entitled pursuant to this _Section 2.3_ shall be made through the Surviving Corporation\'s payroll as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to make the payments under _Section 2.3_ payable to holders who are not current or former employees of Hurricane or any Hurricane Subsidiary in accordance with _Section 2.2_. 

  

  

    
 Section 2.4 _ Withholding_.  Cyclone and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement any amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted with respect to such consideration under the Code, or any applicable provisions of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and timely remitted to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. 

  

    
 Section 2.5 _ Fractional Shares_.  No fractional Cyclone Shares shall be issued in connection with the Merger, no certificate or scrip representing fractional Cyclone Shares shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of Cyclone. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of Hurricane Shares converted pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a Cyclone Share (after aggregating all Hurricane Shares represented by the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof and upon surrender thereof, cash, without interest, in an amount equal to the product of such fractional part of a Cyclone Share (rounded to the nearest one thousandth when expressed in decimal form) and the Cyclone VWAP.

 (a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time and the time, if any, at which this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Section 8.1_, and except as otherwise specifically provided for in this _Section 5.3_, Hurricane agrees that it shall not (and that the Hurricane Board of Directors shall not and that Hurricane shall cause each Hurricane Subsidiary not to), and that it shall cause its and its Subsidiaries\' officers and employees not to, and that it shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries\' other Representatives not to, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiry, proposal or offer, or the making, submission, modification or amendment or announcement of any inquiry, proposal or offer (including any inquiry, proposal or offer to its stockholders) which constitutes or would be reasonably expected to lead to a Hurricane Competing Proposal, (ii) participate in or engage in any negotiations or discussions regarding, or furnish to any Person any nonpublic information relating to Hurricane or any Hurricane Subsidiary in connection with, any inquiry, proposal or offer which constitutes or would be reasonably expected to lead to a Hurricane Competing Proposal, (iii) except in the event the Hurricane Board of Directors has determined in good faith after consultation with Hurricane\'s outside legal counsel that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of the members of the Hurricane Board of Directors under applicable Delaware Law, waive, terminate, modify or release any Person (other than Cyclone, Merger Sub and their respective affiliates) from any provision of, or grant any permission, waiver or request under, or fail to enforce, any "standstill" or similar agreement or obligation; _provided_ that Cyclone shall notify Hurricane promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) of any such waiver, termination, modification, release or grant of permission, waiver or request, (iv) approve or recommend, propose publicly to approve or recommend, or fail to timely recommend against, any Hurricane Competing Proposal, (v) withdraw, change, amend, modify or qualify, or otherwise propose publicly to withdraw, change, amend, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to Cyclone, the Hurricane Board Recommendation, (vi) enter into any letter of intent or other document or agreement relating to, or any agreement or commitment providing for, any Hurricane Competing Proposal, other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, or (vii) resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing (any act or failure to act described in clauses (iv), (v) or (vi) above, a " _Hurricane Change of Recommendation_ "). Hurricane shall immediately cease, and cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective directors, officers and employees to cease, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries\' other Representatives to immediately cease, any and all existing discussions or negotiations with any parties (or provision of any nonpublic information to any parties) conducted heretofore with respect to any Hurricane Competing Proposal or Hurricane Inquiry. Hurricane shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, promptly cause (to the extent it has not already done so prior to the date of this Agreement) any Person that has executed a confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement in connection with any Hurricane Competing Proposal or Hurricane Inquiry that remains in effect as of the date of this Agreement to return or destroy 

  

      

  

all confidential information in the possession of such Person or its
Representatives. Hurricane shall promptly following the execution of this
Agreement inform its and its Subsidiaries\' Representatives who would
reasonably be involved in such matters of Hurricane\'s obligations under this
_Section 5.3_. For purposes of this _Section 5.3_, the term " _Person_ "
means any Person or "group," as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act,
other than, with respect to Hurricane, Cyclone or any Cyclone Subsidiaries.
From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective
Time or the time, if any, at which this Agreement is terminated in accordance

combinations" or any similar provision contained in any applicable Takeover
Statute or the Hurricane Governing Documents or otherwise cause
such restrictions not to apply without the prior written consent of Cyclone,
except in connection with a Hurricane Change of Recommendation.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Hurricane, the Hurricane Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives
may in any event (A) seek to clarify and understand the terms and conditions
of any Hurricane Competing Proposal (or amended proposal) solely to determine
whether such Hurricane Competing Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be
expected to lead to a Hurricane Superior Proposal and (B) inform a Person that
has made a Hurricane Competing Proposal or an inquiry, proposal or offer
which would reasonably be expected to lead to a Hurricane Competing Proposal
of the provisions of this _Section 5.3_, in each case, so long
as Hurricane, the Hurricane Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives
otherwise comply with this _Section 5.3_ in connection therewith.

   

 (b) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in _Section 5.3(a)_, if Hurricane receives, after the date hereof and prior to the receipt of the Hurricane Stockholder Approval, a bona fide, unsolicited, written Hurricane Competing Proposal from any Person that did not result from a breach of this _Section 5.3_, which the Hurricane Board of Directors determines in good faith after consultation with Hurricane\'s outside legal and financial advisors, constitutes a Hurricane Superior Proposal or the Hurricane Board of Directors reasonably expects would lead to a Hurricane Superior Proposal, then, subject to compliance with _Section 5.3(c)_, Hurricane may take the following actions: (x) furnish nonpublic information that was previously furnished to Cyclone to the Person making such Hurricane Competing Proposal, if, and only if, prior to so furnishing such information, Hurricane receives from such Person an executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and (y) engage in discussions or negotiations with such Person with respect to the Hurricane Competing Proposal. 

  

 (c) Hurricane shall notify Cyclone promptly (but in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours) after receipt of any inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Hurricane Competing Proposal, or any inquiry or request for nonpublic information relating to Hurricane or any Hurricane Subsidiary by any Person who has made or would reasonably be expected to make any Hurricane Competing Proposal (each of the foregoing, a " _Hurricane Inquiry_ "). Such notice shall be made orally and confirmed in writing, and shall indicate the identity of the Person making the Hurricane Inquiry or with whom Hurricane is engaging in discussions or negotiations, and the material terms (including price) and conditions of any such inquiry, proposal, or offer or the nature of the information requested pursuant to such Hurricane Inquiry. In addition, Hurricane shall promptly (but in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) after the receipt thereof, provide to Cyclone copies of any proposed draft agreements and other written documentation material to understanding any Hurricane Competing Proposal or Hurricane Inquiry which is received by Hurricane from any Person (or from any Representatives of such Person) making such Hurricane Competing Proposal or Hurricane Inquiry or with whom discussions or negotiations would reasonably be expected to lead to a Hurricane Competing Proposal. Hurricane shall keep Cyclone reasonably informed of the status and material terms and conditions (including any amendments or proposed amendments to such material terms or conditions) of any such Hurricane Competing Proposal or Hurricane Inquiry and keep Cyclone reasonably informed as to the nature of any information requested of Hurricane or any 

  

      

  

Hurricane Subsidiary or any of their respective Representatives with respect
thereto. Neither Hurricane nor any of its Subsidiaries will enter into any
agreement with any Person which prohibits Hurricane from providing any
information to Cyclone in accordance with, or otherwise complying with, this
_Section 5.3_.

  

 (d) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.3_ (other than _Section 5.3(e)_) or _Section 5.5_ to the contrary, at any time prior to the receipt of the Hurricane Stockholder Approval, the Hurricane Board of Directors may make a Hurricane Change of Recommendation (i) in response to a Hurricane Intervening Event, or (ii) following receipt of a bona fide, unsolicited, written Hurricane Competing Proposal which the Hurricane Board of Directors determines in good faith after consultation with Hurricane\'s outside legal and financial advisors is a Hurricane Superior Proposal, in each case, if and only if, (x) with respect to clause (ii), neither Hurricane nor any of its Representatives solicited, encouraged or facilitated such Hurricane Competing Proposal in breach of, or is otherwise in breach of, the provisions of this _Section 5.3_, and (y) with respect to each of clauses (i) and (ii), the Hurricane Board of Directors has determined in good faith after consultation with Hurricane\'s outside legal counsel that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of the members of the Hurricane Board of Directors under applicable Delaware Law. 

  

 (e) Prior to Hurricane taking any action permitted (i) under _Section 5.3(d)(i)_, Hurricane shall provide Cyclone with five (5) business days\' prior written notice advising Cyclone it intends to effect a Hurricane Change of Recommendation and specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons therefor (including the material facts and circumstances related to the applicable Hurricane Intervening Event), and during such five (5) business day period, (x) Hurricane shall negotiate, and cause its Representatives to negotiate, with Cyclone and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent Cyclone wishes to negotiate) to enable Cyclone to determine whether to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement or any other agreement related to the Transactions such that it would obviate the need for the Hurricane Board of Directors to make a Hurricane Change of Recommendation and (y) Hurricane shall consider in good faith any proposal by Cyclone to amend the terms and conditions of this Agreement or any other agreement related to the Transactions in a manner that might obviate the need to effect a Hurricane Change of Recommendation or (ii) under _Section 5.3(d)(ii)_, Hurricane shall provide Cyclone with five (5) business days\' prior written notice (it being understood and agreed that any material amendment to the applicable Hurricane Competing Proposal shall require a new notice and an additional five (5) business day period) advising Cyclone that the Hurricane Board of Directors intends to take such action and contemporaneously providing to Cyclone a copy of the Hurricane Superior Proposal, a copy of any proposed agreements for such Hurricane Superior Proposal (including any financing commitments related thereto) (or, in each case, if not provided in writing to Hurricane or any of its Representatives, a written summary of the terms thereof), and during such initial or subsequent five (5) business day period, (x) Hurricane shall negotiate, and cause its Representatives to negotiate, with Cyclone and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent Cyclone wishes to negotiate) to enable Cyclone to determine whether to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement or any other agreement related to the Transactions such that such Hurricane Competing Proposal would no longer constitute a Hurricane Superior Proposal and (y) Hurricane shall consider in good faith any proposal by Cyclone to amend the terms and conditions of this Agreement or any other agreement related to the Transactions such that such Hurricane Competing Proposal would no longer constitute a Hurricane Superior Proposal. 

  

 (f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit Hurricane or the Hurricane Board of Directors from (i) disclosing to Hurricane\'s stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Hurricane Board of Directors has reasonably determined in good faith after consultation with Hurricane\'s outside legal counsel that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to 

  

      

  

constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of the members of the Hurricane
Board of Directors under applicable Delaware Law; _provided_ that this
_Section 5.3(f)_ shall not permit the Hurricane Board of Directors to make a
Hurricane Change of Recommendation except in compliance with  _Section
5.3(d)_ and _Section 5.3(e)_ or take any other action with respect to any
inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes or would reasonably be expected
to constitute a Hurricane Competing Proposal except to the extent such action
is explicitly permitted by the other paragraphs of this _Section 5.3_.

  

 (g) References in this _Section 5.3_ to the " _Hurricane Board of Directors_ " shall mean the Hurricane Board of Directors or, to the extent applicable, a duly authorized committee thereof.

 Section 6.7 _ Employee Benefits Matters. _ 

  

  

 (a) As of the date hereof, the Parties intend that, subject to the terms of any agreement with any works council, trade union, or other labor organization and the limitations of applicable Law, for the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the earlier of (i) the one year anniversary of the Effective Time and (ii) December 31, 2018 (the " _Continuation Period_ "), Cyclone shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any applicable Cyclone Subsidiary (including 

  

      

  

Hurricane and its Subsidiaries) to, provide to Continuing Employees with (A)
an annual base salary (or hourly wages, as applicable) and annual cash
incentive compensation opportunities that are substantially comparable to the
annual base salary and annual cash incentive compensation opportunities
received by such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time
and (B) group retirement plans and health and welfare plans benefits
(excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any equity or equity based
compensation program) that are substantially comparable to the group
retirement plans and health and welfare plans benefits provided to the
Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding
the foregoing intention, during the Continuation Period, Cyclone, the
Surviving Corporation or any Cyclone Subsidiary, as applicable, may (A) reduce
the compensation or benefits of any Continuing Employee who was employed
by Hurricane or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time (the
" _Hurricane Continuing Employees_ ") to provide compensation and benefit
levels to such Hurricane Continuing Employee that are substantially
comparable to the compensation and benefit levels received by a similarly
situated Continuing Employee who was employed by Cyclone or its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Cyclone Continuing Employees_
") or (B) reduce any Cyclone Continuing Employee\'s compensation or benefits
to provide compensation and benefit levels to such Cyclone Continuing Employee
that are substantially comparable to the compensation and benefit levels
received by a similarly situated Hurricane Continuing Employee.

  

 (b) Effective as of the Effective Time, for purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and level of benefits under the Cyclone Benefit Plans or Hurricane Benefit Plans providing benefits to any employee of Cyclone or Hurricane or any of their respective Subsidiaries who continues to be employed by Hurricane, Cyclone, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries immediately after the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Continuing Employees_ " and such benefit plans, collectively, the " _New Plans_ "), each Continuing Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with Hurricane, Cyclone or any of their respective Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective Time to the extent such Continuing Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any Cyclone Benefit Plan or Hurricane Benefit Plan, as applicable, for similar purposes prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply with respect to (A) any defined benefit pension plan or equity-based plan or arrangement, (B) the level of the retirement savings contribution under any tax-qualified or non-qualified defined contribution plans, (C) the determination of the level of benefits, including any employer subsidy, applicable to a Continuing Employee under any New Plan that provides retiree medical benefits, (D) any benefit plan that is frozen or for which participation is limited to a grandfathered population, (E) if such service was recognized for similar purposes prior to the Effective Time, to the extent that its application would result in a Continuing Employee receiving service credit in excess of the maximum service credit that such Continuing Employee, respectively, could be credited for such similar purpose or (F) to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits or compensation with respect to the same period of service. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary within the foregoing sentence, nothing in this _Section 6.7(b)_ shall be interpreted to prevent any Continuing Employee from receiving the full service credit for his or her years of service with Hurricane, Cyclone or any of their respective Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective Time that was already provided to such individual within any benefit plan in which that Continuing Employee was participating in or was eligible to participate in immediately prior to the Effective Time. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs, (1) each Continuing Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to the extent coverage under such New Plan is replacing comparable coverage under a Hurricane Benefit Plan or Cyclone Benefit Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits, as applicable, in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately before the 

  

      

  

Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), and (2) for
purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or
vision benefits to any Continuing Employee, Cyclone and Hurricane shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause (I) all pre-existing condition
exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan providing
medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to be waived for such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, unless and to the
extent the individual, immediately prior to the Effective Time, was subject
to such conditions under the comparable Old Plans, and (II) any eligible
expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents under the Old Plans providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical
and/or vision benefits during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan
ending on the Effective Time to be taken into account under such New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits for purposes
of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year in which the Effective Time occurs as

 Section 9.7 _ Interpretation. _ When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections, such reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." As used in this Agreement, the term "affiliates" shall have the meaning set forth in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. The table of contents and headings set forth in this Agreement or in the Cyclone Disclosure Letter or the Hurricane Disclosure Letter are for convenience of reference purposes only and shall not affect or be deemed to affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement or any term or provision hereof. When reference is made herein to a Person, such reference shall be deemed to include all direct and indirect Subsidiaries of such Person unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires. All references herein to the Subsidiaries of a Person shall be deemed to include all direct and indirect Subsidiaries of such Person unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires. The Parties agree that they have been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and, therefore, waive 

        

the application of any Law, holding or rule of construction providing that
ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be construed against the
party drafting such agreement or document. The words "hereof", "herein" and
"hereunder" and word of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer
to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement, unless the context requires otherwise. The definitions contained
in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms
of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter
genders of such terms. References in this Agreement to specific laws or to
specific provisions of laws shall include all rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, and any statute defined or referred to herein or in
any agreement or instrument referred to herein shall mean such statute as from
time to time amended, modified or supplemented, including by succession of
comparable successor statutes. The phrase "ordinary course of business" as
used in this Agreement shall be deemed to mean "the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice". All references to "dollars" and "$"
and "Swiss francs" and "CHF" will be deemed references to the lawful money of
the United States of America or Switzerland, respectively.

  

    
 Section 9.8 _ Counterparts. _ This Agreement may be executed manually or by facsimile by the Parties,  in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when a counterpart hereof shall have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile transmission or by e-mail of a .pdf attachment shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement. 

  

    
 Section 9.9 _ Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries_.  

  

  

 (a) This Agreement (including the Hurricane Disclosure Letter and the Cyclone Disclosure Letter), and all annexes and exhibits hereto, constitute the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all other prior agreements (except that the Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed amended hereby so that until the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.1_ hereof, Cyclone and Merger Sub shall be permitted to take the actions contemplated by this Agreement) and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties or any of them with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. 

  

 (b) Except as provided in _Section 6.4_ (but only following the Effective Time), neither this Agreement (including the Hurricane Disclosure Letter and the Cyclone Disclosure Letter) nor the Confidentiality Agreement are intended to confer upon any Person other than the Parties any rights or remedies hereunder. 

  

  

    
 Section 9.10 _ Severability. _ If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by rule of Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the Merger is not affected in any manner adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the Merger are fulfilled to the extent possible. 

  

    
 Section 9.11 _ Governing Law; Jurisdiction_.  

  

  

 (a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to conflicts of laws principles that would result in the application of the Law of any other state (including, for the avoidance of doubt, _Section 8.2_); _provided_ , that matters relating to the Cyclone Approval Matters, the Cyclone Shareholders Approval and the fiduciary duties of the Cyclone Board and the validity of any corporate actions 

  

      

  

on the part of Cyclone shall be governed by, and construed in accordance
with, the Laws of Switzerland without regard to conflicts of laws principles.

  

 (b) Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if (and only if) such court finds it lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the Superior Court of the State of Delaware (Complex Commercial Division) or, if subject matter jurisdiction over the matter that is the subject of the action or proceeding is vested exclusively in the federal courts of the United States of America, the federal court of the United States of America sitting in the District of Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the agreements delivered in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence any such action or proceeding except in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or, if (and only if) such court finds it lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the Superior Court of the State of Delaware (Complex Commercial Division) or, if subject matter jurisdiction over the matter that is the subject of the action or proceeding is vested exclusively in the federal courts of the United States of America, the federal court of the United States of America sitting in the District of Delaware, as applicable, and any appellate court from any thereof, (ii) agrees that any claim in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or, if (and only if) such court finds it lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the Superior Court of the State of Delaware (Complex Commercial Division) or, if subject matter jurisdiction over the matter that is the subject of the action or proceeding is vested exclusively in the federal courts of the United States of America, the federal court of the United States of America sitting in the District of Delaware, as applicable, and any appellate court from any thereof, (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the jurisdiction or laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in such courts and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in such courts. Each of the Parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each Party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process inside or outside the territorial jurisdiction of the courts referred to in this _Section 9.11(b)_ in the manner provided for notices in _Section 9.4_. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any Party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law. 

  

  

    
 Section 9.12 _ Waiver of Jury Trial_.  EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE MERGER AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 9.12_. 

  

    
 Section 9.13 _ Assignment. _ This Agreement shall not be assigned by any of the Parties (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other Parties, except Merger 

        

Sub may assign, in Cyclone and its sole discretion and without the consent of
Hurricane, any or all of its rights, interests and obligations hereunder to
(i) Cyclone, (ii) Cyclone and one or more direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiaries of Cyclone or (iii) one or more direct or indirect wholly
owned Subsidiaries of Cyclone; _provided_ , that no such assignment shall be
permitted without the prior written consent of Hurricane if such assignment
could increase the risk that any of the conditions set forth in _Article
VII_ may not be timely satisfied, or result in a breach of any of covenants
and agreements set forth in this Agreement or adversely affect Hurricane;
_provided_ , _further_ , that no such assignment shall relieve Cyclone or
Merger Sub of any obligation or liability under this Agreement. Subject to the
preceding sentence, but without relieving any Party of any obligation
hereunder, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and
be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and assigns.

  

    
 Section 9.14 _ Enforcement; Remedies_.  

  

  

 (a) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. 

  

 (b) The Parties agree that irreparable injury will occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement is not performed in accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise breached. It is agreed that prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_, each Party shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or remedy any breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by any other Party, to a decree or order of specific performance to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement and to any further equitable relief. 

  

 (c) The Parties\' rights in this _Section 9.14_ are an integral part of the Transactions and each Party hereby waives any objections to any remedy referred to in this _Section 9.14_ (including any objection on the basis that there is an adequate remedy at Law or that an award of such remedy is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity). For the avoidance of doubt, each Party agrees that there is not an adequate remedy at Law for a breach of this Agreement by any Party. In the event any Party seeks any remedy referred to in this _Section 9.14_, such Party shall not be required to obtain, furnish, post or provide any bond or other security in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any such remedy.
