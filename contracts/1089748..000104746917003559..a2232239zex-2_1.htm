of the Effective Time, each option to purchase Hurricane Shares (a "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Hurricane Option</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") granted under any Hurricane
Equity Plan that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall be assumed by Cyclone and shall be converted into an option (a
"</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Cyclone Option</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") to acquire Cyclone Shares in accordance with this </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Section&nbsp;2.3</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. Each such
Hurricane Option as so assumed and converted into a Cyclone Option shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to the Hurricane Option immediately prior
to the Effective Time (but taking into account any changes thereto provided for in the applicable Hurricane Equity Plan, in any applicable award agreement or in such Hurricane Option, by reason of
this Agreement or the Transactions). As of the Effective Time, each such Hurricane Option as so assumed and converted into a Cyclone Option shall be for that number of whole Cyclone Shares determined
by multiplying the number of Hurricane Shares subject to such Hurricane Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share, at a per share
exercise price determined by dividing the per share exercise price of such Hurricane Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent; </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>provided</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>,
</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>however</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, that each Hurricane Option (A)&nbsp;which is an "incentive stock option" (as
defined in Section&nbsp;422 of the Code) shall be adjusted in accordance with the requirements of Section&nbsp;424 of the Code and (B)&nbsp;shall be adjusted in a manner which complies with

Hurricane performance goals (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Hurricane RSUs</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") under any Hurricane Equity Plan that is not then vested shall be assumed by Cyclone and shall be
converted into a restricted stock unit award for Cyclone Shares (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Cyclone RSUs</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") with associated rights to the issuance of additional Cyclone Shares
in accordance with this </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>Section&nbsp;2.3</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. Each Cyclone RSU as so assumed and converted shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions as
applied to the applicable Hurricane RSUs immediately prior to the Effective Time (but taking into account any changes thereto, including any necessary changes to any issuance provisions, provided for
or permitted in the applicable Hurricane Equity Plan, in any applicable award agreement or in such Hurricane RSUs, by reason of this Agreement or the Transactions). To the extent any such Hurricane
RSUs are subject to performance vesting or other performance conditions, following the Effective Time, the HurricaneCyclone Board of Directors, or an applicable committee thereof, may make such
equitable adjustments, if any, to the applicable performance goals or conditions relating to the Cyclone RSUs received by the holder of such Hurricane RSU, as the HurricaneCyclone Board of Directors
(or such committee thereof) may determine to be necessary or appropriate as a result of the consummation of the Transactions, and, in each case, subject to and in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the applicable Hurricane Equity Plans and such Cyclone RSUs. As of the Effective Time, the number of Cyclone Shares underlying each such Cyclone RSU as so assumed and converted (which
shall be rounded (x)&nbsp;up to the nearest whole share if half a share or more or (y)&nbsp;down to the nearest whole share if less than half a share) shall be equal to the product of
(i)&nbsp;the applicable number of Hurricane Shares subject to such award, multiplied by (ii)&nbsp;the Exchange Ratio. For the avoidance of doubt, Cyclone shall have the ability to adjust any
dividend equivalent rights under any Hurricane Equity Plan, in any award agreement or in any Hurricane RSUs, to reflect the changes or adjustments contemplated to the corresponding Hurricane RSUs by
reason of this Agreement or the Transactions. </FONT></P>

(ii)&nbsp;to the extent any Hurricane Equity Award does not provide for accelerated vesting of such Hurricane Equity Award upon
an involuntary termination following a change in control (as defined in the Huntsman Corporation 2016 Stock Incentive Plan), amend such Hurricane Equity Award to provide that upon an involuntary
termination of service of a holder of a Hurricane Equity Award at any time following the Effective Time, other than for cause, all Hurricane Equity Awards (A)&nbsp;as to which vesting depends solely
on the satisfaction of a service obligation by the holder of the Hurricane Equity Award to HurricaneCyclone or any of its Subsidiaries shall become fully vested; or (B)&nbsp;as to which vesting
depends upon the satisfaction of one or more performance objectives, shall immediately vest and all performance objectives shall be calculated based on either, as determined by the HurricaneCyclone
Board of Directors in its sole discretion, (1)&nbsp;actual performance against the stated performance objectives as of the Closing Date or (2)&nbsp;deemed target performance pro-rated based on the
number of days elapsed in the applicable performance period until the Closing Date. At the Effective Time, Cyclone shall assume all obligations of Hurricane under the Hurricane Equity Plans, each
outstanding Hurricane Equity Award and the agreements evidencing the grants thereof and shall administer and honor all such awards in accordance with the terms and conditions of such awards and the
Hurricane Equity Plans pursuant to which they were granted (subject to the adjustments required by reason of this Agreement or the Transactions or such other adjustments or amendments made by Cyclone
in accordance with such terms and conditions). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, with respect to the Hurricane Equity Awards held by individuals who will be members of the Executive
Committee of HurricaneCyclone, to the extent the Parties mutually agree that alternative treatment of such Hurricane Equity Awards is required as a result of applicable Law, the Parties will negotiate
the terms of such alternative treatment in good faith and, to the extent permissible under applicable Law, preserve the intent of the treatment contemplated by this </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>Section&nbsp;2.3</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. </FONT></P>

disclosed by Hurricane in the reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the
SEC, and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to Hurricane's management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the
certifications required pursuant to Sections&nbsp;302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Sarbanes-Oxley Act</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"). Hurricane, each Hurricane
Subsidiary and each of their respective officers and directors in their capacities as such are in material compliance with, and, since December&nbsp;31, 2014, have materially complied with the

controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material respect Hurricane's ability to report financial information and (ii)&nbsp;any fraud, whether or not
