among MEDRAD, INC., a Delaware corporation (&#147;<U>Parent</U>&#148;), PHOENIX ACQUISITION CORP., a
Minnesota corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (&#147;<U>Purchaser</U>&#148;), and POSSIS

Agreement shall have the meanings assigned to them in Article&nbsp;X, or in the applicable Section of

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the boards of directors of each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company have approved
the acquisition of the Company by Parent on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, pursuant to this Agreement, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein,
Purchaser has agreed to commence a tender offer (the &#147;<U>Offer</U>&#148;) to purchase all the
outstanding shares of the Company&#146;s common stock, par value $.40 per share (&#147;<U>Company Common
Stock</U>&#148;), on the terms set forth herein.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (a)&nbsp;has by unanimous vote of the directors (i)
determined that this Agreement, the Offer, the Plan of Merger (as defined below) and the Merger (as
defined below) are advisable, fair and in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders,
(ii)&nbsp;approved the Offer and the merger of Purchaser with and into the Company, with the Company as
the surviving corporation (the &#147;<U>Merger</U>&#148;) pursuant to a plan of merger (the &#147;<U>Plan of
Merger</U>&#148;) in accordance with and in the form required by the Minnesota Business Corporation Act
(the &#147;<U>MBCA</U>&#148;) and (iii)&nbsp;approved this Agreement and (b)&nbsp;is recommending that the Company&#146;s
shareholders (the &#147;<U>Company Shareholders</U>&#148;) accept the Offer, tender their shares of Company
Common Stock into the Offer and, to the extent required by applicable Law, approve the Merger and
the Plan of Merger and adopt this Agreement.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery hereof and as a condition and inducement
to the willingness of Parent and Purchaser to enter into this Agreement, each of the directors and
executive officers of the Company, in their respective capacities as shareholders of the Company,
have entered into tender and support agreements with Parent substantially in the form of <U>Annex
A</U> (&#147;<U>Company Support Agreements</U>&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements hereinafter contained and intending to be bound hereby, the

would render any of the conditions set forth in Section&nbsp;1 of <U>Annex B</U> incapable of being
satisfied and (iii)&nbsp;none of the conditions set forth in Section&nbsp;2 of <U>Annex B</U> hereto shall
have occurred and be continuing, Parent shall cause Purchaser (and the Company shall cooperate with
Parent and Purchaser subject to Section&nbsp;6.02(e)) to commence (within the meaning of Rule&nbsp;14d-2 of

December&nbsp;23, 2006, by and between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Rights

Share, net to the sellers in cash (such amount, or any greater amount per Share paid pursuant to
the Offer, the &#147;<U>Offer Price</U>&#148;). Promptly after the later of: (i)&nbsp;the earliest date as of

Price, in the sole discretion of Purchaser), (iv)&nbsp;add to the Tender Offer Conditions, (v)&nbsp;waive or

expiration date of the Offer, other than in accordance with Section&nbsp;1.01(c) or (vii)&nbsp;make any other
change in the terms or conditions of the Offer which is or would reasonably be expected to be
materially adverse to any holder of Shares, it being agreed that a waiver by Purchaser of any of
the conditions set forth in <U>Annex B</U> (other than the Minimum Condition) in whole or in part
at any time and from time to time in its discretion shall not be deemed to be materially adverse to
any holder of Shares.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;The initial expiration date of the Offer (the &#147;<U>Expiration Date</U>&#148;) shall be the 20th
Business Day following the commencement of the Offer (determined using Rule&nbsp;14d-2 under the
Exchange Act). Without the prior written consent of the Company, Purchaser may extend the
Expiration Date (which extended date shall thereupon be the Expiration Date for purposes of this
Agreement) in increments of not more than ten (10)&nbsp;Business Days each, if at the scheduled
Expiration Date any of the conditions to Purchaser&#146;s obligation to purchase Shares are not
satisfied, until such time as such conditions are satisfied or waived, provided that the Expiration
Date shall not be later than the Outside Date as a result of such extension. Without limiting the
right of Purchaser to extend the Offer, provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated
in accordance with Article&nbsp;VIII hereof, (1)&nbsp;Purchaser shall extend the Expiration Date for any
period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or the staff thereof
applicable to the Offer and (2)&nbsp;Purchaser shall extend the Expiration Date if the conditions set

B) are not satisfied as of any scheduled Expiration Date, then, except to the extent that such
conditions are incapable of being satisfied, at the request of the Company, Purchaser shall extend
the Expiration Date for a period requested by the Company of not more than ten (10)&nbsp;Business Days
in order to permit the satisfaction of such conditions to the Offer; <U>provided</U>,
<U>however</U>, that Purchaser shall not be required to so extend the Expiration Date pursuant to
this sentence on more than two occasions or if the failure to meet any of such conditions set forth
in <U>Annex B</U> was caused by or resulted from the failure of the Company to perform in any
material respect any covenant or agreement of the Company contained herein, or the material breach
by the Company of any representation or warranty contained herein. In addition, Purchaser shall
have the right, without the consent of the Company, to make available a subsequent offering period
(within the meaning of Rule&nbsp;14d-11 under the Exchange Act) if, on the then-applicable Expiration
Date, the conditions to the Offer set forth in <U>Annex B</U> have been satisfied or waived but
there shall not have been tendered that number of Shares which would equal at least ninety percent
(90%) of the issued and then outstanding Shares on a &#147;fully diluted basis&#148; (which assumes

offering period and in any event in
compliance with Rule&nbsp;14d-11 and Rule&nbsp;14e-1(c) promulgated under the Exchange Act. The Offer may be
terminated prior to its Expiration Date (as such expiration date may be extended and re-extended in
accordance with this Agreement), but only if this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance

by the Company pursuant to Section&nbsp;302A.473 of the MBCA, and, prior to the Effective Time, Parent

for in Section&nbsp;2.07. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose that is not provided for
herein. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, in direct
obligations of the United States of America, obligations for which the full faith and credit of the
United States of America is pledged to provide for the payment of all principal and interest, or as
otherwise directed by Parent. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall

delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon

the surrender of the Certificate in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender to the
Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal duly executed, the holder
of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and Purchaser shall cause
the Exchange Agent to promptly so pay, cash in an amount equal to the product of the number of

entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other

Effective Time, the holders of the Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided herein or by

Law. If any Certificate has not been surrendered prior to six years after the Effective Time (or
