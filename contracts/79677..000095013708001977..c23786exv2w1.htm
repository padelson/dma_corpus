AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

   

 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (the " _Agreement_ "), dated as of February 11, 2008, by and among MEDRAD, INC., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), PHOENIX ACQUISITION CORP., a Minnesota corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Purchaser_ "), and POSSIS MEDICAL, INC., a Minnesota corporation (the " _Company_ "). Capitalized terms used in this Agreement shall have the meanings assigned to them in Article X, or in the applicable Section of this Agreement to which reference is made in Article X. 

  

 WHEREAS, the boards of directors of each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company have approved the acquisition of the Company by Parent on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. 

  

 WHEREAS, pursuant to this Agreement, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, Purchaser has agreed to commence a tender offer (the " _Offer_ ") to purchase all the outstanding shares of the Companys common stock, par value $.40 per share (" _Company Common Stock_ "), on the terms set forth herein. 

  

 WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (a) has by unanimous vote of the directors (i) determined that this Agreement, the Offer, the Plan of Merger (as defined below) and the Merger (as defined below) are advisable, fair and in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders, (ii) approved the Offer and the merger of Purchaser with and into the Company, with the Company as the surviving corporation (the " _Merger_ ") pursuant to a plan of merger (the " _Plan of Merger_ ") in accordance with and in the form required by the Minnesota Business Corporation Act (the " _MBCA_ ") and (iii) approved this Agreement and (b) is recommending that the Companys shareholders (the " _Company Shareholders_ ") accept the Offer, tender their shares of Company Common Stock into the Offer and, to the extent required by applicable Law, approve the Merger and the Plan of Merger and adopt this Agreement. 

  

 WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery hereof and as a condition and inducement to the willingness of Parent and Purchaser to enter into this Agreement, each of the directors and executive officers of the Company, in their respective capacities as shareholders of the Company, have entered into tender and support agreements with Parent substantially in the form of _Annex A_ (" _Company Support Agreements_ "). 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements hereinafter contained and intending to be bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I  THE OFFER 

   

 Section 1.01 _The Offer_. (a) Provided that (i) this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with _Article VIII_ hereof, (ii) nothing shall have occurred that would render any of the conditions set forth in Section 1 of _Annex B_ incapable of being satisfied and (iii) none of the conditions set forth in Section 2 of _Annex B_ hereto shall have occurred and be continuing, Parent shall cause Purchaser (and the Company shall cooperate with Parent and Purchaser subject to Section 6.02(e)) to commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 of the 

   ##### 

  

    

Exchange Act), as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this
Agreement but in no event more than ten (10) Business Days thereafter, an
offer to purchase all outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (including
the associated rights to purchase shares of capital stock of the Company ("
_Rights_ ") issued pursuant to that certain Shareholder Rights Plan dated as
of December 23, 2006, by and between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank,
National Association, as Rights Agent (the " _Rights Plan_ ")) (each such
share of Company Common Stock, together with the associated Rights, a "
_Share_ " and collectively, " _Shares_ ") at a price of $19.50 per Share, net
to the sellers in cash (such amount, or any greater amount per Share paid
pursuant to the Offer, the " _Offer Price_ "). Promptly after the later of:
(i) the earliest date as of which Parent is permitted under applicable Law to
accept for payment Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer and (ii) the
earliest date as of which each of the Tender Offer Conditions shall have been
satisfied or waived (and in any event in compliance with Rule 14e-1(c)),
Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause it to, accept for payment, and pay
for (after giving effect to any required withholding Tax), all Shares validly
tendered pursuant to the Offer and not withdrawn (the time and date of
acceptance for payment, the " _Acceptance Date_ "). 

  

 (b) Purchaser expressly reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to waive, in whole or in part, any Tender Offer Condition or modify the terms of the Offer; _provided_ , _ however_ , that without the prior written consent of the Company, Purchaser shall not (i) decrease the Offer Price, (ii) decrease the number of Shares sought to be purchased in the Offer, (iii) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer (other than by increasing the Offer Price, in the sole discretion of Purchaser), (iv) add to the Tender Offer Conditions, (v) waive or amend the Minimum Condition (as defined in _Annex B_ ), (vi) extend or otherwise change the expiration date of the Offer, other than in accordance with Section 1.01(c) or (vii) make any other change in the terms or conditions of the Offer which is or would reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to any holder of Shares, it being agreed that a waiver by Purchaser of any of the conditions set forth in _Annex B_ (other than the Minimum Condition) in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in its discretion shall not be deemed to be materially adverse to any holder of Shares. 

   

 (c) The initial expiration date of the Offer (the " _Expiration Date_ ") shall be the 20th Business Day following the commencement of the Offer (determined using Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act). Without the prior written consent of the Company, Purchaser may extend the Expiration Date (which extended date shall thereupon be the Expiration Date for purposes of this Agreement) in increments of not more than ten (10) Business Days each, if at the scheduled Expiration Date any of the conditions to Purchasers obligation to purchase Shares are not satisfied, until such time as such conditions are satisfied or waived, provided that the Expiration Date shall not be later than the Outside Date as a result of such extension. Without limiting the right of Purchaser to extend the Offer, provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with Article VIII hereof, (1) Purchaser shall extend the Expiration Date for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or the staff thereof applicable to the Offer and (2) Purchaser shall extend the Expiration Date if the conditions set forth in clauses (ii) and (iii) of Section 1 of _Annex B_ are not satisfied as of any scheduled Expiration Date, until such time as the conditions set forth in clauses (ii) and (iii) of Section 1 of _Annex B_ are satisfied, provided that the Expiration Date shall not be later than the Outside Date as a result of such extension. Further, provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with Article VIII hereof, if any of the conditions set forth in 

  ##### 

  

    

Annex B (other than the conditions set forth in clauses (ii) and (iii) of
Section 1 of Annex B) are not satisfied as of any scheduled Expiration Date,
then, except to the extent that such conditions are incapable of being
satisfied, at the request of the Company, Purchaser shall extend the
Expiration Date for a period requested by the Company of not more than ten
(10) Business Days in order to permit the satisfaction of such conditions to
the Offer; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Purchaser shall not be required to
so extend the Expiration Date pursuant to this sentence on more than two
occasions or if the failure to meet any of such conditions set forth in
_Annex B_ was caused by or resulted from the failure of the Company to perform
in any material respect any covenant or agreement of the Company contained
herein, or the material breach by the Company of any representation or
warranty contained herein. In addition, Purchaser shall have the right,
without the consent of the Company, to make available a subsequent offering
period (within the meaning of Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act) if, on the
then-applicable Expiration Date, the conditions to the Offer set forth in
_Annex B_ have been satisfied or waived but there shall not have been
tendered that number of Shares which would equal at least ninety
percent (90%) of the issued and then outstanding Shares on a "fully diluted
basis" (which assumes conversion or exercise of all derivative securities
regardless of the conversion or exercise price, the vesting schedule or other
terms and conditions thereof). Subject to the terms and conditions set forth
in the Offer, Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause it to, accept for
payment and pay for all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn during such
subsequent offering period promptly after any such Shares are tendered during
such subsequent offering period and in any event in compliance with Rule
14d-11 and Rule 14e-1(c) promulgated under the Exchange Act. The Offer may
be terminated prior to its Expiration Date (as such expiration date may be
extended and re-extended in accordance with this Agreement), but only if this
Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with Section 8.01. In no event
shall Purchaser extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date. 

   

 (d) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Purchaser shall (i) file or cause to be filed with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO (together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Schedule TO_") with respect to the Offer which shall contain the offer to purchase and related letter of transmittal and summary advertisement and other ancillary documents and instruments required thereby pursuant to which the Offer will be made (collectively with any supplements or amendments thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "); (ii) cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares as required by applicable Law; and (iii) timely file with the Commissioner of Commerce of the State of Minnesota any registration statement relating to the Offer required to be filed pursuant to Chapter 80B of the Minnesota Statutes and shall disseminate to the holders of Company Common Stock via the Offer Documents the information set forth in any such registration statement to the extent and within the time period required by Chapter 80B of the Minnesota Statutes. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents prior to their filing with the SEC and Parent and Purchaser shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by the Company and its counsel. 

   

 (e) Parent and Purchaser shall cause the Offer Documents and any amendments or supplements thereto to (i) comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act, and (ii) not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that no covenant is made by 

  ##### 

  

    

Parent with respect to information supplied by the Company specifically for
inclusion in the Offer Documents. Parent and Purchaser shall cause the
information supplied by Parent and its affiliates specifically for inclusion
in the Schedule 14D-9, the Information Statement or the Proxy Statement, at
the respective times the Schedule 14D-9, the Information Statement or the
Proxy Statement are filed with the SEC or, in the case of the Proxy
Statement, at the time of the Special Meeting, not to contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Parent
and Purchaser shall cause the Offer to be conducted in compliance in all
material respects with the Exchange Act. 

   

 (f) If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to the Offer, the Merger, the Company, Parent, Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, should be discovered by the Company or Purchaser which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Offer Documents so that the Offer Documents shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties, and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the Company Shareholders, as and to the extent required by applicable Law or any applicable rule or regulation of any stock exchange. Parent and Purchaser agree to provide the Company with (i) any comments or other communications, whether written or oral, that may be received from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after receipt thereof and prior to responding thereto and (ii) a reasonable opportunity to provide comments on that response (to which reasonable and good faith consideration shall be given). 

   

 (g) Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to the Offer to any holder of Shares such amounts as Purchaser is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Taxing authority by Purchaser, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Purchaser. 

   

 (h) Parent shall cause to be provided to Purchaser all of the funds necessary to purchase any Shares that Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer, and shall cause Purchaser to perform, on a timely basis, all of Purchasers obligations under this Agreement. 

   

 Section 1.02 _Company Actions_. (a) The Company hereby represents, that the Companys board of directors, at a meeting duly called and held at which a quorum was present throughout, has unanimously (i) determined and declared that this Agreement and each of the Offer and the Merger are advisable, fair and in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, (ii) approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer, the Merger and the Plan of Merger, in all respects in accordance with the MBCA, (iii) recommended that the Company Shareholders accept the Offer, tender their Shares

the MBCA inapplicable to each of the Offer and the Merger,  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Companys board of directors may withdraw, modify
or amend the Company Recommendations in a manner adverse to Purchaser and
Parent only prior to the Acceptance Date and, in any case, only in accordance
with Section 6.02(e) of this Agreement. The Company shall file with the SEC
and mail to the holders of Shares, on the date of the filing by Parent and
Purchaser of the Offer Documents with the SEC, a Solicitation/Recommendation
Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with any amendments or supplements

14D-9 will set forth the Company Recommendations. To the extent the Company
Recommendations have not been withdrawn, modified or amended, the Company
shall afford Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
the Schedule 14D-9 prior to the time the Schedule 14D-9 is filed with the SEC
and mailed to the holders of Shares. The Company hereby consents to the
inclusion in the Offer Documents of the Company Recommendations to the extent
such Company Recommendations are not withheld or withdrawn in accordance with
and subject to Section 6.02(e). To the extent the Company Recommendations have
been withdrawn, amended or modified in accordance with and subject to Section
6.02(e), the Company hereby consents to the inclusion of such recommendation,
as so amended or modified, in the Offer Documents. 

   

 (b) The Company shall cause the Schedule 14D-9, the Information Statement and, if a Proxy Statement is required in connection with the Merger, the Proxy Statement to (i) comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act and, on the date filed with the SEC and on the date first published, sent or given to the Company Shareholders and, in the case of the Proxy Statement, on the date of the Special Meeting, (ii) not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that no covenant is made by the Company with respect to information supplied by Parent or Purchaser for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9, the Information Statement or the Proxy Statement and (iii) include the opinion of the Companys Financial Advisor referred to in Section 4.22. The Company shall cause the information relating to the Company and its subsidiaries supplied by the Company specifically for inclusion in the Offer Documents, including any amendments or supplements thereto, at the respective times the Offer Documents or any amendments or supplements thereto are filed with the SEC, not to contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. 

   

 (c) If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to the Offer, the Merger, the Company, Parent, Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, should be discovered by the Company or Purchaser which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Schedule 14D-9, so that the Schedule 14D-9 shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties, and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the Company Shareholders, as and 

   #####

been withdrawn, modified or amended, the Company agrees to provide Parent and
Purchaser with (i) any comments or other communications, whether written or
oral, that may be received from the SEC or its staff with respect to
the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt thereof and prior to responding
thereto and (ii) a reasonable opportunity to provide comments on that
response (to which reasonable and good faith consideration shall be given). 

   

 (d) In connection with the Offer, the Company will cause its transfer agent to promptly furnish Purchaser with mailing labels, security position listings, non-objecting beneficial owner lists and any available listing or computer list containing the names and addresses of the record holders of Shares and lists of security positions of Company Common Stock held in stock depositories as of the most recent practicable date and shall furnish Purchaser with such additional available information (including updated lists of holders of Shares and their addresses, mailing labels and lists of security positions and non-objecting beneficial owner lists) and such other assistance as Purchaser or its agents may reasonably request in communicating the Offer to the Companys record and beneficial shareholders.

 Section 1.04 _Top-Up Option_. (a) The Company hereby grants to Purchaser an irrevocable option (the " _Top-Up Option_ "), exercisable on the terms and conditions set forth in this  _Section 1.04_, to purchase at a price per share equal to the Offer Price up to that number of newly issued shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Top-Up Shares_ ") equal to the lowest number of shares of Company Common Stock that, when added to the number of shares of Company Common Stock directly or indirectly owned by Parent or Purchaser at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option, shall constitute one share more than 90% of the shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up Shares (determined on a "fully diluted basis" (which assumes conversion or exercise of all derivative securities regardless of the conversion or exercise price, the vesting schedule or other terms and conditions thereof)); _provided_ , _ however_ , that (i) the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable for a number of shares of Company Common Stock that exceeds the number of authorized shares of Company Common Stock, less shares of Company Common Stock issued or reserved for issuance at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option and (ii) the Top-Up Option may not be exercised unless, following the acceptance by Purchaser of shares of Company Common Stock tendered in the Offer or after a subsequent offering period, eighty percent (80%) or more of the 

   #####

or Purchaser. The Top-Up Option shall be exercisable once at any time within
six (6) Business Days following the later to occur of the Acceptance Date or
the expiration of any subsequent offering period and prior to the earlier to
occur of (a) the Effective Time and (b) the termination of this Agreement
in accordance with its terms. 

   

 (b) The parties shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance and delivery of the Top-Up Shares comply with all applicable Law, including compliance with an applicable exemption from registration of the Top-Up Shares under the Securities Act.

The Company shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of such notice, deliver written notice to Purchaser specifying, based on the information provided by Purchaser in its notice, the number of Top-Up Shares. At the closing of the purchase of Top-Up Shares, the purchase price owed by Purchaser to the Company therefor shall be paid to the Company (i) in cash, by wire transfer or cashiers check or (ii) by issuance by Purchaser to the Company of a promissory note on terms reasonably satisfactory to the Company. Each of Parent and Purchaser agrees to consummate the Merger as promptly as practicable following the closing of the purchase of Top-Up Shares in accordance with Section 302A.621 of the MBCA and the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Without the prior written consent of the Company, the right to exercise the Top-Up Option granted pursuant to this Agreement shall not be assigned by Purchaser except to any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Any attempted assignment in violation of this Section 1.04(b) shall be null and void.

ARTICLE III DISSENTING SHARES; EXCHANGE OF SHARES 

   

 Section 3.01 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger and who has delivered a written notice of intent to demand payment of the fair value of such shares in accordance with Section 302A.473 of the MBCA (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.07(b), unless and until such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or otherwise loses such holders right to demand payment under the MBCA. Such holder shall be entitled to receive payment of the fair value of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of the MBCA, provided that such holder complies with the provisions of Section 302A.473 of the MBCA. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or otherwise loses such holders right to payment under Section 302A.473 of the MBCA, such Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent and Purchaser prompt notice of any demands received by the Company pursuant to Section 302A.473 of the MBCA, and, prior to the Effective Time, Parent and Purchaser shall have the right to participate, at Parents expense, in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Purchaser, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands. 

  

 Section 3.02 _Exchange of Shares_. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser shall designate a bank or trust company or similar entity reasonably acceptable to the Company which is authorized to exercise corporate trust or stock powers to act as Exchange Agent in the Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). At the Effective Time, Purchaser will provide the Exchange Agent the funds necessary to make the cash payments contemplated by Section 2.07 (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Agent shall cause the Exchange Fund to be (i) held for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock and (ii) promptly applied to making the payments provided for in Section 2.07. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose that is not provided for herein. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, in direct obligations of the United States of America, obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide for the payment of all principal and interest, or as otherwise directed by Parent. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be kept in the Exchange Fund. To the extent that there are losses with respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make prompt payments of the Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby, Parent shall promptly replace or restore the portion of the Exchange Fund lost through investments or other 

   ##### 

  

 

events so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is, at all times, maintained at
a level sufficient to make such payments. 

   

 (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Purchaser shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each record holder, as of the Effective Time, of an outstanding certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares (the " _Certificates_ "), one or more forms of a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificate in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and Purchaser shall cause the Exchange Agent to promptly so pay, cash in an amount equal to the product of the number of Shares represented by such Certificate multiplied by the amount of the Merger Consideration with respect to Shares, and such Certificate shall then be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender of any Certificate. If payment is to be made to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate surrendered is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such payment shall pay transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3.02, each Certificate (other than Certificates representing Shares held by Parent, the Company or any subsidiary of Parent or of the Company and Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent for all purposes only the right to receive the Merger Consideration in cash multiplied by the number of Shares evidenced by such Certificate, without any interest thereon. 

   

 (c) At any time following the ninth month after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any funds which have been made available to the Exchange Agent and not disbursed to the holders of Shares (including, without limitation, all interest and other income available to it) and thereafter, such holders shall be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar Laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration that may be due or payable on surrender of the Certificates held by them. 

   

 (d) After the Effective Time, the stock books of the Company shall be closed and, thereafter, there shall be no further registrations or transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of the Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable Law. 

   

 Section 3.03 _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation and Purchaser, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Shares pursuant to this Article III such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of federal, state, local 

   ##### 

  

 

or foreign tax Law. If the Surviving Corporation or Purchaser, as the case may
be, so withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of
which the Surviving Corporation or Purchaser, as the case may be, made such
deduction and withholding. 

   

 Section 3.04 _No Liability_. None of Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any Merger Consideration properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate has not been surrendered prior to six years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which the Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any governmental entity), any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease or operate all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. The Company is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in good corporate standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned, leased or operated by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified and in good corporate standing has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Company, copies of which have previously been made available to Parent, are true, complete and correct copies of such documents as currently in effect. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) Each of the Companys subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its organization.

Each of the subsidiaries is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned, leased, or operated by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified and in good corporate standing has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The articles of incorporation and bylaws or equivalent organizational documents of each of the Companys subsidiaries, copies of which have previously been made available to Parent, are true, correct and complete copies of such documents as currently in effect. 

   

 (c) All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock or other ownership interests of each of the subsidiaries of the Company are owned by the Company, directly or indirectly, free and clear of any claim, Lien or agreement with respect thereto and, in the case of corporations, such shares of capital stock are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. No subsidiary of the Company owns any capital stock of the Company. There are no obligations, contingent or otherwise, of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company to provide funds to or make an investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in any other Person. 

   

 (d) No subsidiary of the Company is party to any Contract obligating such subsidiary, directly or indirectly, to issue any additional equity or other securities. No subsidiary of the Company has outstanding any bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations or debt securities the holders of which have the right to vote (or convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote) on any matter, any stock appreciation rights, "phantom" stock rights, performance units, rights to receive securities on a deferred basis or other rights that are linked to the value of such subsidiary or any part thereof and no subsidiary of the Company is a party to, or bound by, any Contract with respect thereto.

As of February 8, 2008, there were 17,034,157 shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding (of which 53,757 were Company Restricted Shares), and no shares of Company Preferred Stock issued and outstanding. In addition, as of such date, (i) there were 3,935,651 shares of Company Common Stock reserved and available for issuance under the Company Stock Plans, of which 3,527,134 were subject to Company Stock Options outstanding and which Company Stock Options have a weighted average exercise price of approximately $11.03 per share, and (ii) the only shares of Company Preferred Stock reserved for issuance are those shares of Company Preferred Stock reserved for issuance pursuant to the Rights Plan. The Company has no shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock reserved for issuance other than as described above. All issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) Other than as set forth in Section 4.02(a), there are (i) no outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock or any other shares of capital stock of, or equity or voting interests in, the Company, (ii) no Company Stock Options or other securities convertible into, exchangeable or exercisable for or representing the right to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise receive any shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock or any other share of capital stock of, or equity or voting interests in, the Company and (iii) no stock appreciation rights, "phantom" stock rights, performance units, rights to receive shares of Company Common Stock on a deferred basis or other rights that are linked to the value of the Company Common Stock or the value of the Company or any part thereof (the securities described in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), collectively, " _Company Equity Interests_ ").

There are no outstanding contractual obligations of the Company to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, the Company. All Company Stock Options and Company Restricted Shares may, by their terms, be treated in accordance with _Section 2.08_. The board of directors of the Company (or applicable committee thereof) has taken such actions as are required to provide that, with respect to the Companys employee stock purchase plan, (i) participants may not increase their payroll deductions or purchase elections from those in effect on the date hereof and (ii) cause the employee stock purchase plan to be suspended so that no further contributions are made thereto effective as of February 11, 2007. Such suspension shall cause the "offering period" in effect on the date hereof to be the final "offering period" and subject to consummation of the Offer and the Merger, the employee stock purchase plan shall terminate immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 Parent and Purchaser, jointly and severally, represent and warrant to the Company, subject to and qualified by items disclosed in the letter delivered by Parent and Purchaser to the Company concurrently with the execution of this Agreement (the " _Parent Letter_ ") which letter shall identify any exceptions to the representations, warranties and covenants contained in this Agreement (it being agreed that disclosure of any item with respect to any Section of this Article V shall be deemed disclosure with respect to the representations and warranties set forth in this Article V other than the Section to which such disclosure specifically relates if the relevance of such item thereto is reasonably apparent on its face), as follows: 

  

 Section 5.01 _Organization_. (a) Each of Parent and Purchaser is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation. Parent has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease or operate all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Parent is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in good corporate standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned, leased or operated by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified and in good corporate standing has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 (b) Since the date of its incorporation, Purchaser has not carried on any business or conducted any operations, and will not do so, other than the execution of this Agreement, the Company Support Agreement, the performance of its obligations hereunder and thereunder, and matters ancillary thereto. Purchaser was incorporated solely for the purpose of consummating the Offer, the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Purchaser have been validly issued, are fully paid and nonassessable and are owned by, and at the Effective Time will be owned by, Parent free and clear of all Liens. 

  

 Section 5.02 _Authority; No Violation_. (a) Each of Parent and Purchaser has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, and to comply with the provisions of this Agreement. The approval, adoption, execution and delivery of this Agreement, the consummation by Parent and Purchaser of the transactions contemplated hereby and the compliance by Parent and Purchaser with the provisions of this Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Parent and Purchaser, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Purchaser are necessary to authorize this Agreement, to comply with the terms of this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by each of Parent and Purchaser and (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the Company) constitutes the valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and Purchaser, enforceable against each of them in accordance with its terms, except as the enforceability thereof may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating to or affecting creditors rights generally or by general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered at law or in equity). 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) Assuming that all consents, authorizations, permits, waivers and approvals referred to in  _Section 5.02(c)_ of the Parent Letter have been obtained and all registrations, declarations, filings and notifications described in _Section 5.02(c)_ of the Parent Letter have been made and any waiting periods thereunder have terminated or expired, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Purchaser nor the consummation by Parent and Purchaser of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, nor the compliance by Parent and Purchaser with the provisions of this Agreement, do or will (i) conflict with or violate any provision of the organizational documents or the bylaws of Parent or any of its subsidiaries, (ii) conflict with or violate any Law or Order applicable to Parent or its subsidiaries or by which any property or asset of Parent or any of its subsidiaries is bound or affected or (iii) result in any violation or breach of or any loss of any benefit under, or constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default) under, or give to others any right of termination, vesting, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of Parent or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to, or give rise to any increased, additional, accelerated or guaranteed rights or entitlements under, any Contract to which Parent or any of its subsidiaries is a party as issuer, guarantor or obligor, or by which they or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound or affected, except, with respect to (ii) and (iii) above, for any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults, rights, Liens or entitlements which would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 (c) No consents, authorizations, orders, waivers or approvals of, or filings, declarations or registrations with, or notifications to any Governmental Entity are necessary in connection with (i) the execution and delivery by Parent and Purchaser of this Agreement, or (ii) the consummation by Parent and Purchaser of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, or the compliance by Parent and Purchaser with the provisions of this Agreement, except (A) in connection with the HSR Act and Other Antitrust Laws, (B) registration of the Offer pursuant to Section 80B.03 of the Minnesota Statutes, (C) pursuant to the Exchange Act, (D) the filing of articles of merger pursuant to the MBCA, and (E) such consents, authorizations, orders, waivers, approvals, filings, declarations, notices and registrations the failure of which to obtain or make would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 Section 5.03 _Legal Proceedings_. There is no Proceeding of any nature pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened, against Parent or any of its subsidiaries challenging the validity or propriety of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which, if adversely determined, would, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Neither Parent nor any subsidiary nor any property or asset of Parent or any subsidiary is subject to any continuing Order which, either individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 5.04 _Available Funds_. Parent has, and will have at each of the Acceptance Date and the date of the Effective Time, sufficient cash, immediately available lines of credit or other sources of immediately available funds to enable it and Purchaser to pay in full the aggregate Offer Price, the aggregate Merger Consideration and the aggregate consideration to be paid to holders of Company Stock Options as a result of the Merger, as well as to make all other required payments payable in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer for (i) any
sale, lease or other disposition, direct or indirect (and however structured),
of any business or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (which
business or assets represent 20% or more of the consolidated revenues, net
income or assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole), (ii)
any tender offer (including a self-tender offer) or exchange offer that,
if consummated, would result in a third party beneficially owning (or the
Company purchasing) 20% or more of any class of securities of the Company,
(iii) a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination,
reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other
similar transaction involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries (which
subsidiaries represent 20% or more of the consolidated revenues, net income
or assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole), (iv) the
issuance, sale or other disposition, direct or indirect (and
however structured), of securities (or securities or other rights convertible
into, or exercisable or exchangeable for, such securities) representing 20%
or more of the voting power or capital stock of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries (which subsidiaries represent 20% or more of the consolidated
revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a
whole) or (v) any combination of the foregoing in a series of related
transactions (the term "beneficial ownership" for purposes of this Agreement
having the meaning assigned thereto in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder); provided, however, that the
term "Acquisition Proposal" shall not include the Offer or the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding Section 6.02(a), the Company may furnish information to, and negotiate or otherwise engage in discussions with, any Person that has made, after the date of this Agreement, a bona fide written unsolicited Acquisition Proposal if and only to the extent that: (i) the Acceptance Date has not occurred; (ii) the board of directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys Financial Advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal is reasonably expected to lead to a Superior Proposal; (iii) the board of directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action is reasonably likely to result in a breach of the directors fiduciary duties to the Company Shareholders under applicable Law; (iv) prior to furnishing any nonpublic information to such Person, the Company enters into a confidentiality agreement with such Person that contains confidentiality and other provisions no less favorable to the Company than the Confidentiality Agreement dated as of October 12, 2007 by and between the Parent and the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "); (v) the Company provides written notice to Parent of its intent to furnish information or enter into discussions or negotiations with such Person at least three (3) Business Days prior to taking any such action and (vi) such Acquisition Proposal did not result from the Companys breach of the covenants contained in Section 6.02(a); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Company shall promptly make available to Parent with any nonpublic information made available to any third party under this Section 6.02(b) if such information has not previously been made available to the Parent. " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any bona fide written unsolicited Acquisition Proposal (provided that for purposes of this definition, the references to "20%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed replaced with references to "66 2/3%") made by any party (other than Parent and its subsidiaries) that the board of directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys Financial Advisor, would result in a transaction that would be (i) more favorable to the Company Shareholders than the Offer and the Merger from a financial point of view, and (ii) is reasonably capable of being completed on the terms proposed without unreasonable delay taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such Acquisition Proposal, 

   ##### 

  

   

including, without limitation, any antitrust or competition Law approvals
or non-objections and the likelihood of consummation and, if such Acquisition
Proposal involves any financing, the likelihood of obtaining such financing
and the terms on which such financing may be secured. 

   

 (c) Upon execution of this Agreement, the Company shall cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to an Acquisition Proposal and promptly request that all confidential information with respect thereto furnished on behalf of the Company be returned or destroyed. The Company shall not modify, amend or terminate, or waive, release or assign any material rights or claims with respect to, any confidentiality provision entered into with any third party. From and after the execution of this Agreement until the earlier of (i) the date of the termination of this Agreement, or (ii) the Effective Time, the Company shall notify Parent as promptly as practicable (but in any event within one (1) Business Day) of the receipt of, or any inquiries with respect to, an Acquisition Proposal (including, if such Acquisition Proposal is in writing, a copy of such Acquisition Proposal). Commencing upon the provision of any notice referred to above, (A) the Company shall, in person or by telephone, keep Parent reasonably informed of any material changes in such Acquisition Proposal, including material amendments or proposed amendments as to price and other material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal and (B) the Company shall, promptly upon receipt or delivery thereof, provide Parent with copies of all drafts and final versions (and any comments thereon) of agreements (including schedules and exhibits thereto) relating to any such Acquisition Proposal exchanged between the Company or any of its representatives, on the one hand, and the person making an Acquisition Proposal or any of its representatives, on the other hand. The Company shall promptly notify Parent in writing upon determination by the Companys board of directors that an Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal (such notice, a " _Superior Proposal Notice_ "). If requested by Parent, the Company shall engage in good faith negotiations with Parent during the five (5) Business Day period commencing upon the Companys delivery of the Superior Proposal Notice (the " _Negotiation Period_ ") with respect to any counterproposal Parent may make in response to such Acquisition Proposal (" _Counterproposal_ ") (it being understood and agreed that Parent is not obligated to make any Counterproposal). The Company agrees that if, during the Negotiation Period the third party making the Acquisition Proposal that is the subject of the Superior Proposal Notice modifies a material term of its Acquisition Proposal, such modification shall require a new notice and the Negotiation Period shall recommence. If, at the end of the Negotiation Period, the board of directors of the Company determines in good faith, after taking into account any Counterproposal by Parent and all amendments or revisions proposed by Parent and after consultation with the Company Financial Advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal remains a Superior Proposal, it shall promptly notify Parent in writing and may exercise its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(g). 

   

 (d) Except as otherwise provided in Section 6.02(e), neither the board of directors of the Company nor any committee of the board of directors of the Company may take, or resolve or agree to take, any of the following actions: (i) withdraw, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent the Company Recommendations (or propose publicly to do so), (ii) fail to reaffirm to Parent and the Company Shareholders the Company Recommendations within five (5) Business Days following a written request by Parent or (iii) approve or recommend, or resolve or propose publicly to, approve or recommend an Acquisition Proposal (any of the foregoing, including if effected by amendment to the Schedule 14D-9, an " _Adverse_  

   ##### 

  

   

 _Recommendation Change_ "). The furnishing of information or engaging in
discussions or negotiations by the Company in accordance with Section 6.02(b)
shall not, by themselves, constitute a Adverse Recommendation Change. 

   

 (e) Notwithstanding Section 6.02(a)(v) or 6.02(d), at any time prior to the Acceptance Date, the board of directors of the Company may make an Adverse Recommendation Change if the board of directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action is reasonably likely to result in a breach of the directors fiduciary duties to the Company Shareholders under applicable Law; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that, subject to the next sentence, prior to making an Adverse Recommendation Change other than an Adverse Recommendation Change described in Section 6.02(d)(ii), the board of directors of the Company shall give Parent five (5) Business Days written notice that it intends to take such action (" _Adverse Recommendation Change Notice_ "). In the event that an Adverse Recommendation Change is made in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall comply with Section 6.02(c), and provided that the Company has complied with Section 6.02(c), the Company shall be entitled to deliver an Adverse Recommendation Change Notice immediately following the expiration of the Negotiation Period. 

   

 (f) Nothing in this Section 6.02 shall prohibit the Company from complying with Rule 14e-2 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal if, in the good faith judgment of the board of directors of the Company, after consultation with its outside counsel, failure to do so would reasonably likely result in a breach of its obligations under applicable Laws (it being agreed that the issuance by the Company or the Companys board of directors of a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its position, as contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act shall not constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change). The Company shall provide Parent with a copy of the text of any disclosure proposed to be made in order to so comply at the earliest reasonably practicable time in advance of such disclosure. 

   

 Section 6.03 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. (a) The Company shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, afford to Parents officers, directors, employees, accountants, counsel and other agents (" _Representatives_ ") reasonable access to its properties, assets and records during the period prior to the Effective Time to obtain all information concerning its business as Parent may reasonably request. The Company shall furnish to Parent all such documents and copies of documents and records and information with respect to itself and its subsidiaries and copies of any working papers relating thereto as Parent may reasonably request. Nothing in this Section 6.03 shall require the Company to provide any access, or to disclose any information (i) if permitting such access or disclosing such information would violate applicable Law (including antitrust and privacy Laws), (ii) protected by attorney/client privilege, or (iii) which the Company or any subsidiary is required to keep confidential by reason of contract, agreement or understanding with third parties. 

  

 (b) The parties will hold any information that is nonpublic in confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance with the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement. 

    ##### 

  

     

 Section 6.04 _Approvals_. (a) Each of the Company, Parent and Purchaser shall promptly apply for, and take all reasonably necessary actions to obtain or make, as applicable, all Authorizations, Orders, declarations and filings with, and notices to, any Governmental Entity required to be obtained or made by it for the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Each party shall cooperate with and promptly furnish information to the other parties necessary in connection with any requirements imposed upon such other parties in connection with the consummation of the Offer and the Merger. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the Company and Parent shall, as promptly as practicable and before the expiration of any relevant legal deadline, but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days following the execution of this Agreement, file (i) with the United States Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and the United States Department of Justice (" _DOJ_ "), the notification and report form required for the Offer and Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby and any supplemental information requested in connection therewith pursuant to the HSR Act. and (ii) with any other Governmental Entity, any other filings, reports, information and documentation required for the Offer and Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to the merger control, antitrust and competition Laws of all jurisdictions other than those of the United States (" _Other Antitrust Laws_ "). Each of the Company and Parent shall furnish to each others counsel such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection with its preparation of any filing or submission that may be necessary under the HSR Act and any Other Antitrust Laws. 

  

 (b) Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable efforts to obtain promptly any clearance required under the HSR Act and any Other Antitrust Laws for the consummation of the Offer and the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the Company and Parent shall keep the other apprised of the status of any communications with, and any inquiries or requests for additional information from, the FTC and the DOJ and any other Governmental Entities and shall comply promptly with any such inquiry or request. Each of the Company and Parent shall instruct their respective counsel to cooperate with each other and use reasonable efforts to facilitate and expedite the identification and resolution of any issues arising under the HSR Act and the Other Antitrust Laws and the expiration of the applicable HSR Act waiting period and any waiting periods under the Other Antitrust Laws at the earliest practicable dates. Parent shall offer to take (and if such offer is accepted, commit to take) with respect to itself and the Company all commercially reasonable steps to avoid or eliminate impediments under any antitrust, competition, or trade regulation law that may be asserted by the FTC, the DOJ, any State Attorney General or any other Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger (including with respect to any of the suits, actions or proceedings described in clause 2(a) of Annex B to this Agreement) so as to enable the consummation thereof as promptly as reasonably practicable; provided, however, that Parent shall not be required to agree to or accept (i) limitations on the ability of Parent to vote the capital stock of the Company or the Surviving Corporation on any matter or (ii) any divestitures by Parent, the Company or any of their respective subsidiaries, of shares of capital stock or of any business, assets, rights or property of Parent or its Subsidiaries or of the Company or its subsidiaries or the imposition of any limitations on the ability of any of them to conduct their business or to own or exercise control of such assets, properties and stock if such divestitures or limitations would, in the good faith determination of Parent, result in any material reduction in the benefits to be obtained by Parent as a result of the Merger (any of the matters referred to in clause (i) or (ii) being a " _Substantial Detriment_ "). 

    ##### 

  

     

 (c) Each of the parties hereto further agrees to use its reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties for the consummation of the transactions, and to execute and deliver any additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement. In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement shall take all such reasonably necessary action. 

   

 Section 6.05 _Public Announcements_. The parties agree that the initial press release to be issued with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the form heretofore agreed to by the parties. Parent and the Company will consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements with respect to the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by Law, court process, or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange. The Company agrees that all formal employee communication programs or announcements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the forms mutually agreed to by the parties (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). 

  

 Section 6.06 _Indemnification; Insurance_. (a) Parent and Purchaser agree that all rights to indemnification existing in favor of, and all limitations on the personal liability of, each present and former director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or a director, officer, employee, agent or trustee of any employee benefit plan for employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, and each person who is or was then serving in any such capacity (or any person who is or was then serving any other corporation or entity in any such capacity at the request of the Company) (each such Person, together with such Persons heirs, executors or administrators, individually, an " _Indemnified Party_ " and collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") provided for in the Companys Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws or similar organizational documents of any Company subsidiary as in effect on the date of this Agreement with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to indemnification in respect of any claim for indemnification for losses, damages or liabilities of any kind or nature incurred which is asserted or made within such period shall continue until the final disposition of such claim. In addition, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation (and its successors) to indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnified Parties against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, fines and fees, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative legislative or investigative (whether internal or external) arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or a director, officer, employee, agent or trustee of any employee benefit plan for employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the same 

   ##### 

  

    

extent that such Indemnified Party was entitled to indemnification under the
Companys Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws as in effect on the date
hereof. Each Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement of expenses
incurred in the defense of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation to the same extent that such Indemnified Party was entitled to
advancement of expenses under the Companys Articles of Incorporation
and Bylaws as in effect on the date hereof and subject to the same terms and
conditions set forth therein, provided that any such Indemnified Party
provides an undertaking to promptly repay such advancement if it is
ultimately determined that the Indemnified Party is not entitled to
be indemnified. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party obligated to provide
indemnification hereunder (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") shall be obligated
under this Section 6.06 to make any payments in respect of a settlement
effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld).

Following the Closing Date, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor in accordance with their respective terms, all Company Benefit Plans. 

   

 (c) This Section 6.07 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Article VI, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 6.07.
