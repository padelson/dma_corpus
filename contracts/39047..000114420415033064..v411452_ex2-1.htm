ARTICLE 2. _CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_

  



  

2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of any of the following securities:

  



  

(a) _Conversion of Common Stock_. Subject to the adjustments set forth
in _Section 2.2_ , each share of common stock, no par value per share, of the
Company issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time
(collectively, the " _Company Common Stock_ " and, each, a " _Share_ "),
including all Restricted Shares (as defined in _Section 2.4(a)_ ), shall be
converted automatically into the right to receive $34.00 per Share in cash
(the " _Merger Consideration_ "), without interest, except for shares to be
cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_ and Dissenting Shares as
provided for in _Section 2.5_ below. All Shares that have been converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this
_Section 2.1(a)_ shall be automatically cancelled upon the conversion thereof
and shall cease to exist, and the holders of certificates that immediately
before the Effective Time represented such Shares shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such Shares other than the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this _Section 2.1(a)_ upon the surrender of such
certificates in accordance with _Section 2.3_ , without interest. Stock
Options and the rights associated therewith pursuant to this Agreement are
described in _Section 2.4_ of this Agreement.

  



  

(b) _Parent- and Merger Sub-Owned Shares_. Each Share that is owned
directly by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company (as treasury stock or
otherwise) or any of their respective direct or indirect Subsidiaries,
immediately before the Effective Time (the " _Cancelled Shares_ ") shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange for such cancellation.

  



  

(c) _Conversion of Merger Sub Membership Interests_. Each membership
interest in Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately before the
Effective Time shall be converted at the Effective Time into and become one
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, no par
value per share, of the Surviving Corporation. At the Effective Time, new
stock certificates of the Surviving Corporation shall be issued and will be
deemed for all purposes to represent all issued and outstanding shares of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which membership interests in
Merger Sub were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding
sentence.

  



  

2.2 _Changes in Capital Stock_. The Merger Consideration
shall be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any reclassification, stock
split, reverse split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution
of securities convertible into Company Common Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect to Company
Common Stock occurring (or for which a record date is established) after the
date hereof and before the Effective Time.

  



  

2.3 _Exchange of Certificates_.

  



  

(a) _Paying Agent_. At or before the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with U.S. Bank National
Association, 425 Walnut Street, Cincinnati, Ohio 45202, or, in the
alternative, an agent chosen by the Parent and acceptable to the Company, to
act as paying agent hereunder (the " _Paying Agent_ "), in trust for the
benefit of holders of the Shares, cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration in exchange for all of the Shares outstanding
immediately before the Effective Time, payable upon due surrender of the
certificates that immediately before the Effective Time represented Shares ("
_Certificates_ ") (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or
noncertificated Shares represented by book entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ")
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article 2_ (such cash being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

--- 

    



  

(b) _Payment Procedures_.

  



  

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in
any event not later than the fifth business day following the Closing Date,
the Surviving Corporation shall instruct the Paying Agent to mail to each
holder of record of Shares that were converted into the Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section 2.1_ the following: (A) a letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of Certificates (or
effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the
Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as
Parent and the Company may mutually agree) and (B) instructions for use by the
Shareholder in effecting the surrender of Certificates (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the
Merger Consideration.

  



  

(ii) Upon surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss
in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent together with such
letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be reasonably
required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificates (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to
receive from the Exchange Fund in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to
the product of (x) the number of Shares represented by such holder's properly
surrendered Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or
Book-Entry Shares and (y) the Merger Consideration. No interest will be paid
or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of Certificates (or
effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, payment upon due surrender of the
Certificate may be paid to such a transferee if the Certificate formerly
representing such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that
any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. The
Merger Consideration, paid in full with respect to any Share in accordance
with the terms hereof, shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction
of all rights pertaining to such Share. Any portion of the Merger
Consideration made available to the Paying Agent in respect of any Dissenting
Shares (as defined below) shall be dealt with in accordance with  _Section
2.5_ below.

  



  

(iii) Each of the Paying Agent, the Company, Parent, Merger Sub and
their respective Subsidiaries or agents, as applicable, shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable under this Agreement
such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold under the Code, and the
regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent
that amounts are so deducted or withheld, such deducted or withheld amounts
(A) shall be remitted by the applicable entity to the appropriate
Governmental Entity (as defined in _Section 3.5_ ) within the period required
under applicable Law and (B) shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of which such
deduction or withholding was made.

  



    

4 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(c) _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately before
the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented
to the Surviving Corporation or Parent for transfer, the holder of
Certificates shall be given a copy of the letter of transmittal referred to in
_Section 2.3(b)_ and instructed to comply with the instructions in that
letter of transmittal in order to receive the cash to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to this _Article 2_.

  



  

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains
undistributed to the former holders of Shares for 180 days after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon
demand, and any former holders of Shares who have not surrendered their
Shares in accordance with this _Section 2.3_ shall thereafter look only to
the Surviving Corporation for payment of their claim for the Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon due surrender of their
Shares.

  



  

(e) _No Liability_. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding,
none of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the
Paying Agent or any other person shall be liable to any holder or former
holder of Shares or to any other person for any amount properly delivered to
a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

  



  

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest all
cash included in the Exchange Fund as reasonably directed by Parent;
provided, however, that any investment of such cash shall be limited to
direct short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed
as to principal and interest by, the U.S. government. Any interest and other
income resulting from such investments shall be paid to the Surviving
Corporation pursuant to _Section 2.3(d)_.

  



  

(g) _Lost Certificates_. In the case of any Certificate that has been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Paying Agent or Parent, the posting by such person of a bond
in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate a check in the amount of the
number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
multiplied by the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon.

  



  

2.4 _Company Stock Plan_.

  



  

(a) Immediately before the Effective Time, each share of Company Common
Stock granted subject to time-based, performance or other vesting or
lapse restrictions pursuant to any Company Stock Plan (as defined in _Section
2.4(b)_ ) (each, a " _Restricted Share_ "), that is outstanding and subject
to such restrictions immediately before the Effective Time, shall
automatically vest and any performance conditions shall be deemed to have
been satisfied to the maximum extent possible such that the recipient shall be
entitled to 100% of the shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Restricted Share, and the Company's reacquisition right with respect to each
Restricted Share shall lapse, and the holder thereof shall, subject to this
_Article 2_ , be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration (as defined in
_Section 2.1(a)_ ) with respect to each such Restricted Share.

  



  

(b) The Company shall take such action as shall be required:

  



  

(i) to cause the vesting of any unvested options to purchase Company
Common Stock (" _Company Stock Options_ ") granted under any stock option
plans or other equity-related plans of the Company (the " _Company Stock
Plans_ ") to be accelerated in full immediately before the Effective Time;
and

  



  

(ii) to cause each outstanding Company Stock Option to represent, as
of the Effective Time, solely the right to receive, in accordance with this
_Section 2.4_ and subject to _Section 2.3(b)(iii)_ , a lump sum cash payment
in the amount of the Option Consideration, if any, with respect to such
Company Stock Option and to no longer represent the right to purchase Company
Common Stock or any other equity security of the Company, Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any other person or any other consideration.

  



    

5 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(c)  Each holder of a Company Stock Option cancelled pursuant to _Section
2.4(b)(ii)_ shall receive from Parent or the Surviving Corporation, in
respect and in consideration of each such Company Stock Option, as soon as
practicable following the Effective Time (but in any event not later than
five Business Days), an amount (net of applicable Taxes) equal to the product
of (i) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration per Share over (B)
the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Stock Option, multiplied by (ii) the total number of Shares subject to such
Company Stock Option (whether or not then vested or exercisable), without any
interest thereon (the " _Option Consideration_ "). In the event that
the exercise price of any Company Stock Option is equal to or greater than
the Merger Consideration, such Company Stock Option shall be cancelled,
without any consideration being payable in respect thereof, and shall have no
further force or effect. The Option Consideration shall constitute the Merger
Consideration for each Share that was subject to a Company Stock Option, and
the holder of such Shares shall receive no other payment or consideration,
and such Shares shall be cancelled immediately upon payment of the Option
Consideration.

  



  

(d) Following the execution of this Agreement, (i) if and as required by
the Company Stock Plans, the Company shall mail to each person who is a
holder of Company Stock Options a letter describing the treatment of and
payment for such Company Stock Options pursuant to this  _Section 2.4_ and
providing instructions for use in obtaining payment for such Company Stock
Options, and (ii) the Company shall take all actions necessary or appropriate
to terminate the Company Stock Plans as of the Effective Time (including any
necessary or appropriate action of the Company Board). Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, at all times from and after the Effective
Time maintain sufficient liquid funds to satisfy its obligations to holders of
Company Stock Options pursuant to this _Section 2.4_.

  



  

2.5 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, including _Section 2.1_ , shares of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than shares cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_ ) and held
by a holder who has not voted in favor of adoption of this Agreement or
consented thereto in writing and who has properly exercised appraisal rights
of such shares in accordance with Ohio Law (such shares of Company Common
Stock being referred to collectively as the " _Dissenting Shares_ " until
such time as such holder fails to perfect or otherwise loses such holder\'s
appraisal rights under Ohio Law with respect to such shares) shall not be
converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration, but instead shall
be entitled to only such rights as are granted by Ohio Law; provided, however,
that if, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or
loses such holder\'s right to appraisal pursuant to Ohio Law or if a court of
competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the
relief provided by Ohio Law, such shares of Company Common Stock shall be
treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.1(a)_ ,
without interest thereon, upon surrender of such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share. The Company shall provide Parent prompt written notice of any
demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company Common
Stock, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice or
instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to
Ohio Law that relates to such demand. The Company shall keep Parent
fully informed of the status of all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to such demands, and consult with Parent prior to making any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands.

2.6 _Company Executive Savings Plan_. For each share of
Company Common Stock that has been allocated to participants under the

Adverse Effect. All of the outstanding shares of capital stock and other
equity securities or interests of each Subsidiary are owned, of record and
beneficially, by the Company or another of its Subsidiaries free and clear of

circumstance exists that may (with or without notice or lapse of time)

past five years, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has been a
"distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" in a distribution

Section 481(a) of the Code, no such adjustment has been proposed by the IRS
with respect to taxable periods beginning after the Closing Date, and no

Subsidiaries or to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is obligated
to contribute or has any liability (such plans, programs, agreements,
arrangements and commitments, collectively, the " _Company Benefit Plans_ ").
Other than the Company's Subsidiaries, there are no other entities that
together with the Company would be treated as a single employer under Section
414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code (each such entity, an " _ERISA Affiliate_
").

  



    

15

(b) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan, the Company has made
available to Parent and Merger Sub true, complete and correct copies of the
following (as applicable): (i) the written document evidencing such Company
Benefit Plan (or a description, if the Company Benefit Plan is not written);
(ii) any summary plan description and summaries of material modification;
(iii) any related trust agreements, insurance contracts or documents of any
other funding arrangements; (iv) all amendments, modifications or
supplements to any such document; (v) the most recent actuarial report and
financial statements, if any are required by applicable Law; (vi) with
respect to any Company Benefit Plan intended to be "qualified" under Section
401(a) of the Code, the most recent determination letter from the IRS; (vii)
the most recent Form 5500 required to have been filed with the U.S. Department
of Labor, including all schedules thereto; and (viii) any notices to or from
the IRS or any office or representative of the U.S. Department of Labor or
any other Governmental Entity relating to any compliance issues in respect of
any such Company Benefit Plan.

  



  

(c) To the Company's knowledge, with respect to each Company Benefit
Plan, except as set forth on _Section 3.12(c)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule:

  



  

(i) each Company Benefit Plan is being and has been administered in
all material respects in accordance with ERISA, the Code and all
other applicable Laws and in all material respects in accordance with its
terms and governing documents;

  



  

(ii) no Proceeding or Order has been threatened, asserted, instituted
or, to the Company's knowledge, is anticipated against any of the Company
Benefit Plans (other than a routine Proceeding for benefits and appeals of
such Proceeding), any trustee or fiduciaries thereof, the Company (including
any Subsidiary thereof), any director, officer or employee thereof, or any of
the assets of any trust of any of the Company Benefit Plans;

  



  

(iii) all contributions, premiums and other payments required to be
made with respect to any Company Benefit Plan have been made on or
before their due dates under applicable Law and the terms of such Company
Benefit Plan;

  



  

(iv) all obligations of the Company, each Subsidiary and ERISA
Affiliate and each fiduciary under each Company Benefit Plan, whether
arising by operation of Law or by contract, required to be performed under
Section 4980B of the Code, as amended, and Sections 601 through 609 of ERISA,
or similar state Law (" _COBRA_ "), including such obligations that may arise
by virtue of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, have been or
will be timely performed in all material respects; and

  



  

(v) none of the Company Benefit Plans is under audit or investigation
by the IRS, the U.S. Department of Labor or any other Governmental Entity.

  



  

(d) Each Company Benefit Plan that is intended to be "qualified" under
Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from
the IRS to such effect and to the knowledge of the Company no condition exists
that could reasonably be expected to (i) result in the revocation of any such
letter, or (ii) otherwise adversely affect the qualified status of each such
Company Benefit Plan.

  



    

16 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(e) No Company Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA and the
minimum funding standards of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA
has failed to meet such minimum funding standards or otherwise failed to
materially comply with Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA. The
Company and its ERISA Affiliates have not incurred any material liability to
the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (other than Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation premiums, which have been paid when due) or otherwise under Title
IV of ERISA or under the Code that has not been satisfied in full and to the
Company's knowledge no condition exists that could reasonably be likely to
result in the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates incurring any material
liability under Title IV of ERISA. To the Company's knowledge, no reportable
event has occurred within the meaning of Section 4043(c) of ERISA for which
the 30-day notice requirement has not been waived.

  



  

(f) No Company Benefit Plan is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning
of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates has within the last six years (i) contributed
to or had an obligation to contribute to any multiemployer plan or (ii)
incurred any withdrawal liability from any multiemployer plan. Except as set
forth on _Section 3.12(f)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the fair
market value of the assets held under each Company Benefit Plan that
is subject to Title IV of ERISA is sufficient so as to permit a "standard
termination" of each such plan under Section 4041(b) of ERISA without the
need to make any additional contributions to such plan. With respect to each
Company Benefit Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA, the adjusted funding
target attainment percentage (within the meaning of Section 436 of the
Code) for the plan year of the plan that includes the date of this Agreement,
as certified by the plan's actuary, is not less than 80%. The sum of the (i)
excess of the present value of accrued benefits under any Company Benefit Plan
that is subject to Title IV of ERISA over the current value of assets of such
Company Benefit Plan, as of the most recent valuation date for such
Company Benefit Plan, and (ii) any amounts not contributed to a "rabbi" trust
or individual grantor trust with respect to the Company\'s Supplemental
Executive Retirement Plan, and the Company\'s Nonqualified Deferred
Compensation Plan, are described on _Section 3.12(f)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule.

  



  

(g) Except with respect to the Company Benefit Plans set forth on
_Section 3.12(g)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule and except as required
by _Sections 2.4_ and _2.6_ hereof, neither the execution or delivery of this
Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will, either alone or in conjunction with any other event, (i)
result in any payment or benefit becoming due or payable, or required to be
provided, to any current, former or retired director, executive
officer, employee, consultant, independent contractor or other service
provider of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates, (ii)
increase the amount or value of any benefit or compensation otherwise payable
or required to be provided to any such director, employee or independent
contractor, (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment, vesting
or funding of any such benefit or compensation or (iv) result in any amount
failing to be deductible by reason of Section 280G of the Code or be subject
to any excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code.

  



  

(h) The Company, any other "disqualified person" (as defined in Section
4975 of the Code), any "party-in-interest" (as defined in Section 3(14) of
ERISA) and, to the knowledge of the Company, any trustee or administrator of
any Company Benefit Plan, have not engaged in a nonexempt "prohibited
transaction," as defined in Section 4975 of the Code and Section 406 of
ERISA, in each case, that could reasonably be expected to give rise to any
material tax or penalty under Section 4975 of the Code or Sections 406,
502(i) or 502(l) of ERISA.

  



  

(i) Except as set forth on _Section 3.12(i)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule and except as required by _Sections 2.4_ and _2.6_  hereof, to the
Company's knowledge, no payment made or to be made in respect of any employee
or former employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries would reasonably
be expected to be nondeductible by reason of Section 162(m) of the Code.

  



    

17

(j) To the Company's knowledge, no Company Benefit Plan that provides
deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code (i) has failed to
either materially comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and
the applicable guidance issued thereunder in form and operation; (ii) has
been funded in a manner described in Section 409A(b) of the Code; and (iii)
provides for the gross-up of any person with respect to any failure to comply
with Section 409A of the Code.

  



  

(k) Except as disclosed in _Section 3.12(k)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries (i) provides health or
welfare benefits for any retired or former employee or (ii) is obligated to
provide health or welfare benefits to any active employees after their
retirement or other termination of service, unless required to do so under
COBRA.

hours, collective bargaining, unemployment compensation, workers'

(b) As of the date hereof no employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is covered by an effective or pending collective
bargaining agreement or similar labor agreement. As of the date hereof, to
the knowledge of the Company, there has not been any activity on behalf of
any labor organization or employee group to organize any such employees. As of
the date hereof, there is no (i) unfair labor practice Proceeding against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries pending before the National Labor Relations
Board or any other labor relations tribunal or authority and, to the
knowledge of the Company, no such Proceeding is threatened, (ii)
Proceeding pending before the National Labor Relations Board or any other
labor relations tribunal or authority or (iii) grievance or

true, complete and correct list of the following information for
each employee of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries with the title
regional director, vice president or above (collectively, the " _Key

use and operation of the assets to which they relate in the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted, (iv) any liens, claims
or judgments of a monetary nature, except as otherwise classified as Permitted
Liens hereunder, which are disclosed in the financial statements of the

the interest of a subtenant of Company or its Subsidiaries therein (" _Lessor
's Encumbrances_"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, to the
knowledge of the Company without independent investigation or inquiry, the
Company or one of its Subsidiaries has title to, or in the case of leased

(b) _Section 3.15(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
true and complete list of (i) all real property owned by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries (the " _Owned Real Property_ "), and (ii) all real
property leased by or for the benefit of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (the " _Leased Real Property_ "), identifying the current use(s)
of each such property. Except as has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect, the Company has delivered or made available to Parent copies
of (i) the deeds and other instruments related to title by which the Company
and any of its Subsidiaries acquired such real property and interests, and
copies of all title insurance policies, title exceptions, environmental
reports, engineering studies, opinions, abstracts, and surveys in the
possession of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and relating to such
property or interests, and (ii) all leases, subordination agreements, non-
disturbance agreements and leases and all amendments and modifications
thereof related to the Leased Real Property. To the Company's knowledge, and
except as other otherwise conditioned or disclosed herein and in the Company
Disclosure Schedule, each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has (i)
insurable title in fee simple to all Owned Real Property, and (ii) insurable
leasehold title to all Leased Real Property, in each case, free and clear of
all Liens, other than Permitted Liens. Except as has not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect, no parcel of Owned Real Property, or Leased
Real Property is subject to any governmental Order to be sold or is being
condemned, expropriated or otherwise taken by any Governmental Entity with or
without payment of compensation therefor, nor, to the knowledge of the
Company, has any such condemnation, expropriation or taking been proposed or
notice thereof received. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries
enjoys peaceful and undisturbed possession under all such leases. To the
knowledge of the Company, without independent investigation, all leases of
Leased Real Property and all amendments and modifications thereto are in full
force and effect, and there exists no material default under any such lease
by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any other party thereto, nor has
any event occurred that, with notice or lapse of time or both, would
constitute a material default thereunder by the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries or any other party thereto. To the Company's knowledge,
without independent investigation, no foreclosure proceedings are pending on
any Lessor's Encumbrance, and no ground lessor is in default of any Lessor's
Encumbrance or has otherwise failed to comply with, in any material respect,
any Lessor's Encumbrance, nor has any event occurred that, with notice
or lapse of time or both, would constitute a material default under any
Lessor's Encumbrance.

_Sections 3.15(a)(i)-(iv)_ , and _Section 3.15(b)_  of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, to the Company's knowledge (i) there are no contractual or legal

its Subsidiaries to use any Owned Real Property or Leased Real Property for
the current use of such real property in all material respects, (ii) all
plants, warehouses, distribution centers, structures and other buildings on

character of properties it owns, operates or leases or the nature of its

4.5 _Operations of Merger Sub_. Merger Sub was formed solely
for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, has engaged in no other business activities and has conducted its

4.6 _Available Funds; Financing Commitments_. __

  



  

(a) The proceeds to be provided by the commitments, as identified on
_Schedule 4.6(b)_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule ("
_Financing Commitments_ "), are sufficient to make the payments for the
aggregate Merger Consideration set forth in _Section 2.1(a)_. In no event
shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing by Parent, Merger
Sub or any of their Affiliates or any other financing transactions be a
condition to any of Parent's or Merger Sub's obligations under this Agreement;
provided, however, that no Financing Source has terminated its Financing
Commitment as described in _Section 6.2(d)_.

  



  

(b) _Schedule 4.6(b)_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule contains a true
and complete copy of (i) an executed commitment letter pursuant to which the
equity provider has unconditionally agreed to provide Parent and Merger Sub
with the amount of equity financing set forth in such letter (the " _Equity
Commitment Letter_ "); (ii) an executed agreement pursuant to which a third-
party has agreed to provide the balance of funds necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Financing Agreement_ ",
and together with the Equity Commitment Letter, collectively the " _Financing
Sources_ "); and (iii) letters in form and content satisfactory to the
Company dated as of the execution date of this Agreement from each of the
Financing Sources confirming the amounts and enforceability of such agreement
or letter (collectively referred to as the " _Financing_ "). The amounts
identified in the Equity Commitment Letter and in the Financing Agreement
shall represent binding commitments to fund the full amount of the Merger
Consideration set forth in _Section 2.1(a)_.

  



  

(c) None of the Financing Commitments has been amended or modified, prior
to the date hereof (except as permitted by this Agreement, or disclosed in
_Section 4.6_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedules) and the respective
obligations and commitments contained in the Financing Commitments have not
been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. The Financing Commitments are in
full force and effect. The Financing Commitments are the legal, valid and
binding obligations of Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable, and, to the
knowledge of Parent, each of the other parties thereto. The Financing
Commitments are enforceable in accordance with their respective terms against
Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable and, to the knowledge of Parent, each of
the other parties thereto. There are no conditions precedent or other
contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing,
other than as set forth in the Financing Commitments.

  



  

(d) No event has occurred or circumstance exists which, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably be expected to
constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or Merger Sub, as
applicable, or to the knowledge of Parent, any other parties thereto, under
the Financing Commitments.

  



  

(e) Parent has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the
Financing contemplated in the Financing Commitments will not be satisfied or
that the Financing will not be made available to Parent and Merger Sub at or
prior to the Effective Time. To the reasonable belief of Parent, the terms of
the Financing Agreement, are such that the "Seller" (as defined in the
Financing Agreement) will more likely than not be considered the "person
acquiring the property" within the meaning of Section 453(f)(3) of the Code.

  



    

29 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(f) There are no side letters or other agreements, contracts or
arrangements related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the
full amount of the Financing other than as expressly set forth in the
Financing Commitments. Parent and Merger Sub have fully paid, or caused to be
fully paid, any and all commitment or other fees which are due and payable on
or prior to the date hereof pursuant to the terms of the Financing
Commitments.

  



  

4.7 _Agreements with Company Shareholders, Directors,
Officers and Employees_. Except for those certain Voting Agreements identified
on _Section 3.2(d)_ , none of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates is a party to any contract or agreement, or has made or entered

Company's Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, constitutes a Superior Proposal
(as defined below in subparagraph (f)(iii)) or would reasonably be expected to

financial advisors, and authorized agents may, if reasonably necessary to
comply with its fiduciary duties:

Superior Proposal, and furnish Parent with a copy of any written Acquisition
Proposal. The Company shall keep Parent fully informed of the status and
material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal including any material
amendments or proposed amendments as to price and other material terms
thereof. The Company shall provide Parent with at least forty-eight (48) hours
prior notice of any meeting of the Company Board (or such lesser notice as is
provided to the members of the Company Board) at which the Company Board is
reasonably expected to consider any Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall
promptly provide Parent with a list of any non-public information
concerning the Company\'s business, present or future performance, financial

such information.

(iii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal from an unaffiliated third party (other than the Parent) which the
Company Board determines in good faith, after receiving the advice of its
outside legal and financial advisors, that (a) the terms and conditions of

financial point of view than the transactions contemplated herein (after
taking into account the expected timing and risk and likelihood of
consummation and including taking into account any adjustment to the terms
and conditions proposed by the Parent in response to such proposal) and (b)
that the transaction contemplated by such proposal is reasonably likely to be
consummated in accordance with its terms; provided, that for purposes of the

each other apprised on a current basis of the status of matters relating to
the completion of the transactions contemplated thereby, including promptly
furnishing the other with copies of notices or other material communications
received by Parent and the Company, as the case may be, or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, from any third party and/or any

Law relating to the exchange of information, Parent and the Company shall

advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other Party in connection
with, any proposed notifications or filings and any written communications or
submissions, and with respect to any such notification, filing, written

respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be a
release by the Company; provided, however, that Parent has the opportunity to

reasonable best efforts to consult with the other Parties before issuing any
other press release or otherwise making any public statement with respect to
the Merger or this Agreement (including if such public statement is required
by applicable Law or New York Stock Exchange rules). The restrictions set
forth in this _Section 5.9_ shall not apply to any communication made by the
Company regarding an Acquisition Proposal or the withholding, withdrawal or
modification of the approval or Company Board Recommendation with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

5.10 _Employees; Benefit Plans_.

  



  

(a) For a period of 180 days after the Closing Date, Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries
or Affiliates to, continue to employ all of the Company's corporate and
commissary employees working at 2800 Gilbert Avenue and 3011 Stanton Avenue
in Cincinnati, Ohio at the Effective Time (each, a " _Covered Employee_ "); 
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Agreement shall prevent Parent,
the Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates, from terminating any employee of the Company, including Covered
Employees, for Cause. For the purposes of this _Section 5.10_ , "Cause" means
(i) commission of a felony or any other act or omission involving dishonesty,

material and/or repeated unexcused absence or failure to perform assigned
duties commensurate with such Covered Employee\'s position, (viii) use of
illegal drugs, refusal to submit to a drug test, attempting to modify the
results of a drug test, or failure to pass a drug test, or (ix) any other
behavior which causes harm or prejudice to the business, reputation or

respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates.

(b) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to, provide to each
Covered Employee, while employed by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates after the Closing Date, (i)
for a period of 180 days following the Closing Date, no less than the same
base salary or hourly wage rate, and no less than the same short-term (annual
or more frequent) bonus or commission opportunity, provided to such Covered
Employee immediately before the Effective Time, and (ii) for a period
beginning as of the Effective Time and continuing at least until the end of
the "plan year" for each respective Company Benefit Plan (the " _Benefits
Continuation Period_ "), other compensation and employee benefits (excluding
equity and equity-based awards and any benefits under a defined benefit
pension plan) for all Covered Employees, substantially comparable in the
aggregate as those provided to such Covered Employees in the aggregate
under the Company Benefit Plans in effect immediately before the Effective
Time, it being understood that Parent may elect to (i) provide each Covered
Employee with such substantially comparable benefits through coverage under
employee benefits plans, programs and arrangements of Parent or its
Affiliates or Subsidiaries, (ii) cause the Surviving Corporation to provide
each Covered Employee with such substantially comparable benefits through
continued coverage under Company Benefit Plans or (iii) provide each
Covered Employee with such substantially comparable benefits through a
combination of coverage under the employee benefits plans, programs and
arrangements of Parent or its Affiliates or Subsidiaries and continued
coverage under the Company Benefit Plans.

  



  

(c) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of
their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates to, honor all Company Benefit
Plans (including for the avoidance of doubt all severance, change-in-control
and similar plans and agreements) in accordance with their terms as in effect
immediately before the Effective Time, subject to any amendment or termination
thereof that may be permitted by the terms of such Company Benefit Plans;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall prevent the amendment or
termination of any specific Company Benefit Plan or other plan, program,
policy, agreement or arrangement, or interfere with Parent's, the Surviving
Corporation's or any of their respective Subsidiaries' or Affiliates' rights
or obligations to make such amendments or modifications as are necessary to
comply with, or that are permitted under applicable Law.

  



  

(d) For all purposes under (i) all employee benefit plans of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries and
Affiliates providing benefits to any Covered Employee after the Effective
Time, other than the Company Benefit Plans (the " _New Plans_ "), each
Covered Employee shall receive full credit for all purposes (including
eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual but not for benefit accrual purposes
under any New Plan that is a defined benefit plan) for such Covered Employee's
years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries before the Effective
Time (including predecessor or acquired entities or any other entities for
which the Company and its Subsidiaries have given credit for prior service) to
the same extent as such Covered Employee was entitled, before the Effective
Time, to credit for such service under any similar or comparable Company
Benefit Plan, or with respect to any New Plan for which there is no similar
or comparable Company Benefit Plan, but only to the same extent as such
service would be recognized if it had been performed as an employee of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries
and Affiliates (in each case except to the extent such credit would result in
a duplication of benefits) and (ii) the Company Benefit Plans, each Covered
Employee\'s service before the Effective Time with the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall continue to be recognized for all purposes (including
eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual) in accordance with the terms of each
such Company Benefit Plan (in each case except to the extent such credit
would result in a duplication of benefits). In addition, where
applicable, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) at the
Effective Time, each Covered Employee immediately shall be eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in each New Plan applicable to the
Covered Employees as of the Effective Time to the extent the Covered
Employee\'s service with the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time is sufficient to satisfy the waiting period requirements, if
any, under such New Plan; (ii) Parent shall make commercially reasonable best
efforts to cause all pre-existing condition exclusions or limitations and
actively-at-work requirements of each New Plan applicable to the
Covered Employees at the Effective Time to be waived or satisfied for such
Covered Employee and his or her covered dependents to the extent waived or
satisfied under a similar or comparable Company Benefit Plan as of the
Effective Time; (iii) Parent shall make commercially reasonable best efforts
to cause all eligible expenses incurred by each Covered Employee and his or
her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Company
Benefit Plan ending on the date such Covered Employee's participation in
the New Plan begins (if such date is within Benefits Continuation Period) to
be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such Covered Employees and his or her covered dependents for the applicable
plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan;
and (iv) in all cases, all amounts contributed as of the Closing Date by any
Covered Employee to any Company Benefit Plan that is a Code Section 125
cafeteria plan or health savings account arrangement shall remain credited to
such Covered Employee's account under the applicable plan or arrangement
following the Closing Date, subject to the terms and conditions of the
applicable plan or arrangement.

(e) With respect to any accrued but unused vacation or paid time off to
which any Covered Employee is entitled pursuant to the vacation or paid time
off policy applicable to such Covered Employee immediately before the
Effective Time (the " _Vacation Policy_ "), Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates
to, (i) allow such Covered Employee to use such accrued vacation or paid time
off (subject to the terms of the applicable vacation plan or
policy, including any maximums that may prohibit the Covered Employee from
accruing any new vacation or paid time off until such prior time is used) and
(ii) if any Covered Employee's employment terminates during the Benefits
Continuation Period under circumstances entitling the Covered Employee to
severance pay under the Company Severance Plan, pay the Covered Employee, in
cash, an amount equal to the value of the accrued vacation or paid time off.

  



  

(f) Prior to the Closing but only after receipt of the Requisite
Shareholder Approval and the satisfaction of the condition to closing
set forth in _Section 6.1(c)_ (but earlier upon mutual agreement of the
Parties), the Company shall cooperate with Parent's reasonable requests to
(i) arrange and conduct for employees of the Company, an open enrollment
period for any New Plans and employee orientation sessions (with such
sessions to be held at times reasonably agreed to by Parent and the Company),
and (ii) meet with employees of the Company (either individually or in
groups) during breaks, outside of scheduled work hours or as otherwise
agreed to by Parent and the Company.

  



  

(g) Except as set forth in this _Section 5.10_ , nothing in this
Agreement shall confer upon any current or former employee of the
Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, any rights (including for sake of clarity, any
third party beneficiary rights) or remedies including any right to employment
or continued employment for any specified period, of any nature or kind
whatsoever. No provision of this _Section 5.10_ is intended to modify, amend
or create any employee benefit plan of the Company, Parent, Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates.

(h) With respect to awards of options or Restricted Shares that the
Company would have granted on or after the date of this Agreement, in the
ordinary course of business in the absence of the restrictions contained in
_Section 5.1(b)_ of this Agreement, the Compensation Committee of the Company
Board shall make in the ordinary course the determinations of time-vesting
awards and the performance-vesting awards it would grant to employees of the
Company for fiscal year 2015 and shall prorate such awards if necessary from
the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time if the Effective Time occurs
before the end of fiscal year 2016 (each such award, a " _Company Contingent
Award_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, such Company Contingent Awards (A)
may not exceed 10,000 shares of Company Common Stock in the aggregate, or the
equivalent cash amount, and (B) must be distributed among the different levels
of employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries approximately in the same
proportions as awards of options or of Restricted Shares have been
distributed among the different levels of employees of the Company in the last
three fiscal years.

  



  

5.11 _Indemnification; Directors ' and Officers' Insurance_.

  



  

(a) The Parties shall cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to
defend against and respond to any threatened or actual Proceeding, including
any such Proceeding in which any individual who is now, or has been at any
time before the date of this Agreement, or who becomes before the Effective
Time, a director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or who is or was serving at the request of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries as a director, officer or employee of another person (the "
_Indemnified Parties_ "), is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in
whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to
(i) the fact that he is or was a director, officer or employee of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries before the Effective Time, or (ii) this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether asserted or
arising before or after the Effective Time; provided, however, that nothing
in this provision will be construed to grant any person any right of
indemnification other than as provided by the Company Articles, Company
Regulations or applicable Law. All rights to indemnification, including
advancement of expenses, and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or before the Effective Time now existing in favor of
any Indemnified Party as provided in any applicable Articles of Incorporation
or Regulations (or comparable organizational documents), and any existing
indemnification agreements set forth on _Section 5.11(a)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in
full force and effect in accordance with their terms, and shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified after the Effective Time in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of such individuals for
acts or omissions occurring at or before the Effective Time, it being
understood that nothing in this sentence shall require any amendment to the
Articles of Incorporation or Regulations of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

(b) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, the Parent, the Merger Sub, and the Surviving
Corporation shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and provide advancement
of reasonable expenses to, each Indemnified Party against all Proceedings,
losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses, liabilities or judgments or amounts
that are paid in settlement of or in connection with any Proceeding based in
whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such
person is or was a director, officer or employee of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company, and pertaining to any matter existing or
occurring, or any acts or omissions occurring, at or before the Effective
Time, whether asserted or claimed before, or at or after, the Effective Time
(including matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with the
approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby); provided, however, that nothing in this provision will
be construed to grant any person any right of indemnification for any act or
omission not made in good faith and in the best interest of the shareholders
of the Company and its Subsidiaries or as provided under the applicable
Articles of Incorporation and Regulations in effect during the acts or events
under which the claim for indemnification has arisen.

(c) Parent and Merger Sub shall cause Surviving Corporation to cause the
individuals serving as officers and directors of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries immediately before the Effective Time to be covered for a period
of six (6) years from the Effective Time by the directors' and officers'
liability insurance policies maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries (
_provided_ , that Parent may substitute therefor policies of at least the
same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are not less
advantageous to such officers and directors than such policy) with respect to
acts or omissions occurring before the Effective Time that were committed by
such officers and directors in their capacity as such; _provided_ , that in no
event shall Parent be required to expend annually in the aggregate an amount
in excess of 200% of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company or its
Subsidiaries for such insurance (the " _Insurance Amount_ "). At the Company's
option, the Company may purchase before the Effective Time, a six-year
prepaid "tail policy" on terms and conditions providing
substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of directors' and
officers' liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries
with respect to matters existing or occurring at or before the Effective Time,
covering without limitation the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_
, that the annual premium therefor would not be in excess of 200% of the
last annual premium paid before the Effective Time. If such prepaid "tail
policy" has been obtained by the Company before the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its
full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the
Surviving Corporation.

  



  

(d) Parent and Merger Sub shall cause Surviving Corporation to pay all
expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, that may be incurred by the
persons referred to in this _Section 5.11_ in connection with their
enforcement of their rights provided in this _Section 5.11_.

  



  

(e) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses for acts or omissions
occurring at or before the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed
before, at or after the Effective Time, now existing in favor of the current
or former directors, officers or employees, as the case may be, of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries as provided in their respective Articles of
Incorporation or Regulations or other organization documents or in any
agreement shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and
effect. The provisions of this _Section 5.11_ are intended to be in addition
to the rights otherwise available to the current officers and directors of
the Company by Law, charter, statute, regulation or agreement, and shall
operate for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the
Indemnified Parties, their heirs and their Representatives. The obligations
set forth in this _Section 5.11_ shall not be terminated, amended or otherwise
modified in any manner that adversely affects any Indemnified Party, or any
person who is a beneficiary under the policies referred to in this _Section
5.11_  and their heirs and Representatives, without the prior written consent
of such affected Indemnified Party or other person.

  



  

(f) If the Surviving Corporation or Parent or any of their successors or
assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any person, then, and in each such case, the Surviving Corporation
or Parent, as the case may be, shall make or cause to be made, proper
provisions so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations of the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be set forth in this
_Section 5.11_.

  



  

(g) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or
shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and
officers' insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence
with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their
respective directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and
agreed that the indemnification provided for in this _Section 5.11_ is not
before or in substitution for any such claims under such policies.

  



    

45 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(h) The provisions of this _Section 5.11_ shall survive the Effective
Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and Representatives.

  



  

5.12 _Notice of Certain Events_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company shall promptly advise the other of: (a) any change or event
having or reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or
Parent Material Adverse Effect on it, as the case may be, (b) any change or
event that it believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or
constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or
covenants contained in this Agreement, (c) any notice or other communication
from any person alleging that consent of such person is or may be required,
or from any Governmental Entity, in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; and (d) any material legal actions commenced,
or to such party's knowledge, threatened; _provided_ , however, that,
notwithstanding the above, the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
_Section 5.12_ will not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available
hereunder to the Party receiving such notice or the conditions to such Party's
obligation to consummate the Merger.

  



  

5.13 _Stock Exchange Delisting; Exchange Act Deregistration_.
Before the Effective Time, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and
use its commercially reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary,
proper or advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules and policies
of the New York Stock Exchange and SEC to enable the delisting by the
Surviving Corporation of the Common Stock from the New York Stock Exchange and
the deregistration of the Common Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time, and in any event no more than
fifteen (15) trading days after the Closing Date.

  



  

5.14 _Control of Operations_. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall give Parent or Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, the right

current or future heirs, executors, administrators, trustees, successors or
assigns of any of the foregoing (collectively, " _Company Related Parties_ "),
(ii) no Company Related Party shall have any other liability or obligation
for any or all losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Merger Sub or
any other Parent Related Parties in connection with this Agreement (and the
termination hereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and

other Parent Related Party shall be entitled to bring or maintain any other
Proceeding against the Company, any of its Affiliates or any other Company
Related Party arising out of such termination, any of the transactions

termination. The Parties acknowledge and agree that in no event shall the

occasion, whether or not the Company Termination Fee may be payable under more
than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at different times and
the occurrence of different events.

  



  

(d) The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this
_Section 7.3_ and in _Section 8.10_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the

Parent, as the case may be, fails to timely pay any amount due under this
_Section 7.3_ , and, in order to obtain the payment, the Company or Parent,
as the case may be, commences a suit that results in a judgment against the
other Party for the payment set forth in this _Section 7.3_ , such paying
Party shall pay the other party or Parties, as applicable, its reasonable and
documented costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys'
fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on such amount at
the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date
such payment was required to be made through the date such payment was
actually received.

with the Merger by the shareholders of the Company; provided, however, that
after any approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the
shareholders of the Company, there may not be, without further approval of
such shareholders, any amendment of this Agreement (other than as contemplated

of Company Common Stock, if such alteration or change would adversely affect
the holders of any security of the Company, (b) alters or changes any term of
the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, if such alteration
or change would adversely affect the holders of any security of the Company,

waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions

extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument
signed on behalf of such Party, but such extension or waiver or failure to
insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or
condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any
subsequent or other failure.

documents and certificates expressly required by this Agreement to be
delivered to another Party on the date hereof or at or before the Closing
(collectively, the " _Transaction Documents_ ") and the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Documents, including all Proceedings arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the other Transaction
Documents as well as the interpretation, construction, performance and
enforcement of this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents.

  



  

(b) The Parties agree that any suit, action or proceeding brought by any
Party to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or
in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be brought exclusively in any federal or state court located in
Cincinnati, Ohio. Each of the Parties submits to this exclusive jurisdiction
of such courts in any suit, action or Proceeding seeking to enforce any
provision of, or based on any matter arising out of, or in connection with,
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and hereby irrevocably
waives the benefit of jurisdiction derived from present or future domicile or
otherwise in such action of Proceeding. Each Party irrevocably waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection that it may now or hereafter
have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or Proceeding in any
such court or that any such suit, action or Proceeding brought in any such
court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each Party agrees that any
such suit, action or Proceeding will constitute a complex business case, and,
if a Party initiates such a suit, action or proceeding in Ohio state court,
it must be brought in the Ohio Business Courts as a business case.

  



  

8.8 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND
AGREES THAT ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND
THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY
RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUCH ACTION OR
PROCEEDING, INCLUDING ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
ANY FINANCING IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT: (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE
OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE
THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS
OF THIS WAIVER; (C) IT MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY; AND (D) IT HAS BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 8.8_.

  



  

8.9 _Assignment; Third-Party Beneficiaries_.

  



  

(a) Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement may be assigned by any of the Parties
(whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent
of the other Parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by all of the
Parties and their respective successors and assigns.

(b) Except (i) from and after the Effective Time, for the rights of
holders of equity securities issued by the Company to receive the
consideration set forth in _Article 2_ (with respect to which such holders
shall be third-party beneficiaries) and (ii) as provided in _Section 5.11_
(with respect to which the Indemnified Parties shall be third-party
beneficiaries), this Agreement is not intended, and shall not be deemed, to
confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, to create any agreement of
employment with any person or to otherwise create any third-party beneficiary
hereto. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product
of negotiations among the Parties and are for the sole benefit of the
Parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject
to waiver by the Parties in accordance with  _Section 7.5_ without notice or
liability to any other person. In some instances, the representations and
warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the Parties of
risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any
of the Parties. Consequently, persons other than the Parties may not rely upon
the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

  



  

(c) No provision in this Agreement modifies or amends or creates any
Employee Benefit Plan unless this Agreement explicitly states that the
provision "amends" or "creates" that Employee Benefit Plan, and no third party
shall be entitled to enforce any provision of this Agreement on the grounds
that it is an amendment to, or a creation of, an Employee Benefit
Plan, unless that provision explicitly states that such enforcement rights
are being conferred. This provision shall not prevent the Parties to this
Agreement from enforcing any provision of this Agreement. If a person not
entitled to enforce this Agreement brings a lawsuit or other action to
enforce any provision in this Agreement as an amendment to, or creation of an
Employee Benefit Plan, and that provision is construed to be such an
amendment or creation despite not being explicitly designated as one in this
Agreement, that provision shall lapse retroactively, thereby precluding it
from having any effect.

  



  

8.10 _Enforcement_.

  



  

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein
expressly conferred upon a person will be deemed cumulative with, and not
exclusive of, any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such
person, and the exercise by a person of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy.

  



  

(b) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed
that the Parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, in each case without posting a bond or
undertaking, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. Each of the Parties agrees that it will not
oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief on the basis that (i) the Party seeking such remedy has an
adequate remedy at law or (ii) an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. For the avoidance of
doubt, each Party may pursue at its sole discretion both a grant of specific
performance and monetary damages to which it may be lawfully entitled.

8.11 _Disclosure Schedules_. The Company Disclosure Schedules
and the Parent Disclosure Schedules shall each be arranged in Sections
corresponding to the numbered Sections contained in this Agreement. The
disclosure in any such Section, whether related to representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements, shall qualify the corresponding Section
of this Agreement. The disclosure in any Section of this Agreement in
_Article 3_ or _Article 4_ shall qualify each other Section in _Article 3_ or
_Article 4_ to the extent that it is reasonably apparent that such
information is relevant in such other Sections. The inclusion of any
information in the Company Disclosure Schedules or the Parent Disclosure
Schedules, or in any update thereto, shall not be deemed to be an
admission or acknowledgment, in and of itself, that such information is
required by the terms hereof to be disclosed, is material, has resulted in or
would result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse
Effect, or is outside the ordinary course of business.
