AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

   

 THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of October 31, 2006 (" _Agreement_ "), by and among BANCORPSOUTH, INC., a Mississippi corporation ("BancorpSouth"), and CITY BANCORP, a Missouri corporation (" _City Bancorp_ "). 

  

RECITALS: 

   

 WHEREAS, BancorpSouth is the parent corporation of BancorpSouth Bank, a Mississippi banking corporation (" _BancorpSouth Bank_ "); 

  

 WHEREAS, City Bancorp is the sole shareholder of The Signature Bank, a Missouri banking corporation (" _The Signature Bank_ "); 

  

 WHEREAS, BancorpSouth and City Bancorp have determined that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and their shareholders to consummate the business combination transactions provided for herein in which City Bancorp will merge with and into BancorpSouth (the " _Merger_ "), subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein; 

  

 WHEREAS, the parties intend that the Merger shall qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder; and 

  

 WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain conditions to the Merger. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I. THE MERGER 

  

1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in
accordance with the Mississippi Business Corporation Act (the " _MBCA_ ") and
the General and Business Corporation Law of Missouri (the " _GBCLM_ "), at
the Effective Time (as defined in _Section 1.2_ ), City Bancorp shall merge
with and into BancorpSouth. BancorpSouth shall be the surviving corporation
(hereinafter sometimes called the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") in the Merger,
and shall continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State of
Mississippi. The name of the Surviving Corporation shall continue to be "
_BancorpSouth, Inc._ " Upon consummation of the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of City Bancorp shall terminate. 

  

1.2 _Effective Time_. 

   

 (a) The Merger shall become effective as set forth in the articles of merger (the " _Articles of Merger_ ") which shall be filed on the Closing Date (as defined in _Section 10.1_ ) with the Secretary of State of the State of Mississippi (the " _Mississippi Secretary_ ") and the Secretary of State of the State of Missouri (the " _Missouri Secretary_ "). 

  

 (b) The term " _Effective Time_ " shall be the date and time when the Merger becomes effective, as set forth in the Articles of Merger. 

   ##### 

  

 

1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall
have the effects set forth in Section 79-4-11.06 of the MBCA and Section
351.458 of the GBCLM. 

  

1.4 _Conversion of City Bancorp Common Stock_. 

   

 (a) At the Effective Time, each share of the common stock, $.067 par value per share, of City Bancorp (the " _City Bancorp Common Stock"_ ) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than City Bancorp Dissenting Shares (as defined below) and shares of City Bancorp Common Stock held directly or indirectly by BancorpSouth or City Bancorp or any of their respective Subsidiaries as defined in _Section 3.2(c)_ hereof (as adjusted below), other than Trust Account Shares and DPC shares, as such terms are defined in this Section below) shall be converted, at the election of the holder thereof, into the right to receive the following, without interest: 

  

 (i) for each share of City Bancorp Common Stock with respect to which an election to receive cash has been made (a " _Cash Election_ "), the right to receive in cash an amount equal to $34.08 (the " _Cash Consideration_ " and, collectively, the " _Cash Election Shares_ "); 

  

 (ii) for each share of City Bancorp Common Stock with respect to which an election to receive common stock, par value $2.50 per share, of BancorpSouth (the " _BancorpSouth Common Stock_ "), together with the number of BancorpSouth Rights (as defined in _Section 5.2_ hereof) associated therewith, has been made (a " _Stock Election_ "), the right to receive from BancorpSouth the number of shares of BancorpSouth Common Stock as is equal to the Exchange Ratio (as defined below) (the " _Stock Consideration_ " and, collectively, the " _Stock Election Shares_ "); 

  

 (iii) holders of more than one share of City Bancorp Common Stock may elect a combination of both cash and shares of BancorpSouth Common Stock (with such election referred to as a " _Mixed Election_ "). For purposes of this Agreement, Cash Consideration, Stock Consideration and any combination thereof shall be collectively referred to herein as " _Merger Consideration_ "; and 

  

 (iv) for each share of City Bancorp Common Stock other than City Bancorp Dissenting Shares (as defined below) and shares as to which a Cash Election or a Stock Election has been effectively made (collectively, " _Non-Election Shares_ "), the right to receive from BancorpSouth such Stock Consideration and/or Cash Consideration as is determined in accordance with _Section 1.4(d)_. 

 

At the Effective Time, cash in the amount of $1,500,000 multiplied by the Non-
Dissenting Percentage and that number of shares of BancorpSouth Common Stock
equal to 44,014.08 multiplied by the Exchange Ratio multiplied by the Non-
Dissenting Percentage (collectively, such cash and shares being the " _Escrow
Fund_ ") will be deposited in escrow with Enterprise Bank and Trust
Company (the " _Escrow Agent_ "), pursuant to the terms of an Escrow
Agreement related to certain litigation outstanding on the date hereof and
any additional litigation related thereto (including without limitation any
amendments, extensions, additional claims or other additional filings,
in whatever forum, arising out of the same or related facts or
circumstances), in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit 1.4_
(the " _Escrow Agreement_ "). For purposes of this Section, " _Non-Dissenting
Percentage_ " shall equal the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the number of
shares of City Bancorp Common Stock with respect to which dissenters rights
have not been exercised on or before the date of the City Bancorp
Shareholders Meeting (as defined below) by (ii) the number of shares of City
Bancorp Common Stock issued and outstanding as of such date. Such funds will
be held in escrow pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement. The
Stock Consideration placed into escrow will be legally issued, outstanding
and reflected on the books of BancorpSouth as issued and outstanding.
Dividends payable on such shares of BancorpSouth Common Stock while such
shares are held in escrow will be paid to the Escrow Agent for distribution
to the appropriate former holders of City Bancorp Common Stock, and such
persons, either individually or through the Co-Representatives appointed
pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement,   ##### 

  

  

  

to the extent the Co-Representatives have been granted such authority by such
persons, shall have the voting rights associated with their respective
portion of such BancorpSouth Common Stock while such shares are held in
escrow. 

   

 (b) For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the following meanings: 

  

 (i) " _Aggregate BancorpSouth Share Amount_ " shall be a number of shares of BancorpSouth Common Stock equal to the number of shares of City Bancorp Common Stock outstanding at the time of determination (after cancellation of shares of City Bancorp Common Stock held directly or indirectly by BancorpSouth or City Bancorp or any of their respective Subsidiaries, other than Trust Account Shares and DPC Shares (as defined below) and excluding City Bancorp Dissenting Shares (as defined below)) multiplied by the Exchange Ratio multiplied by 0.50. 

  

 (ii) " _Exchange Ratio_ " shall be equal (rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth) to (x) 1.4908 if the Average BancorpSouth Common Stock Price is less than or equal to $22.86 (the " _Lower Price_ "), (y) 1.2198 if the Average BancorpSouth Common Stock Price is greater than or equal to $27.94 (the " _Higher Price_ "), or (z) if the Average BancorpSouth Common Stock Price is between the Lower Price and the Higher Price, the result obtained by dividing $34.08 by the Average BancorpSouth Common Stock Price. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) if the Average BancorpSouth Common Stock Price is less than $20.57 (the " _City Bancorp Termination Price_ "), City Bancorp shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(g)_ hereof (subject to BancorpSouths right to adjust the Exchange Ratio as described in such Section); and (ii) if the Average BancorpSouth Common Stock Price is greater than $30.73, the Exchange Ratio shall be decreased to that number which would cause the dollar value of the Stock Consideration valued using the Average BancorpSouth Common Stock Price to be equal to that which would have been payable had the Average BancorpSouth Common Stock Price been equal to $30.73. The " _Average BancorpSouth Common Stock Price_ " means the average of the closing price per share of BancorpSouth Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ ") at the end of the regular session as reported on the Consolidated Tape, Network A, for the ten consecutive trading days ending on the date on which the last consent of the applicable federal and state regulatory authorities shall be received (the " _Determination Date_ "). 

  

 (c) Fifty percent (50%) of the City Bancorp Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than City Bancorp Dissenting Shares (as defined below) and shares of City Bancorp Common Stock held directly or indirectly by BancorpSouth or City Bancorp or any of their respective Subsidiaries as defined in _Section 3.2(c)_ hereof (as adjusted below), other than Trust Account Shares and DPC Shares), shall be exchanged for BancorpSouth Common Stock. Therefore, the total number of shares of City Bancorp Common Stock to be converted into Stock Consideration (the " _Stock Conversion Number_ ") shall be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the Aggregate BancorpSouth Share Amount by (y) the Exchange Ratio. All of the other shares of City Bancorp Common Stock shall be Cash Election Shares and shall therefore be converted into Cash Consideration (in each case, excluding shares of City Bancorp Common Stock to be cancelled pursuant to Subsection (e) below). 

  

 (d) As promptly as possible after the Election Deadline (as defined below), BancorpSouth shall cause the Exchange Agent (as defined in _Section 2.1_) to effect the allocation among holders of City Bancorp Common Stock of rights to receive the Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration as follows: 

  

 (i) If the aggregate number of shares of City Bancorp Common Stock with respect to which Stock Elections shall have been made (the " _Stock Election Number_ ") exceeds the Stock Conversion Number, then all Cash Election Shares and all Non-Election Shares of each holder 

   ##### 

  

 

thereof shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration,
and Stock Election Shares of each holder thereof will be converted into the
right to receive the Stock Consideration in respect of that number of Stock
Election Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number
of Stock Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator
of which is the Stock Conversion Number and the denominator of which is the
Stock Election Number, with the remaining number of such holders Stock
Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the
Cash Consideration; and 

   

 (ii) If the Stock Election Number is less than the Stock Conversion Number (the amount by which the Stock Conversion Number exceeds the Stock Election Number being referred to herein as the " _Shortfall Number_ "), then all Stock Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration and the Non-Election Shares and Cash Election Shares shall be treated in the following manner: 

   

(A) If the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the number of Non-
Election Shares, then all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the
right to receive the Cash Consideration and the Non-Election Shares of each
holder thereof shall convert into the right to receive the Stock
Consideration in respect of that number of Non-Election Shares equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Non-Election Shares
held by such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the
Shortfall Number and the denominator of which is the total number of Non-
Election Shares, with the remaining number of such holders Non-Election
Shares being converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration; or 

   

(B) If the Shortfall Number exceeds the number of Non-Election Shares, then
all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the
Stock Consideration and Cash Election Shares of each holder thereof shall
convert into the right to receive the Stock Consideration in respect of that
number of Cash Election Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(x) the number of Cash Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a fraction,
the numerator of which is the amount by which (1) the Shortfall Number exceeds
(2) the total number of Non-Election Shares and the denominator of which is
the total number of Cash Election Shares, with the remaining number of such
holders Cash Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the
Cash Consideration. 

  

 (e) At the Effective Time, all shares of City Bancorp Common Stock that are owned directly or indirectly by BancorpSouth or City Bancorp or any of their respective Subsidiaries, other than shares of City Bancorp Common Stock (i) held directly or indirectly in trust accounts, managed accounts and the like or otherwise held in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of third parties (any such shares, and shares of BancorpSouth Common Stock which are similarly held, whether held directly or indirectly by BancorpSouth or City Bancorp, as the case may be, being referred to herein as " _Trust Account Shares_ ") and (ii) held by BancorpSouth or City Bancorp or any of their respective Subsidiaries in respect of a debt previously contracted (any such shares of City Bancorp Common Stock, and shares of BancorpSouth Common Stock which are similarly held, whether held directly or indirectly by BancorpSouth or City Bancorp, being referred to herein as " _DPC Shares_ "), shall be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no Merger Consideration or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. All shares of BancorpSouth Common Stock that are owned by City Bancorp or any of its Subsidiaries (other than Trust Account Shares and DPC Shares) shall become authorized but unissued shares of BancorpSouth. 

  

 (f) Each share of City Bancorp Common Stock converted into Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article I_ shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each certificate (each a " _Certificate_ ") previously representing any such shares of City Bancorp Common Stock shall thereafter only represent the right to receive (i) the number of whole shares of BancorpSouth Common Stock into which such share is convertible pursuant to _Section 1.4(a)_ and (ii) the cash in lieu of fractional shares into which the shares of City Bancorp Common Stock represented by such Certificate have been converted pursuant to _Section 1.4(a)_ and  _Section 2.2(f)_ hereof and (iii) Cash 

   ##### 

  

 

Consideration pursuant to _Section 1.4(a)_ hereof. Certificates previously
representing shares of City Bancorp Common Stock shall be exchanged for
certificates representing whole shares of BancorpSouth Common Stock and cash
in lieu of fractional shares issued in consideration therefor and Cash
Consideration upon the surrender of such Certificates in accordance with
_Section 2.2_ hereof, without any interest thereon. If, between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time, the shares of BancorpSouth Common
Stock shall be changed into a different number or class of shares by reason
of any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of
shares or readjustment, or a stock dividend thereon shall be declared with a
record date within said period (any such event, an " _Anti-Dilution Event_
"), the Exchange Ratio and the Merger Consideration shall be adjusted to
result in the same aggregate consideration being delivered to City Bancorps
shareholders as would have been received had such Anti-Dilution Event not
occurred. 

   

 (g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of City Bancorp Common Stock which are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and with respect to which dissenters rights shall have been properly demanded in accordance with Section 351.455 of the GBCLM (the " _City Bancorp Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive, or be exchangeable for, Merger Consideration or cash in lieu of fractional shares but, instead, the holders thereof shall be entitled to payment for the fair value of such City Bancorp Dissenting Shares as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the provisions of the GBCLM; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) if any holder of City Bancorp Dissenting Shares shall subsequently deliver a written withdrawal of his demand for payment of the fair value of such shares, or (ii) if any holder fails to establish his entitlement to dissenters rights as provided in Section 351.455 of the GBCLM, such holder or holders (as the case may be) shall forfeit the right to determination of the fair value of such shares of City Bancorp Common Stock and each of such shares shall be treated as Non-Election Shares and shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into the right to receive, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, Stock Consideration and/or cash in lieu of fractional shares and/or Cash Consideration, without any interest thereon, as provided in _Sections 1.4(a)_ and  _1.4(c)_ and _Article II_ hereof. 

 

1.5 _Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, each option granted by City
Bancorp under an Employee Plan (as defined in Section 4.11(a)) to purchase
shares of City Bancorp Common Stock which is outstanding and unexercised
(each, a " _City Bancorp Option_ ") shall, by virtue of the Merger and
without any further action by the holder thereof, cease to represent a right
to acquire shares of City Bancorp Common Stock and shall be an option (the "
_New Option_ ") to purchase shares of BancorpSouth Common Stock. City Bancorp
will timely update _Section 4.2(a)_ of the City Bancorp Disclosure Schedule
to identify the City Bancorp Options that are outstanding at the Effective
Time. Each holder of a City Bancorp Option at the Effective Time will receive
a New Option in substitution thereof in an amount and at an exercise price
determined as provided below: 

   

 (a) The number of shares of BancorpSouth Common Stock to be subject to the New Option shall be equal to the number of whole shares of BancorpSouth Common Stock to which the holder of the City Bancorp Option would have been entitled under _Section 1.4(a)_ of this Agreement had the City Bancorp Option been exercised in full immediately prior to the Effective Time and had such holder received only Stock Consideration in the Merger (with fractional shares rounded to the nearest whole shares); and 

  

 (b) The exercise price per share of BancorpSouth Common Stock under the New Option shall be equal to the aggregate exercise price for the shares of City Bancorp Common Stock otherwise purchasable under the City Bancorp Option divided by the number of shares of BancorpSouth Common Stock issuable under the New Option pursuant to _Section 1.5(a)_; provided, however, the conversion formula shall be adjusted as necessary so it is a substitution that is described in Section 424(a) of the Code. Except as otherwise provided herein, the New Stock Options shall be subject to the same terms and 

   ##### 

  

 

conditions (including expiration date, vesting and exercise provisions)
and provide the same rights as were applicable to the corresponding City
Bancorp Stock Options immediately prior to the Effective Time (but taking
into account any changes thereto, including the acceleration of vesting
thereof, provided for in the applicable stock option plan of City
Bancorp (the "City Bancorp Stock Option Plan") or in any award agreement
thereunder by reason of this Agreement or the transaction contemplated
hereby), all such terms to be set forth in the acknowledgement executed by
City Bancorp Option holders as provided in Section 7.6(e). 

   

 (c) At the Effective Time, BancorpSouth shall either adopt the City Bancorp Stock Option Plan for the purpose of issuing New Options or, in BancorpSouths sole discretion, issue New Options under and subject to an appropriate stock option plan of BancorpSouth. BancorpSouth shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of BancorpSouth Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of the New Options. BancorpSouth shall take such action as is necessary to ensure that a registration statement on Form S-8, S-4 or other applicable form is effective to cover the shares of BancorpSouth Common Stock subject to the New Options and shall thereafter use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement (and maintain the current status of the prospectus contained therein) for so long as such New Options remain exercisable. 

  

 1.6 _Tax Matters_. Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, it is intended that the Merger shall qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and that this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code. It is intended that this Agreement shall provide for "fixed consideration" pursuant to Treasury Regulations 1.368-1(e)(2)(iii)(A) and that the continuity of interest requirement under applicable federal income tax principles relating to reorganizations under Section 368(a) of the Code be measured by valuing the Merger Consideration on the last business day before the first date this Agreement is a binding contract (the "COI Testing Date") in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1(e)(2). This Agreement shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with the intentions expressed in this _Section 1.6_. The parties agree that BancorpSouth may at any time change the method of effecting the combination of BancorpSouth and City Bancorp, including, without limitation, by merging City Bancorp with a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of BancorpSouth, and City Bancorp shall cooperate in such efforts, including by entering into an appropriate amendment to this Agreement (to the extent such amendment only changes the method of effecting the business combination and does not substantively affect this Agreement or the rights and obligations of the parties or their respective shareholders hereunder); provided, however, that any such subsidiary shall become a party to, and shall agree to be bound by, the terms of this Agreement, and that any such change shall not (i) alter or change the kind or amount of Merger Consideration to be provided to holders of City Bancorp Common Stock as provided for in this Agreement, (ii) adversely affect the rights of holders of City Bancorp Options (hereinafter defined) or (iii) materially impede or delay consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

 

1.7 _BancorpSouth Common Stock_. Except for shares of BancorpSouth Common
Stock owned by City Bancorp or any of its Subsidiaries (other than Trust
Account Shares and DPC Shares), which shall be converted into authorized but
unissued stock of BancorpSouth as contemplated by _Section 1.4_ hereof, and
for the issuance of the Stock Consideration, the shares of BancorpSouth Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
unaffected by the Merger and such shares shall remain issued and
outstanding. 

  

1.8 _Articles of Incorporation_. At the Effective Time, the Amended and
Restated Articles of Incorporation of BancorpSouth, as in effect at the
Effective Time, shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation. 

    ##### 

  

    

1.9 _Bylaws_. At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of BancorpSouth, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law and
the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

1.10 _Directors and Officers_. The directors and officers of BancorpSouth
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors and officers
of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the
articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified. 

   

ARTICLE II. EXCHANGE OF SHARES 

  

2.1 _BancorpSouth to Make Shares and Cash Available_. At or prior to the
Effective Time, BancorpSouth shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited,
with Computershare Trust Company NA (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the
benefit of the holders of Certificates, for exchange in accordance with this
_Article II_, the Cash Consideration, certificates representing the shares
of BancorpSouth Common Stock constituting the Stock Consideration and the cash
in lieu of fractional shares, other than the Cash Consideration and Stock
Consideration that is part of the Escrow Fund (such cash and certificates for
shares of BancorpSouth Common Stock being deposited with the Exchange Agent,
together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto,
being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ") to be issued
pursuant to _Section 1.4_ and paid pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)_ in exchange
for outstanding shares of City Bancorp Common Stock. No consideration shall
be deposited for any City Bancorp Dissenting Shares except to the extent
that, at least five business days prior to the Effective Time,
BancorpSouth has received notice that the holder of any City Bancorp
Dissenting Shares has delivered a withdrawal of his demand for the payment of
the fair value of such shares or has otherwise failed to establish
entitlement to dissenters rights with respect to such shares, in which
case BancorpSouth shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange
Agent Merger Consideration for such shares as if they were Non-Election
Shares. 

  

2.2 _Exchange of Shares; Payment of Cash Consideration_. 

   

 (a) At the time of the mailing of the Proxy Statement and Prospectus described in _Section 7.1_ hereof, BancorpSouth will cause the Exchange Agent to send to each holder of record of shares of City Bancorp Common Stock on the record date for the meeting of the shareholders of City Bancorp a letter of transmittal and election form (collectively, the " _Election Form_ ") and other appropriate materials providing for such holder, subject to the provisions of _Section 1.4_ hereof, to make a Stock Election, Cash Election, Mixed Election or no election. As of the Election Deadline (as defined below), any shares of City Bancorp Common Stock with respect to which there shall not have been such election by submission to the Exchange Agent of an effective, properly completed Election Form shall be deemed to be Non-Election Shares. 

  

 (i) Any Cash Election, Stock Election or Mixed Election shall have been validly made only if the Exchange Agent shall have received an Election Form properly completed on or before 5:00 p.m., Central Time, on the tenth business day immediately following the meeting of shareholders of City Bancorp described in _Section 7.1_ hereof (the " _Election Deadline_ "). An election by a holder of shares of City Bancorp Common Stock shall be validly made only if the Exchange Agent shall have received an Election Form properly completed and executed (with the signature or signatures thereon guaranteed if required by the Election Form) by such holder of shares of City Bancorp Common Stock. An Election Form shall be deemed properly completed only if accompanied by one or more Certificates (or customary affidavits and, if required by BancorpSouth, indemnification regarding the loss or destruction of such Certificates or the guaranteed delivery of such Certificates) representing all shares of City Bancorp Common Stock covered by such Election Form, together with duly executed transmittal materials included with the Election Form. BancorpSouth shall have the right to make reasonable determinations 

    ##### 

  

    

and to establish reasonable procedures (not inconsistent with the terms of
this Agreement) in guiding the Exchange Agent in its determination as to the
validity of Election Forms and of any revision, revocation or withdrawal
thereof. 

   

 (ii) Two or more holders of shares of City Bancorp Common Stock who are determined to constructively own shares owned by each other by virtue of Section 318(a) of the Code and who so certify to BancorpSouths satisfaction, and any single holder of shares of City Bancorp Common Stock who holds such shares in two or more different names and who so certifies to BancorpSouths satisfaction, may submit a joint Election Form covering the aggregate shares of City Bancorp Common Stock owned by all such holders or by such single holder, as the case may be. For all purposes of this Agreement, each such group of holders which, and each such single holder who, submits a joint Election Form shall be treated as a single holder of shares of City Bancorp Common Stock. 

   

 (iii) Each holder of record of shares of City Bancorp Common Stock who holds such shares as nominee, trustee or in other representative capacities (each, a " _Representative_ ") may submit multiple Election Forms, provided that such Representative certifies that each such Election Form covers all shares of City Bancorp Common Stock held by that Representative for a particular beneficial owner. 

   

 (iv) Any holder of shares of City Bancorp Common Stock who has made an election by submitting an Election Form to the Exchange Agent may, at any time prior to the Election Deadline, change such holders election by submitting a revised Election Form, properly completed and signed, that is received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline. Any holder of shares of City Bancorp Common Stock may, at any time prior to the Election Deadline, revoke such holders election by written notice to the Exchange Agent received at any time prior to the Election Deadline. 

   

 (b) As soon as practicable after the Election Deadline (the " _Allocation Date_ "), the Exchange Agent shall effectuate the allocation among the holders of shares of City Bancorp Common Stock of rights to receive the Stock Consideration, the Cash Consideration or a combination of both the Stock Consideration and the Cash Consideration in the Merger in accordance with the terms of this Section. As more fully set forth in _Section 1.4_ above, the aggregate number of shares of City Bancorp Common Stock to be converted in the Merger into the right to receive Cash Consideration may not exceed 50% of the outstanding shares of City Bancorp Common Stock, and the aggregate number of shares of City Bancorp Common Stock to be converted in the Merger into the right to receive Stock Consideration may not exceed 50% of the total number of outstanding shares of City Bancorp Common Stock. 

  

 (c) No dividends or other distributions declared after the Effective Time with respect to BancorpSouth Common Stock and payable to the holders of record thereof shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this _Article II_. After the surrender by a record holder of a Certificate in accordance with this _Article II_, BancorpSouth shall promptly pay the record holder thereof any such dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with respect to shares of BancorpSouth Common Stock represented by such Certificate. 

  

 (d) If any certificate representing shares of BancorpSouth Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other taxes payable by reason of the issuance of a certificate representing shares of BancorpSouth Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of City Bancorp of the shares of City Bancorp Common Stock which were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for certificates representing shares of BancorpSouth Common Stock as provided in this _Article II_. 

  

 (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of BancorpSouth Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no dividend or distribution with respect to BancorpSouth Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of BancorpSouth. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, BancorpSouth shall pay to each former shareholder of City Bancorp who otherwise would be entitled to receive a fractional share of BancorpSouth Common Stock an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the closing price of BancorpSouth Common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the Closing Date and (y) the fraction of a share of BancorpSouth Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to _Article I_ hereof. 

  

 (g) If BancorpSouth receives notice less than five business days prior to the Effective Time that a City Bancorp Dissenting Shareholder has failed to establish his entitlement to dissenters rights, such shareholder shall receive Merger Consideration from BancorpSouth directly, rather than out of the Exchange Fund, as if such shares were Non-Election Shares. 

  

 (h) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the shareholders of City Bancorp for 12 months after the Effective Time shall be paid to BancorpSouth. Any shareholders of City Bancorp who have not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to BancorpSouth for payment of their portion of the Cash Consideration and their shares of BancorpSouth Common Stock, cash in lieu of fractional shares and unpaid dividends and distributions on BancorpSouth Common Stock deliverable in respect of each share of City Bancorp Common Stock such shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon and net of any amounts which were put into the Escrow Fund, to the extent that the Escrow Fund has not been released to shareholders of City Bancorp pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of BancorpSouth, City Bancorp, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of City Bancorp Common Stock for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. 

  

 (i) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by BancorpSouth, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as is customarily required by BancorpSouth and Exchange Agent for other shareholders of BancorpSouth as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of BancorpSouth Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

 (a) BancorpSouth and City Bancorp shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement, and BancorpSouth shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC the S-4, in which the Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus. Each of City Bancorp and BancorpSouth shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as 

   ##### 

  

 

practicable after such filing, and City Bancorp shall thereafter mail the
Proxy Statement to its shareholders as promptly as practicable. Each of City
Bancorp and BancorpSouth will use all reasonable efforts to respond to any
comments made by the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and the S-4, and
to cause the S-4 to become effective as promptly as practicable. Prior to
the effective date of the S-4, BancorpSouth shall take all or any action
required under any applicable federal or state securities laws in connection
with the issuance of shares of BancorpSouth Common Stock in the Merger. If at
any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to either of
the parties, or their respective affiliates, officers or directors, should be
discovered by either party which should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to any of the S-4 or the Proxy Statement so that such documents
would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party hereto and,
to the extent required by law, rules or regulations, an appropriate amendment
or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with
the SEC and disseminated to the shareholders of City Bancorp. 

   

 (b) The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use their reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, and to obtain all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities which are necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including, without limitation, the Merger). 

  

 (c) City Bancorp shall, upon request, furnish BancorpSouth with all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the S-4 or any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of BancorpSouth or any of its Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

 

7.2 _Access to Information_. 

   

 (a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, City Bancorp shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, attorneys, financial advisors and other representatives (each, a " _Representative_ ") of BancorpSouth, access during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time to all of its properties, books, contracts, commitments, records, officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives and, during such period, it shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, make available to BancorpSouth all information concerning its business, properties and personnel as BancorpSouth may reasonably request. In addition, City Bancorp and each of its Subsidiaries shall permit a Representative of BancorpSouth to have access to the premises and observe the operations of City Bancorp or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, to attend each meeting of their respective Boards of Directors and committees thereof (other than during discussions regarding this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or any Acquisition Proposal that may be brought to its attention) and to meet, during normal business hours, with the officers of City Bancorp and its Subsidiaries responsible for the Financial Statements, the internal controls of City Bancorp and its Subsidiaries and the disclosure controls and procedures of City Bancorp and its Subsidiaries to discuss such matters as BancorpSouth may deem reasonably necessary or appropriate for BancorpSouth to satisfy its obligations under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and any rules and regulations relating thereto. Neither City Bancorp nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would reasonably violate the rights of its customers, may reasonably be expected to jeopardize any attorney-client privilege or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. City Bancorp shall identify the nature of any such limitation on access and disclosure, and the parties hereto will make appropriate 

   ##### 

  

 

substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the
restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. 

   

 (b) BancorpSouth agrees that it will not use Confidential Information related to City Bancorp or its Subsidiaries or their predecessor entities, subsidiaries or affiliates for any purpose other than assisting BancorpSouth in consummating the transactions contemplated hereby. BancorpSouth agrees not to disclose or allow disclosure to others of any such Confidential Information, except that BancorpSouth may disclose Confidential Information to its directors, officers, employees, partners, affiliates, agents, advisors or representatives (collectively, " _BancorpSouth Representatives_ "), to the extent necessary to permit such BancorpSouth Representatives to assist BancorpSouth in consummating the transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that BancorpSouth shall require each such BancorpSouth Representative to be bound by the terms of this Section to the same extent as if they were parties hereto, and BancorpSouth shall be responsible for any breach of this Section by any of the BancorpSouth Representatives. In addition, BancorpSouth agrees that it will not make any disclosure that it is having or has had discussions concerning the transactions contemplated hereby or any terms which have been or are being discussed, that it has received Confidential Information or that it is considering the transactions contemplated hereby; provided that it may make such disclosure if it has received the written opinion of its counsel that such disclosure must be made by it in order that it not commit a violation of law and, prior to such disclosure, it promptly advises and consults with City Bancorp and its legal counsel concerning the information it proposes to disclose. In the event that BancorpSouth or anyone to whom BancorpSouth transmits any Confidential Information in accordance with this Section is requested or required (by deposition, interrogatories, requests for information or documents in legal proceedings, subpoenas, civil investigative demand or similar process), in connection with any proceeding, to disclose any Confidential Information, BancorpSouth will give City Bancorp prompt written notice of such request or requirement so that City Bancorp may seek an appropriate protective order or other remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this Section, and BancorpSouth will cooperate with City Bancorp to obtain such protective order. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained or City Bancorp waives compliance with the relevant provisions of this Section, BancorpSouth (or such other persons to whom such request is directed) will furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information which, in the written opinion of BancorpSouths counsel, is legally required to be disclosed and, upon City Bancorps request, will use BancorpSouths best efforts to obtain assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded to such information. 

  

 (c) City Bancorp and its Subsidiaries agree that they will not use Confidential Information related to BancorpSouth or its Subsidiaries or their predecessor entities, subsidiaries or affiliates for any purpose other than assisting City Bancorp in consummating the transactions contemplated hereby. City Bancorp and its Subsidiaries agree not to disclose or allow disclosure to others of any such Confidential Information, except that City Bancorp may disclose Confidential Information to its directors, officers, employees, partners, affiliates, agents, advisors or representatives (collectively, "City Bancorp Representatives") only upon obtaining the prior written consent of BancorpSouth with respect to any disclosure of such information to a particular City Bancorp Representative, to the extent necessary to permit such City Bancorp Representatives to assist City Bancorp in consummating the transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that City Bancorp shall require each such City Bancorp Representative to be bound by the terms of this Section to the same extent as if they were parties hereto, and City Bancorp shall be responsible for any breach of this Section by any of the City Bancorp Representatives. In addition, City Bancorp and their Subsidiaries agree that they will not make any disclosure that they are having or have had discussions concerning the transactions contemplated hereby or any terms which have been or are being discussed, that they have received Confidential Information or that they are considering the transactions contemplated hereby; provided that they may make such disclosure if they have received the written opinion of their counsel that such disclosure must be made by them in order that they not commit a violation of law and, prior to such disclosure, they promptly advise and consult with BancorpSouth and its legal counsel concerning the information they propose to disclose.

City Bancorp or one of its Subsidiaries transmits any Confidential
Information in accordance with this Section is requested or required (by
deposition, interrogatories, requests for information or documents in legal
proceedings, subpoenas, civil investigative demand or similar process),
in connection with any proceeding, to disclose any Confidential Information,
City Bancorp will give BancorpSouth prompt written notice of such request or
requirement so that BancorpSouth may seek an appropriate protective order or
other remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this Section, and
City Bancorp will cooperate with BancorpSouth to obtain such protective order.
In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained or
BancorpSouth waives compliance with the relevant provisions of this Section,
City Bancorp (or such other persons to whom such request is directed) will
furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information which, in
the written opinion of City Bancorps counsel, is legally required to be
disclosed and, upon BancorpSouths request, will use City Bancorps best
efforts to obtain assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded to
such information. 

   

 (d) For purposes of this Section, " _Confidential Information_ " will be deemed to include: (a) any information (including any technology, know-how, patent application, test result, research study, business plan, budget, forecast or projection) relating directly or indirectly to the business of City Bancorp or BancorpSouth, respectively, any predecessor entity or any subsidiary or other affiliate of City Bancorp or BancorpSouth (whether prepared by City Bancorp or BancorpSouth or by any other person and whether or not in written form) that is, has been or will be made available to another party hereto or its Representative by or on behalf of City Bancorp or BancorpSouth or any Representative of City Bancorp or BancorpSouth; (b) any memorandum, analysis, compilation, summary, interpretation, study, report or other document, record or material that is, has been or will be prepared by or for City Bancorp or BancorpSouth or any Representative of City Bancorp or BancorpSouth and that contains, reflects, interprets or is based directly or indirectly upon any information of the type referred to in clause (a) of this sentence; (c) the existence and terms of this Agreement and the proposed terms of any other agreement contemplated hereby and the fact that information of the type referred to in clause (a) of this sentence has been made available to City Bancorp or BancorpSouth or any of their respective Representatives; and (d) the fact that discussions or negotiations are or may be taking place with respect to a possible transaction involving City Bancorp and BancorpSouth and the proposed terms of any such transaction.

 (e) If the transactions contemplated hereby are not consummated or if, at any time, either City Bancorp or BancorpSouth (each a " _Requesting Party_ ") requests, the other party and its Representatives will promptly deliver to the Requesting Party any Confidential Information (and all copies thereof) obtained or possessed by such other party or any of its Representatives. Notwithstanding the delivery to the Requesting Party of Confidential Information pursuant to this Section, the parties and their Representatives will continue to be bound by their confidentiality obligations and other obligations under this Section. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (f) Notwithstanding anything in any other agreement to the contrary, no investigation by BancorpSouth or its Representatives shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of City Bancorp set forth herein, and the parties shall remain responsible to the extent provided herein. 

  

 (g) The parties agree that the provisions of this _Section 7.2_ shall supersede any prior agreements between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof; provided, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of Section 9 of the letter agreement, dated as of June 12, 2006, by and between BancorpSouth and Stifel, shall remain in full force and effect. 

 

7.3 _Shareholder Meeting_. City Bancorp shall take all steps in accordance
with applicable law necessary to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold
a meeting of its shareholders (the "City Bancorp Shareholders Meeting") to
be held as soon as is reasonably practicable after the date on which the S-4
becomes effective for the purpose of voting upon the approval and adoption
of this Agreement. City Bancorp will, through its Board of Directors (but
only if and to the extent it reasonably believes such action is consistent
with the fulfillment of its fiduciary duties), recommend to its shareholders
approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and such
other matters as may be submitted to its shareholders in connection with this
Agreement. 

  

7.4 _Affiliates_. City Bancorp shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
each director, executive officer and other person who is an "affiliate" (for

written agreement, in the form of _Exhibit 7.4_. 

  

7.5 _NYSE Listing_. BancorpSouth shall make all filings required of it to

7.6 _Employee Benefit Plans; Existing Agreements_. 

   

 (a) As soon as administratively feasible after the Effective Time, to the extent permissible under the terms of the BancorpSouth Plans, the employees of City Bancorp and its Subsidiaries (the " _City Bancorp Employees_ ") shall be eligible to participate in BancorpSouths employee benefit plans in which similarly situated employees of BancorpSouth or BancorpSouth Bank participate, to the same extent as similarly situated employees of BancorpSouth or BancorpSouth Bank (it being understood that inclusion of City Bancorp Employees in BancorpSouths employee benefit plans may occur at different times with respect to different plans) except as provided below; _provided_ _however_ , that City Bancorp Employees shall not be eligible for participation in the BancorpSouth defined benefit pension plan. 

  

 (b) With respect to each BancorpSouth Plan that is an " _employee benefit plan_ ," as defined in section 3(3) of ERISA, for purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits, including for severance benefits and vacation entitlement, service with City Bancorp shall be treated as service with BancorpSouth; _provided_ , _however_ , that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication or increase of benefits. Such service also shall apply for purposes of satisfying any waiting periods, evidence of insurability requirements, or the application of any preexisting condition limitations. Each BancorpSouth Plan shall waive pre-existing condition limitations to the same extent waived under the applicable City Bancorp Plan. City Bancorp employees shall be given credit for amounts paid under a corresponding benefit plan during the same period for purposes of applying deductibles, copayments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the BancorpSouth Plan. 

  

 (c) As of the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed and as described in _Section 8.2(g)_ below, BancorpSouth shall assume and honor and shall cause the appropriate Subsidiaries to assume and

other compensation agreements and arrangements existing prior to the
execution of this Agreement which are between City Bancorp or any of its
Subsidiaries and any director, officer or employee thereof and which have
been disclosed in the City Bancorp Disclosure Schedule. 

   

 (d) If requested by BancorpSouth, prior to the Effective Time, City Bancorp shall freeze, amend, spin-off, merge or take other action with respect to any Employee Plan (including terminating such plans immediately prior to and conditioned upon the occurrence of the Effective Time) that BancorpSouth, in its sole discretion, deems advisable and not inconsistent with this Agreement (together, the " _Designated Plans_ "), and provide all required notices to participants and appropriate governmental agencies. With respect to those Designated Plans that are maintained by City Bancorp as qualified under section 401(a) of the Code, BancorpSouth will take appropriate actions to provide for the rollover of distributions therefrom into the appropriate tax-qualified retirement plan of BancorpSouth, provided that the acceptance of rollovers would not jeopardize the tax-qualified status of any BancorpSouth Plan. Prior to the Effective Time, City Bancorp shall amend the Designated Plans to eliminate any benefit, right, subsidy, payment or accrual that would otherwise result from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other change in the control of City Bancorp. City Bancorp will take appropriate action to terminate the City Bancorp Stock Purchase Plan prior to the Closing and to refund all amounts withheld from participants thereunder that have not previously been applied to the purchase of City Bancorp common stock. 

  

 (e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, City Bancorp shall obtain the consent prior to the Merger of all holders of a City Bancorp Option to the conversion of City Bancorp Options into New Options, as provided under the terms of _Section 1.5_. Such consent shall be in writing and in a form approved by BancorpSouth and shall include an acknowledgement of the correctness of the conversion and acceptance thereof without claims, sufficient to serve as a release and waiver of any claims against City Bancorp. 

  

 (f) On or before December 31, 2006, City Bancorp shall pay all performance bonuses earned in 2006 for all employees who have employment agreements, as identified in _Section 4.11(q)_ of the City Bancorp Disclosure Schedule. 

 

7.7 _Consents and Approvals_. City Bancorp shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain all third-party consents required under City Bancorp
Contracts. 

  

7.8 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective Time any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all
properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of
the parties to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party to
this Agreement and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such
necessary action as may be reasonably requested by BancorpSouth. 

  

7.9 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each of BancorpSouth and City Bancorp agrees (subject to any
fiduciary duties of the City Bancorp Board of Directors) to use its
respective reasonable best efforts in good faith to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or desirable, or advisable under applicable laws, so as to permit
consummation of the Merger as promptly as practicable and otherwise to enable
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and shall cooperate
fully with the other party hereto to that end. 

  

7.10 _Tax-Free Qualification_. Each of BancorpSouth and City Bancorp shall use
its reasonable best efforts not to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts
not to permit any of its Subsidiaries to, take any 

    ##### 

  

    

action that would reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger
from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code. 

  

7.11 _Indemnification of City Bancorp Directors and Officers_. 

   

 (a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, other than the litigation which is the subject of the Escrow Agreement and any related claims, including, without limitation, any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation in which any person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of City Bancorp or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties") is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of City Bancorp, any of the Subsidiaries of City Bancorp or any of their respective predecessors or affiliates or (ii) this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, whether in any case asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time, the parties hereto agree to cooperate and use their best efforts to defend against and respond thereto. It is understood and agreed that, after the Effective Time, BancorpSouth shall indemnify and hold harmless, subject in all respects to any limitations imposed by any statute, rule, regulation, administrative interpretation, or other law, including any procedural requirements or other conditions, each such Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation. In the event of any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time), the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to them after consultation with BancorpSouth; provided, however, that (1) BancorpSouth shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and, upon such assumption, BancorpSouth shall not be liable to any Indemnified Party for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by any Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof, except that if BancorpSouth elects not to assume such defense or if counsel for the Indemnified Parties reasonably advises that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest between BancorpSouth and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to them after consultation with BancorpSouth, and BancorpSouth shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties, (2) BancorpSouth shall in all cases be obligated pursuant to this paragraph to pay for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties (unless an ethical conflict of interest arises for such firm of counsel in representing all Indemnified Parties), (3) BancorpSouth shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) and (4) BancorpSouth shall have no obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party if that indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by any statute, rule, regulation, administrative interpretation, or other law. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim Indemnification under this _Section 7.11_ , upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify BancorpSouth thereof; provided that the failure to so notify shall not affect the obligations of BancorpSouth under this _Section 7.11_ except to he extent such failure to notify materially prejudices BancorpSouth. BancorpSouths obligations under this _Section 7.11_ shall continue in full force and effect without time limit from and after the Effective Time. 

  

 (b) Until the merger of The Signature Bank with and into BancorpSouth Bank (the "Bank Merger"), City Bancorp prior to the Merger and BancorpSouth after the Merger shall maintain City Bancorps current directors and officers liability insurance policy to cover the officers and directors of The Signature Bank serving in such capacities immediately prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Merger, City Bancorp shall purchase insurance and after the Merger BancorpSouth shall maintain insurance to cover the officers and directors of City Bancorp or its Subsidiaries (including The Signature Bank, with such insurance for The Signature Banks officers and directors to be purchased after the Bank 

   ##### 

  

 

Merger) serving in such capacities immediately prior to the Effective Time
for a period of five (5) years from the Effective Time, to the extent
reasonably necessary to provide the same coverage in effect prior to the
Effective Time with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time which were committed by such officers and directors in their
capacity as such, with the cost of any such insurance to be approved
by BancorpSouth, in its sole discretion. Prior to the Merger, City Bancorp
shall purchase tail insurance coverage for all other claims made policies of
City Bancorp in effect prior to the Effective Time for a period of five (5)
years from the Effective Time, to the extent reasonably necessary to provide
the same coverage in effect prior to the Effective Time, with the cost of
any such insurance to be approved by BancorpSouth, in its sole discretion. 

   

 (c) In the event BancorpSouth or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of BancorpSouth assume the obligations set forth in this Section. 

  

 (d) The provisions of this _Section 7.11_ are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. 

 

7.12 _Trust Preferred Securities_. Each of BancorpSouth and City Bancorp will
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause BancorpSouth to succeed to City
Bancorps rights, interests and obligations pursuant to the indentures, dated
as of September 25, 2003 and December 21, 2004, regarding certain floating
rate junior subordinated debt securities (collectively, the " _Indentures_
"), including the execution of supplemental indentures and other
necessary documentation, getting necessary consents and obtaining any

connection with the Merger by the shareholders of City Bancorp: 

   

 (a) By mutual consent of City Bancorp and BancorpSouth in a written instrument, if the Board of Directors of each so determines by a vote of a majority of the members of its entire Board; 

  

 (b) By either BancorpSouth or City Bancorp upon written notice to the other party (i) 60 days after the date on which any request or application for a Requisite Regulatory Approval shall have been denied or withdrawn at the request or recommendation of the Governmental Entity which must grant such Requisite Regulatory Approval, unless within the 60-day period following such denial or withdrawal a petition for rehearing or an amended application has been filed with the applicable Governmental Entity; _provided_ , _however_ , that no party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(b)(i)_ if such denial or request or recommendation for withdrawal shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein or (ii) if any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final nonappealable order enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger; 

  

 (c) By BancorpSouth or City Bancorp upon written notice to the other party if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before June 1, 2007, unless the failure of the Closing to occur by such date shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein; 

  

 (d) By BancorpSouth or City Bancorp upon written notice to the other party if any approval of the shareholders of City Bancorp required for the consummation of the Merger shall not have been obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the required vote at the City Bancorp Shareholders Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof; 

  

 (e) By either BancorpSouth or City Bancorp upon written notice to the other party (provided that the terminating party is not then in material breach of any representation or warranty or material breach of any covenant or other agreement contained herein) in the event of either: (i) if any of the representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part of the other party hereto shall be or become materially untrue or incorrect, and such representation is either incapable, by its nature, of being cured or is not cured within 30 calendar days following the giving of written notice thereof to the party making such representation; or (ii) a material breach by the other party of any of the covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, and such breach is either incapable, by its nature, of being cured or is not cured within 30 calendar days following the giving of written notice thereof to such other party; provided, however, that neither party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(e)_ unless the breach of representation or warranty, together with all other such breaches, would entitle the party receiving such representation not to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby under _Section 8.2(a)_ (in the case of a breach of representation or warranty by City Bancorp) or _Section 8.3(a)_ (in the case of a breach of a representation or warranty by BancorpSouth); 

   ##### 

  

  

 (f) By BancorpSouth upon written notice to City Bancorp if City Bancorps Board of Directors shall have failed to recommend in the Proxy Statement that City Bancorps shareholders approve and adopt this Agreement, or City Bancorps Board of Directors shall have withdrawn, modified or changed, in a manner adverse to BancorpSouth, its approval or recommendation of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, or if City Bancorp or The Signature Bank enters into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, or acquisition or similar agreement related or with respect to any Acquisition Proposal; or 

  

 (g) By the Board of Directors of City Bancorp, if it determines by a vote of a majority of the members of its entire Board, at any time during the 10-day period commencing two days after the Determination Date, if the Average BancorpSouth Common Stock Price is less than the City Bancorp Termination Price; 

 

subject, however, to the following: If the City Bancorp Board of Directors
elects to so terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(g)_, it
shall give written notice thereof to BancorpSouth immediately following such
vote. During the five-day period commencing with its receipt of such notice,
BancorpSouth shall have the option to elect to increase the Exchange Ratio to
that number which would cause the dollar value of the Stock Consideration
valued using the Average BancorpSouth Common Stock Price to be equal to that
which would have been payable had the Average BancorpSouth Common Stock Price
been equal to the Lower Price. If BancorpSouth makes an election contemplated
by the preceding sentence within such five-day period (the "
_Adjustment Period_ "), it shall give prompt written notice to City Bancorp
of such election (the " _Adjustment Notice_ ") pursuant to this _Section
9.1(g)_ and this Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance with its
terms (except as the Exchange Ratio shall have been so modified), and any
references in this Agreement to "Exchange Ratio" shall thereafter be deemed
to refer to the Exchange Ratio as adjusted pursuant to this _Section
9.1(g)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if BancorpSouth does not provide the
Adjustment Notice within the Adjustment Period or notifies City Bancorp that
it does not intend to increase the Exchange Ratio as described above, City
Bancorp may withdraw its notice of election to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section at any time prior to the expiration of three
business days after expiration of the Adjustment Period. 

  

9.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement by
either BancorpSouth or City Bancorp as provided in _Section 9.1_, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect except (i) _Sections
9.2_, _9.3_ , _10.3_ ,  _10.4_ and _10.12_ shall survive any termination of
this Agreement (ii) that notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, no party shall be relieved or released from any
liabilities or damages arising out of its breach of any provision of
this Agreement, and City Bancorp shall not be relieved or released from any
obligation to make payment to BancorpSouth pursuant to _Section 9.3_
hereof. 

  

9.3 _Termination Fee_. City Bancorp shall pay to BancorpSouth, upon demand, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds, the sum of $4,500,000 (the
"Termination Fee") if (A) this Agreement is terminated (1) by BancorpSouth
pursuant to (i) _Section 9.1(f)_, or (ii) _Section 9.1(e)_ , other than as a
result of circumstances beyond the control of City Bancorp, or (2) terminated
by City Bancorp or BancorpSouth pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)_ and (B)
an Acquisition Proposal has been made or is made at any time within a nine
(9) month period after such termination of this Agreement and actions have
been taken or are taken by the board of directors of City Bancorp to pursue
further discussions or negotiations regarding such Acquisition

9.4 _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable law, this Agreement may
be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their
respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval of the
matters presented in connection with the Merger by the shareholders of City
Bancorp; _provided_ , _however_ , that after any approval of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by City Bancorps shareholders, there may not
be, without further approval of such shareholders, any 

    ##### 

  

    

amendment of this Agreement which reduces the amount or changes the form of
the consideration to be delivered to such shareholders hereunder other than
as contemplated by this Agreement. This Agreement may not be amended except by
an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto. 

  

9.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, each of the
parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by its Board of Directors, may,
to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any
of the obligations or other acts of the other party hereto, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other
party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c)
waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the other party
contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument
signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or failure to
insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or
condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any
subsequent or other failure.
