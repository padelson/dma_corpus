Capital as of September 8, 2006, an estimate of the Debt and the Transaction
Costs as of the Closing Date, and an estimate of the Initial Phantom Stock
Costs based on the Estimated Adjusted Purchase Price. The Estimated Adjusted

full amount of the Transaction Costs (except with respect to the portion of
the Transaction Costs payable upon the disbursement of the escrowed funds to
the Sellers), the Estimated Initial Phantom Stock Costs and the Debt

## ** _Section 2.4_** ** _ Post-Closing Adjustment._**

  

(a) Within 45 days after the Closing Date, the Buyer and each of the Sellers
shall have the right to (i) review the books and records of the Acquired
Entities and any other relevant books and records maintained by the Acquired
Entities and (ii) determine whether the Estimated Adjusted Purchase Price is
correct based on the Buyers or the Sellers determination, as applicable,
per good faith calculations, that the value of the amounts included in the
Adjusted Purchase Price Notice are accurate as of the Closing Date. In the
event any of the Parties determines that the Adjusted Purchase Price is not
accurate, it shall prepare and deliver to the other Parties within 45 days
after the Closing Date a written statement (an "Adjustment Statement")
setting forth, in reasonable detail, a calculation of a proposed revised
Adjusted Purchase Price (a "Revised Adjusted Purchase Price") and the amount
of the difference between the Estimated Adjusted Purchase Price and such
Revised Adjusted Purchase Price (the "Adjustment Amount") and shall assist
the other Parties in verifying the amounts set forth in such Adjustment
Statement.

  

(b) The Buyer or the Sellers may dispute all or any portion of the
calculation of such Revised Adjusted Purchase Price and the related
Adjustment Amount by written notice (the "Dispute Notice") to the other Party
within 30 days of the date of receipt of the related Adjustment Statement
provided to such Party pursuant to Section 2.4(a) setting forth, in
reasonable detail, the basis for the dispute. If the Parties do not agree
on the calculation of such Adjustment Amount within 30 days of any related
Dispute Notice, the Buyer and the Sellers will select (within 10 days of the
expiration of that 30-day period) an accounting firm mutually acceptable to
them to resolve any remaining objections. If the Buyer and the Sellers are
unable to agree on the choice of an accounting firm within such 10-day
period, they will select, within an additional 10 days, a nationally-
recognized accounting firm by lot (after excluding their respective regular
outside accounting firms) that is a member of the Securities and Exchange
Commissions Practice Division of the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants. The determination of the Revised Adjusted Purchase Price by the
accounting firm so selected will be set forth in writing and will be
conclusive and binding upon the Buyer and the Sellers for purposes of
determining adjustments to the Purchase Price pursuant to this Section 2.4.
The cost and expense of such accounting firm shall be borne equally by and
between the Buyer and the Sellers. The Revised Adjusted Purchase Price shall
be as agreed to by the Parties or determined by an appointed accounting firm
in accordance with this Section 2.4, as the case may be. Such Revised
Adjusted Purchase Price as so agreed or determined or, in the event no
Adjustment Statement is delivered in accordance with Section 2.4(a), the
Estimated Adjusted Purchase Price shall be deemed and referred to herein as
the "Final Adjusted Purchase Price." If the amount of the Final Adjusted
Purchase Price is less in value than the amount of Estimated
Adjusted Purchase Price, then the Sellers shall pay to the Buyer the amount
of the difference between the Estimated Adjusted Purchase Price and the Final
Adjusted Purchase Price within two (2) business days by wire transfer of
immediately available funds. If the amount of the Final Adjusted Purchase
Price is greater in value than the amount of Estimated Adjusted Purchase
Price, then the Buyer shall pay to the Sellers the amount of the difference
between the Final Adjusted Purchase Price and the Estimated Adjusted Purchase
Price within two (2) business days by wire transfer of immediately available
funds.

     

   

(c) The Revised Adjusted Purchase Price and any adjustments in respect
thereof determined in accordance with Section 2.4 shall be made in accordance
with GAAP and no adjustments shall be made for changes in any Exchange Rates
in effect after the Closing Date.

  

## ** _Section 2.5_** ** _ Treatment of Grant Phantom Stock._**

  

(a) Pursuant to the Phantom Stock Agreements, at the Closing Time and upon
receipt of an executed termination agreement and amendment in a form
reasonably acceptable to the Buyer that will cancel all the Grant Phantom
Stock and terminate all obligations of the Corporation under the Phantom
Stock Agreements in exchange for the making of the payments set forth in this
Section 2.5, the Buyer (or the Corporation, upon payment of the required
funds to the Corporation by the Buyer) will pay to the Phantom Stockholders
an amount for each unit of Grant Phantom Stock equal to the Estimated
Adjusted Purchase Price (calculated without reduction for the Estimated
Initial Phantom Stock Costs) divided by 2,948.7424 (and the Buyer or the
Corporation, as applicable, shall be entitled to make any withholdings
required by applicable law). The total amount of the payments made
under this Section 2.5(a) shall be referred to herein as the "Estimated
Initial Phantom Stock Costs."

  

(b) If the amount of the Final Initial Phantom Stock Costs (as defined below)
is greater in value than the amount of Estimated Initial Phantom Stock Costs,
then within two (2) business days of the determination of the Final Adjusted
Purchase Price the Buyer (or the Corporation, upon payment of the required
funds to the Corporation by the Buyer) will pay to the Phantom Stockholders
an amount for each unit of Grant Phantom Stock equal to the amount of the
difference between Final Initial Phantom Stock Costs and the Estimated
Initial Phantom Stock Costs divided by 2,948.7424 (and the Buyer or the
Corporation, as applicable, shall be entitled to make any withholdings
required by applicable law). If the amount of the Final Initial Phantom Stock
Costs is less in value than the amount of Estimated Initial Phantom
Stock Costs, then the Buyer will be paid by the Sellers (on behalf of the
Phantom Stockholders) an amount equal to (i) the amount of the difference
between Estimated Initial Phantom Stock Costs and the Final Initial Phantom
Stock Costs (the "Phantom Stock Adjustment") (ii) divided by 2,948.7424 and
(iii) multiplied by 180. The "Final Initial Phantom Stock Costs" shall be
equal to the Final Adjusted Purchase Price (calculated without reduction for
the Final Initial Phantom Stock Costs) divided by 2,948.7424 multiplied by
180.

  

(c) On the date of the termination of the Escrow Agreement, the Buyer (or the
Corporation, upon payment of the required funds to the Corporation by the
Buyer) will pay to the Phantom Stockholders an amount, if any, for each unit
of Grant Phantom Stock equal to (i) the total amount, if any, of the escrowed
funds remaining in the Escrow Fund less the Transaction Costs to be paid by
the Buyer or the Corporation that have not been paid prior to the date of the
termination of the Escrow Agreement and less the Phantom Stock Adjustment, if
any, (ii) divided by 2,948.7424 (and the Buyer or the Corporation, as
applicable, shall be entitled to make any withholdings required by applicable
law). Any payment made to the Phantom Stockholders by the Buyer or the
Corporation pursuant to this Section 2.5(c) shall be reimbursed to the Buyer
or the Corporation from the escrowed funds to be disbursed to the Sellers
upon the termination of the Escrow Agreement. Additionally, any Transaction
Costs to be paid by the Buyer or the Corporation that have not been paid
prior to the date of the termination of the Escrow Agreement shall be
reimbursed to the Buyer or the Corporation from the escrowed funds to be
disbursed to the Sellers upon the termination of the Escrow Agreement.

     

   

(d) The units of Grant Phantom Stock have been awarded as follows:

debtor of an Account Receivable relating to the amount or validity of such

for sale or raw materials or work-in-process for the production of such

standing under all applicable legislation (foreign or domestic) and all
required employer contributions under any such plan(s) or policies have been

representation that is made concerning an Employee Plan and its compliance
with ERISA, the Code or any applicable Legal Requirements under U.S. law, or

#### (i) each Acquired Entity is, and at all times since December 31, 2001,
has been, in compliance with all of the terms and requirements of each
Governmental Authorization identified or required to be identified in
Schedule 4.16(b);

  

#### (ii) to the Sellers Knowledge, since December 31, 2001 no event has
occurred or circumstance exists that may (A) constitute or result directly or
indirectly in a violation of or a failure to comply with any term or
requirement of any Governmental Authorization or (B) result directly or

     

   

#### indirectly in the revocation, withdrawal, suspension, cancellation or

2001, any written notice or, to the Sellers Knowledge, other communication

have been duly made on a timely basis with the appropriate Governmental
Bodies.

  

### (c) except for contract- or project-specific Governmental Authorizations,
the Governmental Authorizations listed in Schedule 4.16(b) collectively
constitute all of the Governmental Authorizations necessary to permit the
Acquired Entities to lawfully conduct and operate their business in the
manner in which it is currently conducted and operated and to permit the
Acquired Entities to own and use their assets in the manner in which they
currently own and use such assets.

  

## ** _Section 4.17_** ** _ Taxes._**

  

### (a) _Tax Returns Filed and Taxes Paid_. The Acquired Entities have filed
or caused to be filed on a timely basis all Tax Returns and all reports with
respect to Taxes that are or were required to be filed pursuant to applicable
Legal Requirements. All Tax Returns and reports filed by the Acquired
Entities are true, correct and complete. Each of the Sellers and the
Acquired Entities, as the case may be, has paid, or made provision for the
payment of, all Taxes for which they are responsible that have or may have
become due for all periods covered by the Tax Returns or otherwise, or
pursuant to any assessment received by the Acquired Entities, except such
Taxes, if any, as are listed in Schedule 4.17(a) and are being contested in
good faith and as to which adequate reserves (determined in accordance with
GAAP) have been provided in the Interim Balance Sheet and the Financial
Statements. Except as provided in Schedule 4.17(a), none of the Acquired
Entities are currently the beneficiary of any extension of time within which
to file any Tax Return. No claim has ever been made or is expected to be made
by any Governmental Body in a jurisdiction where an Acquired Entity does not
file Tax Returns that it is or may be subject to taxation by that
jurisdiction. There are no Encumbrances on any of the assets of the Acquired
Entities that arose in connection with any failure to pay any Tax (other than
Taxes not yet due and payable), and the Sellers have no Knowledge of any
claims attributable to Taxes which, if adversely determined, would result in
any such Encumbrance.

local, and foreign income Tax Returns of the Acquired Entities (other than
Tax Returns for sales and use taxes) filed since December 31, 2000. Schedule
4.17(b) contains a complete and accurate list of all pending audits and Tax
disputes. Neither the Acquired Entities nor the Sellers expects any
undisclosed deficiencies in the payment of Tax to be asserted with respect to
any such audit. Any such deficiencies proposed as a result of such audits
have been paid, reserved against, settled or are being contested in good
faith. The Sellers have delivered, or made available to Buyer, copies of any
examination reports, statements or deficiencies or similar items with respect
to such audits in any Acquired Entitys possession. Except as provided
in Schedule 4.17(b), the Sellers have no Knowledge that any Governmental Body
is likely to assess any additional taxes for any period for which Tax Returns
have been filed. Except as provided in Schedule 4.17(b), there is no dispute
or claim concerning any Taxes of the Acquired Entities either (i) claimed or
raised by any Governmental Body in writing or (ii) as to which the Sellers
have Knowledge. Except as described in Schedule 4.17(a), no Acquired Entity
has been given or been requested to give waivers or extensions (or is or

statute of limitations relating to the payment of Taxes of an Acquired Entity
or for which an Acquired Entity may be liable.

  

### (c) _Post-Closing Tax Liabilities_. The unpaid Taxes of the Acquired
Entities do not, as of the Closing Date, exceed the reserve for Tax Liability
(rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing
differences between book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the Interim
Balance Sheet. Except as disclosed in Schedule 4.17(c), since December 31,
2002, no Acquired Entity has received notice of any proposed tax assessment
or deficiency against any Acquired Entity. Since the date of the Interim

GAAP, outside the Ordinary Course of Business consistent with past custom and
practice.

  

### (d) _Transactions Affecting Post-Closing Tax Years_. The Acquired Entities
will not be required to include any item of income in, or exclude any item of
deduction from, taxable income for any taxable period (or portion thereof)

accounting for a taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date, (ii)

provision or similar provision of federal, state, local or foreign income Tax
law) executed on or prior to the Closing Date, (iii) installment sale or open
transaction disposition made on or prior to the Closing Date, or (iv) prepaid
amount received on or prior to the Closing Date.

  

### (e) _Specific Potential Tax Liabilities and Tax Situations_.

  

#### (i) _Withholding_. All Taxes that the Acquired Entities are or were
required by Legal Requirements to withhold, deduct or collect prior to
the Closing Time have been or will be duly withheld, deducted and collected
and, to the extent required, will be paid to the proper Governmental Body or
other Person.

  

#### (ii) _Tax Sharing or Similar Agreements_. There is no tax sharing
agreement, tax allocation agreement, tax indemnity obligation or similar
written or

     

   

#### unwritten agreement or practice with respect to Taxes (including any
advance pricing agreement, closing agreement or other arrangement relating to
Taxes) that will require any payment by any Acquired Entity after the
Closing.

  

#### (iii) _Consolidated Group_. No Acquired Entity (i) has been a member of
an Affiliated Group (or any similar group defined under a similar provision
of federal, state, local or foreign law) (other than the Affiliated Group of
the Corporation) or (ii) has liability for Taxes of any person (other than
the other Acquired Entities) under §1.1502-6 of the Treasury Regulations (or
any similar provision of state, local or foreign law), as a transferee or
successor by contract or otherwise.

  

#### (iv) _Listed Transactions_. In the past six years, no Acquired Entity
has participated in a transaction that has been specifically identified by

any penalty amnesty program.

  

#### (v) _Golden Parachute Agreements_. Except with respect to the Phantom
Stock Agreements, no Acquired Entity is a party to any agreement, contract or
plan that, as a result of the Closing, could result, separately or in the
aggregate, in the payment of (i) any "excess parachute payment" within the
meaning of Code Section 280G (or any corresponding provision of federal,
state, local or foreign Tax law) or (ii) any amount that will not be fully
deductible as a result of Code Section 162(m) (or any corresponding provision
of state, local or foreign Tax law).

  

#### (vi) _Arrangement Constituting a Partnership_. No Acquired Entity is
subject to any joint venture, partnership or other arrangement or contract
that is treated as a partnership for federal or applicable state income tax
purposes or for any other Tax purposes.

  

#### (vii) _Tax Attributes_. Schedule 4.17(f)(vii) sets forth the estimated
amount of any net operating loss, net capital loss, unused investment,
foreign tax or other credit, or excess charitable contribution allocable to
any Acquired Entity as of December 31, 2005.

(b) results from any activity undertaken after the Closing Date, of the
Sellers or any entity in which it has an investment, including any business

### (b) To make claim for indemnification, an Indemnified Party shall notify
the Indemnifying Party of its Claim, including the specific details of and
specific basis under this Agreement for its Claim (the "Claim Notice"). In
the event that the claim for indemnification is based upon a Claim by a third
party against the Indemnified Party (a "Third Party Claim"), the Indemnified
Party shall provide its Claim Notice promptly after the Indemnified Party has
actual knowledge of the Third Party Claim and shall enclose a copy of all
papers (if any) served with respect to the Third Party Claim; _provided_
 that the failure of any Indemnified Party to give notice of a Third Party
Claim as provided herein shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
obligations under this Agreement except to the extent such failure results in
insufficient time being available to permit the Indemnifying Party to
effectively defend against the Third Party Claim or otherwise materially
prejudices the Indemnifying Partys ability to defend against the Third Party
Claim or increases the amount of liability or cost of defense. In the event
that the claim for indemnification is based upon an Breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, the Claim Notice shall
specify the representation, warranty, covenant or agreement which was
Breached;

  

### (c) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, by notice to the
Indemnified Party given not later than 30 days after receipt of the Claim
Notice, to assume the control of the compromise, settlement and defense of
the Third Party Claim, provided that such assumption shall, by its terms, be
without cost to the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party is authorized,
prior to and during such 30-day period, to file any motion, answer or other
pleading that it shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect its interests
or those of the Indemnifying Party and that is not prejudicial to the
Indemnifying Party;

  

### (d) Upon the assumption of control of any Third Party Claim by the
Indemnifying Party on the basis provided herein, the Indemnifying Party shall
diligently proceed with the defense, compromise or settlement of the Third
Party Claim, including, the employment of counsel satisfactory to the
Indemnifying Party and, in connection therewith, the Indemnified Party shall:
(i) cooperate fully and to make available to the Indemnifying Party all
pertinent information, documents and witnesses under the Indemnified Partys
control; and (ii) make such assignments and take such other steps as on the
advice of counsel for the Indemnifying Party are reasonably necessary to
enable the Indemnifying Party to conduct such defense;

  

### (e) Notwithstanding any other provision contained herein, the Indemnified
Party, at its sole expense, shall have the right to participate in the
negotiation, settlement and defense of any Third Party Claim and the
Indemnifying Party shall not negotiate, settle, compromise or pay any Third
Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party; such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed;

  

### (f) Should the Indemnifying Party fail to give notice to the Indemnified
Party in accordance with Section 8.5(d) above, the Indemnified Party shall
diligently proceed with the defense, compromise or settlement of the Third
Party Claim, and, in connection therewith, the Indemnifying Party shall, at
its sole expense, cooperate fully to make available to the Indemnified Party
all pertinent information and witnesses under the Indemnifying Partys
control

     

   

### and (ii) make such assignments and take such other steps as on the advice
of counsel for the Indemnified Party are reasonably necessary to conduct such
defense. Notwithstanding any other provision contained herein, the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in the negotiation,
settlement and defense of any Third Party Claim, at its sole expense, and
under no circumstance shall the Indemnified Party negotiate,
settle, compromise or pay (except in the case of payment of a judgment) any
Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying
Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed; and

  

### (g) In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a Third
Party Claim (a "Direct Claim"), the Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days
from its receipt of the Claim Notice to (i) cure the Adverse Consequences
that form the substance of the Claim; (ii) admit its liability for such
Adverse Consequences or (iii) dispute the Claim for such Adverse
Consequences. If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party
within such 30-day period that it has cured the Adverse Consequences or that
it disputes the Claim for such Adverse Consequences, the amount of such
Adverse Consequences shall conclusively be deemed a liability of the
Indemnifying Party hereunder. The Indemnified Party shall cooperate fully to
make available to the Indemnifying Party all pertinent information, documents
and witnesses under the Indemnified Partys control. The Indemnified
Party shall not be entitled to the payment of any of its expenses in this
regard from the Escrow Amount until the outcome of such proceedings is known
and the obligation of the Indemnifying Party is determined.

  

## ** _Section 8.6_** ** _ Determination of Adverse Consequences._**
All indemnification payments under this Article VIII shall be deemed
adjustments to the Purchase Price except as required by applicable Legal
Requirements.

  

## ** _Section 8.7_** ** _ Excluded Damages._** Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, no Indemnified Party shall be entitled to any
consequential damages including exemplary, punitive, incidental, indirect or
special damages (collectively, "Excluded Damages") suffered by an Indemnified
Party except to the extent such Excluded Damages were incurred by a third
party and are the subject of a Third-Party Claim asserted by that third-party
after the Closing Date, and Buyer hereby releases Seller, and Seller hereby
releases Buyer, in each case to the fullest extend applicable law permits,
from liabilities for all Excluded Damages.

  

## ** _Section 8.8_** ** _ Scope of Representations and Warranties of
Sellers._  THE BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY
PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE SELLERS HAVE NOT MADE AND THE SELLERS HEREBY
EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY NATURE, WHETHER
EXPRESS, IMPLIED, AT COMMON LAW, BY STATUTE OR OTHERWISE. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY
PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE SELLERS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM AND NEGATE, AND
THE BUYER HEREBY WAIVES, AS TO PERSONAL PROPERTY, EQUIPMENT AND FIXTURES
CONSTITUTING A PART OF THE ASSETS OWNED OR OPERATED BY THE ACQUIRED ENTITIES:
(A) ANY IMPLIED OR EXPRESS WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY; (B) ANY IMPLIED OR
EXPRESS WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE; AND (C) ANY AND ALL
IMPLIED WARRANTIES EXISTING UNDER APPLICABLE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS. THE SELLERS
AND THE BUYER AGREE THAT, TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
LEGAL REQUIREMENTS TO BE EFFECTIVE, THE DISCLAIMERS OF THE WARRANTIES
CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION 8.8 ARE CONSPICUOUS.**

     

   

## ** _Section 8.9_** ** _ Exclusive Remedy._** Except in respect of any
claims based on fraud involving a knowing and intentional misrepresentation
of a material fact: (a) the indemnities provided for in this Article VIII
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of any Person after the Closing with
respect to, matters arising out of, or resulting from this Agreement
(including, without limitation, for any Breach of this Agreement or
contribution, cost recovery or other claim under any Environmental Law,
whether such action is brought in tort, contract or otherwise); (b) each
Party covenants and agrees that following the Closing it shall not seek or
assert any other remedy hereunder; and (c) each Party specifically waives and
releases the other Parties from any Liability and any rights it might
otherwise have pursuant to law except as provided for in this Article VIII.
Any claims by a party for a breach by another Party of such second Partys
obligations under Section 2.4 above shall not be subject to the limitations
set forth in this Article VIII.

  

## ** _Section 8.10_** ** _ Mitigation of Damages and Minimization of
Claims._** The Buyer and the Sellers agree to use all reasonable commercial
efforts to: (a) resolve all Third Party Claims and Direct Claims for which
indemnification is sought under this Article VIII on the lowest cost basis
that complies with the requirements of Applicable Laws; and (b) mitigate the
costs and expenses as well as any Adverse Consequences arising out of any
Third Party Claim or Direct Claim.

## ** _Section 10.8_** ** _ Governing Law._** _ _This Agreement shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the domestic laws of the State
of Texas without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or
rule (whether of the State of Texas or any other jurisdiction) that would
cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
Texas.

  

## ** _Section 10.9_** ** _ Amendments and Waivers._** No amendment of any
provision of this Agreement shall be valid unless the same shall be in
writing and signed by the Buyer and the Seller. No waiver by any Party of
any default, misrepresentation, or Breach of warranty or covenant hereunder,

subsequent default, misrepresentation, or Breach of warranty or
covenant hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any
prior or subsequent such occurrence.

  

## ** _Section 10.10_** ** _ Severability._** Any term or provision of this
Agreement that is invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any
jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining

jurisdiction.

  

## ** _Section 10.11_** ** _ Expenses._** Except as otherwise provided
herein, each of the Parties will bear its own costs and expenses (including
legal fees and expenses) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. The Sellers agree that, except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Corporation has not borne or will

## ** _Section 10.12_** ** _ Construction._** The Parties have participated
jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement.  In the event an
ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement
shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or
burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of
the authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement. Any reference to
any federal, state, local, or foreign statute or law shall be deemed also to
refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless

     

   

## the context requires otherwise. The word "including" shall mean including
without limitation.  The Parties intend that each representation, warranty,
and covenant contained herein shall have independent significance. The word
"pending" shall mean, with respect to a Proceeding, the receipt of a notice
of a Proceeding by an Acquired Entity. If any Party has Breached
any representation, warranty, or covenant contained herein in any respect,
the fact that there exists another representa­tion, warranty, or covenant
relating to the same subject matter (regardless of the relative levels of
specificity) which the Party has not Breached shall not detract from or
mitigate the fact that the Party is in Breach of the first representation,
warranty, or covenant. Matters disclosed by the Sellers in any exhibit or
schedule to this Agreement shall be deemed disclosed as to all portions of
this Agreement and shall qualify all such portions of the Agreement, without
being restricted to the express provisions that they are identified as
excepting. Any waiver or consent may be given subject to satisfaction of
conditions stated therein and any waiver or consent shall be effective only
in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given.

  

## ** _Section 10.13_** ** _ Incorporation of Exhibits and Schedules._** The
Exhibits and Schedules (as may be added, modified, supplemented or amended in
accordance with Section 5.6) identified in this Agreement are incorporated
herein by reference and made a part hereof.

  

## ** _Section 10.14_** ** _ Specific Performance_**. Each of the Parties
acknowledges and agrees that the other Parties would be damaged irreparably
in the event any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or otherwise are Breached.
 Accordingly, each of the Parties agrees that the other Parties shall
be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent Breaches of the
provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and
the terms and provisions hereof in any action instituted in any court of the
United States or any state thereof having jurisdiction over the Parties and
the matter (subject to the provisions set forth in Section 10.15 below), in
addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled, at law or in
equity.

  

## ** _Section 10.15_** ** _ Submission to Jurisdiction._** Each of the
Parties submits to the jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in
Harris County, Texas, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating
to this Agreement and agrees that all claims in respect of the action or
proceeding may be heard and determined in any such court. Each of the
Parties waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of
any action or proceeding so brought and waives any bond, surety, or other
security that might be required of any other Party with respect thereto. Any
Party may make service on any other Party by sending or delivering a copy of
the process to the Party to be served at the address and in the manner
provided for the giving of notices in Section 10.7 above. Nothing in this
Section 10.14, however, shall affect the right of any Party to bring any
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any
other court or to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law or
at equity. Each Party agrees that a final judgment in any action or
proceeding so brought shall be conclusive and may be enforced by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by law or at equity.
