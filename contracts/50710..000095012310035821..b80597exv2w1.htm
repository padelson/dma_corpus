 _THE OFFER_  

   

Section 2.01 _The Offer_. 

   

 (a) Provided that this Agreement has not been terminated in accordance with _Section 10.01_ , as promptly as practicable but in no event later than five (5) Business Days after the date of this Agreement, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, commence the Offer in accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "), and the terms and conditions of this Agreement. 

   

 (b) The Offer shall initially expire at 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on the twentieth (20th) Business Day following the date of the commencement of the Offer. If, as of the initial expiration date of the Offer or any extension thereof in accordance with this _Section 2.01(b)_, any of the conditions set forth in _Exhibit A_ are not satisfied, or waived by Parent (in its sole discretion and to the extent permitted under this Agreement), then Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, extend the Offer for one or more additional ten (10) Business Day periods until the earlier of (i) the date on which the conditions set forth in _Exhibit A_ are satisfied, or waived by Parent (in its sole discretion and to the extent permitted under this Agreement) or (ii) the date on which this Agreement is terminated in accordance with  _Section 10.01_. In addition, Merger Sub may, and Parent may cause Merger Sub to, without the consent of the Company and in its sole discretion, extend the Offer (i) for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") or the staff thereof or the NYSE Amex LLC (" _Amex_ ") applicable to the Offer and (ii) after acceptance for payment of shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer, for a further period of time not to exceed twenty (20) Business Days by means of a subsequent offering period pursuant to Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act. 

   

 (c) The obligation of Parent to cause Merger Sub to accept for payment and pay for any shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be subject to the satisfaction of each of the conditions set forth in _Exhibit A_ (any of which may be waived by the Buyer Parties in their sole discretion, except that the Minimum Tender Condition may not be waived) and to the other conditions in this Agreement. The Buyer Parties expressly reserve the right to modify the terms of the Offer, except that without the consent of the Company, the Buyer Parties shall not (i) reduce the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Offer, (ii) reduce the Offer Price, (iii) modify or add to the conditions set forth in _Exhibit A_, (iv) except as provided in _Section 2.01(b)_ , extend the Offer, (v) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, or (vi) otherwise amend the Offer in any manner adverse to the holders of Company Common Stock or that would individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Offer or prevent, materially delay or impair the ability of the Buyer Parties to consummate the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Nothing contained in this _Section 2.01(c)_ (but otherwise subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement) shall limit or 

   ##### 

  

   

restrict the ability of Parent to cause Merger Sub, and for Merger Sub, to
increase the Offer Price and in connection therewith to extend the period of
time during which the Offer remains open for acceptance as required by any
rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or the staff thereof
or of Amex; provided, however, that any such increase in the Offer Price
shall be in increments of at least $0.05. If immediately following
the Acceptance Time (as defined in _Section 8.03(a)_), Parent, Merger Sub
and their respective subsidiaries and Affiliates own more than 80% but less
than 90% of the shares of Company Common Stock outstanding at that time
(which shares beneficially owned shall include shares tendered in the Offer
and not withdrawn) and the exercise of the Top-Up Option would not result in
the number of Top-Up Option Shares, when added to the number of shares
of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by Merger Sub, constituting more
than 90% of the then outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (calculated
after giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares), to the
extent requested by the Company, Merger Sub shall provide for a subsequent
offering period of at least ten (10) Business Days. The Offer may be
terminated prior to its expiration date (as such expiration date may
be extended and re-extended in accordance with this Agreement) only if this
Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with its terms. 

   

 (d) On the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer and this Agreement, Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, pay for all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer that Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer as soon as practicable and in any event no more than two (2) Business Days after the expiration of the Offer. Merger Sub may, at any time, transfer or assign to one or more Subsidiaries of Parent the right to purchase all or any portion of the shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer, but any such transfer or assignment shall not relieve Parent or Merger Sub of its respective obligations under the Offer or prejudice the rights of tendering stockholders to receive payment for shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and accepted for payment. Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub on a timely basis the funds necessary to purchase any and all shares of Company Common Stock that Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer. 

   

 (e) On the date of commencement of the Offer, the Buyer Parties shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer, which shall contain an offer to purchase, a related form of letter of transmittal, a summary advertisement and ancillary documents and instruments pursuant to which the Offer will be made (such Schedule TO and the documents included therein pursuant to which the Offer shall be made, together with any supplements or amendments thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "), and shall cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with applicable federal securities Laws. The Offer Documents shall comply as to form in all material respects with the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and other applicable Laws, rules and regulations.

in writing with a copy of any written comments and telephonic notification of
any oral comments Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel may receive from the
SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after the
receipt of such comments, shall consult with the Company and its counsel
prior to responding to any such comments and shall provide the Company and
its counsel with a copy of any written response and telephonic notification

   #####

authority to institute any action, on behalf of the Company and the holders
of Company Common Stock not affiliated with Parent (including at the request
of such holders), to enforce the performance of this Agreement. 

   

Section 2.04 _Top-Up Option_. 

   

 (a) On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this _Section 2.04_, the Company hereby grants Merger Sub an irrevocable option (the " _Top-Up Option_ ") to purchase at a price per share equal to the Offer Price that number of shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ") equal to the lowest number of shares of Company Common Stock that, when added to the number of shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by Merger Sub at the time of such exercise, constitutes one share more than ninety percent (90%) of the then outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, calculated after giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares. 

   

 (b) The number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option may not exceed the number of then authorized but unissued shares of Company Common Stock. Merger Sub shall not be permitted to exercise the Top-Up Option if (i) as a result of the foregoing limitation, the number of Top-Up Option Shares, when added to the number of shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by Merger Sub, would constitute less than 90% of the then outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, calculated after giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares, (ii) any provision of applicable Law or any judgment, injunction, order or decree of any governmental authority shall prohibit such exercise, or require any action, consent, approval, authorization or permit of, action by, or filing with or notification to, any governmental authority in connection with such exercise or the delivery of Top-Up Option Shares, if such action, consent, approval, authorization, permit, filing or notification has not theretofore been obtained or made, (iii) the issuance of Top-Up Option Shares pursuant to the Top-Up Option would require approval of the Company Stockholders under applicable laws, rules or regulations (including, without limitation, the Amex rules and regulations to the extent that the Merger does not become effective on the same Business Day as the exercise of the Top-Up Option) or (iv) the conditions set forth in _Sections 9.01(b)_ and _(c)_ are not satisfied at the time of the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares. 

   

 (c) The Top-Up Option may be exercised, in whole but not in part, during the ten (10) Business Day period commencing as of the Acceptance Time. 

   

 (d) If Merger Sub determines to exercise the Top-Up Option, it shall deliver a written notice of exercise to the Company setting forth (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that are expected to be owned by Merger Sub immediately prior to the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares and (ii) the place and time for the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares (the " _Top-Up Closing_ "). Merger Subs notice shall include an undertaking by Merger Sub to consummate the Merger within three (3) Business Days after the date of the Top-Up Closing. The Company shall, 

   ##### 

  

   

as soon as practicable following receipt of such notice, notify Merger Sub in
writing of the number of shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding and
the number of Top-Up Option Shares. The aggregate purchase price payable for
the shares of Company Common Stock being purchased by Merger Sub pursuant to
the Top-Up Option shall be determined by multiplying the number of such
shares then subject to the Top-Up Option by the Offer Price. Such purchase
price shall be paid by Merger Sub by paying in cash an amount equal to
the aggregate par value of such shares, which shall be allocated to the
Companys stated (or "paid-in") capital account, and by executing and
delivering to the Company a promissory note having a principal amount equal
to the balance of such purchase price, which balance shall be allocated to
the Companys "additional capital" account. Such promissory note shall
bear interest per annum at the prime lending rate as announced from time to
time by JP Morgan Chase and in effect on the date such promissory note is
made, shall mature and become due and payable on the first Business Day
following the Merger Effective Time and may be prepaid without premium or
penalty. At the Top-Up Closing, Merger Sub shall pay the Company
the aggregate purchase price for the Top-Up Option Shares and the Company
shall cause to be issued to Merger Sub or its designee a certificate
representing the Top-Up Option Shares. 

   

 (e) The Buyer Parties acknowledge and agree that the shares of Company Common Stock that Merger Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option shall not be registered under the Securities Act and shall be issued in reliance upon an exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offer. Merger Sub is, or shall be upon the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, an "accredited investor" as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act. Merger Sub agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Option Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and shall be acquired by Merger Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for, resale in connection with any distribution thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act. 

   

 (f) Merger Sub agrees that the share certificates evidencing the Top-Up Option Shares may, at the Companys election, include the following legend: 

  

 "THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND MAY NOT BE SOLD, PLEDGED OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 OR ANY EXEMPTION THEREFROM."

 _EFFECTS OF THE MERGER_  

  

 Section 4.01 _Effects of the Merger on Company Securities_.

 (b) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time (except as otherwise provided in _Section 4.01(a)_), shall be converted and exchanged automatically into the right to receive $2.20 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). The shares of Company Common Stock whether in the form of a certificate (a " _Company Common Share Certificate_ ") or book-entry share (a " _Book-Entry Share_ ") that are to be so converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration are referred to herein as the " _Merger Shares_ ". From and after the Merger Effective Time, all such Merger Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of any Merger Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor, without interest thereon, upon the surrender of such Merger Shares in accordance with _Section 4.05_. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 4.01(b)_, shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time that are held by persons who have complied in all respects with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to such shares (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 4.01(b)_ but instead the holders of such Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL;  _provided_ that Dissenting Shares held by any person who waives, withdraws, fails to perfect or otherwise loses the right to payment of the fair value of such shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall be treated as if such shares had been converted into the Merger Consideration as of the Merger Effective Time in accordance with the provisions of  _Section 4.01(b)_. The Company shall promptly notify Parent in writing of any claim or demand by any holder of Company Common Stock seeking to exercise dissenters rights 

   #####

such claim or demand. The Company shall not settle or offer to settle any
such claim or demand without the prior written consent of Parent. 

  

 Section 4.02 _Treatment of Company Stock Options_. 

   

 (a) Each Company Stock Option that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall vest in full and be canceled and terminated and converted at the Merger Effective Time into the right to receive a cash amount equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock then subject to such Company Stock Option and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, less any required withholding taxes. 

   

 (b) At the Merger Effective Time, all of the Company Stock Plans effective at or prior to the Merger Effective Time shall be terminated and of no further force or effect. 

   

 (c) Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall take commercially reasonable actions to ensure that the Company shall not, at the Merger Effective Time, be bound by any options, stock appreciation rights, or other rights or agreements which would entitle any Person, other than Parent and its Subsidiaries, to own any capital stock of the Surviving Corporation or to receive any payment in respect thereof. 

   

 (d) The Company shall take commercially reasonable actions to cause all dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including Company Stock Options) by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.

If such Offering Period is still in effect on the ESPP Termination Date, then on the ESPP Termination Date, each purchase right under the ESPP as of the ESPP 

   ##### 

  

   

Termination Date shall be automatically exercised by applying the payroll
deductions of each participant in the ESPP for such Offering Period to the
purchase of a number of whole shares of Company Common Stock (subject to the
provisions of the ESPP regarding the number of shares purchasable) at an
exercise price per share determined pursuant to the terms of the ESPP using
the ESPP Termination Date as the Purchase Date (as defined in the
ESPP), which number of shares will then be converted and exchanged
automatically into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with _Section 4.01(b)_ hereof. Any excess payroll deductions not
used as a result of ESPP share limitations shall be distributed to each
participant without interest. If a fractional number of shares of Company
Common Stock results, then such number shall be rounded down to the next
whole number, and the excess payroll deductions shall be distributed to the
applicable participant without interest. 

   

 (b) Prior to the Merger Effective Time, the Company shall take commercially reasonable actions to provide holders of each outstanding and unexercised Company Warrant with written notice of the Merger, including the effect of the Merger on such Company Warrant, and to the extent permitted pursuant to the applicable Company Warrant, to cause each outstanding and unexercised Company Warrant to be cancelled as of the Merger Effective Time in exchange for the right to receive with respect to each share of Company Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such Company Warrant an amount in cash equal to (i) the Merger Consideration minus (ii) the exercise price per share of Company Common stock provided under the terms of such Company Warrant; _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to that certain Black Scholes Warrant, the Buying Parties shall comply with Section 3(b) thereof. 

   

 (c) Any share of, or any right to a share of, Company Common Stock held by any participant in or under any Company Stock Plan that is, prior to the Merger Effective Time, unvested or otherwise restricted or deferred (if any) shall, immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, become vested and in the case of any such right the shares of Company Common Stock to be paid thereunder shall be distributed prior to the Merger Effective Time, and thereafter such unrestricted shares of Company Common Stock shall be treated in the manner described in _Section 4.01(b)_ above. 

  

 Section 4.04 _Effects of the Merger on Merger Sub Securities_. At the Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action by Merger Sub or Parent, as the holder of all outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub (other than the requisite approval by the sole stockholder of Merger Sub in accordance with the DGCL, which approval has been obtained), each outstanding share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 Section 4.05 _Payment of Merger Consideration; Stock Transfer Books_. 

   

 (a) Prior to the Merger Effective Time, Parent shall appoint as exchange agent a bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ ").

At or prior to the Merger Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause the
Surviving Corporation to deposit with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the
benefit of the holders of Merger Shares, sufficient cash to satisfy (i) the
aggregate Merger Consideration due and payable upon surrender of the
Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this _Article IV_ and (ii) if
requested by the Company, the aggregate amounts payable to the holders
of Company Stock Options and Company Warrants in accordance with _Sections
4.02_ and  _4.03_ of this Agreement. All cash deposited with the Exchange
Agent shall be hereinafter referred to as the " _Surviving Corporation Fund_
". The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver
the Merger Consideration contemplated to be paid pursuant to the provisions
of this _Article IV_ out of the Surviving Corporation Fund. The Surviving
Corporation Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The fees and
expenses of the Exchange Agent shall be paid by Parent. The Exchange
Agent shall invest the Surviving Corporation Fund in (i) direct obligations
of the United States of America, (ii) obligations for which the full faith
and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide for payment
of all principal and interest, (iii) commercial paper obligations receiving
the highest rating from either Moodys Investor Services, Inc. or Standard and
Poors, a division of The McGraw Hill Companies or (iv) money market
funds investing solely in a combination of the foregoing, or a combination
thereof, as directed by and for the benefit of the Surviving Corporation;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no gain or loss thereon shall affect the
amounts payable hereunder and the Parent shall take all actions necessary to
ensure that the Surviving Corporation Fund includes at all times cash
sufficient to satisfy the Buyer Parties obligation under this Agreement. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be the

 (b) As promptly as practicable after the Merger Effective Time, but in no event more than three (3) Business Days following the Merger Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each person who was, as of immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, a holder of record of the Merger Shares (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Merger Shares shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Merger Shares to the Exchange Agent) and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Merger Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. 

   

 (c) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of Merger Shares for cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of such Merger Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check drawn by the Exchange Agent or a bank cashiers check in the amount that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this  _Article IV_. The Merger Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. The Exchange Agent shall accept such Merger Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. 

   

 (d) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Merger Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration 

   ##### 

  

   

in respect of the applicable Merger Shares may be made to a person other than
the person in whose name the Merger Shares so surrendered is registered if
such Merger Shares shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form
for transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration in
respect thereof or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 4.05_, each Merger Share shall
be deemed at all times after the Merger Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender or transfer the Merger Consideration,
subject to _Section 4.08_ hereof. No interest shall be paid or will accrue
on the Merger Consideration payable to holders of Merger Shares pursuant to
the provisions of this _Article IV_, irrespective of the time when such
Merger Shares are surrendered for exchange. 

   

 (e) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, any portion of the Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed two (2) years after the Merger Effective Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Authority) shall, to the extent permitted by Law, become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. None of Parent, the Exchange Agent or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of Merger Shares for any such shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto), or cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

   

 (f) Any portion of the Surviving Corporation Fund made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section 4.05(a)_ to pay for shares of Company Common Stock for which appraisal rights have been perfected shall be returned to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, upon demand by Parent. 

   

 (g) If any Company Common Share Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Company Common Share Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall pay in respect of Merger Shares to which such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Common Share Certificate relate the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled. 

   

 (h) At the Merger Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of Merger Shares thereafter on the records of the Company. From and after the Merger Effective Time, the holders of Merger Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, or by applicable Law. 

  

 Section 4.06 _Withholding Rights_. The Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Stock Options or such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, and the rules and regulations 

   ##### 

  

 

promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock or Company Stock Options in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as applicable. 

   

 Section 4.07 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that, notwithstanding  _Section 7.01(d)_, the Company changes (or establishes a record date for changing) the number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Merger Effective Time as a result of a stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or similar transaction with respect to shares of the Company Common Stock, at any time during the period from the date hereof to the Merger Effective Time, then the Offer Price and the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted, taking into account the record and payment or effective dates, as the case may be, for such transaction.

negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate
order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of any assets or

 (d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties contained in this _Section 8.06_, if any administrative or judicial Action, including any proceeding by Governmental Authority or a private party, is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging the Offer, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, as violative of any Regulatory Law or otherwise, each of the Company 

   #####

respective reasonable best efforts to defend against, contest and resist any
such Action and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or

contemplated hereby. The Company shall, and shall cause its legal counsel to,
cooperate with Parent and its legal counsel in connection with the defense of
any such Action and, without the prior written consent of Parent, shall not
enter into any settlement or other resolution of any such matter which calls
for aggregate payments by the Company and its Subsidiaries in excess of
$1,000,000 or which otherwise imposes a material restriction or limitation or
materially burdensome requirement on the conduct of the business of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the Merger Effective Time. The

Subsidiaries) or to take any other action that would have a Parent Material

 (c) all of the other representations and warranties of the Company contained in _Article V_ shall be true and correct (without giving effect to any limitation on any representation or warranty indicated by the words "Company Material Adverse Effect", "in all material respects", "in any material respect", "material" or "materially") as of the Determination Time, as though made as of the Determination Time (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date), except where the failure of any such representations and warranties to be so true and correct would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect;
