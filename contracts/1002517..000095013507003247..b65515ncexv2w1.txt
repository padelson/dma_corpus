other agreements in connection with the Merger.   E. Concurrent with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a material inducement to Parent
and Sub to enter into this Agreement, all officers and directors of the
Company, and certain other affiliated stockholders of the Company are

Company or the holders of shares of Company Capital Stock, each outstanding
share of Company Capital Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior  
-6-    to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares (as defined in
SECTION 1.8(a) hereof)), upon the terms and subject to conditions set forth
in this SECTION 1.7 and throughout this Agreement, including, without
limitation, the escrow provisions set forth in ARTICLE VII hereof, will be

receive, upon surrender of the certificate representing such shares of
Company Capital Stock in the manner provided in SECTION 1.9 hereof, the
portions of the Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration to be
determined in accordance with the provisions set forth in EXHIBIT E attached
hereto. Both on the fifth (5th) day prior to the Closing and at the Closing,
the Vice President of Finance of the Company shall deliver to Parent a
calculation setting forth the portions of the Cash Consideration and the
Stock Consideration to which each holder of shares of Company Capital Stock
or of vested Company Options, in each case to the extent outstanding on the
date such calculation is delivered by the Vice President of Finance of the
Company, would be entitled at the Effective Time if such holder were to hold
all of such shares of Company Capital Stock or vested Company Options, as the
case may be, immediately prior to the Effective Time. Such calculations by
the Vice President of Finance of the Company shall be made by implementing
the provisions of EXHIBIT E attached hereto.   (b) REDUCTION FOR ESCROW
AMOUNT. Each distribution of the Cash Consideration made to a Stockholder
pursuant to this SECTION 1.7 shall be reduced by such Stockholder\'s Pro Rata
Portion of the Escrow Amount, if any, in accordance with SECTION 7.4
hereof.   (c) NO FRACTIONAL SHARES. No fraction of a share of Parent
Common Stock will be issued pursuant to the Merger, but in lieu thereof,
each Stockholder who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of
Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock to be received by such Stockholder) shall receive from Parent an amount
of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent) equal to the product of (i) such
fraction multiplied by (ii) the Signing Price.   (d) Notwithstanding
anything in this SECTION 1.7 to the contrary, in no event shall Parent be
obligated to distribute in the aggregate (i) cash in excess of the Cash
Consideration or (ii) shares of Parent Common Stock in excess of the Stock
Consideration.   (e) TREATMENT OF COMPANY OPTIONS.   (i) No Company Vested
Option shall be assumed or otherwise replaced by Parent. Each Company Vested
Option shall terminate and cease to be outstanding as of the Effective
Time.   (ii) The Company shall give to each holder of a Company
Vested Option the opportunity (of not more than 30 days) to decline to accept
a modification of such Company Vested Option such that, immediately prior to
the Effective Time, and conditioned on the consummation of the Merger, such
holder shall automatically (without any further action required of such
holder) be deemed to have exercised such Company Vested Option pursuant to a
net exercise program whereby such holder will be deemed to have paid the
aggregate exercise price for such   -7-   Company Vested Option by
relinquishing that number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such
option in an amount necessary to pay the applicable aggregate exercise price
and any applicable withholding taxes associated with such net exercise of
such Company Vested Option. The number of shares of Company Common Stock
deemed delivered to the holder of each Company Vested Option pursuant to this
net exercise program shall be determined by subtracting the Net Exercise
Consideration (as defined below) applicable to such Company Vested Option
from the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Vested Option. The holder of each such Company Vested Option shall
from and after the Effective Time (A) participate in the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in the same manner, and to the same extent, as
if at the Effective Time such holder owned that number of shares of Company
Common Stock delivered after the automatic deemed net exercise pursuant to
this Section 1.7(ii) and (B) receive, if applicable, the Fractional Share
Payment (as defined below). As soon as practicable following the filing of
the Registration Statement and in compliance with applicable securities laws,
the Company shall provide to each holder of any Company Option an
informational notice and consent describing the treatment of Company Vested
Options pursuant to this Section 1.7.   (iii) Parent shall, at its sole
discretion and pursuant to a written election of Parent made prior to the
Closing, either (A) assume every Company Unvested Option in accordance with
the terms set forth below in this Section 1.7(iii) or (B) cause all such
Company Unvested Options to vest and terminate (each referred to herein as a
"CASHED OUT OPTION") and make a cash payment to the holder of each such
Cashed Out Option in an amount equal to (x) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock underlying all Company Unvested Options held by such holder
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (y) the Per Share
Amount and minus (z) the aggregate amount necessary to exercise all of the
Company Unvested Options held by such holder. If Parent elects to vest and
terminate all Company Unvested Options in accordance with the foregoing
provisions of this Section 1.7(iii), Parent shall make the cash payment
required pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 1.7(iii) to
each holder of Company Unvested Options no later than the second Business
Day after the Closing. If Parent elects to assume all Company Unvested
Options in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 1.7(iii),
(i) each such assumed Company Unvested Option shall thereby be converted into
an option (an "ASSUMED OPTION") to purchase the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of Company Common
Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Company Unvested Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Company Option
Exchange Ratio (as defined below), rounded down to the nearest whole number
of shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) the per share exercise price for
the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Assumed
Option shall be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the per share
exercise price of the Company Unvested Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time by the Company Option Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the
nearest whole cent. Each Assumed Option shall continue to be subject to the
same vesting schedule following the Effective Time as to which it was subject
prior to the Effective Time and shall also have the same terms and conditions
set forth in the applicable Company Unvested Option (including any applicable
award agreement or other documents evidencing such security). Notwithstanding
the provisions of the immediately preceding   -8-    sentence, in the

Consideration" by (B) the Per Share Amount.   -9-     (7) "GOOD REASON"

expenses) of the Stockholder Representative incurred in connection with this
Agreement (the "STOCKHOLDER REPRESENTATIVE FUND"), with any balance of the
Stockholder Representative Fund not incurred for such purposes to be returned
to the Stockholders when the Stockholder Representative shall deem it
appropriate to do so. In the event that the Stockholder Representative Fund
shall be insufficient to satisfy the expenses of the Stockholder
Representative, and in the event there are any remaining funds in the Escrow
Fund to be distributed to the Stockholders immediately prior to the final
distribution from the Escrow Fund to the Stockholders pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement, the Stockholder Representative shall be entitled to recover any
such expenses from the Escrow Fund to the extent of such funds prior to

all interest or other income earned from the investment of the
Stockholder Representative Fund shall be reported as allocated to the
Stockholders in proportion to their interests in the Stockholder
Representative Fund. Each Stockholder shall deliver to the Stockholder
Representative a properly executed IRS Form W-9 or appropriate IRS Form
W-8.   1.8 DISSENTING SHARES.   -11-     (a) RIGHT TO DISSENT.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, any
shares of Company Capital Stock held by a holder who has not voted for the
Merger, or who has not effectively withdrawn or lost such holder\'s appraisal
rights under Delaware Law (collectively, the "DISSENTING SHARES") shall not
be converted into or represent a right to receive the applicable
consideration for Company Capital Stock set forth in SECTION 1.7 hereof, but
the holder thereof shall only be entitled to such rights as are provided by
Delaware Law.   (b) WITHDRAWAL OF APPRAISAL RIGHTS. Notwithstanding the
provisions of SECTION 1.8(a) hereof, if any holder of Dissenting Shares shall
effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) such
holder\'s appraisal rights under Delaware Law, then, as of the later of the
Effective Time and the occurrence of such event, such holder\'s shares shall
automatically be converted into and represent only the right to receive the
consideration for Company Capital Stock, as applicable, set forth in SECTION
1.7 hereof, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate
representing such shares.   (c) DISSENTING SHARE PAYMENTS. The Company shall
give Parent and the Stockholder Representative prompt notice of any written
demand for appraisal received by the Company pursuant to the applicable
provisions of Delaware Law. Parent shall have the opportunity to participate
in (but not control) all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands. All such negotiations and proceedings and all decisions related
thereto shall be controlled by the Stockholder Representative. None of
Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation shall, except with the prior
written consent of the Stockholder Representative not to be unreasonably
withheld, make any payment with respect to any such demands or offer to
settle or settle any such demands. To the extent that Parent, the Company or
the Surviving Corporation (i) makes any payment or payments in respect of any
Dissenting Shares in excess of the consideration that otherwise would have
been payable in respect of such shares in accordance with this Agreement or
(ii) incurs any other costs or expenses, (including specifically, but without
limitation, attorneys\' fees, costs and expenses in connection with any
action or proceeding or in connection with any investigation) in respect of
any Dissenting Shares (excluding payments for such shares) (together
"DISSENTING SHARE PAYMENTS"), Parent shall be entitled to recover under the
terms of SECTION 7.2 hereof the amount of such Dissenting Share Payments
without regard to the Deductible or the Basket (as such terms are defined in
SECTION 7.5(a) hereof).   1.9 SURRENDER OF CERTIFICATES.   (a) EXCHANGE
AND PAYING AGENT. Parent, or an institution selected by Parent, shall serve
as the exchange and paying agent (Parent in such capacity, or such
institution, the "EXCHANGE AND PAYING AGENT") for the Merger to receive the
consideration to which the Stockholders are or may be entitled to pursuant to
this Agreement.   (b) PARENT TO PROVIDE CASH AND PARENT COMMON STOCK.
Subject to the provisions of SECTION 7.4 relating to escrow arrangements,
promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall make available to the
Exchange and Paying Agent for exchange in accordance with this ARTICLE I
the   -12-    shares of Parent Common Stock issuable and the cash
payable at the Effective Time pursuant to SECTION 1.7 hereof in exchange for
outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock; provided, however, that Parent
shall deposit into the Escrow Fund the Escrow Amount out of the Cash
Consideration otherwise deliverable to the Stockholders pursuant to SECTION
1.7 hereof. The Pro Rata Portion of the Escrow Amount shall be deemed to be
contributed with respect to each Stockholder entitled to receive a portion of
the Stock Consideration.   (c) EXCHANGE PROCEDURES. Approximately ten (10)
days prior to the date the parties expect to be the Closing Date, Parent or
the Exchange and Paying Agent shall mail a letter of transmittal to each
Stockholder at the address set forth opposite each such Stockholder\'s name
on SECTION 2.2(a) of the Disclosure Schedule. If requested by the Stockholder
Representative, Parent or the Exchange and Paying Agent, as the case may be,
will include with the letter of transmittal a copy of an agreement between
the Stockholder Representative and the Stockholders in the form provided by
the Stockholder Representative, with the request that each Stockholder sign
and return such agreement with the letter of transmittal; Parent or the
Exchange and Paying Agent, as the case may be, will promptly deliver to the
Stockholder Representative any such agreements which are returned to Parent
or the Exchange and Paying Agent by the Stockholders. At or as soon as
practicable following the Closing, the Stockholders will surrender the
certificates representing their shares of Company Capital Stock (the "COMPANY
STOCK CERTIFICATES") to the Exchange and Paying Agent for cancellation
together with a duly completed and validly executed letter of transmittal.
Upon surrender of a Company Stock Certificate for cancellation to the
Exchange and Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
subject to the terms of SECTION 1.9(f) hereof, the holder of such Company
Stock Certificate shall be entitled to receive from the Exchange and Paying
Agent in exchange therefor, the applicable portion of the
Merger Consideration pursuant to SECTION 1.7 hereof (less the Escrow Amount
to be deposited into the Escrow Fund with respect to such Stockholder, if
any), and the Company Stock Certificate so surrendered shall be cancelled.
Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that, if the Vice
President of Finance has delivered to Parent the calculation contemplated
under SECTION 1.7(a) hereof at least five (5) days prior to the Closing Date,
the Merger Consideration shall be delivered to Stockholders on the Closing
Date who have surrendered certificates representing their shares of Company
Capital Stock in accordance with the provisions of this SECTION 1.9(c). In
the event that, despite using commercially reasonable efforts, Parent is
unable to cause the Merger Consideration to delivered to such Stockholders on
the Closing Date, Parent shall nevertheless ensure that the Merger
Consideration is delivered to such Stockholders within three Business Days
after the Closing Date.   (d) Until so surrendered, each Company Stock
Certificate outstanding after the Effective Time will be deemed, for all
corporate purposes thereafter, to evidence only the right to receive the cash
amounts payable and/or Parent Common Stock issuable in exchange for shares of
Company Capital Stock (without interest) into which such shares of Company
Capital Stock shall have been so converted. No portion of the Merger
Consideration will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock
Certificate with respect to shares of Company Capital Stock formerly  
-13-   represented thereby until the holder of record of such Company Stock
Certificate shall surrender such Company Stock Certificate pursuant
hereto.   (e) DISTRIBUTIONS WITH RESPECT TO UNEXCHANGED SHARES. No
dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time
with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective
Time will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock
Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented
thereby until the holder of record of such Company Stock Certificate shall
surrender such Company Stock Certificate. Subject to applicable Laws,
following surrender of any such Company Stock Certificate, there shall be
paid to the record holder of the certificates representing whole shares of
Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, at the
time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such
whole shares of Parent Common Stock. No interest shall be payable on any cash
deliverable upon the exchange of any Company Capital Stock.   (f) TRANSFERS
OF OWNERSHIP. If any certificate for shares of Parent Common Stock is to be
issued in a name other than that in which the Company Stock Certificate
surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, or if any cash amounts are to
be disbursed pursuant to SECTION 1.7 hereof to person other than the person
whose name is reflected on the Company Stock Certificate surrendered in
exchange therefor, it will be a condition of the issuance or delivery
thereof that the certificate so surrendered will be properly endorsed and
otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such
exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent designated by it any transfer
or other Taxes (as defined in SECTION 2.11) required by reason of the
issuance of a certificate for shares of Parent Common Stock in any name other
than that of the registered holder of the certificate surrendered, or
established to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it that
such Tax has been paid or is not payable.   (g) EXCHANGE AND PAYING AGENT
TO RETURN CASH CONSIDERATION. At any time following the last day of the sixth
(6th) month following the Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to require
the Exchange and Paying Agent to deliver to Parent or its designated
successor or assign all cash amounts and shares of Parent Common Stock that
have been deposited with the Exchange and Paying Agent pursuant to SECTION
1.9(b) hereof, and any and all interest thereon or other income or proceeds
thereof, not disbursed to the holders of Company Stock Certificates pursuant
to SECTION 1.9(b) hereof, and thereafter the holders of Company Stock
Certificates shall be entitled to look only to Parent (subject to the terms
of SECTION 1.9(h) hereof) only as general creditors thereof with respect to
any and all amounts that may be payable to such holders of Company Stock
Certificates pursuant to SECTION 1.7 hereof upon the due surrender of
such Company Stock Certificates in the manner set forth in SECTION 1.9(b)
hereof.   (h) NO LIABILITY. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this SECTION 1.9, neither the Exchange and Paying Agent, the Surviving
Corporation, nor any party hereto shall be   -14-   liable to a holder
of shares of Company Capital Stock for any amount properly paid to a public
official as required by any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law.   1.10 NO FURTHER OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN COMPANY CAPITAL STOCK. The
cash amounts paid and Parent Common Stock issued in respect of the surrender
for exchange of shares of Company Capital Stock in accordance with the terms
hereof shall be deemed to be full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such shares of Company Capital Stock, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of
shares of Company Capital Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Company Stock Certificates
are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be
canceled and exchanged as provided in this ARTICLE I.   1.11 LOST, STOLEN
OR DESTROYED CERTIFICATES. In the event any Company Stock Certificates shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange and Paying Agent shall
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such amount, if
any, as may be required pursuant to SECTION 1.7 hereof; provided, however,
that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the
issuance thereof, require the Stockholder who is the owner of such lost,
stolen or destroyed certificates to either (i) deliver a bond in such amount
as it may reasonably direct or (ii) provide an unsecured
indemnification agreement in a form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Parent, against any claim that may be made against Parent or the Exchange and
Paying Agent with respect to the certificates alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed.   1.12 TAKING OF NECESSARY ACTION; FURTHER ACTION. If
at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or
desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the
Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets,
property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company, Parent,
Sub, and the officers and directors of the Company, Parent and Sub are fully
authorized in the name of their respective corporations or otherwise to take,
and will take, all such lawful and necessary action.   ARTICLE II

constitute a default on) on the part of the Company, or to the Company\'s
Knowledge, on the part of any other party thereto. The Company has not
received any notice of a default, alleged failure to perform, or any offset
or counterclaim with respect to any such Lease Agreement, that has not been
fully remedied and withdrawn.   (b) To the Company\'s Knowledge, the Leased
Real Property is in good operating condition and repair, free from

nor, to the Company\'s Knowledge, such Leased Real Property, including the
improvements thereon, violate in any material respect any applicable building
code, zoning requirement or Law relating to such property or operations
thereon, and any such non-violation is not dependent on so-called non-
conforming use exceptions.   (c) The Company has good and valid title to,

which do not detract from the value or interfere with the present use of the
property subject thereto or affected thereby.   (d) All facilities,
equipment and other properties owned, leased or used by the Company are (i)

maintained, subject to normal wear and tear.   2.14 INTELLECTUAL

all Intellectual Property and Intellectual Property Rights immediately

on the Intellectual Property Rights of any person. For avoidance of doubt,
"currently" as it is used in this SECTION 2.14(g), when measured as of the
Closing Date, shall mean both "at the Effective Time" and "immediately
following the Effective Time".   (h) No third party that has licensed
Intellectual Property or Intellectual Property Rights to the Company has

legal counsel) and (b) that include claims of infringement or

liability to the Company of more than one million dollars ($1,000,000) or
result (either directly or indirectly as a result of an injunction or
other   -27-   order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent)) in a
loss of more than one percent (1%) of the Company\'s annual revenues, the

technology or services currently under development) or Intellectual Property

agreement in substantially the Company\'s standard form. To the extent that

directly or indirectly, provided consideration for such development or
creation, the Company has a written Contract with such person with respect
thereto pursuant to the terms of which such person agrees that the Company

Intellectual Property therein and associated Intellectual Property
Rights.   (n) No Company Intellectual Property, Intellectual Property
Rights, product, technology, or service of the Company is subject to any
pending proceeding (other than the Parent/Company Litigation, as to which

transfer or   -28-    licensing thereof by the Company or may affect the
validity, use or enforceability of such Company Intellectual Property.  
(o) No government funding, facilities or resources of a university, college,
other educational institution or research center or funding from
third parties was used in the development of the Company Intellectual
Property and no Governmental Entity, university, college, other educational
institution or research center has any claim or right in or to the Company
Intellectual Property. To the Company\'s Knowledge, no current or former

other educational institution, or a research center, during a period of time
during which such Employee or independent contractor was also performing

provided by any other person to the Company. Without limiting the foregoing,
neither the Company nor any person acting on the Company\'s behalf
has disclosed, delivered or licensed to any person, agreed to disclose,
deliver or license to any person, or permitted the disclosure or delivery to
any escrow agent or other person of any source code or related proprietary or
confidential information or algorithms owned by the Company or used in its
business ("COMPANY SOURCE CODE"). No event has occurred, and no circumstance
or condition exists, that (with or without notice or lapse of time or both)
will, or would reasonably be expected to, result in the disclosure or
delivery by or on behalf of the Company of any Company Source Code.   (r)
SECTION 2.14(r) of the Disclosure Schedule lists all software or other
material that is distributed as "freeware," "free software," "open
source software" or under a similar licensing or distribution model
(including but not limited to the GNU General Public License) that the
Company uses or licenses, and identifies that which is incorporated into,
combined with, or distributed in conjunction with any Company products
("INCORPORATED OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE") and identifies the type of license or
distribution model governing its use. The Company\'s use and/or distribution
of each component of Incorporated Open Source Software complies with all
material provisions of the applicable license agreement, and in no case does
such use or distribution give rise under such license agreement to any rights
in any third parties under any Company Intellectual Property or obligations
for the Company with respect to any Company Intellectual Property, including
without limitation any obligation to disclose or distribute any such
Intellectual Property in source code form, to license any such Intellectual
Property for the purpose of making derivative works, or to distribute any
such Intellectual Property without charge.   -29-     (s)

Parent, solely for purposes of effecting the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby. Except as contemplated by this Agreement,
Sub does not hold, nor has it held, any material assets or incurred any
material liabilities nor has Sub   -40-   carried on any business
activities other than in connection with the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.   3.4 NO CONFLICT. The execution and
delivery by Parent and Sub of this Agreement and any Related Agreement to

contemplated hereby and thereby, will not conflict with or result in any
violation of or default (with or without notice of lapse of time, or both)
under (i) the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Parent or Sub, each
as amended to date and in full force and effect on the date hereof, or (ii)
assuming compliance with the matters referred to in SECTION 3.5, any Laws

exceeds its total liabilities (including contingent liabilities but without
duplication of any underlying liability related thereto). The present fair
saleable value on a going-concern basis of Parent\'s assets is not less than
the amount required to pay its probable liabilities on its debts as they
become absolute and mature. Parent does not intend to, and does not believe
that it will, incur debts or liabilities beyond its ability to pay as such
debts and liabilities mature. Parent is not engaged in business or a
transaction for which its property would constitute unreasonably small
capital.   3.7 PARENT COMMON STOCK. The Parent Common Stock that constitutes

shall the Company permit, as applicable, any of its officers, directors,
Employees, Stockholders, agents, representatives or affiliates to), directly
or indirectly, take any of the following actions with any party other than
Parent and its designees: (a) solicit, encourage, seek, entertain, support,
assist, initiate or participate in any inquiry, negotiations or discussions,
or enter into any Contract, with respect to any offer or proposal to acquire

(whether or not outstanding), whether by merger, purchase of assets, tender
offer, license or otherwise, or effect any such transaction, (b) disclose any

or any request for disclosure or access as referenced in clause (b) above,
the Company shall immediately (x) suspend any discussions with such offeror
or party with regard to such offers, proposals, or requests and (y) notify
Parent thereof, including information as to the identity of the offeror or
the party making any such offer or proposal and the specific terms of such

thereto as Parent may reasonably request. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that the provisions of this
SECTION 4.2 were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed by the parties hereto that
Parent shall be entitled to an immediate injunction or injunctions, without
the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy and
without the necessity of posting any bond or other security, to prevent
breaches of the provisions of this SECTION 4.2 and to enforce  
-48-   specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the
United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which Parent may be entitled at law or in equity. Without
limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the
restrictions set forth above by any officer, director, agent, Employee,
representative or affiliate of the Company shall be deemed to be a breach of
this Agreement by the Company.   4.3 PROCEDURES FOR REQUESTING PARENT

Parent, prior to taking such action the Company may request such written

Parent will use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registration

effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby.   -49-     (ii) The Company shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) obtain the Sufficient Stockholder
Vote approving this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger, and (ii) seek approval from the Stockholders, in
accordance with the requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, for
any payments and/or benefits that may separately or in the aggregate,
constitute "parachute payments" pursuant to Section 280G of the Code
("SECTION 280G PAYMENTS"), as determined by the Company, such that
such payments and benefits shall not be deemed to be Section 280G Payments,
either at a meeting of the Company\'s Stockholders or pursuant to a written
stockholder consent, all in accordance with Delaware Law and the Charter
Documents. In connection with such meeting of Stockholders or written

be subject to review and approval of Parent and shall also include the
unanimous recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Company in favor of
the Merger and this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and
the determination of the Company\'s Board of Directors that that the terms
and conditions of the Merger are fair to, and in the best interests of, the
Stockholders. Parent will promptly provide all information relating to its
business and operations necessary for inclusion in the Soliciting Materials
to satisfy all requirements of applicable state and federal securities Laws.
The Company shall cooperate and provide Parent (and its counsel) with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Soliciting Materials and
any amendment or supplement thereto prior submission of such materials to the
Stockholders.   (b) If the Company shall seek to obtain the Sufficient
Stockholder Vote by way of a meeting of the Stockholders, the Company shall
consult with Parent regarding the date of such meeting to approve this
Agreement and the Merger (the "COMPANY STOCKHOLDERS\' MEETING") and shall not
postpone or adjourn (other than for absence of a quorum or to the extent
necessary to ensure that any necessary supplement or amendment to the
Soliciting Materials is provided to its Stockholders in advance of the
Company Stockholders\' Meeting) the Company Stockholders\' Meeting without
the consent of Parent. In the event the Company shall seek to obtain the
Sufficient Stockholder Vote by written consent, immediately upon receipt of
written consents of its Stockholders constituting the Sufficient Stockholder
Vote, the Company shall deliver notice of the approval of the Merger by
written consent of the Company\'s Stockholders, pursuant to the applicable

include a copy of such Section 262), and shall promptly inform Parent of the
date on which the Stockholder Notice was sent. Notwithstanding the foregoing,

Stockholder will be able to exercise appraisal rights if such Stockholder has
not perfected such appraisal rights in accordance with Section 262 of
Delaware Law.   (c) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to

Disclosure Agreement and the New NDA. In this regard, the
Company acknowledges that the Parent Common Stock is publicly traded and that
any information obtained by Company regarding Parent could be considered to
be material non-public information within the meaning of federal and
state securities Laws. Accordingly, the Company acknowledges and agrees not

applicable insider trading Laws. All information disclosed to Parent or its
accountants, counsel, or other representatives, or to which any of them is
given access, shall be deemed covered by and subject to the provisions of the

SECTION 5.6 hereof, but excluding one-half of the $795,000 in transaction
bonuses disclosed on Section 2.10 of the Disclosure Schedule) incurred by a

legal, financial and other advisors providing services in connection with the
negotiation and effectuation of the terms   -51-   and conditions of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby reflecting such advisors\'

regarding the subject matter of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby without the consent of the other party, except that this
restriction shall be subject to Parent\'s obligation to comply
with applicable securities Laws and the rules of Nasdaq. If Parent believes
it has any obligation to make any such statement or communication, it will
first consult with the Company and will use commercially reasonable efforts
to minimize any adverse effect of such statement or communication.   5.6

consents, waivers and approvals which are listed in SECTION 2.5 of the
Disclosure Schedule under the caption "Material Third Party Consents"

consent, waiver or approval (including by threatening to exercise a
"recapture" or other termination right) upon the payment of a consent fee,
"profit sharing" payment or other consideration, including increased rent
payments or other payments under the Contract, the Company shall be
responsible for making all payments required to obtain such consent, waiver
or approval and such amounts shall be deemed Third Party Expenses under
SECTION 5.4 hereof.   5.7 FIRPTA COMPLIANCE. On the Closing Date, the
Company shall deliver to Parent a properly executed statement (a "FIRPTA

PARENT NOTIFICATION OF CERTAIN MATTERS. Parent shall use

employment of each such employee after the Closing. Parent will have no

to the reasonable review and approval of Parent. The Company also shall take
such other actions in furtherance of terminating such Company Employee
Plan(s) as Parent may reasonably require. In the event that termination of a

are necessary to reasonably estimate the amount of such charges and/or fees
and provide such estimate in writing to Parent no later than fifteen (15)
calendar days prior to the Closing Date and such charges and fees shall not

person benefited thereby, except to the extent that such modification is
required by law.   (b) After the Effective Time Parent and the Surviving
Corporation will, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law,
indemnify and hold harmless each present or former director or officer of the
Company (collectively, the "COMPANY INDEMNIFIED DandO; PERSONS") against any
costs or expenses (including attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection
with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,

as a director, officer, employee, or agent of the Company occurring prior to
the Effective Time (including without limitation actions or omissions
relating to this Agreement and/or the Merger) for a period of six years after
the date hereof. The right to indemnification hereunder will include the
right to advancement of expenses as incurred in connection with any
indemnifiable claim, in advance of any resolution thereof, subject to
repayment if it ultimately is finally determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction that the person who received such advances was not entitled to

in the Disclosure Schedule (or required to be provided to Parent\'s legal
counsel), or that is necessary to correct any information in the Disclosure
Schedule (or required to be provided to Parent\'s legal counsel) that is or
has become   -55-   inaccurate. For avoidance of doubt, the Company shall
only supplement the Disclosure Schedules to reflect matters arising after the
date of this Agreement.   (b) If the matter or matters, if any, included in
any such disclosure supplement, individually or in the aggregate would cause
a failure of the condition set forth in SECTION 6.2(a) and the Merger closes,
then notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent and
Sub shall not be entitled to indemnification from the Stockholders in respect
of such matter or matters included in such disclosure supplement.   (c) If
the matter or matters, if any, included in any such disclosure supplement,
would not individually or in the aggregate cause a failure of the condition
set forth in SECTION 6.2(a), the Company may, in it sole discretion deliver
to Parent written authorization to terminate this Agreement by written notice
to the Company delivered within five (5) Business Days following the delivery
of such authorization to Parent in the same manner and with the same force
and effect as if the matter or matters so disclosed had caused a failure of
the condition in SECTION 6.2(a).   (d) If, following a disclosure supplement
pursuant to SECTION 5.15(c)the Company authorizes Parent to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to SECTION 5.15(c) and Parent does not so terminate this
Agreement and the Merger closes, then notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, Parent and Sub shall not be entitled to
indemnification from the Stockholders in respect of such matter or matters
included in such disclosure supplement.   (e) If, following a disclosure
supplement pursuant to SECTION 5.15(c), the Company does not authorize Parent
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to SECTION 5.15(c) and the Merger
closes, such disclosure supplement shall not affect the rights of Parent and
Sub to indemnification for the matter or matters included in such disclosure
supplement.   5.16 NON-DISPARAGEMENT. From the date of this Agreement until
the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement,
Parent and the Company will not (except in the course of any Parent/Company
Litigation, to which this SECTION 5.16 shall not apply), and will cause their
respective affiliates, officers, directors, employees and representatives not
to, disparage, deprecate, or make any negative comment with respect to the
business, operations, properties, assets, technologies, products or services
of the other party.   5.17 STOCKHOLDER ARRANGEMENTS. The Company shall take

SECTION 7.2 hereof. The Escrow Fund shall be available to compensate the
Parent Indemnified Parties for any claims by such parties for any Losses
suffered or incurred by them and for which they are entitled to recovery
under this ARTICLE VII. The Escrow Agent may execute this Agreement following

Party may not recover any Losses under SECTION 7.2 until the aggregate amount
of all indemnifiable Losses under all claims of all Parent Indemnified
Parties shall be in excess of $3,000,000 (the "BASKET"), at which time,
subject to the other limitations set forth in this Agreement, all
Losses incurred in excess of $500,000 (the "DEDUCTIBLE") (including the
$2,500,000 difference between the Deductible and the Basket) shall be subject
to indemnification hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to the
other limitations set forth in this Agreement, a Parent Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to recover for, and neither the Deductible nor the Basket
shall not apply as a threshold to, any and all claims or payments made with
respect to all Losses incurred pursuant to clauses (ii), (iii), and (iv) of
SECTION 7.2 hereof.   (b) PARENT INDEMNIFIED PARTIES\' CLAIMS FOR
INDEMNIFICATION. In order to seek indemnification under SECTION 7.2, Parent

Agent shall promptly, and in no event later than the thirtieth (30th) day
after its receipt of the Officer\'s Certificate, deliver to the Parent
Indemnified Party from the Escrow Fund an amount equal to the Loss set forth
in such Officer\'s Certificate. Any payment from the Escrow Fund to Parent
Indemnified Parties shall be deemed to have been made pro rata amongst the
Stockholders based on the aggregate amounts deposited into the Escrow Fund on
each such Stockholder\'s behalf. For the purposes hereof, "PARENT OFFICER\'S
CERTIFICATE" shall mean a certificate signed by any officer of Parent: (1)
stating that an Indemnified Party has paid, sustained, incurred, or
properly accrued, or reasonably anticipates that it will have to pay,
sustain, incur, or accrue Losses, and (2) specifying in reasonable detail the
individual items of Losses included in the amount so stated, the date each
such item was paid, sustained, incurred, or properly accrued, or the basis
for such anticipated liability, and the nature of the misrepresentation,
breach of warranty or covenant to which such item is related.   (c)
STOCKHOLDER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES\' CLAIMS FOR INDEMNIFICATION. In order to
seek indemnification under SECTION 7.3, the Stockholder Representative shall

delivered a Parent Objection Notice pursuant to SECTION 7.5(e) hereof, Parent
shall promptly, and in no event later than the thirtieth (30th) day after its
receipt of the Stockholder Representative Certificate, deliver in accordance
with the written instructions of the Stockholder Representative, which
instructions shall be conclusively binding upon the Stockholder  
-62-   Indemnified Part(y)(ies) and may be relied upon by Parent, for
distribution to the Stockholder Indemnified Part(y)(ies) an amount equal to
the Loss set forth in such Stockholder Representative\'s Certificate. Any
such payment shall be made either by wire transfer or check, as the
Stockholder Representative may direct in its written instructions to Parent.
For the purposes hereof, "STOCKHOLDER REPRESENTATIVE\'S CERTIFICATE" shall
mean a certificate signed by the Stockholder Representative: (1) stating that
a Stockholder Indemnified Party has paid, sustained, incurred, or properly
accrued, or reasonably anticipates that it will have to pay, sustain, incur,
or accrue Losses, and (2) specifying in reasonable detail the individual
items of Losses included in the amount so stated, the date each such item was
paid, sustained, incurred, or properly accrued, or the basis for such
anticipated liability, and the nature of the misrepresentation, breach of
warranty or covenant to which such item is related.   (d) OBJECTIONS TO
PARENT INDEMNIFIED PARTIES\' CLAIMS FOR INDEMNIFICATION. No such payment
shall be made under SECTION 7.5(b) if the Stockholder Representative shall
object in a written statement to the claim made in the Parent Officer\'s
Certificate (a "STOCKHOLDER OBJECTION NOTICE"), and such Stockholder
Objection Notice shall have been delivered to Parent and the Escrow Agent
prior to the expiration of the thirtieth (30th) day after its receipt of the
Parent Officer\'s Certificate. If the Stockholder Representative does not
to object in writing within such 30-day period, such failure to so object
shall be an irrevocable acknowledgment by the Stockholder Representative that
the Indemnified Party is entitled to the full amount of the claim for Losses
set forth in such Parent Officer\'s Certificate, and payment in respect of
such Losses shall thereafter be made in accordance with this SECTION 7.5.  
(e) OBJECTIONS TO STOCKHOLDER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES\' CLAIMS
FOR INDEMNIFICATION. No such payment shall be made under SECTION 7.5(c) if
Parent shall object in a written statement to the claim made in the
Stockholder Representative\'s Certificate (a "PARENT OBJECTION NOTICE"), and
such Parent Objection Notice shall have been delivered to the Stockholder
Representative prior to the expiration of the thirtieth (30th) day after its
receipt of the Stockholder Representative\'s Certificate. If Parent does not
to object in writing within such 30-day period, such failure to so object
shall be an irrevocable acknowledgment by Parent that the Stockholder
Indemnified Part(y)(ies) is/are entitled to the full amount of the claim for
Losses set forth in such Stockholder Representative\'s Certificate, and
payment in respect of such Losses shall thereafter be made in accordance with
this SECTION 7.5.   (f) RESOLUTION OF CONFLICTS.   (i) In case the
Stockholder Representative delivers a Stockholder Objection Notice in
accordance with SECTION 7.5(d) or Parent delivers a Parent Objection Notice
in accordance with SECTION 7.5(e), the Stockholder Representative and Parent
shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective
parties with respect to each of such claims. If the Stockholder
Representative and Parent should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such
agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties and, in the case of a
Parent Objection Notice, furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent
shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and make distributions from
the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms thereof.   -63-    (ii) If,
after thirty (30) days after delivery of a Stockholder Objection Notice or a
Parent Objection Notice, as the case may be, no such agreement can be reached
after good faith negotiation, either Parent, on the one hand, or the
Stockholder Representative on the other hand, may seek any remedy available
to it in law or equity, subject to the terms of this Agreement, including
SECTION 9.8 hereof.   (g) THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS.   (i) In the event Parent or
the Stockholder Representative becomes aware of a third party claim (a "THIRD
PARTY Claim") which the party becoming aware of such Third Party Claim
reasonably believes may result in a demand for indemnification pursuant to
this ARTICLE VII, such party shall notify the other party of such claim, and
in the case of a Third Party Claim of which Parent becomes aware, Parent
shall also notify the Escrow Agent.   (ii) If the Third Party Claim may
result in a claim against the Escrow Fund, the Stockholder Representative on
behalf of the Stockholders, shall be entitled, at its expense, to participate
in, but not to determine or conduct, the defense of such Third Party Claim.
Parent shall have the right in its sole discretion to conduct the defense of,
and to settle, any such claim; provided, however, that except with the
consent of the Stockholder Representative, no settlement of any such Third
Party Claim with third party claimants shall be determinative of the amount
of Losses relating to such matter. In the event that the Stockholder
Representative has consented to any such settlement, the Stockholders shall
have no power or authority to object to the amount of any Third Party Claim
by Parent.   (iii) If the Third Party Claim may result in an obligation of
Parent to indemnify the Stockholder Indemnified Parties, Parent shall be
entitled, at its expense, to participate in, but not to determine or conduct,
the defense of such Third Party Claim. The Stockholder Representative shall
have the right in its sole discretion to conduct the defense of, and to
settle, any such claim; provided, however, that except with the consent of
Parent, no settlement of any such Third Party Claim with third party
claimants shall be determinative of the amount of Losses relating to such
matter.   (iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
SECTION 7.5(g), if a Third Party Claim is not reasonably likely to result in
Losses in an aggregate amount greater than one hundred fifty percent (150%)
the maximum obligation remaining pursuant to this Agreement of either Parent
to indemnify the Stockholder Indemnified Parties on the one hand (in the case
of indemnification sought from Parent) or the Stockholders to indemnify the
Parent Indemnified Parties on the other hand (in the case of indemnification
sought from the Stockholders), then the party from whom indemnification is
being sought pursuant to this SECTION 7.5 shall have the right in its sole
discretion to conduct the defense of, and to settle, any such claim;
provided, however, that without the prior written consent of the indemnified
party, the indemnifying party shall not agree to any settlement of any such
Third Party Claim that does not include a full and unconditional release of
the indemnified party.   -64-    (h) ESCROW AGENT\'S DUTIES.   (i) The
Escrow Agent shall be obligated only for the performance of such duties as
are specifically set forth herein, and as set forth in any additional written
escrow instructions which the Escrow Agent may receive after the date of this
Agreement that are signed by an officer of Parent and the Stockholder
Representative and are not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, or,
in the reasonable opinion of Escrow Agent, will not result in additional
obligations or liabilities to the Escrow Agent, and may rely and shall be
protected in relying or refraining from acting on any instrument reasonably
believed to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper
party or parties. The Escrow Agent\'s duties hereunder are ministerial
in nature and shall not be deemed fiduciary. The Escrow Agent shall not be
liable for any act done or omitted hereunder as Escrow Agent while acting in
good faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment, and any act done or
omitted pursuant to the advice of legal counsel shall be conclusive evidence
of such good faith.   (ii) The Escrow Agent is hereby expressly authorized
to disregard any and all warnings given by any of the parties hereto or by
any other person, excepting only orders or process of courts of law, and is
hereby expressly authorized to comply with and obey orders, judgments or
decrees of any court. In case the Escrow Agent obeys or complies with any
such order, judgment or decree of any court, the Escrow Agent shall not be
liable to any of the parties hereto or to any other person by reason of such
compliance, notwithstanding any such order, judgment or decree being
subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside, vacated or found to
have been entered without jurisdiction.   (iii) The Escrow Agent shall not
be liable in any respect on account of the identity, authority or rights of
the parties executing or delivering or purporting to execute or deliver this
Agreement or any documents or papers deposited or called for hereunder.  
(iv) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for the expiration of any rights
under any statute of limitations with respect to this Agreement or
any documents deposited with the Escrow Agent.   (v) In performing any
duties under this Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any
party for damages, losses, or expenses, except for gross negligence or
willful misconduct on the part of the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall
not incur any such liability for (A) any act or failure to act made or
omitted in good faith, or (B) any action taken or omitted in reliance upon
any instrument, including any written statement or affidavit provided for in
this Agreement that the Escrow Agent shall in good faith believe to be
genuine, nor will the Escrow Agent be liable or responsible for
forgeries, fraud, impersonations, or determining the scope of any
representative authority. In addition, the Escrow Agent may consult with
legal counsel in connection with performing the Escrow Agent\'s duties under
this Agreement and shall be fully protected in any act taken, suffered, or
permitted by him/her in good faith in accordance with the  
-65-   advice of counsel. The Escrow Agent is not responsible for
determining and verifying the authority of any person acting or purporting to
act on behalf of any party to this Agreement.   (vi) If any controversy
arises between the parties to this Agreement, or with any other party,
concerning the subject matter of this Agreement, its terms or conditions, the
Escrow Agent will not be required to determine the controversy or to take any
action regarding it. The Escrow Agent may hold all documents and the Escrow
Fund and may wait for settlement of any such controversy by final appropriate
legal proceedings or other means as, in the Escrow Agent\'s discretion, may
be required, despite what may be set forth elsewhere in this Agreement. In
such event, the Escrow Agent will not be liable for damages. Furthermore, the
Escrow Agent may at its option, file an action of interpleader requiring the
parties to answer and litigate any claims and rights among themselves. The
Escrow Agent is authorized to deposit with the clerk of the court all
documents and the Escrow Fund held in escrow, except all costs, expenses,
charges and reasonable attorney fees incurred by the Escrow Agent due to the
interpleader action (the "AGENT INTERPLEADER EXPENSES") and which the parties
agree to pay as follows: fifty percent (50%) to be paid by Parent and fifty
percent (50%) to be paid by the Stockholders on the basis of
the Stockholders\' respective Pro Rata Portions; provided, however, that in
the event any Stockholder fails to timely pay his or her Pro Rata Portion of
the Agent Interpleader Expenses, the parties agree that Parent may at its
option pay such Stockholder\'s Pro Rata Portion of the Agent Interpleader
Expenses and recover an equal amount (which shall be deemed a Loss) from such
Stockholder\'s Pro Rata Portion of the Escrow Fund. Upon initiating such
action, the Escrow Agent shall be fully released and discharged of and from
all obligations and liability imposed by the terms of this Agreement.  
(vii) The parties and their respective successors and assigns agree jointly
and severally to indemnify and hold Escrow Agent harmless against any and all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses, including
reasonable costs of investigation, counsel fees, including allocated costs of
in-house counsel and disbursements that may be imposed on Escrow Agent or
incurred by Escrow Agent in connection with the performance of his/her duties
under this Agreement, including but not limited to any litigation arising
from this Agreement or involving its subject matter, other than those arising
out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Escrow Agent (the
"AGENT INDEMNIFICATION EXPENSES") as follows: fifty percent (50%) to be paid
by Parent and fifty percent (50%) to be paid by the Stockholders on the basis
of the Stockholders\' Pro Rata Portions directly from the Escrow Fund;
provided, however, that in the event the Stockholders\' portion of the
Agent Indemnification Expenses cannot be satisfied from the Escrow Fund in
full, the parties agree that Parent shall pay the shortfall of such
Stockholders\' portion of the Agent Indemnification Expenses, and shall be
entitled to recover such amount from each Stockholder equal to such
Stockholder\'s Pro Rata Portion of such amount without regard to any caps or
other limits herein.   (viii) The Escrow Agent may resign at any time upon
giving at least thirty (30) days written notice to the Parent and the
Stockholder Representative; provided, however, that no such resignation shall
become effective until the appointment of a successor escrow agent, which  
-66-   shall be accomplished as follows: Parent and the Stockholder
Representative shall use their best efforts to mutually agree on a successor
escrow agent within thirty (30) days after receiving such notice. If the
parties fail to agree upon a successor escrow agent within such time, the
Escrow Agent shall have the right to appoint a successor escrow agent
authorized to do business in the State of New York or appeal to a court of
competent jurisdiction to appoint a successor escrow agent and shall remain
the escrow agent until such order is received. The successor escrow agent
shall execute and deliver an instrument accepting such appointment and it
shall, without further acts, be vested with all the estates, properties,
rights, powers, and duties of the predecessor escrow agent as if originally
named as escrow agent. Upon appointment of a successor escrow agent, the
Escrow Agent shall be discharged from any further duties and liability under
this Agreement.   (ix) The Escrow Agent is hereby authorized, in making or
disposing of any investment permitted by this Agreement, or in carrying out
any sale of the Escrow Fund permitted by this Agreement, to deal with itself
(in its individual capacity) or with any one or more of its affiliates,
whether it or such affiliate is acting as a subagent of the Escrow Agent or
for any third person or dealing as principal for its own account.   (x)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any provision seeking to limit the
liability of the Escrow Agent shall not be applicable in the event such
liability arises from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
the Escrow Agent.   (xi) Notwithstanding any term appearing in this
Agreement to the contrary, in no instance shall the Escrow Agent be required
or obligated to distribute any of the Escrow Fund (or take other action that
may be called for hereunder to be taken by the Escrow Agent) sooner than two
(2) Business Days after (i) it has received the applicable documents required
under this Agreement in good form, or (ii) passage of the applicable time
period (or both, as applicable under the terms of this Agreement), as the
case may be.   (i) FEES. All fees (including attorney\'s fees) of the Escrow
Agent for performance of its duties hereunder shall be paid by Parent in
accordance with the standard fee schedule of the Escrow Agent previously
delivered to Parent. It is understood that the fees and usual charges agreed
upon for services of the Escrow Agent shall be considered compensation for
ordinary services as contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that the
conditions of this Agreement are not promptly fulfilled, or if the Escrow
Agent renders any service not provided for in this Agreement but that has
been requested by an officer of Parent, or if the parties request a
substantial modification of the terms of the Agreement, or if any controversy
arises, or if the Escrow Agent is made a party to, or intervenes in, any
litigation pertaining to the Escrow Fund or its subject matter, the Escrow
Agent shall be reasonably compensated for such extraordinary services and
reimbursed for all costs, attorney\'s fees, including allocated costs of in-
house counsel, and expenses occasioned by such default, delay, controversy or
litigation.   (j) SUCCESSOR ESCROW AGENTS. Any corporation or other entity
into which the Escrow Agent in its individual capacity may be merged or
converted or with which it may be consolidated,   -67-   or any
corporation or other entity resulting from any merger, conversion
or consolidation to which the Escrow Agent in its individual capacity shall
be a party, or any corporation or other entity to which substantially all
the corporate trust business of the Escrow Agent in its individual capacity
may be transferred, shall be the Escrow Agent under this Escrow Agreement
without further act.   (k) INVESTMENT OF ESCROW FUND.   (i) If the Escrow
Agent shall have received specific written investment instruction from Parent
and Company (which shall include instruction as to term to maturity, if
applicable), on a timely basis, the Escrow Agent shall invest the Escrow Fund
in Eligible Investments, pursuant to and as directed in such instruction.  
(ii) "ELIGIBLE INVESTMENTS" shall mean (i) obligations issued or guaranteed
by the United States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof
(provided that the full faith and credit of the United States is pledged in
support thereof); (ii) obligations (including certificates of deposit
and banker\'s acceptances) of any domestic commercial bank having capital and
surplus in excess of $500,000,000; (iii) repurchase obligations for
underlying securities of the type described in clause (i); (iv) investment in
the Escrow Agent\'s "Insured Money Market Account" ("IMMA"). If otherwise
qualified, obligations of the Escrow Agent or any of its affiliates shall
qualify as Eligible Investments. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Eligible
Investments shall be limited to those instruments readily obtainable and
routinely offered by the Escrow Agent\'s Corporate Trust Services.   (iii)
Escrow Agent Not Responsible For Investment Decisions. Absent its timely
receipt of such specific written investment instruction from Parent and
Company, the Escrow Agent shall have no obligation or duty to invest
(or otherwise pay interest on) the Escrow Fund; provided, however, that in
the event the Escrow Agent shall not have received such written investment
instruction, the Escrow Agent shall be authorized to invest any of the Escrow
Fund in the Escrow Agent\'s IMMA until such investment instruction is
received. All earnings received from the investment of the Escrow Fund shall
be credited to, and shall become a part of, the Escrow Fund (and any losses
on such investments shall be debited to the Escrow Account). The Escrow Agent
shall have no liability for any investment losses, including without
limitation any market loss on any investment liquidated prior to maturity in
order to make a payment required hereunder.   (iv) Transaction
Confirmations. The parties hereto acknowledge that, to the extent regulations
of the Comptroller of the Currency, or other applicable regulatory entity,
grant the parties the right to receive individual confirmations of security
transactions at no additional cost, as they occur, the parties specifically
waive receipt of such confirmations to the extent permitted by law. The
Escrow Agent will furnish the parties hereto with periodic cash transaction
statements that include detail for all investment transactions made by the
Escrow Agent hereunder.   (v) Tax Reporting. The Interested Parties agree
that, for tax reporting purposes, Parent shall be treated as the owner of the
Escrow Fund, in accordance with former   -68-   Proposed Treasury
Regulations Section 1.468B-8 for federal and state tax purposes while it is
held by the Escrow Agent, and until such time, if ever, as it is determined
that the funds are payable to Company, the Escrow Agent will report the
interest or other income (the "ESCROW INCOME") as earned by Parent; and the
Escrow Agent shall, for each calendar year (or portion thereof) for which the
Escrow Fund is so held will so report the interest earned on the Escrow Fund
on Internal Revenue Service Form 1099 and corresponding state income tax
forms in accordance with applicable law and regulations.   7.6 STOCKHOLDER
REPRESENTATIVE.   (a) By virtue of the approval of the Merger and this
Agreement by the Sufficient Stockholder Vote, each of the Stockholders shall
be deemed to have agreed to appoint Stata Venture Partners, LLC as its agent
and attorney-in-fact (such appointment being coupled with an interest and
irrevocable), as the Stockholder Representative for and on behalf of the
Stockholders to give and receive notices and communications, to authorize
payment to any Indemnified Party from the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of
claims by any Indemnified Party, to object to or refrain from objecting to
such payments, to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises
of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of
arbitrators with respect to such claims, to assert, negotiate, enter into
settlements and compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders
of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to, any other claim by any
Indemnified Party against any Stockholder or by any such Stockholder against
any Indemnified Party or any dispute between any Indemnified Party and any
such Stockholder, in each case relating to this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, to withhold
and expend the Stockholder Representative Fund, and to take all other actions
that are either (i) necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the
Stockholder Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing or (ii)
specifically mandated by the terms of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement.
Such agency may be changed by the Stockholders from time to time upon not
less than thirty (30) days prior written notice to Parent; provided, however,
that the Stockholder Representative may not be removed unless holders of a
two-thirds interest of the Escrow Fund agree to such removal and to
the identity of the substituted agent. A vacancy in the position of
Stockholder Representative may be filled by the holders of a majority in
interest of the Escrow Fund. No bond shall be required of the Stockholder
Representative, and the Stockholder Representative shall not receive any
compensation for its services. Notices or communications to or from the
Stockholder Representative shall constitute notice to or from the
Stockholders.   (b) The Stockholder Representative shall not be liable for
any act done or omitted hereunder as Stockholder Representative except to the
extent of the Stockholder Representative\'s own bad faith. The Stockholders
shall jointly and severally indemnify the Stockholder Representative and hold
the Stockholder Representative harmless against any loss, liability or
expense incurred without bad faith on the part of the Stockholder
Representative and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of the Stockholder Representative\'s duties hereunder,
including the reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel, accountants,
and/or   -69-   other advisers retained by the Stockholder Representative
("STOCKHOLDER REPRESENTATIVE EXPENSES") and without limiting his rights to
such indemnification, or the assets of the Stockholders to which recourse may
be had in respect of such indemnification, the Stockholder Representative
shall be entitled to reimbursement of all Stockholder Representative Expenses
from the Escrow Fund, if, when, and to the extent otherwise deliverable to
the Stockholders. The Stockholder Representative, in its capacity as the
Stockholder Representative, shall have no liability for any claims for
indemnification, compensation, or reimbursement under this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement. A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder
Representative, including but not limited to an amendment, extension or
waiver of this Agreement, shall constitute a decision of the Stockholders and
shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the Stockholders; and the Escrow
Agent and Parent may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction
of the Stockholder Representative as being the decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Stockholders.   7.7 LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary:  
(a) Except as set forth in SECTION 7.7(c) and SECTION 7.7(c) hereof, the
maximum amount a Parent Indemnified Party may recover from a
Stockholder individually pursuant to the indemnity set forth in SECTION 7.2
hereof for Losses shall be limited to the amounts held in the Escrow Fund
with respect to such Stockholder.   (b) Except as set forth in SECTION
7.7(c) and SECTION 7.7(c) hereof, the maximum amount, in the aggregate, the
Stockholder Indemnified Parties may recover from Parent and Sub pursuant to
the indemnity set forth in SECTION 7.2 hereof shall be limited to an amount
equal to $30 million; provided, however, that the limitations set forth in
this SECTION 7.7(b) shall not apply to any failure by Parent or Sub to
perform or comply with the covenants set forth in SECTION 5.14 or the
obligation of Parent to deliver the Merger Consideration.   (c)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, nothing
in this Agreement shall limit the liability of any person for indemnification
hereunder in respect of Losses arising out of any actual fraud on the part of
such person, but the loss of such limitations of liability shall apply only
to the party who committed actual fraud and not to any other person.   (d)
Subject to SECTION 7.7(c) hereof, the provisions of this ARTICLE VII and of
SECTION 9.7 hereof are the sole and exclusive basis for the assertion of
claims against, or the imposition of liability on, the Stockholders
in connection with this Agreement, any other agreement or instrument executed
or delivered pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement, or the Merger
or other transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, whether based on
contract, tort, statute, regulation, or otherwise. The Parent Indemnified
Parties irrevocably waive and relinquish, and agree not to assert or pursue,
any claim not based on the provisions of this ARTICLE VII or SECTION 9.7.  
-70-    7.8 ADJUSTMENTS TO MERGER CONSIDERATION. All indemnification
payments made pursuant to this Agreement will be and be treated by all
persons for all purposes as adjustments to the Merger Consideration.   7.9
NO INDEMNIFICATION WITHOUT CLOSING. In the event the Merger does not close:
(i) nothing herein shall limit the liability of either party for any breach
or inaccuracy of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this
Agreement or any Related Agreement, (ii) the provisions of this ARTICLE
VII other than this SECTION 7.9 shall not apply and shall be of no further
force or effect and (iii) the parties shall be entitled to seek any remedy
available to such party in law or at equity for any such breach or
inaccuracy.   ARTICLE VIII   TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER   8.1
TERMINATION. Except as provided in SECTION 8.1 hereof, this Agreement may be
terminated and the Merger abandoned at any time prior to the Closing:   (a)
by unanimous agreement of the Company and Parent;   (b) by Parent or the
Company if the Closing Date shall not have occurred by the date that is six
months from the date of this Agreement;   (c) by Parent or the Company if:
(i) there shall be a final non-appealable order of a federal or state court
in effect preventing consummation of the Merger, or (ii) there shall be any
Law enacted, promulgated or issued or deemed applicable to the Closing by any
Governmental Entity that would make consummation of the Closing illegal;  
(d) by Parent if there shall be any action taken, or any Law
enacted, promulgated or issued or deemed applicable to the Merger by any
Governmental Entity, that would prohibit Parent\'s ownership or operation of
the business of the Company;   (e) by Parent if it is not in material
breach of its obligations under this Agreement and there has been a breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company or the
Stockholders contained in this Agreement such that the conditions set forth
in SECTION 6.2(a) hereof would not be satisfied and such breach has not been
cured within ten (10) calendar days after written notice thereof to the
Company and the Stockholder Representative; provided, however, that no cure
period shall be required for a breach which by its nature cannot be cured;
or   (f) by the Company if none of the Company or the Stockholders is
in material breach of their respective obligations under this Agreement and
there has been a breach of any   -71-    representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement of Parent contained in this Agreement such that the
conditions set forth in SECTION 6.3(a) hereof would not be satisfied and such
breach has not been cured within ten (10) calendar days after written notice
thereof to Parent; provided, however, that no cure period shall be required
for a breach which by its nature cannot be cured.   8.2 EFFECT OF
TERMINATION. In the event of termination of this Agreement as provided in
SECTION 8.1 hereof, this Agreement shall forthwith cease to be effective and
there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Parent, the Company
or the Stockholders, or their respective officers, directors or stockholders,
if applicable; provided, however, that each party hereto shall remain liable
for any breaches of this Agreement prior to its termination; and provided
further, however, that, the provisions of SECTIONS 5.3, 5.4 and 5.5 hereof,
ARTICLE VII and ARTICLE IX and hereof and this SECTION 8.2 shall remain in
full force and effect and survive any termination of this Agreement.   8.3
REIMBURSEMENT OF COMPANY EXPENSES. In the event this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to SECTION 8.1 hereof and the Company has not committed any actual
fraud in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby or intentionally breached any of its covenants set forth
in this Agreement and the Related Agreements, Parent, shall promptly
reimburse the Company for up to $1,000,000 of documented out-of-pocket costs
and expenses incurred by the Company in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby.   8.4 AMENDMENT. This Agreement may
be amended by the parties hereto at any time by execution of an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of the party against whom enforcement is sought. For
purposes of this SECTION 8.4, the Stockholders agree that any amendment of
this Agreement signed by the Stockholder Representative shall be binding upon
and effective against the Stockholders whether or not they have signed such
amendment.   8.5 EXTENSION; WAIVER. At any time prior to the Closing,
Parent, on the one hand, and the Company and the Stockholder Representative,
on the other hand, each in its sole discretion, may, to the extent legally
allowed, but shall not be required to, (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations of the other party hereto, (ii) waive
any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (iii)
waive compliance with any of the covenants, agreements or conditions for the
benefit of such party contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party
hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. For purposes of this
SECTION 8.5, the Stockholders agree that any extension or waiver signed by
the Stockholder Representative shall be binding upon and effective against
all Stockholders whether or not they have signed such extension or
waiver.   -72-    ARTICLE IX   GENERAL PROVISIONS   9.1 NOTICES. All
