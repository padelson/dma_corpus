and articles of merger satisfying the applicable requirements of the NRS (the
" _Certificates of Merger_ ") shall be duly executed by the Company and
Merger Sub and, simultaneously with or as soon as practicable following the
Closing, filed with the Secretary of State of the States of Delaware and
Nevada (the " _Secretaries of State_ "). The Merger shall become effective
upon the later of: (a) the date and time of the filing of the Certificates of
Merger with the Secretaries of State, or (b) such later date and time as may

The date and time the Merger becomes effective is referred to in this
Agreement as the " _Effective Time_." 

  

1.4 _Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers_. At the
Effective Time: 

  

1.4(a) the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time; 

  

1.4(b) the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be the Bylaws of Merger
Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time; 

  

1.4(c) the directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the
Effective Time shall be the respective individuals who are directors of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time; and 

  

1.4(d) the officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the
Effective Time shall be the respective individuals who are officers of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

   

1.5 _Conversion of Shares_. 

  

1.5(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any stockholder of
the Company: 

  

(i) any shares of Company Common Stock then held by the Company or any wholly
owned Subsidiary of the Company (or held in the Companys treasury) shall be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor; 

  

(ii) any shares of Company Common Stock then held by Parent, Merger Sub or any
other wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent shall be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor; 

  

(iii) each share of the common stock, $0.001 par value per share, of Merger
Sub then outstanding shall be converted into one share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation; and 

  

    ##### 

  

 

(iv) except as provided in clauses (i) and (ii) above and subject to Sections
1.5(b) and 1.5(c) below, each share of Company Common Stock then outstanding,
other than Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section 1.10 below), shall be
converted into the following (the consideration described in (A)) below being
the " _Cash Consideration_ ", the consideration described in (B) below being
the " _Stock Consideration_ " and together with the Cash Consideration, the "
_Merger Consideration_ "): 

  

(A) for each such share of Company Common Stock with respect to which an
election to receive cash has been effectively made and not revoked pursuant
to Sections 1.6(c), (d) and (e) (the " _Cash Electing Shares_ "), the right
to receive US$5.00 in cash from Parent (the " _Cash Election Price_ "); or 

  

(B) for each such share of Company Common Stock with respect to which an
election to receive cash has not been effectively made or has been revoked
pursuant to Sections 1.6(c), (d) and (e) (the " _Stock Electing Shares_ "),
the right to receive 0.8 of a share of Parent Common Stock (the fraction of a
share of Parent Common Stock specified in this Section 1.5(a)(iv)(B) (as
such fraction may be adjusted in accordance with Section 1.5(b)) is referred
to as the " _Exchange Ratio_ "). 

  

1.5(b) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock are changed
into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split,
stock dividend, reverse stock split, reclassification, recapitalization or
other similar transaction, then the Exchange Ratio shall be
appropriately adjusted. 

  

1.5(c) No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in
connection with the Merger, and no certificates or scrip for any such
fractional shares shall be issued. Any holder of Company Common Stock who
would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common
Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
to such holder) shall, in lieu of such fraction of a share and upon surrender
of such holders Company Stock Certificate(s) (as defined in Section 1.8), be
paid in cash the dollar amount (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without
interest, determined by multiplying such fraction by the closing price of a
share of Parent Common Stock on the American Stock Exchange, New York Stock
Exchange or other applicable national securities exchange on the date the
Merger becomes effective. 

   

1.6 _Company Stock Elections_. 

  

1.6(a) Subject to Section 1.7 and to the terms of the Related Agreements, each
Person who, on or prior to the Election Date referred to in Section 1.6(c)
below, is a record holder of shares of Company Common Stock (and remains a
record holder of such stock until the Effective Time) will be entitled, with
respect to all or any portion of such holders shares, to make an
unconditional election (a " _Cash/Stock Election_ ") on or prior to such
Election Date to receive, with respect to each such share, the Cash Election
Price or shares of Parent Common Stock at the Exchange Ratio, respectively,
on the basis hereinafter set forth. 

  

1.6(b) Prior to the mailing of the Joint Proxy and Information
Statement/Prospectus, Parent shall appoint a reputable bank or trust company
designated by Parent and reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as
exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the payment of the
Merger Consideration. 

  

1.6(c) The Company shall prepare and mail a form of election (the " _Form of
Election_ ") with the Joint Proxy and Information Statement/Prospectus to the
record holders of Company Common Stock no later than the record date with
respect to the determination of those stockholders of the Company entitled to
receive the Joint Proxy and Information Statement/Prospectus. The Form of
Election shall be used by each record holder of shares of Company Common
Stock who wishes to elect to receive the Cash Election Price for any or all
shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder. The Company will use its
best efforts to make the Form of Election and the Joint Proxy
and Information Statement/Prospectus available to all persons who become
holders of Company Common Stock during the period between such record date
and the Election Date referred to below. Any such holders election to
receive the Cash Election Price with respect to any or all of such
holders shares of Company Common Stock shall have been properly made only if
the Exchange Agent shall have received a Form of Election properly completed
and signed at its designated office, by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the
date specified in the Form of Election, which date shall not be later than
one business day prior to the Closing Date (the " _Election Date_ "). 

 

    ##### 

  

  

1.6(d) Any Form of Election may be revoked only by a duly executed written
notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time,
on the Election Date. In addition, all Forms of Election shall automatically
be revoked if the Exchange Agent is notified in writing by Parent that the
Merger has been abandoned. If a Form of Election is revoked, the shares of
Company Common Stock to which such Form of Election relates shall be treated
as Stock Electing Shares. 

  

1.6(e) The determination of the Exchange Agent shall be binding as to whether
or not elections to receive the Cash Election Price have been properly made
or revoked pursuant to this Section 1.6 with respect to shares of Company
Common Stock, and as to the time when elections and revocations were received
by it. If the Exchange Agent determines that any election to receive the
Cash Election Price for shares of Company Common Stock was not properly made
with respect to such shares, then such shares shall be treated by the
Exchange Agent as Stock Electing Shares, and such shares shall be exchanged
in the Merger for shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to
Section 1.5(a)(iv)(B). The Exchange Agent shall also make all computations
contemplated by Section 1.7, and any such computation shall be conclusive and
binding on the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, except for manifest
mathematical error. Parent and the Company shall make such rules as
are consistent with this Section 1.6 and Section 1.7 for the implementation
of the elections and computations provided for herein and therein as shall be
necessary or desirable fully to effect such elections and computations. 

  

1.7 _Issuance of Stock Consideration and Payment of Cash Election Price_. The
manner in which each share of Company Common Stock (other than shares of
Company Common Stock to be cancelled as set forth in Sections 1.5(a)(i) and
(ii)) shall be converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive
the Cash Election Price or the Stock Consideration shall be as set forth in
this Section 1.7. 

  

1.7(a) As is more fully set forth below, the Total Cash Consideration (as
defined below) in the Merger pursuant to this Agreement shall not be more
than 60% of the sum of (i) the Total Stock Consideration, and (ii) the Total
Cash Consideration (such limit, the " _Cash Limitation_ "). For purposes
hereof, (i) the term " _Total Stock Consideration_ " means the product of (A)
the Exchange Ratio, (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock, other
than shares of Company Common Stock issued upon conversion of the Notes,
converted into Parent Common Stock, after the application, if and to the
extent necessary, of Sections 1.7(d) and 1.7(e), and (C) the average of the
high and low trading prices of the Parent Common Stock on the American Stock
Exchange, New York Stock Exchange or other applicable national securities
exchange on the last business day prior to the date hereof or at the
Effective Time, whichever average price is lower, and (ii) the term " _Total
Cash Consideration_ " means the sum (after the application, if and to the
extent necessary, of Sections 1.7(d), 1.7(e)) of (A) all cash paid in
connection with Cash/Stock Elections (including under the Related
Agreements), (B) all cash paid in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
Section 1.5(c), (C) cash paid for Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section
1.10) and (D) such other amounts that may at any time be paid in connection
with the events contemplated herein that Parent or the Company reasonably
believes are required to be taken into account for purposes of the continuity
of interest requirement under Section 368(a) of the Code. For these purposes
cash that is paid for Dissenting Shares shall be computed as if holders of
Dissenting Shares made the Cash Election. 

  

1.7(b) Each share of Company Common Stock that constitutes a Stock Electing
Share shall be converted into the right to receive Parent Common Stock at the
Exchange Ratio pursuant to Section 1.5(a)(iv)(B). 

 

    ##### 

  

  

1.7(c) If the Total Cash Consideration, as determined following the receipt of
all Cash/Stock Elections, is equal to or less than the Cash Limitation, each
share of Company Common Stock that constitutes a Cash Electing Share shall be
converted into the right to receive the Cash Election Price pursuant to
Section 1.5(a)(iv)(A). 

  

1.7(d) If the Total Cash Consideration, as determined following the receipt of
all Cash/Stock Elections, is more than the Cash Limitation, then the number
of Cash Electing Shares shall be reduced, and the following holders of
Company Common Stock who have made a Cash/Stock Election (each, a " _Cash
Electing Shareholder_ ") shall instead receive shares of Parent Common Stock
at the Exchange Ratio to the extent and in the order described below until
the Total Cash Consideration is equal to or less than the Cash Limitation: 

  

(i) Each Cash Electing Shareholder who holds a sufficient number of shares of
Company Common Stock covered by a Cash/Stock Election to receive as part of
the Merger Consideration at least one whole share of Parent Common Stock
pursuant to Section 1.5(a)(iv)(B) if such shares are treated as Stock
Electing Shares, shall receive such one whole share of Parent Common Stock for
such shares of Company Common Stock, at the Exchange Ratio pursuant to
Section 1.5(a)(iv)(B), in lieu of receiving the Cash Election Price for such
shares pursuant to Section 1.5(a)(iv)(A), provided, however, that if the
application of this procedure to fewer than all of such Cash Electing
Shareholders is sufficient to reduce the Total Cash Consideration to an
amount equal to or less than the Cash Limitation, Parent and the Exchange
Agent will select by lot the Cash Electing Shareholders whose Cash/Stock
Elections will be subject to the foregoing procedure; 

  

(ii) If the application of Section 1.7(d)(i) is not sufficient to reduce the
Total Cash Consideration to an amount equal to or less than the Cash
Limitation, then, in addition to the application of Section 1.7(d)(i), each
Cash Electing Shareholder who holds a sufficient number of shares of Company
Common Stock covered by a Cash/Stock Election to receive as part of the
Merger Consideration at least a second whole share of Parent Common Stock
pursuant to Section 1.5(a)(iv)(B) if such shares are treated as Stock
Electing Shares, shall receive such second whole share of Parent Common Stock
for such shares of Company Common Stock, at the Exchange Ratio pursuant to
Section 1.5(a)(iv)(B), in lieu of receiving the Cash Election Price for such
shares pursuant to Section 1.5(a)(iv)(A), provided, however, that if the
application of this procedure to fewer than all of such Cash Electing
Shareholders is sufficient to reduce the Total Cash Consideration to an
amount equal to or less than the Cash Limitation, Parent and the Exchange
Agent will select by lot the Cash Electing Shareholders whose Cash/Stock
Elections will be subject to the foregoing procedure; and 

  

(iii) If the application of Section 1.7(d)(ii) is not sufficient to reduce the
Total Cash Consideration to an amount equal to or less than the Cash
Limitation, under the principles of Section 1.7(d)(i) and (ii), then the Cash
Electing Shares shall continue to be reduced, and each Cash Electing
Shareholder who holds a sufficient number of shares of Company Common Stock
covered by a Cash/Stock Election to receive as part of the Merger
Consideration at least a third whole share and, to the extent necessary,
greater than three whole shares, of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section
1.5(a)(iv)(B) if such shares are treated as Stock Electing Shares,
shall receive such third or more whole shares of Parent Common Stock for such
shares of Company Common Stock, at the Exchange Ratio pursuant to Section
1.5(a)(iv)(B), in lieu of receiving the Cash Election Price for such shares
pursuant to Section 1.5(a)(iv)(A), until the Total Cash Consideration is
equal to or less than the Cash Limitation. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

1.7(e) If, due to the existence of Dissenting Shares or due to any uncertainty
in the calculation of the Cash Limitation, it reasonably appears to Parent or
Company that the Merger may potentially fail to satisfy continuity of
interest requirements under applicable principles relating to reorganizations
under Section 368(a) of the Code, the number of Cash Electing Shares shall be
reduced, and Cash Electing Shareholders shall instead receive one or more
shares of Parent Common Stock in the order described in Section 1.7(d), to
the extent necessary to enable the Merger to satisfy such requirements. 

  

1.8 _Closing of the Company s Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time: (a) all
holders of certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights as stockholders of the Company other than the right to receive the
Cash Election Price and/or shares of Parent Common Stock (and cash in lieu
of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock), as the case may be, as
contemplated by Section 1.5; and (b) the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed with respect to all shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. No further transfer
of any such shares of Company Common Stock shall be made on such stock
transfer books after the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, a
valid certificate previously representing any shares of Company Common Stock
(a " _Company Stock Certificate_ ") is presented to the Exchange Agent or to
the Surviving Corporation or Parent, such Company Stock Certificate shall be
canceled and shall be exchanged as provided in Section 1.9. 

   

1.9 _Exchange of Certificates_. 

  

1.9(a) Promptly after the Effective Time, but in no event later than three (3)
business days thereafter, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent (i)
certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant
to this Section 1, and (ii) cash sufficient to make payments (A) in respect
of Cash Electing Shares in accordance with Section 1.5(a)(iv)(A), and (B) in
lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.5(c). The shares of
Parent Common Stock and cash amounts so deposited with the Exchange Agent,
together with any dividends or distributions received by the Exchange Agent
with respect to such shares, are referred to collectively as the " _Exchange
Fund_." 

  

1.9(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the
Exchange Agent will mail to the record holders of Company Stock Certificates
(i) a letter of transmittal in customary form and containing such provisions
as Parent may reasonably specify (including a provision confirming that
delivery of Company Stock Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title to Company Stock Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of
such Company Stock Certificates to the Exchange Agent), and (ii) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of Company Stock Certificates in exchange
for the applicable Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Company Stock
Certificate to the Exchange Agent for exchange, together with a duly
executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may be reasonably
required by the Exchange Agent or Parent, (A) the holder of such Company
Stock Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (1) the
Cash Election Price in respect of all Cash Electing Shares with respect to
which a Cash/Stock Election has previously been properly made and not revoked
by such holder, and/or (2) a certificate or evidence of shares in book entry
form representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.5
(and cash in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock), and (B)
the Company Stock Certificate so surrendered shall be canceled. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.9, each Company Stock
Certificate shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent
only the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration as contemplated
by this Section 1\. If any Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the payment of the Cash Election Price and/or the issuance of
any certificate representing Parent Common Stock, require the owner of
such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate to provide an
appropriate affidavit and to deliver a bond (in such sum as Parent may
reasonably direct) as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
Company Stock Certificate. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

1.9(c) No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to
Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid
to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate with respect to
the shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive
in the Merger until such holder surrenders such Company Stock Certificate
in accordance with this Section 1.9 (at which time such holder shall be
entitled, subject to the effect of applicable abandoned property laws,
escheat laws or similar laws, to receive all such dividends and
distributions, without interest). 

  

1.9(d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to holders
of Company Stock Certificates as of the date 180 days after the date on which
the Merger becomes effective shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and
any holders of Company Stock Certificates who have not theretofore
surrendered their Company Stock Certificates in accordance with this Section
1.9 shall thereafter look only to Parent for satisfaction of their claims for
the applicable Merger Consideration to which the they may be entitled, cash
in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and any dividends or
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock. 

  

1.9(e) Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or
otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former
holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as may be required to be deducted
or withheld therefrom under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax law. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld and
paid over to the proper Governmental Body, such amounts shall be treated for
all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom
such amounts would otherwise have been paid. 

  

1.9(f) Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any
holder or former holder of Company Common Stock or to any other Person with
respect to any shares of Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions
with respect thereto), or for any cash amounts, properly delivered to any
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law, escheat law
or similar Legal Requirement. 

  

1.9(g) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, shares of Parent
Common Stock issuable in exchange for the shares of Company Common Stock held
by Mr. Xu Hong Bin shall be placed in escrow to the extent required by and
pursuant to the terms of the Majority Stockholder Consent Agreement between
Parent and Mr. Xu Hong Bin. 

  

1.10 _Dissenting Shares_. Shares of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by a holder
who (a) has not voted such shares in favor of the adoption of this Agreement
and the Merger, (b) is entitled to, and who has, properly demanded and
perfected dissenters rights for such shares of Company Common Stock
in accordance with NRS Section 92A.420 and (c) has not effectively withdrawn
or forfeited such dissenters rights prior to the Effective Time (the "
_Dissenting Shares_ "), will not be converted into a right to receive Merger
Consideration at the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, such
holder fails to perfect or withdraws, forfeits or otherwise loses such
holders dissenters rights, (i) such shares of Company Common Stock will be
treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time pursuant to
Section 1.5, without interest thereon, and (ii) the procedures in Section 1.7
will apply with respect to the payment of Merger Consideration with regard to
such shares of Company Common Stock. The Company will give Parent prompt
notice of any written notice received by the Company regarding dissenters
rights with respect to shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent will have
the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands. The Company will not, except with the prior written Consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any
such demands. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

1.11 _Treatment of Warrants_. 

  

1.11(a) At the Effective Time, subject to any necessary Consent of holders of
warrants, each warrant issued by the Company to purchase shares of Company
Common Stock (each a " _Company Warrant_ "), which is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to represent
a right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock and shall be assumed by
Parent and converted automatically into a warrant to purchase shares of
Parent Common Stock (a " _Converted Warrant_ ") in an amount and at an
exercise price determined as provided below (and each Converted Warrant
otherwise shall remain subject to the terms of the applicable warrant
agreement, notice or letter evidencing the issuance of the Company Warrant
pursuant thereto). 

  

(i) The number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be subject to a Converted
Warrant shall be equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to the outstanding Company Warrant and (y) the Exchange
Ratio, _provided_ that any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock resulting
from such multiplication shall be rounded down to the nearest whole
share; and 

  

(ii) the exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock under a Converted
Warrant shall be equal to the exercise price per share of Company Common
Stock under the outstanding Company Warrant divided by the Exchange Ratio,
_provided_ that such exercise price shall be rounded up to the nearest
cent. 

  

1.11(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent
shall deliver to each holder of a Converted Warrant an appropriate notice
evidencing the foregoing assumption of the Company Warrant by Parent. 

  

1.11(c) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for
issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery
upon the exercise of the Converted Warrants, including the authorization for
listing of such shares on the American Stock Exchange, New York Stock
Exchange or other applicable national securities exchange. 

  

1.12 _Tax Consequences_. For federal income tax purposes, the Merger is
intended to constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Code. The parties to this Agreement hereby adopt this Agreement as a
"plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and
1.368-3(a) of the Treasury Regulations. 

  

1.13 _Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of Merger Sub
and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation
and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Merger Sub, the Company
or otherwise) to take such action.

their respective properties and assets that they each purport to own or use,
and to perform all their respective obligations under Acquired Corporation
Contracts. Each of the Acquired Corporations is duly qualified to do business
as a foreign corporation or other Entity and is in good standing (where such
concept is applicable) under the laws of each state or other jurisdiction in
which either the ownership or use of the properties owned or used by it, or
the nature of the activities conducted by it, requires such qualification,

individually or in the aggregate, to result in a Material Adverse Effect
on the Acquired Corporations.

capital stock of China Bottles. Except for the foregoing and except as noted
in the Companys audited financial statements, the Company does not make any
other representation or warranty in respect of China Bottles (other than as
to any agreements to which it is a party listed in Part 2.1(c) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule).

2.2(a) The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute
and deliver this Agreement and the Related Agreements to which it is a party,
to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder and to consummate the

delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company
of the Contemplated Transactions have been duly and validly authorized by all
necessary corporate action and no other corporate proceedings on the part of
the Company are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the
Contemplated Transactions (other than, with respect to the Merger, the
Required Company Stockholder Vote to be effected pursuant to the Majority
Stockholder Written Consent Agreements and the filing of the Certificates of
Merger required by the DGCL and NRS). The Board of Directors of the Company
has unanimously adopted this Agreement, declared it to be advisable and
resolved to recommend to the stockholders of the Company that they vote in
favor of the approval of this Agreement in accordance with the NRS. This
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company

generally and (ii) rules of law and equity governing specific performance,
injunctive relief and other equitable remedies. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

2.2(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of any of the Contemplated Transactions do or will, directly or
indirectly (with or without notice or lapse of time or both), (i) contravene,
conflict with, or result in a violation of any provision of
the Organizational Documents of any of the Acquired Corporations; (ii)
contravene, conflict with, or result in a violation of, any Legal
Requirements to which any of the Acquired Corporations, or any of the assets

or used by any of the Acquired Corporations, except, in the case of clauses
(ii), (iii), (iv), (iv), (v) and (vi), for any such conflicts,
violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences that would not prevent or
delay consummation of the Merger, or otherwise prevent the Company from
performing its obligations under this Agreement, or that could not reasonably
be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, result in a Material
Adverse Effect on the Acquired Corporations. 

  

2.2(c) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company do not, and
the performance of this Agreement and consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions by the Company will not, require any Consent of, or filing with

securities or "blue sky" laws (" _Blue Sky Laws_ "), (B) the filing of the
Certificates of Merger as required by the DGCL and NRS, and (C) filings made
in connection with applicable Antitrust Laws and investment laws set forth in
Part 2.2(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and (ii) such other
Consents, filings or notifications, where failure to obtain such Consents, or
to make such filings or notifications, would not prevent or delay the
consummation of the Merger, or otherwise prevent the Company from performing
its obligations under this Agreement, or that could not reasonably
be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, result in a Material
Adverse Effect on the Acquired Corporations. 

  

2.3 _Capitalization_. The authorized capital stock of the Company consists

SECTION 3: Representations and Warranties of Parent. 

   

Parent represents and warrants to the Company as follows: 

  

3.1 _Organization and Good Standing_. 

  

3.1(a) Parent and Merger Sub are corporations duly incorporated, validly
existing, and in good standing under the laws of their respective
jurisdictions of incorporation, with full corporate power and authority to
conduct their respective businesses as now being conducted, to own or
use their respective properties and assets that they purport to own or use,
and to perform all their respective obligations under Contracts to which
Parent or Merger Sub is party or by which Parent or Merger Sub or any of
their respective assets are bound. Parent and Merger Sub are duly
qualified to do business as foreign corporations and are in good standing
under the laws of each state or other jurisdiction in which either the
ownership or use of the properties owned or used by them, or the nature of
the activities conducted by them, requires such qualification, except where
the failure to be so qualified could not reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, result in a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent and Merger Sub, taken as a whole. 

  

3.1(b) Parent has made available to the Company through EDGAR copies of the
Organizational Documents of Parent, as currently in effect. 

  

3.2 _Authority; No Conflict_. Except for the requirement that Parent obtain
the Required Parent Stockholder Vote: 

  

3.2(a) Parent has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and the Related Agreements to which it is a party, to
perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the Contemplated
Transactions. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Related
Agreements to which Parent is a party by Parent and the consummation by Parent
of the Contemplated Transactions have been duly and validly authorized by all
necessary corporate action and no other corporate proceedings on the part of
Parent are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the
Contemplated Transactions (other than, with respect to the Merger, the
filing of the Certificate of Incorporation Amendment and, as required by the
DGCL and NRS, the Certificates of Merger). The Board of Directors of Parent
(the " _Parent Board_ ") has approved this Agreement and declared it to be
advisable. This Agreement and the Related Agreements to which Parent is a
party have been duly and validly executed and delivered by Parent and,
assuming the due execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company,
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent, enforceable
against Parent in accordance with their terms subject to the effect of (i)
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar
laws now or hereafter in effect relating to rights of creditors generally
and (ii) rules of law and equity governing specific performance, injunctive
relief and other equitable remedies. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

3.2(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the Related
Agreements to which Parent is a party, nor the consummation of any of the
Contemplated Transactions do or will, directly or indirectly (with or without
notice or lapse of time or both); (i) contravene, conflict with, or result in
a violation of any provision of the Organizational Documents of Parent or
Merger Sub; (ii) contravene, conflict with, or result in a violation of, any
Legal Requirements to which Parent or Merger Sub, or any of the assets owned
or used by Parent or Merger Sub, is subject; (iii) contravene, conflict with,
or result in a violation of any of the terms or requirements of, or give any

or modify, any Governmental Authorization that is held by Parent or Merger
Sub, or that otherwise relates to the business of, or any of the assets owned
or used by, Parent or Merger Sub; (iv) contravene, conflict with, or result
in a violation or breach of any provision of, or constitute a default under,
or give any Person the right to accelerate the maturity or performance of, or
to cancel, terminate, or modify, any Contract to which Parent or Merger Sub
is party or by which Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective assets
are bound; (v) require a Consent from any Person; or (vi) result in
the imposition or creation of any Encumbrance upon or with respect to any of
the assets owned or used by Parent or Merger Sub, except, in the case of
clauses (ii), (iii), (iv), (v) and (vi), for any such conflicts, violations,
breaches, defaults or other occurrences that would not prevent or
delay consummation of the Merger in any material respect, or otherwise
prevent Parent from performing its obligations under this Agreement in any
material respect, or that could not reasonably be expected to, individually
or in the aggregate, result in a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. 

  

3.2(c) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Related
Agreements to which Parent is a party by Parent, nor the performance of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions by Parent,
require any Consent of, or filing with or notification to, any Governmental
Body, except (i) for (A) applicable requirements, if any, of the Exchange Act,
the Securities Act, any national securities exchange on which the Parent
Common Stock is then listed, and Blue Sky Laws, (B) the filing of the
Certificates of Merger as required by the DGCL and NRS, (C) the filing of the
Certificate of Incorporation Amendment with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware, and (D) filings made in connection with applicable
Antitrust Laws and investment laws and (ii) such other Consents, filings or
notifications where failure to obtain such Consents, or to make such filings
or notifications, would not prevent or delay the consummation of the
Merger in any material respect, or would otherwise prevent Parent from
performing its obligations under this Agreement in any material respect, or
could not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, result
in a Material Adverse Effect on Parent and Merger Sub. 

  

3.2(d) The Merger Sub has all necessary corporate power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder
and thereunder and to consummate the Merger and the Contemplated
Transactions. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Merger
Sub and the consummation by the Merger Sub of the Contemplated Transactions
have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action and
no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Merger Sub are necessary to
authorize this Agreement or to consummate the Contemplated
Transactions (other than, with respect to the Merger, the approval and
adoption of this Agreement by the Parent as the holder of a majority of the
then outstanding shares of Merger Sub Common Stock and the filing of the
Certificates of Merger as required by the DGCL and NRS). The Board of
Directors of Merger Sub has unanimously approved this Agreement, declared it
to be advisable and resolved to recommend to Parent that it vote in favor of
the adoption of this Agreement in accordance with the DGCL. This Agreement
has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Merger Sub
and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Merger Sub,
enforceable against the Merger Sub in accordance with its terms. 

  

3.3 _Capitalization_. The authorized capital stock of Parent consists of
250,000,000 shares of Parent Common Stock and 1,000,000 shares of preferred
stock, $0.001 par value per share (" _Parent Preferred Stock_ "). As of the
date hereof, (a) 67,646,800 shares of Parent Common Stock are issued and
outstanding, all of which are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid

or other obligations relating to the issued or unissued capital stock of
Parent or Merger Sub, or obligating Parent or Merger Sub to issue, grant or
sell any shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests in, or
securities convertible into equity interests in, Parent or Merger Sub. Each
outstanding share of capital stock of Merger Sub is duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable and each such share owned by Parent or
Merger Sub is free and clear of all Encumbrances of any nature whatsoever.
None of the outstanding equity securities or other securities of Parent or
Merger Sub was issued in violation of the Securities Act or any other
Legal Requirement. Parent is in control of Merger Sub for purposes of Section
368(a)(2)(D) of the Code. 

  

    #####

correct and complete copy of each report, registration statement and
definitive proxy statement filed by Parent with the SEC (the " _Parent SEC

or superseded) contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. 

  

3.5 _Financial Statements_. The financial statements and notes contained
or incorporated by reference in Parent SEC Reports fairly present the
financial condition and the results of operations, changes in stockholders
equity, and cash flow of Parent and Merger Sub as at the respective dates of
and for the periods referred to in such financial statements, all
in accordance with GAAP and Regulation S-X of the SEC, subject, in the case
of interim financial statements, to normal recurring year-end adjustments
(the effect of which will not, individually or in the aggregate, be
materially adverse) and the omission of notes to the extent permitted
by Regulation S-X of the SEC or GAAP.

included in the Form S-4 Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy and
Information Statement/Prospectus which is required to be described in an
amendment of, or a supplement to, the Form S-4 Registration Statement or the
Joint Proxy and Information Statement/Prospectus so that such document does
not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party learning

and Parent and the Company shall promptly file with the SEC any
necessary amendment or supplement to the Form S-4 Registration Statement or

Company shall, as required by Legal Requirements, disseminate the information
contained in such amendment or supplement to holders of Parent Common Stock
and Company Common Stock; provided that, no amendment or supplement will be

consultation between Parent and the Company and providing Parent and the
Company with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such amendment
or supplement.

memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement,
merger agreement, or similar agreement (each, a " _Purchase Document_ ")
relating to proposed acquisitions by an Acquired Corporation of the assets
or equity interests of any other Person (a " _Proposed Acquired Person_ " and
each of such currently proposed acquisitions, a " _Proposed Acquisition_ ").
Prior to the closing of any Proposed Acquisition, or any other permitted
acquisition, the Company will obtain the financial statements (including,
in each case, any notes thereto) and related pro forma financial information
that would be required, pursuant to Regulation S-X, to be contained in the
Joint Proxy and Information Statement/Prospectus and the Form S-4
Registration Statement (the " _Acquisition Financial Statements_ "). All
Acquisition Financial Statements will (i) comply with the rules and
regulations of the SEC (including Regulation S-X), (ii) be prepared in
accordance with GAAP, (iii) fairly present in all material respects the
financial condition and the results of operations, changes in stockholders
equity and cash flow of the respective Proposed Acquired Persons as at the
respective dates of and for the periods referred to in such financial
statements, subject, in the case of interim financial statements of any such
Proposed Acquired Person, to (A) the omission of notes to the
extent permitted by Regulation S-X, and (B) normal, recurring year-end
adjustments (the effect of which will not, individually or in the aggregate,
be materially adverse to such Proposed Acquired Person), and (iv) be
accompanied by an unqualified opinion of a registered independent
public accounting firm acceptable to Parent and qualified to practice before
the PCAOB. 

  

5.3 _Exchange Listing_. Parent agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts
to continue the quotation of Parent Common Stock on the American Stock
Exchange, New York Stock Exchange or another national securities exchange

5.4 _Access to Information_ _._ Each of Parent and the Company shall afford to
each others officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other
representatives, reasonable access (subject to Legal Requirements regarding
the sharing of such information), during normal business hours, and upon
reasonable prior notice, during the period from the date hereof through
the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement, to its (and the
Company shall provide Parent with such access to each Proposed Acquired
Persons or other permitted acquisitions) properties, books, contracts,
commitments, personnel and records in a manner commensurate with due
diligence conducted by any party prior to the date hereof. Any investigation
conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this Section 5.4 shall be
conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the conduct
of the business of the parties or their respective Subsidiaries or
the Proposed Acquired Persons, as the case may be, or create a risk of damage
or destruction to any property or assets of the parties or their respective
Subsidiaries. During such period, the Company and Parent shall furnish or
make available promptly to each other (except as otherwise available on
EDGAR) (a) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other
document filed or received by it during such period pursuant to the
requirements of federal or state securities laws and (b) all other
information concerning its business, properties, assets and personnel as the
other may reasonably request. Parent and the Company, as the case may be,
will hold any such information which is nonpublic in confidence in accordance
with the Confidentiality Agreement. No information or knowledge obtained in
any investigation pursuant to this Section 5.4 or otherwise shall affect or
be deemed to modify any representation or warranty contained in
this Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of the parties to
consummate the Merger. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and the Company
may restrict or otherwise prohibit access to any documents or information to
the extent that (i) access to such documents or information would risk of
waiver of any attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other
applicable privilege applicable to such documents or information or (ii)
access to a Contract to which any of the Acquired Corporations or Parent and
Merger Sub is a party or otherwise bound would violate or cause a default
under, or give a third party the right terminate or accelerate the rights
under, such Contract. 

   

5.5 _Parent Stockholders  Meeting_. 

  

5.5(a) Parent, acting through Parents Board, shall take all actions in
accordance with Legal Requirements, the Organizational Documents of Parent
and the rules of the American Stock Exchange, New York Stock Exchange or
other applicable national securities exchange to promptly and duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold as promptly as practicable, and in any
event within forty-five (45) days after the declaration of effectiveness of
the Form S-4 Registration Statement, the Parent Stockholders Meeting for the
purpose of considering and voting upon (i) the adoption of this Merger
Agreement by the stockholders of Parent, (ii) the issuance of Parent
Common Stock in the Merger and (iii) the adoption of the Certificate of
Incorporation Amendment (the " _Parent Voting Proposal_ "). In connection
therewith (A) the Parent Board shall recommend approval of the Parent Voting
Proposal by the stockholders of Parent and include such recommendation in
the Joint Proxy and Information Statement/Prospectus, (B) neither the Parent
Board nor any committee thereof shall withdraw, qualify or modify, or
publicly propose to withdraw, qualify or modify in any manner adverse to the
Company the recommendation of the Parent Board that the Parents stockholders
vote in favor of the Parent Voting Proposal, and (C) Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of
the Parent Voting Proposal and shall take all other action necessary or
advisable to secure the Required Parent Stockholder Vote. Nothing contained
in this Section 5.5 or otherwise contained in this Agreement shall be deemed
to prohibit Parent from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
with respect to a tender offer contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any required disclosure to
Parents stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Parent Board,
after consultation with outside counsel, such action is required under
applicable Legal Requirements. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

5.5(b) Except to the extent required by Legal Requirements, Parent shall not
(i) change the date specified in the Joint Proxy and Information
Statement/Prospectus for the Parent Stockholders Meeting or (ii) postpone,
delay or adjourn the Parent Stockholders Meeting, except, in each case, (A)
to the extent necessary to ensure that any amendment or supplement to the
Joint Proxy and Information Statement/Prospectus required by applicable Legal
Requirements is provided to the stockholders of Parent sufficiently in
advance of the Parent Stockholders Meeting, or (B) if there are an
insufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock represented in person or
by proxy at the Parent Stockholders Meeting to constitute a quorum or
otherwise to approve the Parent Voting Proposal, in which case Parent may
postpone, delay, or adjourn the Parent Stockholders Meeting and use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain a quorum and/or the Required Parent
Stockholder Vote as promptly as practicable in the prevailing
circumstances.

all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested in connection
therewith. The Company and Parent shall each use all commercially
reasonable efforts (subject to Legal Requirements regarding the sharing of

application or other filing to be made pursuant to the rules and regulations
of any Legal Requirement (including all information required to be

transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any Antitrust Law.

proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in connection
with proceedings under or relating to any Antitrust Law. Parent shall be
entitled to direct any proceedings or negotiations with any Governmental
Body relating to any of the foregoing, provided that it shall afford the
Company a reasonable opportunity to participate therein. In furtherance and
not in limitation of the foregoing, the Company shall (i) keep Parent
informed of any communication received from, or given to, any Governmental
Body and of any communication received from or given to any Person (other than

Affiliates of the Company) in connection with any proceeding by a private
party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby,
and (ii) permit Parent to review in advance any communication given by the
