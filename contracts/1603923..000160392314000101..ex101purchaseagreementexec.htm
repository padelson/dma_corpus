ARTICLE II

PURCHASE PRICE AND CLOSING



2.1 Place and Date. The closing of the sale and purchase of the Domestic
Assets and the Domestic Shares (the "Domestic Closing") shall take place at
10:00 A.M. local time at the offices of Winston and Strawn LLP, 1111 Louisiana,
25th Floor, Houston, Texas effective at the commencement of business on the
third Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to
the obligations of the parties set forth herein (other than conditions that by
their terms are to be satisfied on the Closing Date, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of those conditions), or at such other place and on
such other date and time as the parties may mutually agree in writing. The day
on which the Domestic Closing occurs is herein referred to as the "Closing
Date," and the effective time of the Domestic Closing shall be 11:59 p.m. EST
on the Closing Date. The closings of the sale and purchase of the Foreign
Assets (the "Foreign Closings") shall take place on the Closing Date at such
places and such times as may be specified in the respective Foreign
Acquisition Agreements, or on such other date and time as the parties mutually
agree in writing.



2.2 Purchase Price. The purchase price for the Assets and the Shares to be
sold and purchased hereby is SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS
($750,000,000) (the "Closing Purchase Price"), as adjusted pursuant to this
Agreement (including after the Closing pursuant to Section 2.6 and Exhibit F)
(collectively, with the Closing Purchase Price, the "Purchase Price"). The
Purchase Price will be paid or caused to be paid by Acquiror, for its own
account and for the account of each of the Buyers, to Weatherford for its
account and for the account of each of the Sellers in accordance with this
Agreement and the Foreign Acquisition Agreements. The Purchase Price shall be
paid by the wire transfer of immediately available funds to such bank account
or accounts as per written instructions of Weatherford given to Acquiror at
least three Business Days prior to the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or the timing of the Foreign Closings, the full Closing Purchase
Price shall be paid by Acquiror or one or more Buyers to Weatherford or an
Asset Seller as of the date of Domestic Closing, subject to the requirements
of Section 1.4(b) as it relates to Foreign Closings occurring after such date.
Acquiror and Buyers shall comply with withholding tax obligations, if any,
imposed in connection with the payment of Purchase Price, including the
Closing Purchase Price. Any withholding tax paid over by Acquiror and Buyers
to Governmental Authorities shall be treated as a payment of the Purchase
Price and the amount otherwise payable by Acquiror and Buyers to Weatherford
and the Sellers pursuant to this Agreement shall be reduced by the amount of
such withholding tax. If Acquiror or any Buyer determines that it needs to
withhold any portion of the Purchase Price, Acquiror shall provide Weatherford
with reasonable notice and shall work in good faith with Weatherford to reduce
or eliminate the need to withhold. For the avoidance of doubt, Acquiror and
Buyers will not be required to gross-up the Purchase Price for any such
withholding tax.

2.3 Assumption of Liabilities.

(a) At the respective Closings for the Assets, Acquiror or another Buyer shall

Liabilities relating to the Business, whether arising prior to, on or after

3.1.22.



2.5 Allocation of Purchase Price.

(a)Acquiror and Weatherford shall cooperate to determine the allocation of the
Purchase Price (prior to adjustments) among the various Sellers of the Assets
and Share Sellers in advance of the Closing Date. To the extent that the
Acquiror and Weatherford do not agree to such allocation prior to the Closing
Date, the Acquiror and Weatherford shall cooperate following the Closing Date
to make such determination, provided that if within one hundred and eighty
days (180) of the Closing Date the parties are unable to agree as to such
allocation, each party shall allocate the Purchase Price among the various
Sellers of the Assets and Share Sellers as each such party determines in its
own discretion.



(b)To the extent that Acquiror and Weatherford agree to an allocation of the
Purchase Price that is paid to a Seller of any Asset, Acquiror and Weatherford
shall cooperate following the Closing Date to allocate such portion of the
Purchase Price and the applicable Assumed Liabilities of such Seller among the
various Assets sold by such Seller, provided that if within one hundred and
eighty (180) days of the Closing Date the parties are unable to agree as to
such allocation, each party shall allocate the applicable portion of the
Purchase Price and applicable Assumed Liabilities among the various Assets as
each party determines in its own discretion.



(c)Any adjustments to the Purchase Price hereunder shall be allocated among
the various Asset Sellers and Share Sellers consistently with the basis for
any such adjustment as mutually agreed by the Acquiror and Weatherford,
provided that if the Acquiror and Weatherford cannot agree to the allocation
of such adjustment, each party shall allocate such adjustment as each party
determines in its own discretion.



(d)To the extent that Acquiror and Weatherford agree to an allocation under
Section 2.5(a) or Section 2.5(b) or Section 2.5(c), Acquiror and Weatherford
shall, and shall cause their applicable Affiliates, to file all relevant
Returns consistently with such agreed allocation. To the extent that any such
allocation is challenged by any Taxing Authority during the course of any
audit or other legal proceedings, the Acquiror or Weatherford, as the case may
be, shall provide reasonable notice to the other party of such challenge.



2.6 Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment.

(a) Within 120 days after the Closing Date, Acquiror will prepare and deliver
or cause to be prepared and delivered to Weatherford a combined balance sheet
of the Business acquired pursuant hereto and the Foreign Acquisition
Agreements as of the Closing (the "Closing Date Balance Sheet") and a proposed
statement of the Net Working Capital prepared therefrom (the "Closing
Statement"). The Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement (i) will
reflect, respectively, the financial position of the Business acquired
pursuant hereto and the Foreign Acquisition Agreements on a combined basis and
the components and calculation of the Net Working Capital, in each case as of
the Closing and (ii) will be prepared and determined as of the Closing
consistent with Weatherford's policies, procedures, practices and
methodologies set forth on Schedule 3.1.4(b). The Net Working Capital as of
the Closing Date determined in accordance with this Section 2.6 is referred to
herein as the "Closing Working Capital Balance." The portion of the Closing
Working Capital Balance relating to



Inventories located at the sites described on Exhibit E shall be prepared
based on a physical inventory performed by Weatherford and Acquiror at such
sites, which shall be carried out in accordance with the procedures, including
the measurement procedures, specified in Schedule 3.1.4(b), and shall be
commenced on or about the Closing Date and shall be completed within five
Business Days after the Closing Date.

(b) If, within 60 days after the date of Acquiror's delivery of the Closing
Date Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement, Weatherford determines in good
faith that the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement have not
been prepared or determined in accordance with this Agreement, Weatherford may
give written notice to Acquiror within such 60 day period (i) setting forth
Weatherford's proposed changes to the Closing Date Balance Sheet as prepared
by Acquiror and the determination by Weatherford of the Closing Working
Capital Balance and (ii) specifying in reasonable detail Weatherford's basis
for disagreement with Acquiror's preparation and determination of the Closing
Date Balance Sheet and the Closing Working Capital Balance. The failure by
Weatherford to so express disagreement and provide such notice within such 60
day period will constitute acceptance of Acquiror's preparation of the Closing
Date Balance Sheet and computation of the Closing Working Capital Balance. If
Acquiror and Weatherford are unable to resolve any disagreement between them
with respect to the preparation of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the
determination of the Closing Working Capital Balance within 15 days after the
giving of notice by Weatherford to Acquiror of such disagreement, the dispute
may be referred by Acquiror or Weatherford for determination to the Houston,
Texas office of Grant Thornton LLP (or, if they are unable or unwilling to
serve, another mutually acceptable internationally recognized accounting firm
(the "Accountants")). Within 15 days of such referral, each party shall
submit, in writing, detailed briefs to the Accountants setting forth their
position, and the Accountants shall make a written determination as promptly
as practicable, but in any event within 30 days after the date on which the
dispute is referred to the Accountants. The Accountants will not disclose
either party's position to the other party. Neither Acquiror nor Weatherford
shall be entitled to respond to the brief provided by the other party to the
Accountants. The Accountants may ask and receive responses in writing from one
or both parties in order to clarify such party's position. The Accountants are
authorized to select only the Closing Working Capital Balance as presented by
Acquiror or Weatherford and shall not select any other amount as the Closing
Working Capital Balance. The costs and expenses of the Accountants shall be
borne by the party against whom the dispute is decided. No party will disclose
to the Accountants, and the Accountants will not consider for any purposes,
any settlement discussions or settlement offer made by any party. The decision
of the Accountants shall be final and binding on the parties.

(c) During the period that Weatherford's advisors and personnel are conducting
their review of Acquiror's preparation of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and
determination of the Closing Working Capital Balance until the final
determination of the Closing Working Capital Balance, Weatherford and its
Representatives will have reasonable access during normal business hours to
the work papers prepared by or on behalf of Acquiror and its Representatives
in connection with Acquiror's preparation of the Closing Statement and
determination of the Closing Working Capital Balance; provided, however, that
Weatherford will conduct such review in a manner that does not unreasonably
interfere with the conduct of the businesses of Acquiror.



(d) Any amounts collected with respect to any accounts receivable of the
Business that are included in the Net Working Capital but that are reserved
against and excluded from computing the Net Working Capital as of Closing (the
"Reserved Accounts Receivable") prior to the final determination of the
Closing Working Capital Balance in accordance with this Section 2.6 will be
included as a current asset in the calculation of the Closing Working Capital
Balance to the extent so collected prior to such determination. If, prior to
the one year anniversary of the date of the Domestic Closing, the Acquiror or
any of its Affiliates collects any Reserved Accounts Receivable that were not
added back to the Closing Working Capital Balance in accordance with the
immediately preceding sentence, then the Acquiror or its Affiliates will
promptly remit all such amounts to Weatherford. During the one year period
after the date of the Domestic Closing, Acquiror or its Affiliates shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with their own respective
collection practices in collecting any such Reserved Accounts Receivable;
provided that the Acquiror or its Affiliates will not be required to expend
amounts for any third party out-of-pocket costs or expenses to collect such
Reserved Accounts Receivable, unless Weatherford or its Affiliates agrees in
writing to reimburse the Acquiror or its Affiliates for all such amounts.

2.7 Adjustments to Purchase Price.

(a) Upon the final determination of the Closing Working Capital Balance, the
parties shall make the following adjustments:

(i) If the Closing Working Capital Balance exceeds the Working Capital Target
by $1,000,000 or more, then the Purchase Price will be increased by, and
Acquiror will pay to Weatherford, the amount of the difference between the
Closing Working Capital Balance and the Working Capital Target.

(ii) If the Closing Working Capital Balance is less than the Working Capital
Target by $1,000,000 or more, then the Purchase Price will be decreased by,
and Weatherford will pay to Acquiror, the amount of the difference between the
Working Capital Target and the Closing Working Capital Balance.

(b) Any payment in respect of an adjustment required to be made under Section
2.7 will be made by Acquiror or Weatherford, as applicable, in cash by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to one account specified by Acquiror
or Weatherford in writing, within five Business Days following the final
determination with respect to the Closing Working Capital Balance.

2.8 Consent of Third Parties. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign or
transfer any instrument, contract, lease, licenses, permit or other agreement
or arrangement or any claim, right or benefit arising thereunder or resulting
therefrom if an assignment or transfer or an attempt to make such an
assignment or transfer without the consent or approval of a third party would
constitute a breach or violation thereof or affect adversely the rights of the
Buyers or the Asset Sellers thereunder and such consent or approval has not
been obtained by the Closing; and any transfer or assignment to the Buyers by
the Asset Sellers of any interest under any such instrument, contract, lease,
licenses permit or other



agreement or arrangement that requires the consent of a third party shall be
made following the Closing subject to such consent or approval being obtained.
In the event any such consent or approval is not obtained on or prior to the
Closing Date, Weatherford shall use all reasonable efforts to obtain any such
approval or consent as soon as reasonably possible after the Closing Date, and
Weatherford will cooperate with Acquiror and the other Buyers in any lawful
arrangement to provide that Acquiror or another Buyer shall receive the
interest of the Asset Sellers in the benefits under any such instrument,
contract, lease or permit or other agreement or arrangement, including
performance by the Asset Sellers, as agent, provided that the Acquiror or
another Buyer shall pay or satisfy the corresponding expenses and Liabilities
for the enjoyment of such benefit to the extent the Acquiror or another Buyer
would have been responsible therefor hereunder if such consent or approval had
been obtained.

2.9 Tax Treatment. All adjustments to the Purchase Price under Section 2.7
shall be treated for Tax purposes as adjustments to the Purchase Price to the
extent permitted under applicable Law and shall be allocated as provided in
Section 2.5.

2.10 Proration Procedures. Following the Closing, Weatherford and Acquiror
agree to the following proration procedures relating to processing costs and
expenses that are allocable in part to each of the parties:

(i) If Weatherford or its Affiliates, on the one hand, or Acquiror or its
Affiliates, on the other hand, receives an invoice for expenses that are
allocable partly to it and partly to the other party based on the allocation
of Liabilities set forth in Sections 2.3 and 2.4, the recipient shall pay such
invoice in full promptly and shall promptly advise the other party that such
invoice has been received and shall request the appropriate reimbursement from
the other party. The party owing such reimbursement shall pay such
reimbursement to the other party within fifteen (15) days after receipt of an
invoice for the reimbursable amount, together with a copy of the original
invoice and such other party's calculation of the reimbursement amount.

(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever time permits, Weatherford or its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and Acquiror or its Affiliates, on the other
hand, shall use its respective commercially reasonable efforts to consult with
each other in determining each party's appropriate allocable share of any
payment or expense due and shall remit or pay, as applicable, the allocable
share to the party entitled to or responsible for, as applicable, under this
paragraph for such payment or the paying of such expense in a timely fashion.

(iii) Weatherford and Acquiror shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to, use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
substantially complete all prorations within one hundred twenty (120) days
after the Closing Date.

neither any Employee, Weatherford nor any Asset Seller with respect to the
Business nor any Target Company is a party or subject to, or bound by any
collective bargaining agreement or other agreement with any labor union, trade
union, works council or representative of employees and to the knowledge of
Weatherford there are no labor unions, trade unions, work councils or other

of applicable Law pertaining to the employment of Employees, including all
such laws relating to labor relations, collective bargaining, recordkeeping,
immigration, employee leave, equal employment, fair employment practices,
entitlements, non-retaliation, prohibited discrimination, or other similar
employment practices or acts, except for any failure so to comply that,
individually or together with all such other failures, has not and will not
result in a material Liability on the part of Acquiror or other Buyer or the

of the Business will have been paid in full on or prior to Closing or, if not

3.1.23. Employee Benefit Plans and Related Matters.

(a) Schedule 3.1.23(a) lists all Plans sponsored, maintained or contributed to
or required to be contributed to by Weatherford, any Asset Seller or any of
their respective ERISA Affiliates or for which Weatherford, any Asset Seller
or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has any Liability, in each case,
applicable to employees of, or who primarily provide services with respect to,
the Business or a Target Company (the "Employees") and their beneficiaries and
dependents (each such Plan, and "Employee Plan," and collectively, the
"Employee Plans") and also lists such Plans that are applicable to each Target
Company (the "TC Plans"), other than any Non-U.S. Plans and any "multiemployer
plans" within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA. Each of the Employee
Plans, the TC Plans and any corresponding trust intended to qualify under
Sections 401(a) and 501(a) of the Code or comparable provision of non-U.S. law
do so qualify and the IRS (or other comparable non-U.S. Governmental
Authority) has issued a favorable determination letter with respect to such
qualification of such Employee Plan and TC Plan, and to the knowledge of
Weatherford, nothing has occurred since the date of the last determination
letter that could reasonably be expected to cause such Employee Plan or TC
Plan to lose such tax qualification. All of the Employee Plans and TC Plans
have been administered in material compliance with their terms and any
applicable collective bargaining agreement and with the requirements of any
applicable Law, including ERISA and the Code. Weatherford has delivered or
made available to Acquiror true and complete copies or descriptions of all of
the Employee Plans and TC Plans (including any amendments or supplements
thereto) and descriptions of all unwritten plans and, where applicable,
related trusts, including all amendments.

(b) At no time during the six (6) years prior to the date of this Agreement,
have Weatherford, any Asset Seller, and Target Company or their respective
ERISA Affiliates sponsored, maintained, contributed to or participated in an
Employee Plan or TC Plan that was or is subject to Section 302 or Title IV of
ERISA or Section 412 of the Code or to a "multiemployer plan" within



the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA. No Employee Plan or TC Plan is a
"multiple employer plan" within the meaning of Section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA.

(c) No Employee is or may become entitled to post-employment benefits of any
kind by reason of employment in the Business, including death or medical
benefits (whether or not insured), other than (a) coverage provided pursuant
to the terms of any Employee Plan or TC Plan specifically identified as
providing such coverage on Schedules 3.1.23(c)(1) or (d) (and setting forth
the employees eligible to participate in such Employee Plan) or mandated by
Section 4980B of the Code, (b) retirement benefits payable under any Employee
Plan or TC Plan qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code or under comparable
provisions of non-U.S. law or (c) other than statutorily required plans
outside of the U.S. (a "Non-U.S. Plan"). Except as set forth on Schedule
3.1.23(c)(2), the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the Foreign Acquisition Agreements or the Ancillary Agreements will
not result in the payment of any bonus or other incentive or any increase in
the amount of compensation or benefits or the acceleration of the vesting or
timing of payment of any compensation or benefits payable to or in respect of
any Transferred Employee.

(d) Schedule 3.1.23(d) lists each Employee Plan and TC Plan that is maintained
outside of the U.S. or is not subject to applicable Law in the U.S., other
than statutorily required under a Non-U.S. Plan. With respect to each Non-U.S.
Plan: (i) all employer and employee contributions to each Non-U.S. Plan
required by applicable Law or by the terms of such Non-U.S. Plan have been
made, or, if applicable, accrued in accordance with applicable accounting
practices; (ii) each Non-U.S. Plan required to be registered has been
registered and each Non-U.S. Plan has been maintained in good standing with
applicable Governmental Authorities and administered and funded in material
compliance with applicable Laws and other requirements, and (iii) there have
not occurred, nor are there continuing, any breaches of fiduciary duty under
any Law or regulation in connection with a Non-U.S. Plan. Each Non-U.S. Plan
is now and has been operated in material compliance with applicable Laws and
other requirements. There are no currently pending or, to the knowledge of
Weatherford, threatened claims by a Governmental Authority with respect to any
Non-U.S. Plan. Each Non-U.S. Plan that is intended to qualify for special tax
treatment meets all the material requirements for such treatment.

3.1.24. Brokers or Finders, etc. All negotiations relating to this Agreement,
the Foreign Acquisition Agreements, the Ancillary Agreements, and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, have been carried on without the
participation of any Person acting on behalf of Weatherford or any Asset
Sellers or a Target Company, in such manner as to give rise to any claim
against Acquiror or any of its Affiliates for any brokerage or finder's
commission, fee or similar compensation.

3.1.25. Product Liability. Except as would not result in a material Liability,
each product manufactured, sold or delivered by Weatherford or its Affiliates

been recalled by Weatherford or its Affiliates in connection with the Business
or (ii) Proceedings (whether completed or pending) seeking the recall,

no director, officer, employee or Affiliate of Weatherford or any Asset Seller
with respect to the Business or a Target Company has any Debt in respect of
the Business. Except as disclosed in Schedule 3.1.26, neither Weatherford nor
any of its Affiliates (i) is a party to any Contract providing for a payment
by Weatherford or its Affiliates for goods or services in excess of $500,000
per year or $1,000,000 in the aggregate during the term thereof (excluding
intercompany agreements that will terminate at Closing) with any Asset Seller

interest in any material property used by the Business as conducted as of the
date of this Agreement (other than the Assets, the assets of the Target
Companies, the Excluded Assets or assets to be utilized in performing services
under the Transition Services Agreement).

institution and other financial institution with which the Target Companies
have any accounts or safe deposit boxes and the names of all Persons
authorized to draw thereon or to have access thereto.

inventory is obsolete, damaged, defective or of below standard quality.

shall not be deemed to cure any breach of a covenant or agreement or to
satisfy a condition. Each party to this Agreement shall promptly notify the
other parties of the threat or commencement of any legal proceeding before the
Closing that could in any way affect the ability of such party to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby.



4.4 No Negotiation. From the date of this Agreement through the earlier of the
Closing Date or the date on which this Agreement is earlier terminated
pursuant to ARTICLE VIII, neither Weatherford nor any of its Affiliates or
Representatives shall, directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate or encourage
any inquiries or proposals from, discuss or negotiate with, provide any
information to or consider any inquiries or proposals from, any Person (other
than Acquiror and its Affiliates and Representatives) relating to any
transaction involving the sale of all or any portion of the Business, whether
affected by sale of assets, sale of stock, merger or otherwise and Weatherford
will engage in negotiations relating to the sale of the Business with Acquiror
and its Representatives on an exclusive basis. Weatherford shall (i) ensure
that its Affiliates and Representatives are aware of the provisions of this
Section 4.4, and (ii) be responsible for any breaches by any such parties of
this Section 4.4. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the
restrictions and limitations set forth in this Section 4.4 restrict or
otherwise limit a sale or change of control transaction involving all of
Weatherford International plc, regardless of the form of such transaction;
provided, however, any such transaction shall not impact the continuing
validity and enforceability of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby

4.5 Non-Competition. Weatherford agrees for the benefit of the Acquiror and
Buyers that, effective as of the Closing Date and thereafter until the earlier
of (a) the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date and (b) as to any particular
jurisdiction, the maximum permitted period, neither it nor any of its
Affiliates shall, directly or indirectly, conduct or participate or engage in
any business that is competitive with the product lines and related services
offered by the (i) the Engineered Chemistry Business on the date hereof or on
the Closing Date anywhere in the world or (ii) the Integrity Business anywhere
in the United States (the applicable territorial restrictions set forth in
clauses (i) and (ii) above referred to as a "Restricted Territory"); provided,
however, that this clause shall not prevent, nor shall it be construed to
prevent Weatherford or any of its Affiliates from (t) engaging in or owning
any portion of the business conducted as of the date hereof by the India JV,
and its subsidiaries, (u) engaging in or owning all or portion of any business
engaged as of the date hereof in the Pressure Pumping Business, (v) engaging
in or owning all or portion of any business engaged in the Integrity Business
outside the United States, or (w) making any acquisition (whether by way of
assets, stock, or otherwise) of an interest in, or any investment in, in
either case whether directly or indirectly, and thereafter operate any
business or entity that derives 20% or less of its gross revenues from the
sale or provision of goods or services that are competitive with the Business
in a Restricted Territory. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Weatherford may
acquire a business or entity that derives more than 20% of its gross revenues
from the sale or provision of goods or services that are competitive with the
Business in the applicable Restricted Territory, provided (1) that such
activities do not constitute and are not anticipated to constitute the primary
activity of such business or entity and (2) that Weatherford and its
Affiliates shall promptly (and in any event within 15 months) after any such
acquisition sell, spin off or otherwise divest itself of the division, unit or
other portion of the acquired business or entity that provides such
competitive goods and services; provided prior to any such sale, spin off or
divestiture to a third party (i) Weatherford shall reasonably cooperate with
Acquiror and its Affiliates for up to 30 days to enable it to have the
opportunity to make an offer to Weatherford or its Affiliates to acquire such
division, unit or other portion of the acquired business or entity that
provides such competitive goods and services, which Weatherford or its
Affiliates can accept or reject in its sole discretion, and (ii) during such
30 day period, Weatherford shall be permitted to negotiate and/or discuss with
other third parties at the same time Weatherford is cooperating with Acquiror
in connection with such sale, spin off or divestiture. Weatherford
acknowledges and agrees



that the restrictions set forth in this Section 4.5 are necessary to protect
the goodwill that Weatherford and the Asset Sellers are selling herein and
that Weatherford's agreement to the covenants set forth in this Section 4.5 is
an express condition of Acquiror's entry into this Agreement. Weatherford
further agrees that the restrictions set forth in this Section 4.5 are the
result of arm's-length bargaining and are fair and reasonable in all respects
and are fair and reasonable in light of: (1) the nature and wide geographic
scope of the operation of the Business, which is conducted throughout the
Restricted Territory; (2) Weatherford's and its Affiliates' level of control
over, contact with, knowledge of confidential information about, and
association with the goodwill of, the Business in all jurisdictions in which
it is conducted; and (3) the consideration that Weatherford and is receiving
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
amount of goodwill for which Acquiror is paying. Weatherford further
acknowledges that a remedy at law for any breach or attempted breach of this
Section will be inadequate and further agrees that any breach of this Section
will result in irreparable harm to the Acquiror and the Business, and Acquiror
shall be entitled to immediate injunctive relief in connection with any breach
of this Section. Each provision of this Section shall be interpreted in such
manner as to be effective and valid under applicable Law, but if any provision
of this Section shall be prohibited by or invalid under applicable Law, such
provision shall be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or
invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the
remaining provisions of this Section. If any provision of this Section shall,
for any reason, be judged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid
or unenforceable, such judgment shall not affect, impair or invalidate the
remainder of this Section but shall be confined in its operation to the
provision of this Section directly involved in the controversy in which such
judgment shall have been rendered. In the event that the provisions of this
Section should ever be deemed to exceed the scope, time or geographic
limitations permitted by applicable Law, then such provision shall be reformed
to the maximum scope, time or geographic limitations permitted by applicable
Law. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, except with respect to
any investment company or fund that has not made other significant investments
involving companies in the oilfield services industry, the terms of this
Section shall not be binding on any non-Affiliate successor or acquiror of
Weatherford or any non-Affiliate acquiror of all of Weatherford's business.

4.6 Confidentiality.

(a) From and after the Closing Date, Weatherford shall not, and shall cause
its Affiliates and any officers, directors, employees and Representatives of
Weatherford or such Affiliates not to, in perpetuity, disclose to any Person
any confidential information regarding the Business, including information
relating to business marketing, pricing, technologies, trade secrets,
processes, customers, suppliers, financial data, statistics or research,
Intellectual Property, and development and any information derived from any of
them, but not including information that is or becomes generally available to
the public other than as a result of disclosure by Weatherford or any of its
Affiliates or any Representative of Weatherford or such Affiliates, provided
that Weatherford and its Affiliates may disclose information that Weatherford
or any of its Affiliates is required to disclose by applicable Law (including
securities laws) or legal process.





(b) Weatherford acknowledges that Acquiror and its Affiliates would be
irreparably damaged in the event of a breach or a threatened breach of any of
Weatherford's obligations under this Section 4.6, and agrees (and shall cause
each of its Affiliates to agree) that, in the event of a breach or a
threatened breach of any such obligation, Acquiror shall, in addition to all
other rights and remedies available to it in respect of such breach, be
entitled to obtain an injunction from a court of competent jurisdiction
granting it specific performance of the provisions of this Section 4.6.

4.7 Use of Business Names by Acquiror. To the extent the trademarks, service
marks, brand names or trade, corporate or business names of Weatherford or of
any of Weatherford's Affiliates or divisions are used by the Business on
stationery, signage, invoices, receipts, forms, packaging, advertising and
promotional materials, product, training and service literature and materials
or like materials ("Marked Materials") at the Closing, Acquiror and its
Affiliates (including the Target Companies) may use such Marked Materials
after the Closing for a period of six months (as concerns signage) or three
months (as concerns all other Marked Materials), in each case without altering
or modifying such Marked Materials, or removing such trademarks, service
marks, brand names, or trade, corporate or business names, but neither
Acquiror nor any of its Affiliates (including the Target Companies) shall
thereafter use such trademarks, service marks, brand names or trade, corporate
or business names in any other manner without the prior written consent of
Weatherford. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent the trademarks,
service marks, brand names or trade, corporate or business names of
Weatherford or of any of Weatherford's Affiliates or divisions appear on
Inventory at the Closing, Acquiror and its Affiliates (including the Target
Companies) may sell such Inventory indefinitely without altering or modifying
such Inventory, or removing such trademarks, service marks, brand names, or
trade, corporate or business names.

4.8 Master Agreements; Retained Contracts.

(a) From the date hereof until the expiration of twelve (12) months after the

Retained Contracts to the extent any such products or services thereunder
relate to the Business for the purpose of obtaining in Acquiror's (or its
Affiliates') own name such of those products or services related to the
Business as it may require. Acquiror shall promptly reimburse Weatherford for
any reasonable out-of-pocket documented charges or other reasonable out-of-

Weatherford or from the customer), provide the products or services required
to be provided by such agreement in accordance with the terms thereof that
Weatherford had been providing prior to the Closing Date in the Ordinary
Course of Business. Weatherford will take, or cause



its Affiliates to take, such actions as may be reasonably requested by
Acquiror in connection with the customers of the Business under such
Weatherford Master Agreements, including (x) using commercially reasonable
efforts to have such customers enter into separate agreements for the benefit
of Acquiror with respect to the Business or agree to agree to assign the
portion of the Weatherford Master Agreement related to the Business to
Acquiror or Buyer, (y) with respect to communications with such customers or
(z) to terminate the obligations of the Business to any customer if so
requested by Acquiror. Weatherford will promptly remit to Acquiror any amounts
received by Weatherford under any such Weatherford Master Agreement after the

accordance with the following sentence), Weatherford will for twelve (12)
months after the Closing Date, upon notice of a customer order (whether from
Acquiror or from the customer), provide the products or services required to
be provided by such agreement in accordance with the terms thereof that
Weatherford had been providing prior to the Closing Date in the Ordinary
Course of Business. Acquiror will take, or cause its Affiliates to take, such
actions as may be reasonably requested by Weatherford in connection with the
customers under such Transferred Master Agreements, including (x) using
commercially reasonable efforts to have such customers enter into separate
agreements for the benefit of Weatherford or agree to agree to assign the
portion of the Transferred Master Agreement unrelated to the Business to
Weatherford or its Affiliates, (y) with respect to communications with such
customers or (z) to terminate the obligations unrelated to the Business with
any customer if so requested by Weatherford. Acquiror will promptly remit to
Weatherford any amounts received by Acquiror under any such Transferred Master
Agreement after the Closing Date in respect to products provided or services
performed unrelated to the Business by Weatherford or one or more of its
Affiliates.

(d) At Closing, Weatherford shall, or cause one or more of its Affiliates to,
enter into such agreements and other arrangements (including sublicenses and
subleases), to the extent permitted by applicable Law and not prohibited by
the applicable Weatherford Master Agreement, with Acquiror and/or the other
Buyers as are reasonably necessary to ensure that Acquiror and/or the other
Buyers receive until three months after the Closing, or as otherwise provided
in an Ancillary Agreement, whichever is later, benefits under the Weatherford
Master Agreements that are substantially same as the benefits received by
Weatherford or its Affiliates with respect to the Business prior to the
Closing.

4.9 Letters of Credit, Guaranties. Promptly after the Closing, Acquiror shall,
and will cause each other Buyer to, use their reasonable efforts to be
substituted for Weatherford, the Asset Sellers and their Subsidiaries and
Affiliates (other than the Target Companies) on the guaranties and letters of
credit set for the performance guarantees, warranty bonds, advance payments
guarantees and tender guarantees related to the Business as set forth on
Schedule 4.9, which schedule may be updated prior to the Closing to reflect
any guaranties and letters of credit for such items entered into after the
date hereof in the Ordinary Course of Business in accordance with the
provisions of this



Agreement (collectively, the "Surety Obligations"), in each case so that
Weatherford, the Asset Sellers and their Subsidiaries and Affiliates are
relieved of all liability with respect thereto. To the extent that either
Acquiror or the Buyers are not substituted for Weatherford, the Asset Sellers
and their Subsidiaries and Affiliates on, or Weatherford, the Asset Sellers
and such Subsidiaries and Affiliates are not relieved of, such liability under
the Surety Obligations, Acquiror shall reimburse Weatherford, the Asset
Sellers and their Subsidiaries and Affiliates for all out-of-pocket amounts
paid by Weatherford, the Asset Sellers under such Surety Obligations, provided
that Weatherford, the Asset Sellers and their Subsidiaries and Affiliates
shall take such actions as the Buyers may reasonably direct (at the cost of
the Buyers) to defend such obligations.

4.10 Foreign Acquisition Agreements; Closings. Subject to the terms and
conditions hereof and of the respective Foreign Acquisition Agreements,
Weatherford will, and will cause each Asset Seller and Share Seller to, and

agreements and obligations under, and use all commercially reasonable efforts
to consummate the transactions contemplated by, each Foreign Acquisition
Agreement and each other Ancillary Agreement to which it is now or hereafter a
party, in each case by the Closing Date. It is the intention of the parties to
this Agreement, notwithstanding the provisions of any Foreign Acquisition
Agreement, that no purchase and sale contemplated by any Foreign Acquisition
Agreement shall be consummated earlier than simultaneously with the Domestic
Closing. Accordingly, each of the parties hereto will take such action as may
be necessary to ensure that no Closing under any Foreign Acquisition Agreement
occurs prior to the Domestic Closing.

4.11 Required Consents and Approvals.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto shall use (and cause its Affiliates to use) its
commercially reasonable efforts (subject to, and in accordance with,
applicable Law) to take promptly, or cause to be taken promptly, all actions,
and to do promptly, or cause to be done promptly, and to assist and cooperate
with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable Laws to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,

material consideration to any landlord or other third party to obtain any
consent, approval or waiver required for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated



hereby under any Contracts (other than those payable pursuant to the terms of
any such Contract), waive any condition to such party's obligation to
consummate the Closing or waive any right of such party under this Agreement.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided and without limiting
the foregoing, Weatherford and Acquiror shall (i) if the required filings of
the parties under the HSR Act and/or the Competition Act have not already been
made, make their respective filings as soon as practically possible and
thereafter make any other required submissions under the HSR Act and/or the
Competition Act; provided, that Acquiror shall pay the related filing fees
under the HSR Act and the Competition Act on filing, subject to an obligation
of Weatherford to reimburse Acquiror for 50% of such filing fee, but in no
event in excess of $62,500; (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate with each other in (x) determining whether any filings are required
to be made with, or consents, permits, authorizations, waivers or approvals

necessary to resolve such objections, if any, as the United States Federal
Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of
Justice, state antitrust enforcement authorities, the Competition Bureau or
competition authorities of any other nation or other jurisdiction or any other
Person may assert under Regulatory Law with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby, and to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under
any Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with result to the
transactions contemplated hereby so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon
as reasonably possible; (iv) promptly inform the other party upon receipt of
any material communication from the United States Federal Trade Commission,
the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice, the
Competition Bureau or any other Governmental Authority regarding any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (v) subject to applicable
legal limitations and the instructions of any Governmental Authority, keep
each other apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of the
transactions contemplated thereby, including promptly furnishing the other
with copies of notices or other communications received by Weatherford or
Acquiror, as the case may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, from
any third party and/or any Governmental Authority with respect to such
transactions. Weatherford and Acquiror shall permit legal counsel for the
other party reasonable opportunity to review in advance, and consider in good
faith the views of the other party in connection with, any proposed written
communication to any Governmental Authority. Each of Weatherford and Acquiror
agrees not to (A) participate in any substantive meeting or discussion, either
in person or by telephone, with any Governmental Authority in connection with
the proposed transactions unless it consults with the other party in advance
and, to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental Authority, gives the
other party the opportunity to attend and participate, (B) extend any waiting
period under the HSR Act and/or the Competition Act without the prior written
consent of the other party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) and (C) enter into any agreement with any Governmental



Authority not to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
without the prior written consent of the other party.

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the agreements of the parties
contained in this Section 4.11, if any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement as violative of any Regulatory Law, each of Weatherford and Acquiror
shall cooperate in all respects with each other and shall use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to contest and resist any such action or
proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
using their commercially reasonable efforts to (x) propose, negotiate, commit
to and effect, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale,
divesture or disposition of assets or businesses of Acquiror or its Affiliates
(including the assets and operations making up the Business), provided that
any such sale, divestiture or disposition shall not be required to be
effective unless and until the transactions contemplated hereunder are
consummated and (y) otherwise take or commit to take actions after the Closing
Date that would limit Acquiror's or its Affiliates' freedom of action with
respect to, or their ability to retain, one or more of its Affiliates'
businesses, product lines or assets, in each case as may be required in order
to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction,
temporary restraining order or other order which would have the effect of
preventing or materially delaying the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing
or any other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this Section 4.11 shall
limit a party's right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 so
long as such party has, prior to such termination, complied with its
obligations under this Section 4.11.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.11 or any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no event will Acquiror or any
of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates be required to agree to (A) any prohibition
of or limitation on its or their ownership (or any limitation that would
affect its or their operation) of any portion of their respective businesses
or assets, including after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (B) divest, hold separate or otherwise dispose of any portion
of its or their respective businesses or assets, including after giving effect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (C) any limitation on its
or their ability to effect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
(D) any other limitation on its or their ability to effectively control their
respective businesses or any limitation that would affect its or their ability
to control their respective operations, including after giving effect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (any such action or limitation
described in clauses (A) through (D) of this sentence, a "Restriction"), other
than Restrictions (1) that solely apply to the Business from and after the
Closing (such restrictions, "Target Restrictions") and (2) that, individually
or in the aggregate with all other Target Restrictions, would not have caused
a reduction of the Business's consolidated revenues, during the 12-month
period ended September 30, 2014, of 15% of such consolidated revenues (such
amount, the "Target Amount") or more during such period had such Target
Restrictions been in place at any point during such 12-month period, and would
not reasonably be expected to cause such a reduction of the Business's
consolidated revenues for the 12-month period beginning with the first full
calendar month following the Closing of



the Target Amount or more had such Target Restrictions been in place at any
point during such 12-month period. For the avoidance of doubt, the Acquiror
will be entitled to the proceeds of any divestiture or Target Restriction
required pursuant to this Section 4.11 and if such divestiture or other Target
Restriction occurs or is imposed prior to Closing, the Business will be
entitled to and will hold the proceeds thereof at Closing (and shall not be
taken into account for purposes of the Closing Working Capital).

(e) For purposes of this Agreement, "Regulatory Law" means the Sherman Act of
1890, the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade
Commission Act of 1914, the Competition Act and all other federal, state or
foreign statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees, administrative and
judicial doctrines and other laws, including any antitrust, competition or
trade regulation laws, that are designed or intended to (i) prohibit, restrict
or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or
restraint of trade or lessening competition through merger or acquisition or
(ii) protect the national security or the national economy of any nation.

4.12 Publicity. On or after the date of this Agreement, Weatherford and
Acquiror each intend to issue similar but separate press releases with respect
to the execution hereof and the transactions contemplated hereby, and each of
Weatherford and Acquiror shall consult with each other before issuing, and
provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon such press
release. Weatherford and Acquiror shall consult with each other before
issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon,
any press release to be issued on or prior to Closing or the first press
release to announce the Closing of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and any other press releases announced in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement within seven
(7) days of any Closing.

4.13 Misdirected Payments.

any amount received by Acquiror or any other Buyer after the Closing with
respect to the Excluded Assets.

4.14 Further Assurances. From and after the Closing Date, the parties shall
cooperate reasonably with each other in connection with any steps required to
be taken in order for the parties to carry out the intent of this Agreement.
Neither Weatherford, on the one hand, nor Acquiror, on the other hand, shall,
without the prior written consent of the other party, take any action or
refrain from taking any action the intended result of which is to prevent or
materially impede, interfere with or unreasonably delay, the transactions
contemplated hereby. In furtherance of the foregoing, from time to time after
the Closing Date, the parties hereto agree to (i) furnish upon request to each
other such further assurances, information, documents and instruments of
transfer or assignment and assumption and (ii) do such things and promptly
execute, acknowledge, and deliver any such further



assurances, documents and instruments of transfer or assignment and
assumption, in each case that the other party may reasonably request for the
purpose of carrying out the intent of this Agreement.

4.15 Post-Closing Access. Without limiting the rights and obligations set
forth in Section 6.1, following the Closing, each party hereto agrees that it
will cooperate with and make available to each other party, during normal
business hours and upon reasonable notice, (i) all books and records related
to the Business, (ii) information related to the Business and (iii) employees
(without substantial disruption of employment), in each case retained by such
party and remaining in existence after the Closing which are necessary or
useful in connection with any audit, investigation or dispute, any litigation
or investigation or any other matter requiring any such books and records and
other documents, information or employees for any reasonable business purpose.
Except in connection with an indemnified claim under this Agreement (in which
case the indemnifying party shall bear such costs), the party requesting any
such books and records and other documents, information or employees shall
bear all of the out of pocket costs and expenses reasonably incurred in
connection with providing such books and records and other documents,
information or employees. All information received pursuant to this Section
4.15 shall be kept confidential by the party obtaining such information,
subject to any disclosure that is required to be made by such party in order
to comply with applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any securities
exchange upon which its securities are traded.

4.16 Control of Operations. Without in any way limiting either party's rights
or obligations under this Agreement, the parties understand and agree that (i)
nothing contained in this Agreement shall give the Acquiror, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the Business's operations prior to
the Closing Date, and (ii) prior to the Closing Date, Weatherford, the Asset
Sellers and the Target Companies shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over the
Business's operations.

4.17 Termination of Intercompany Agreements. On or prior to the Closing Date,
Weatherford and each Target Company shall terminate, in any manner selected by
Weatherford, all intercompany agreements, contracts and transactions between a
Target Company on the one hand, and Weatherford or any of its Affiliates, on
the other hand.

4.18 Update of Schedules

(a) From time to time up to the Closing, Weatherford shall promptly supplement
or amend any Schedule that it has delivered in response to ARTICLE III with
respect to:

(i) any matter first existing or occurring following the date hereof that (i)
if existing or occurring at or prior to the date hereof would have been
required to be set forth or be described in the Schedule or (ii) is necessary
to correct any information in such Schedule that has been rendered inaccurate
thereby; or





(ii) any matter first existing or occurring prior to the date of this
agreement that was not previously set forth in such Schedule.

Except as described in Section 3.1.12(b), no supplement or amendment to any
such Schedule shall have any effect for the purpose of determining
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 5.2(a). No supplement or
amendment to any schedule delivered pursuant to Section 4.18(a) shall (i)
limit Seller's indemnification obligations regardless of whether or not the
transactions contemplated herein are consummated or (ii) in any way limit the
ability of Acquiror from making a claim for breach of this Agreement.

4.19 Casualty Loss. If, prior to the Closing Date, all or any part of the
Assets or assets of any Target Company are damaged or impaired by fire, act of
God, or any other casualty or are taken by any condemnation event and if (i)
in the case of a casualty event, the cost of restoring such damage or
impairment to a condition reasonably comparable to the condition immediately
prior to such casualty event or (ii) in the case of a condemnation event, the
condemnation value therefor, as the case may be, would reasonably be expected
to exceed $2,500,000, Weatherford shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, use
its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) promptly repair or replace any
assets damaged or lost on account thereof, (ii) pay over any net insurance
proceeds or any net condemnation award received by Weatherford or its
Affiliates with respect to such casualty event or condemnation event to the
Acquiror or its Affiliates promptly after Closing to the extent not expended
by Weatherford or its Affiliates in connection with any such repair or
replacement, and (iii) if any such repair or replacement is not completed as
of the applicable Domestic Closing or Foreign Closing, cooperate with Acquiror
or its applicable Buyer, at its reasonable request, in pursing any insurance
claims or condemnation awards related to such casualty event or condemnation
event. For avoidance of doubt, the failure to complete any such repair or

any Returns relating to Retained Taxes for Pre-Closing Tax Periods (or
Straddle Periods). The party requesting assistance hereunder shall reimburse
the other party for any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
providing such assistance.

receipt, registration, transfer, conveyance, excise, recording, license and
other similar Taxes and fees (and any interest, penalties or other surcharges
imposed thereon) arising out of or in connection with or attributable to the
transactions effected pursuant to this Agreement, the Foreign Acquisition
Agreements, and the Ancillary Agreements ("Transfer Taxes") shall be paid 50%
by the applicable Seller and 50% by the applicable Buyer.

(b) The applicable Seller and/or applicable Buyer that have primary
responsibility under applicable Law to file a Return with respect to a
Transfer Tax shall be responsible for preparing and filing such Return. Any
such Return prepared by Acquiror or another Buyer shall be subject to
Weatherford's approval, and any such Return prepared by Weatherford or any

not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Acquiror shall apply
for, execute and provide, and shall cause the other Buyers to apply for,
execute and provide, to the Sellers, and Weatherford shall apply for,



execute and provide, and shall cause the Sellers to apply for, execute and

Agreements (collectively, "VAT and GST Taxes").

(d) The parties hereto agree to treat all transfers in each jurisdiction as
transfers of a going concern business to the maximum extent allowed by
applicable Law and, where necessary or appropriate, apply for any rulings or
approvals required to obtain such treatment.

refund) relates to a Straddle Period (other than Transfer Taxes and VAT and
GST Taxes described in Section 6.2), the parties shall use the following
conventions for determining the portion of such Tax (or Tax refund) that
relates to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on (and including) the
Closing Date and the portion of the Straddle Period beginning on the day after
the Closing Date: (a) in the case of income Taxes, sales Taxes, employment
Taxes, withholding Taxes, and other similar Taxes, such Taxes shall be
apportioned between the portion of the Straddle Period ending on (and
including) the Closing Date and the portion of the Straddle Period beginning
on the day after the Closing Date as if a separate Return with respect to such
Taxes was filed for the portion of the Straddle Period ending on (and
including) the Closing Date using a "closing of the books methodology"; and
(b) in the case of ad valorem property Taxes and other similar Taxes imposed
on a periodic basis, such Taxes shall be apportioned between the portion of

of the Straddle Period beginning on the day after the Closing Date based on
the number of days in the portion of the Straddle Period ending on (and
including) the Closing Date and the number of days in the portion of the
Straddle Period beginning on the day after the Closing Date. For purposes of
clause (a), any item determined on an annual or periodic basis (including

days in such portion of the Straddle Period as compared to the number of days
in the entire Straddle Period.

(a) Subject to the terms of the Transition Services Agreement, Weatherford, at
its sole cost and expense, shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be

Periods. Each Weatherford Prepared Return shall be prepared on a basis
consistent with past Tax practices, Tax procedures and Tax accounting methods,
except to the extent otherwise required by Law. At least thirty (30) days

Target Company after the Closing Date, Acquiror shall cause the applicable
Target Company to properly sign and file such Return.

(b) Subject to the terms of the Transition Services Agreement, Acquiror, at
its sole cost and expense, shall cause each Target Company to prepare and
timely file all Returns of each Target Company due after the Closing Date that
are not Weatherford Prepared Returns (the "Acquiror Prepared Returns"). To the
extent that an Acquiror Prepared Return relates to a Straddle Period, such
Return shall be prepared on a basis consistent with past Tax practices, Tax
procedures and Tax accounting methods, except to the extent otherwise required
by Applicable Law. At least thirty (30) days prior to the due date of any

Return of any Target Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or otherwise
initiate (or agree to) any other Weatherford Tax Matter without the prior
written consent of Weatherford.

6.5 Tax Contest.

(a) If any Taxing Authority issues to Acquiror or any Affiliate of Acquiror
(i) a notice of its intent to audit or conduct another legal proceeding that
could give rise to a Retained Tax or (ii) a notice of deficiency for a
Retained Tax, Acquiror shall notify Weatherford of the receipt of such
communication from the Taxing Authority within fifteen (15) days of receipt;
provided. however, that the failure to provide such notice shall not excuse
Weatherford from its responsibility for such Retained Tax except to the extent
(and only to the extent) that Weatherford has actually been prejudiced by such
failure.

(b) If there is any audit or other legal proceeding relating to a Retained Tax
that is imposed on a Target Company or Acquiror or other Buyer (a "Tax
Contest"), Weatherford shall have the right, at its sole cost and expense,
upon notice to the Acquiror, to control or participate in such Tax Contest to
the extent such Retained Tax is for a Pre-Closing Tax Period and Weatherford
shall have the right, at its sole cost and expense, upon notice to the
Acquiror, to participate in such audit or proceedings to the extent such
Retained Tax is for a Straddle Period. Acquiror shall not settle or abandon,
or allow any Target Company or other Affiliate to settle or abandon a Tax
Contest (whether or not Weatherford controls or participates in such Tax
Contest) without the prior written consent of Weatherford, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld., conditioned or delayed Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Weatherford (or its designee) shall solely control any audit or
other proceedings relating to a Retained Tax that is imposed on Weatherford or
any Seller and any audit or other proceedings relating to any Tax with respect
to any consolidated, combined, or unitary group the common parent of which is
Weatherford or any Seller or any affiliate of Weatherford (excluding any such
group that consists solely of Target Companies). With respect to any Tax
Contest or any audit or other proceeding that Weatherford controls pursuant to
this Section 6.5(b), Weatherford shall not settle or abandon, or allow any
Seller or other Affiliate to settle or abandon such Tax Contest



or audit or other proceeding without the prior written consent of Acquiror,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

any Target Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period) (whether in the form of cash
received or a credit or offset against Taxes otherwise payable) to the extent
not included in the Closing Working Capital Balance shall be for the benefit
of Weatherford. To the extent that Acquiror, the Target Companies or any of
the Buyers or any of their Affiliates receive a refund that is for the benefit
of Weatherford, Acquiror shall pay the amount of such refund (and any interest
received from the Taxing Authority with respect to such refund) to an account
or accounts designated by Weatherford. The amount due to Weatherford shall be
payable ten (10) days after receipt of the refund from the applicable Taxing
Authority (or, if the refund is in the form of a credit or offset, ten (10)
days after the due date of the Return claiming such credit or offset). If the
aggregate amount of Tax accruals and reserves included in the Closing Working
Capital Balance, as finally determined, exceeds the aggregate amount of Taxes
actually paid after the Closing by Acquiror or the Target Companies or any of
their affiliates to Taxing Authorities for Pre-Closing Tax Periods, the excess
shall be treated as a refund of Taxes. Acquiror shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates, to take all commercially reasonable actions requested by
Weatherford to timely claim any refunds that will give rise to a payment under
this Section 6.6. All payments under this Section 6.6 shall be treated for Tax
purposes as adjustments to the Purchase Price to the extent permitted under
applicable Law and shall be allocated as provided in Section 2.5.

(a) Subject to the terms of the Transition Services Agreement, Weatherford
will, and will cause its Affiliates and each Asset Seller and each of its and
their respective Affiliates to, cause the Employees employed by an Asset
Seller or any other Weatherford Affiliate (other than a Target Company) to be
available for hire by Acquiror or the Buyers. To the extent permitted by
applicable Law, Weatherford will, and will cause each Asset Seller or other
Weatherford Affiliate (other than the Target Companies) to, make available to
Acquiror such information relating to the Employees as Acquiror may reasonably
request in connection with the hiring of such individuals by Acquiror or
Buyer. For a period of eighteen months from the Closing Date, Weatherford will
not, and will not permit any of its Affiliates to, directly or indirectly
solicit, offer to employ, employ or retain the services of, or otherwise
interfere with the relationship of any Buyer or its Affiliate with, any
Transferred Employee; provided, that Weatherford shall be permitted to hire
for employment any Transferred Employee who is involuntarily terminated by
Acquiror or any of its Affiliates following the Closing; and provided, further
that the phrase "solicit for employment" shall not be deemed to include
general solicitations of employment not specifically directed toward any
Transferred Employees (whether through advertisements, recruiting firms that
aren't specifically targeting any Transferred Employees or other means).

(b) Effective as of the Closing Date and subject to the terms of the
Transition Services Agreement, Acquiror will, or will cause each applicable
other Buyer or its Affiliate



to, offer employment to the Employees listed on Schedule 7.1 on terms that,
and for a period of one year after the Closing Date, provide for reasonably
comparable positions and with base wages or salaries, bonus opportunities and
other employee benefits (other than defined benefit pension plans and equity-
based plans) that are substantially similar in the aggregate to those
currently provided to such Employees by Weatherford or its Affiliates. For the
avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge that Acquiror will not offer any
equity-based plans relating to Weatherford or any of its Affiliates.
"Transferred Employees" means those Employees of the Asset Sellers or other
Weatherford Affiliate (other than a Target Company) who accept Acquiror's or
Buyer's offer of employment and commence employment with Acquiror or Buyer, or
who are employees of any of the Target Companies on the Closing Date.

(c) Neither Acquiror nor its Affiliates shall have responsibility for (i)
Liabilities in respect of any Employees who do not become Transferred
Employees or (ii) Liabilities for Transferred Employees to the extent that
such Liabilities arose or existed prior to the time the Transferred Employee
became employed by Acquiror or one of its Affiliates, except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement, including under this Section 7.1(c) and Section
2.3.

(d) Weatherford and its Affiliates shall be solely responsible for funding
and/or paying any benefits under all of the Employee Plans, including any
termination benefits and other employee entitlements accrued under any
Employee Plan, and neither Acquiror nor any of its Affiliates shall have any
Liabilities with respect to any Employee or Employee Plan or any claim thereof
or related thereto, except to the extent expressly provided in this ARTICLE
VII or reflected in the Closing Working Capital Balance with respect to the
Transferred Employees. From and after the Closing, Weatherford shall remain
solely responsible for any and all Liabilities in respect of the Employees,
including the Transferred Employees and their beneficiaries and dependents,
relating to or arising in connection with or as a result of (i) the employment
or the actual or constructive termination of employment of any such Employee
by any Asset Seller or other Weatherford Affiliate (other than the Target
Companies), or (ii) the participation in or accrual of benefits or
compensation under, or the failure to participate in or to accrue compensation
or benefits under, any Employee Plan or other employee or retiree benefit or
compensation plan, program, practice, policy, agreement or arrangement of any
Asset Seller or other Weatherford Affiliate (other than the Target Companies)
prior to the Closing except, in any such case, to the extent any such
Liability is specifically assumed by any Buyer pursuant to this ARTICLE VII.
Each of Lubrizol and Weatherford agree and shall abide by the terms and
conditions of that certain letter agreement dated November 29, 2014 relating
to payments to certain employees of Integrity Delaware, LLC.

(e) Acquiror will, or will cause each applicable other Buyer to, cause each
Transferred Employee to be credited with service as of the Closing Date for
all purposes under each of such Acquiror's employee benefit plans to the
extent such Transferred Employee's service with the Asset Sellers or other
Weatherford Affiliate (other than the Target Companies) prior to the Closing
Date was so credited for all purposes other than benefit accrual under a
defined benefit pension plan, provided that the foregoing shall not apply to
the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits.



(f) The Employees listed on Schedule 7.1(f) as updated prior to the Closing
Date are not actively at work on the Closing Date (each, an "Inactive
Employee") and shall not, as of the Closing Date, be Transferred Employees.
Weatherford represents and warrants that Schedule 7.1(f) as of the date of
this Agreement lists, and as of the Closing Date will list, each Inactive
Employee's name, title, reason for absence and expected return date.
Weatherford and its Affiliates shall be liable for, and shall hold Acquiror,
the other Buyers and their respective Affiliates harmless from and against all
Liabilities in respect of any Inactive Employee. In the event that an Inactive
Employee returns to work at any time during the ninety (90) day period
following the Closing, subject to the terms of the Transition Services
Agreement, Acquiror or another Buyer or its Affiliate shall offer employment
to such individual, and if he or she accepts such employment he or she shall
be a Transferred Employee upon the date he or she begins employment with
Acquiror or one of its Affiliates for purpose of this Agreement.

(g) After the Domestic Closing, Weatherford shall cause all of the payment
obligations for the amounts described in Section 2.4(m) to be discharged with
respect to the applicable Employees in accordance with the contracts,
agreements, arrangements or policies, as applicable, that give rise to such
obligations.

7.2 Defined Contribution Plan. Subject to the terms of the Transition Services
Agreement, Acquiror shall, or shall cause the applicable Buyer to, cause a
qualified defined contribution retirement plan in which the Transferred
Employees will be participants following the Closing Date to accept a rollover
contribution from the Weatherford International, LLC 401(k) Savings Plan (the
"Seller 401(k) Plan") from any Transferred Employee who elects to make such a
contribution.

7.3 Welfare and Fringe Benefit Plans. Subject to the terms of the Transition
Services Agreement, Acquiror shall, or shall cause the other Buyers to,
provide the Transferred Employees and their dependents and beneficiaries
coverage under any welfare and fringe benefit plans, programs, policies or
arrangements established by Acquiror or the other Buyers for such Transferred
Employees (the "Transferred Employee Welfare Benefit Plans") effective as of
each Transferred Employee's first day of employment with Acquiror or the
Buyers. In connection therewith, the Acquiror shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause each of the Transferred Employee Welfare Benefit
Plans, subject to the approval of any applicable insurance carrier, to (i)
recognize the co-payments and deductible expenses of the Transferred Employees
and their eligible dependents and (ii) waive all pre-existing condition
exclusions and limitations of the Transferred Employees and their eligible
dependents. Subject to the terms of the Transition Services Agreement,
Weatherford and its Affiliates shall provide Acquiror with information
pertaining to the hire date, recognized credited service amount, seniority
date and participation, vesting and, as applicable, benefit accrual period of
service, deductible and out-of-pocket amounts for each of the Transferred
Employees.



7.4 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Nothing express or implied by this Agreement
shall confer upon any Employee, or legal representative thereof, any rights or
remedies, including any right to employment or benefits for any specified
period, of any nature or kind whatsoever, under or by reason of this
Agreement. In no event shall the terms of this Agreement be deemed to: (i)
establish, amend, or modify any Employee Plan; (ii) alter or limit the ability
of Weatherford or any of its Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any
Employee Plan or alter or limit the ability of Acquiror or any of its
Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any other benefit or employment plan,
program, agreement or arrangement after the Closing Date; or (iii) confer upon
any current or former employee, officer, director or consultant of the

9.2 Indemnification.

(a) By Weatherford. Weatherford agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless
each of Acquiror, the other Buyers, the Target Companies (from and after the
Closing) and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents,
advisers, Representatives and Affiliates (collectively, the "Acquiror
Indemnitees") from and against, and pay or reimburse the Acquiror Indemnitees
for, any and all claims, liabilities, obligations, losses, fines, costs,
proceedings,



deficiencies or damages, including reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and
reasonable attorneys' and accountants' fees incurred in the investigation or
defense of any of the same (collectively, "Losses") resulting from:

(i) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by
Weatherford or its Affiliates in this Agreement, in any Foreign Acquisition
Agreement as of the Closing Date as if made on and as of such date (except for
representation and warranties made as of a specified date, then as of such
specified date);

(ii) any failure of Weatherford, its Affiliates, any Asset Seller or Share
Seller to perform any covenant or agreement hereunder, under any Foreign
Acquisition Agreement; and

(iii) subject to the limitations set forth in Section 9.2(i), any Excluded
Liabilities; and

For purposes of determining the amount of any Losses (but not for the purpose
of determining the existence of any breach, misrepresentation or inaccuracy)
with respect to any representation or warranty of Weatherford, any
qualification as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect or words of similar
import set out in any such representation or warranty shall be disregarded.

Except with respect to Fundamental Representations, Retained Taxes,
Environmental Liabilities and Costs, and the items set forth on Schedules
3.1.5, 3.1.8, 3.1.9(a), 3.1.18(b), 3.1.19, 3.1.20(d), 3.1.21(b), 3.1.21(c),
3.1.21(d), and 3.1.22 (including for the avoidance of doubt, any amendments in
the Schedules to this Agreement prior to Closing under Section 4.18 relating
to the foregoing provisions), Weatherford shall not be required to indemnify
the Acquiror Indemnitees with respect to any claim for indemnification
pursuant to (i) Section 9.2(a)(i) unless and until the aggregate amount of all
claims against Weatherford under such clause exceed $7,500,000 less the
Incurred Pre-Closing Contract Liabilities or (ii) Section 9.2(a)(iii) unless
and until the aggregate amount of all claims against Weatherford under such
clause exceed $3,000,000 less the Incurred Pre-Closing Contract Liabilities
(the "Deductible"), and with respect to each of clauses (i) and (ii), only for
such excess amount. Except with respect to Fundamental Representations,
Weatherford shall not be obligated to provide indemnification in excess of
fifteen percent (15%) of the Purchase Price for all indemnifiable claims under
Section 9.2(a)(i). Except with respect to Fundamental Representations, no
claim for indemnification may be made pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(i) for any
individual item where the claim for Losses related thereto, aggregated with
all claims arising out of the same or similar facts or circumstances, is less
than $50,000, and if such claim (as so aggregated) does not exceed such
amount, the amount of such claim shall not be taken into account in
determining whether, or to the extent to which, the Deductible has been
exceeded. Except with respect to Section 9.2(a)(iii), the aggregate liability
of Weatherford to the Acquiror Indemnitees under Section 9.2(a) shall not
exceed seventy-fifty percent (75%) of the Purchase Price.

Acquiror Indemnitees shall not be entitled to make any claim under this
Section 9.2(a) in respect of any matter to the extent that such matter has
been taken into account as a liability or reduction to the final Closing
Working Capital Balance determined in accordance with Section 2.6.



(b) By Acquiror. Acquiror agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless each
of Weatherford, Asset Sellers, the Share Sellers and their respective
officers, directors, employees, agents, advisers, Representatives and
Affiliates (collectively, the "Seller Indemnitees") from and against any and
all Losses resulting from:

(i) the breach of any representation or warranty made by Acquiror or its
Affiliates in this Agreement, in any Foreign Acquisition Agreement as of the
Closing Date as if made on and as of such date (except for representation and
warranties made as of a specified date, then as of such specified date);

(ii) any failure of any Buyer or its Affiliates to perform any covenant or
agreement hereunder, in any Foreign Acquisition Agreement;

(iii) the Assumed Liabilities; and

(iv) other than the Excluded Liabilities, the operation of the Business by any
Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates following the Closing Date.

(c) Exclusive Remedy. Other than (i) as set forth in Section 4.5, (ii) with
respect to any claim for fraud or willful misconduct that any indemnified
party may have under applicable Law, and (iii) the Ancillary Agreements, after
the Closing, indemnification pursuant to this ARTICLE IX shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy for the parties hereto with respect to matters arising under
this Agreement of any kind or nature, including for any misrepresentation or
breach of any warranty, covenant, or other provision contained in this
Agreement, and the parties hereto hereby waive and release any other rights,
remedies, causes of action, or claims that either of them have or that may
arise against any other party with respect thereto.

(d) Mitigation. Each party shall take all reasonable steps to mitigate any of
its Losses to the extent required under applicable Laws upon becoming aware of
any event which would reasonably be expected to, or does, give rise thereto,
including taking such actions and pursuing claims against third parties that
may be responsible or otherwise liable for such Losses. Each of the parties
hereto shall reasonably cooperate with the others with respect to resolving
any Losses to the extent required under applicable Laws with respect to which
one party is obligated to indemnify the other party hereunder; provided,
however, that such party shall not be required to make such efforts if they
would be detrimental in any material respect to such party.

(e) Notice of Claims. If a claim for Losses (a "Claim") is to be made by a
party entitled to indemnification hereunder against the indemnifying party,
the party claiming such indemnification shall give written notice (a "Claim
Notice") to the indemnifying party as soon as practicable after the party
entitled to indemnification becomes aware of any fact, condition or event
which may give rise to Losses for which indemnification may be sought under
this Section 9.2; provided, however, that the failure to provide such written
notice shall not excuse the indemnifying party from any of its obligations
under this Section 9.2 except to the extent (and only to the extent) that such
failure shall have caused the Losses for which the indemnifying



party is obligated to be greater than such Losses would have been had the
indemnified party given the indemnifying party prompt notice hereunder.

(f) Defense of Third Party Claims. If any lawsuit or enforcement action is
filed by a third party against any party entitled to the benefit of indemnity
hereunder with respect thereto, written notice thereof shall be given to the
indemnifying party as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 15
calendar days after the service of the citation or summons). The failure of
any indemnified party to give timely notice hereunder shall not affect rights
to indemnification hereunder, except to the extent that the indemnifying party
has been damaged by such failure as described in the proviso to Section
9.2(e). After such notice, if (1) the indemnifying party shall acknowledge in
writing to the indemnified party that the indemnifying party is obligated
under the terms of its indemnity hereunder to indemnify the indemnified party
in connection with such lawsuit or action, and (2) such third party claim is
solely for monetary losses, then the indemnifying party shall be entitled, if
it elects to do so, at its own cost, risk and expense, (i) to take control of
the defense and investigation of such lawsuit or action, (ii) to employ and
engage legal counsel of its own choice, but, in any event, reasonably
acceptable to the indemnified party, to handle and defend the same unless the
named parties to such action or proceeding (including any impleaded parties)
include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and the
indemnified party has been advised by counsel that there may be one or more
legal defenses available to such indemnified party that are different from or
additional to those available to the indemnifying party, in which event the
indemnified party shall be entitled, at the indemnifying party's cost, risk
and expense, to separate counsel of its own choosing. The indemnifying party
shall not, without the written consent of the indemnified party, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, (x) settle or compromise
any Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment which does not include an
unconditional written release by the claimant or plaintiff of the indemnified
party from all Liability in respect of such Claim or (y) settle or compromise
any Claim if the settlement imposes equitable remedies or obligations on the
indemnified party other than financial obligations for which such indemnified
party will be fully indemnified hereunder. No Claim which is being defended in
good faith by the indemnifying party in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement shall be settled or compromised by the indemnified party without the
written consent of the indemnifying party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

If the indemnifying party fails to assume the defense of such lawsuit or
action within 30 calendar days after receipt of the Claim Notice or is not
permitted to assume such defense pursuant to this Section 9.2(f), the
indemnified party against which such lawsuit or action has been asserted will
(upon delivering notice to such effect to the indemnifying party) have the
right to undertake, at the indemnifying party's cost and expense, the defense,
compromise or settlement of such lawsuit or action on behalf of and for the
account and risk of the indemnifying party; provided, however, that such
lawsuit or action shall not be compromised or settled without the written
consent of the indemnifying party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. If the indemnified party settles or
compromises such lawsuit or action without the prior written consent of the
indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will bear no Liability hereunder
for or with respect to such lawsuit or action unless the indemnifying party
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed its consent. In the event either
party assumes the defense of a particular lawsuit or action in the



manner contemplated above, the party assuming such defense will keep the other
party reasonably informed of the progress of any such defense, compromise or
settlement. The indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement of any
action effected pursuant to and in accordance with this Section 9.2 and for
any final judgment (subject to any right of appeal), and the indemnifying
party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the indemnified party from and
against any Losses by reason of such settlement or judgment. Each of the
parties hereto shall reasonably cooperate with the other party to allow the
other party to fulfill its indemnification obligations under this Agreement,
including by making available employees with knowledge, and documentation,
relevant to the indemnifiable claim, provided that the indemnifying party
shall be liable for the indemnified party's out-of-pocket expenses in this
regard. To the extent of any conflict between the provisions of this Section
9.2(f) and the provisions of Section 6.5 with respect to a Tax Contest, the
provisions of Section 6.5 shall control.

(g) Additional Agreements. (A) To the extent that any Losses that are subject
to indemnification under this Agreement are covered by insurance, the amount
of any indemnity payment shall be net of the Net Proceeds of any insurance
policy paid to the indemnified party with respect to such Losses, (B) any
indemnification under this Agreement shall be decreased by the amount of any
Tax Benefit and (C) any Losses that are subject to indemnification under this
Agreement shall be decreased to the extent that such Losses are reflected as a
reserve or accrual in the Closing Working Capital Balance. For purposes of
this Section 9.2(g), "Net Proceeds" shall mean the insurance proceeds actually
recovered under the applicable insurance policy, less any expenses of
recovery, deductibles, and/or co-payments. If any amounts are reimbursed under
insurance coverage subsequent to indemnification under this ARTICLE IX, the
indemnified party shall reimburse the indemnifying party in an amount equal to
the amounts subsequently received by the indemnified party or its Affiliates
under insurance coverage (net of the expenses of recovery). For purposes of
this Section 9.2(g), to the extent a Tax Benefit is not realized in the year
in which the indemnity payment is required to be made, the indemnified party
(or any Affiliate thereof) shall pay to the indemnifying party (or any
Affiliate thereof) the amount of such Tax Benefit when it is realized. Losses
shall be determined after taking into account any indemnity, contribution or
other similar payment actually received by the indemnified party from any
third party with respect thereto, less any costs and expenses incurred by the
indemnified party in connection therewith, including an obligation to
reimburse the indemnifying party in an amount equal to the amount subsequently
received by the indemnified party or its Affiliates from any third party (net
of the costs and expenses incurred by the indemnified party or its Affiliates
in connection with any such recovery).

(h) Certain Losses. In no event shall an indemnifying party be liable for
indirect, punitive, special or consequential Losses sustained or claimed by an
indemnified party except to the extent such Losses arise from a third party
Claim.

(i) Certain Environmental Matters. Weatherford shall have no obligation under
Section 9.2(a)(i) with respect to a breach of a representation and warranty
set forth in Section 3.1.21, and no obligation under Section 9.2(a)(iii) with
respect to any Environmental Liabilities and Costs, to indemnify, defend and
hold harmless Acquiror Indemnitees from and against any Losses arising in
connection therewith to the extent that such Losses (1) result from (i) a
change in the current use of a Real Property from industrial use to non-
industrial commercial or residential use, or from non-



industrial commercial use to residential use, or (ii) an investigation of
environmental conditions on any Real Property involving physically invasive
testing procedures such as soil and groundwater sampling, undertaken by or for
Acquiror Indemnitees, other than any such investigation (A) required under
applicable Environmental Law, (B) required by any order issued under an
Environmental Law or pursuant to a written request by a Governmental Authority
with authority under an Environmental Law to order such action (provided such
written request has not been solicited by, or on behalf of Acquiror
Indemnitees), (C) reasonably determined by Acquiror in good faith to be
necessary in connection with any construction, maintenance or repair activity
at any Real Property where such construction, maintenance or repair does or
would reasonably be expected to require access to, or disturbance of, soil or
groundwater or (D) a required action with respect to any third party Claim, or
(2) result from Response Actions that are inconsistent with the standard of
care set forth in the following sentence. Response Actions shall be conducted
in a reasonable and cost effective manner, to standards applicable to the
current use of properties and, to the extent applicable to that particular
site, may include the use of risk-based cleanup standards, natural attenuation
and deed restrictions to obtain closure where appropriate and available. After
the Closing Date, Acquiror shall exercise due care with respect to mitigate
the extent of any Release and the related response costs.

(j) Tax Treatment. Any indemnity payment made under this ARTICLE IX shall be
treated for Tax purposes as an adjustment to the Purchase Price to the extent
permitted by applicable Law and shall be allocated as provided by Section 2.5.

the State of Texas without regard to choice of law principles. In the event of
any dispute or disagreement between Weatherford and Acquiror arising out of or
in connection with the interpretation or enforcement of the provisions of this
Agreement and the documents referred to herein, Acquiror and Weatherford
hereby: (i) irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State
of Texas and the Federal courts of the United States of America located in
Houston, Harris County, Texas; and (ii) waive, and agree not to assert, as a
defense that it is not subject to personal jurisdiction in said courts or that
the venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any of such
document may not be interpreted by or enforced in or by said courts and agree
that mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such action or
proceeding in the manner provided in Section 10.4, or in such other manner as
may be permitted by law, shall be valid and sufficient service thereof.

(f) Negotiation. In the event of any dispute or disagreement between
Weatherford and Acquiror arising out of or in connection with this Agreement,
including any questions regarding the existence, validity or termination of
this Agreement (the "Dispute"), on written request of either party, shall be
referred to representatives of the parties for decision, each party being
represented by a senior executive officer who has no direct operational
responsibility for the matters contemplated by this Agreement (the
"Negotiation Representatives"). The Negotiation Representatives shall promptly
meet in a good faith effort to resolve the Dispute. If the Dispute is not
resolved, as evidenced by the terms of a settlement reduced to writing and
signed by the parties, within 30 calendar days after reference of the matter
to them (or within such longer period of time as the parties may mutually
agree in writing), then either party may enforce its rights hereunder by other
means available to it under Law.

(g) Binding Effect. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns.

(h) Assignment. This Agreement shall not be assignable or otherwise
transferable by any party hereto without the prior written consent of the
other party hereto.

(i) No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as provided in Section 4.5 with
respect to the Non-Competition Covenant and Section 9.2 with respect to
indemnification of indemnified parties hereunder, nothing in this Agreement
shall confer any rights upon any person or entity other than the parties
hereto and their respective heirs, successors and permitted assigns.

(j) Amendment, Waivers, etc. No amendment, modification or discharge of this
Agreement, and no waiver hereunder, shall be valid or binding unless set forth
in writing and duly executed by the party against whom enforcement of the
amendment, modification, discharge or waiver is sought (except as may be
specifically provided herein with respect to the amendment of certain
Schedules prior to the Closing). Any such waiver shall constitute a



waiver only with respect to the specific matter described in such writing and
shall in no way impair the rights of the party granting such waiver in any
other respect or at any other time. Neither the waiver by any of the parties
hereto of a breach of or a default under any of the provisions of this
Agreement, nor the failure by any of the parties, on one or more occasions, to
enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement or to exercise any right or
privilege hereunder, shall be construed as a waiver of any other breach or
default of a similar nature, or as a waiver of any of such provisions, rights
or privileges hereunder.

(k) Specific Performance. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the
other party hereto would be damaged irreparably in the event that either party
hereto fails to perform any of the provisions of this Agreement in accordance
with their specific terms or if such provisions are otherwise breached.
Accordingly, each of the parties hereto agrees that the other party hereto
will be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
the provisions hereof in any action instituted in any court of the United
States or any state thereof having jurisdiction over the parties hereto and
the matter, in addition to any other remedy to which such party hereto may be
entitled, at law or in equity.

(l) Conflicts. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this Agreement
shall govern and control to the extent any term or provision of any Foreign
Acquisition Agreements, or any Ancillary Agreement conflicts with this
Agreement.

(m) Joint and Several Liability. Lubrizol and LZ shall be jointly and
severally liable for all obligations of Acquiror under this Agreement.
