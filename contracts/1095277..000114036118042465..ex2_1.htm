ARTICLE I

 

THE OFFER

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with Article VIII and the conditions set forth in  clauses (c)(i), (ii),
(iii) and (iv)(1), (iv)(2), (iv)(3) and (iv)(4) of _Exhibit A_ hereto shall

of 1934, as amended (including the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, the " _Exchange Act_ ")) the Offer. The obligations of Merger Sub,
and of Parent to cause Merger Sub, to accept for payment and pay for any
Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be subject to (i) the 
satisfaction of the Minimum Condition (as defined in _Exhibit A_ hereto) and
(ii) the satisfaction or waiver by Merger Sub of each of the other conditions

_Offer Conditions_ ") and the terms and  conditions hereof. Merger Sub
expressly reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to (A) increase the
Offer Price, (B) waive any Offer Condition other than the Minimum Condition,

1.1(a)) set forth in this Agreement in a manner adverse to the holders of

_Initial Expiration Date_ ") or, in the event the Initial Expiration  Date
has been extended pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement, the date
and time to which the Offer has been so extended (the Initial Expiration Date,

(c) Subject to the terms of the Offer and this Agreement and the satisfaction
of all of the Offer Conditions, Merger Sub will  accept for payment (the time
of such acceptance, the " _Acceptance Time_ ") and thereafter timely pay for
all Shares validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to  the Offer
as soon as practicable after the Expiration Date or (in the case of Shares
tendered during any Subsequent Offering Period) as soon as practicable
following the valid tender thereof, _provided_ , that with respect to Shares
tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been
delivered in settlement or satisfaction of such guarantee, Merger Sub shall be
under no obligation to make  any payment for such Shares unless and until
such Shares are delivered in settlement or satisfaction of such guarantee.

 


 

 

Section 1.2 _Offer Documents_. As promptly as reasonably practicable on the
date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Merger Sub shall (a) file a
Schedule TO (together with all exhibits, amendments and supplements  thereto,
the " _Schedule TO_ ") with respect to the Offer, which shall contain or shall
incorporate by reference an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to Purchase_ ")

Documents_ "), and (b) cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders
of Shares, in each case as and to the extent  required by applicable federal

any  material respect, and each of Parent and Merger Sub further agrees to
take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to be
filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to the holders of Shares, in each
case as and to the  extent required by applicable federal securities Law. The
Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the Offer Documents and any amendments thereto prior to the filing
thereof with the SEC and Parent  shall give due consideration to all
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Company
and its counsel. In addition, Parent agrees to provide the Company and its
counsel any comments, whether written or oral, that Parent  may receive from
the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after the
receipt of such comments, and any written or oral responses thereto. The

any comments, whether written or oral, that the Company or its counsel may
receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D‑9 or from
the CFPB or its staff with  respect to the Offer and Merger or the CFPB Order
promptly after the receipt of such comments, and any written or oral responses

(a) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Company
shall be amended so that it reads in its entirety as  set forth in _Exhibit

terms and as provided by applicable Law.

 


 

 

(b) At the Effective Time, and without any further action on the part of the
Company and Merger Sub, the bylaws of the Company  shall be amended so that
they read in their entirety the same as the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that all references therein to
Merger Sub shall be automatically amended and shall become  references to the
Surviving Corporation, and, as so amended, shall be the bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with their terms,
the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and as
provided  by applicable Law.

Merger Sub:

 


 

 

(a) Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than (i) any Excluded Shares and (ii) any  Dissenting Shares) shall
thereupon be converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent the
right to receive the Offer Price in cash, without interest, and subject to
deduction for any required withholding Tax (the " _Merger Consideration_ ").
As of the Effective Time, all Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and shall  thereafter
only represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration, if any, to be

6  


 

 

(b) Each Share held in the treasury of the Company or owned, directly or
indirectly, by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior  to the Effective Time
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Rollover Shares) (collectively, "
_Excluded Shares_ ") shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to 
exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 


 

 

(c) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the  Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation.

 


 

 

(d) If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding  shares of capital stock of
the Company, or securities convertible into or exchangeable into or
exercisable for shares of such capital stock, shall occur as a result of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock 
split) or subdivision or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or
any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period
(excluding, in each case, normal quarterly cash dividends), merger or other
similar  transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted so
as to provide Parent and the holder of Shares the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event; _provided_ , that nothing
in this Section 3.1(d) shall be construed to permit the Company to take any
action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement.

 


 

 

Section 3.2 _Treatment of Options and Other Equity-Based Awards_.

 


 

 

(a) At the Effective Time, each option (each, a " _Company  Stock Option_ ")
to purchase Shares granted under the 1999 Stock Option Plan, the 2004 Stock
Option Plan, the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan and the 2014 Stock Incentive Plan
(the " _Company Stock Plans_ "), whether vested or unvested, that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and, in
exchange therefor, the Surviving Corporation shall pay to each former holder
of any  such cancelled Company Stock Option as soon as practicable following
the Effective Time an amount in cash (without interest, and subject to
deduction for any required withholding Tax) equal to the product of (i) the
excess of the Merger  Consideration over the exercise price per Share under
such Company Stock Option and (ii) the number of Shares subject to such
Company Stock Option; _provided_ , that if  the exercise price per Share of
any such Company Stock Option is equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration, such Company Stock Option shall be cancelled without any cash
payment being made in respect thereof.

 


 

 

(b) At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit award (each, a "
_Company RSU Award_ ") in respect of Shares granted under the Company Stock
Plans that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall fully
vest (to the extent unvested) and shall be cancelled and converted 
automatically into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Merger
Consideration in respect of each Share underlying such Company RSU Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

 

 

7  


 

 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver all required
notices (which notices shall have been approved by  Parent, in its reasonable
discretion) to each holder of Company Stock Options and Company RSU
Awards(collectively, the " _Equity Awards_ ") setting forth each holder's 
rights pursuant to the respective Company Stock Plan, stating that such Equity
Award shall be treated in the manner set forth in this Section 3.2.

 


 

 

(d) The Surviving Corporation shall pay the amounts described in this Section
3.2, less applicable Tax withholdings, as soon as  administratively
practicable (and, in any event, within thirty (30) Business Days) following
the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, to the
extent that payment of the amounts described in this Section 3.2 with 
respect to Equity Awards that constitute nonqualified deferred compensation
subject to Section 409A of the Code would otherwise cause the imposition of a
Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code, the Surviving Corporation shall
make such  payment at the earliest time permitted under the Company Stock
Plans and applicable award agreement that would not result in the imposition
of such Tax or penalty.

 


 

 

(e) The Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure that, as of the
Effective Time, (i) the Company Stock Plans shall  terminate and (ii) no
holder of an Equity Award or any participant in any Company Stock Plan or any
other employee incentive or benefit plan, program or arrangement or any non-
employee director plan maintained by the Company shall have any rights  to
acquire, or other rights in respect of, the capital stock of the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries, except the right to
receive the payments contemplated by Sections 3.2(a), (b), (c) and (d) in
cancellation and  settlement thereof.

 


 

 

Section 3.3 _Treatment of the Peak6 Warrant_.

 


 

 

(a) At the Effective Time, that certain Amended and Restated Warrant dated
April 20, 2017 issued by the Company to Peak6  Ventures LLC (the " _Peak6
Warrant_ ") to the extent it is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be deemed exercised and cancelled pursuant to its terms,  and in
exchange therefor, the Surviving Corporation shall pay to the holder thereof
as soon as practicable following the Effective Time an amount in cash (without
interest) equal to the product of (i) the excess of the Merger Consideration
over  the exercise price per Share under the Peak6 Warrant and (ii) the
number of Shares subject to the Peak6 Warrant. The amounts described in this
Section 3.3 shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the  Peak6 Warrant.

 


 

 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver all required
notices (which notices shall have been approved by  Parent, in its reasonable
discretion) to the holder of the Peak6 Warrant setting forth such holder's
rights pursuant to the Peak6 Warrant, stating that the Peak6 Warrant shall be
treated in the manner set forth in this Section 3.3.

 


 

 

Section 3.4 _Exchange and Payment_.

 


 

 

(a) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be
deposited) with a bank or trust company designated  by Parent and reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ "), in trust for the benefit
of holders of Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time (other  than
holders to the extent they hold Excluded Shares or Dissenting Shares), cash in
an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration in accordance
with Section 3.1(a) (such cash, the " _Payment Fund_ "). Except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement, the Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose
other than to fund payments due pursuant to this Article III.

 

 

 

8  


 

 

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail  to each holder of record of
a certificate (" _Certificates_ ") that immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented outstanding Shares that were converted into the right  to
receive the Merger Consideration (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates held by such Person shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the  Certificates to the Paying Agent, and which letter shall be in customary
form and contain such other provisions as Parent or the Paying Agent may
reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of such Certificates in  exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of a Certificate to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as the  Paying Agent may
reasonably require, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange for the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate
(other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) the Merger Consideration
for  each such Share (subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax),
and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Promptly
after the Effective Time and in any event not later than the third Business
Day thereafter, the  Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to
issue and send to each holder of uncertificated Shares represented by book
entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), other than  with respect to Excluded Shares
and Dissenting Shares, a check or wire transfer for the amount of cash that
such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 3.1(a) in respect of
such Book-Entry Shares, without such holder being required to  deliver a
Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent, and such
Book-Entry Shares shall then be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued
for the benefit of holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the
Merger  Consideration.

 


 

 

(c) If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered  Certificate or Book-Entry
Share is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that such Certificate
so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer or such Book-Entry Share shall be properly  transferred and that
the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry 
Share or shall have established to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax is
not applicable.

 


 

 

(d) Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.4, each Certificate or
Book-Entry Share shall be deemed after the  Effective Time to represent only
the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof,
pursuant to this Article III, without any interest thereon.

 


 

 

(e) All cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this  Article III shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
Shares formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be  closed and
there shall be no further registration of transfers of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent  for transfer or transfer is sought for Book-Entry Shares, such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided
in this Article III, subject to applicable Law in the case of Dissenting
Shares.

 

 

 

9  


 

 

(f) The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Payment Fund as
directed by Parent, on a daily basis. Any interest  or other income resulting
from such investments shall be paid to Parent, upon demand.

 


 

 

(g) Any portion of the Payment Fund (and any interest or other income earned
thereon) that remains undistributed to the holders  of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares nine months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the
Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any remaining holders of Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares (except to the extent representing Excluded  Shares or
Dissenting Shares) shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation as
general creditors thereof for payment of the Merger Consideration (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws), without interest.

 


 

 

(h) None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or any other
Person shall be liable to any Person in respect of  any portion of the
Payment Fund properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 


 

 

(i) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit, in form and substance  reasonably acceptable to
Parent, of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the
posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as Parent or the Paying 
Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed  Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof
pursuant to this Agreement.

 


 

 

(j) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent
pursuant to Section 3.1(a) to pay for Shares  for which appraisal rights have
been perfected as described in Section 3.6 shall be returned to Parent, upon
demand; _provided_ that the parties acknowledge that,  notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent shall not be required under
this Section 3.4 or otherwise to deposit with the Paying Agent any cash to pay
Merger Consideration with respect to Shares as to which its holder has 
purported to deliver a notice or demand of appraisal that has not been
withdrawn prior to the Closing Date.

 


 

 

Section 3.5 _Withholding Rights_. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation and the Paying Agent shall each be entitled to deduct and
withhold, or cause to be deducted and withheld, from the amounts otherwise
payable  pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent determines it is required to deduct
and withhold under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_
"), or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so deducted and withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been  paid to the Person in respect of
whom such deduction and withholding was made.

 

 

 

10  


 

 

Section 3.6 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time that are held by any holder who has not voted in favor of the  Merger
and who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such Shares
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be
converted into  the right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless and
until such holder shall have failed to perfect, or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost, such holder's right to appraisal under the DGCL. Dissenting
Shares shall be treated in  accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. If any
such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or loses any such right to
appraisal, each such Share of such holder shall thereupon be converted into
and become exchangeable only for the right to  receive, as of the later of
the Effective Time and the time that such right to appraisal has been
irrevocably lost, withdrawn or expired, the Merger Consideration in accordance
with Section 3.1(a). The Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent  of any
demands for appraisal of any Shares, attempted withdrawals of such notices or
demands and any other instruments received by the Company relating to rights
to appraisal, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct
all  negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company
shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to, settle or offer to settle, or approve any withdrawal of any such
demands.

 


 

 

ARTICLE IV

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 


 

 

Except as set forth in the corresponding section or subsection of the
disclosure letter delivered by the Company to Parent immediately  prior to
the execution of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ ") (it
being agreed that disclosure of any item in any section of the Company
Disclosure Letter  shall also be deemed disclosure with respect to any other
Section of this Agreement to which the relevance of such item is readily
apparent on the face of such disclosure), the Company represents and warrants
to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

 


 

 

Section 4.1 _Organization, Standing and Power_.

 


 

 

(a) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries (i) is an entity duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the  Laws of the jurisdiction of
its organization, (ii) has all requisite corporate or similar power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its
business as now being conducted, and (iii) is duly qualified or licensed to 
do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature
of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes
such qualification or licensing necessary, except in the case of clause (iii),
where the  failure to be so qualified or licensed or in good standing,
individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Material Adverse Effect_ " means any event, change, circumstance, occurrence,
effect or state of facts that (A) materially impairs or delays or would
reasonably be expected to impair or delay the  ability of the Company to
consummate the Offer, the Merger or any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (other than any stockholder litigation arising from or relating
to this Agreement, the Support Agreement or the transactions  contemplated
hereby or thereby); or (B) is or would reasonably be expected to be materially
adverse to the business, assets, liabilities, condition or, results of
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in the case of clause (B) only, Material Adverse Effect shall
not  include any such event, change, circumstance, occurrence, effect or
state of facts relating to or arising from (i) changes in general economic,
financial, social or political conditions, (ii) changes in any financial,
debt, credit, capital or  banking markets (including any disruption thereof),
(iii) changes in conditions generally affecting the industries in which the
Company and its Subsidiaries operate, (iv) changes in interest, currency or
exchange rates or the price of any  commodity, security or market index, (v)
changes in Law, GAAP or other accounting principles or requirements, or
standards or interpretations, (vi) the occurrence, escalation, outbreak or
worsening of any hostilities, war, police action, acts of  terrorism or
military conflicts, whether or not pursuant to the declaration of an emergency
or war, (vii) the existence, occurrence or continuation of any force majeure
events, including any earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, tropical storms,
fires  or other natural disasters or any national, international or regional
calamity, (viii) compliance by the Company and its Subsidiaries with the terms
of this Agreement, including the failure to take any action restricted by this
Agreement, or any  actions taken to the extent required by this Agreement,
(ix) any actions taken, or not taken, with the written consent, waiver or at
the written request of Parent, (x) the public announcement of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated by  this Agreement, (xi) any change in the
market price or trading volume of the Shares (provided, the underlying cause
of such failure or change may be taken into account in determining whether a
Material Adverse Effect has occurred), and (xii) any  stockholder litigation
arising from or relating to this Agreement, the Support Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, except, in the case of clauses
(i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi) and (vii), to the extent any such effect 
has a disproportionate adverse impact on the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, relative to other similarly situated companies in the
principal industries in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate.

(b) The Company has previously made available to Parent true and complete
copies of the Company's certificate of incorporation,  as amended (the "
_Company Charter_ ") and bylaws (the " _Company Bylaws_ ") and the certificate
of  incorporation and bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) of each
of its Subsidiaries, in each case as amended to the date of this Agreement,
and each as so delivered is in full force and effect. The Company is not in
violation of any  provision of the Company Charter or Company Bylaws. The
Company has made available to Parent true and complete copies of the minutes
(or, in the case of draft minutes, the most recent drafts thereof as of the
date of this Agreement) of all  meetings of the Company's stockholders, the
Company Board and each committee of the Company Board (other than the Special
Committee) and the minutes of meeting of the stockholders and board of
directors of each of its Subsidiaries held since  January 1, 2016.

 


 

 

Section 4.2 _Capital Stock_.

 


 

 

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 50,000,000 Shares
and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value  $0.01 per share (the "
_Company Preferred Stock_ "). As of October 31, 2018 (the " _Measurement Date_
"),    (i) 24,428,246 Shares were issued and outstanding, (ii) 25,571,754
Shares were authorized but unissued, (iii) no Shares were held by the Company
in its treasury, (iv) no shares  of Company Preferred Stock were issued and
outstanding and no shares of Company Preferred Stock were held by the Company

to Company Stock Plans (of which (A) 2,772,887  Shares were subject to
outstanding Company Stock Options, and (B) 1,812,836 Shares were subject to
Company RSU Awards). All outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company
are, and all shares reserved for issuance will be, when issued, duly 
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not subject to
any preemptive rights. No shares of capital stock of the Company are owned by
any Subsidiary of the Company. All outstanding shares of capital stock and
other voting  securities or equity interests of each Subsidiary of the
Company have been duly authorized and validly issued, are fully paid,
nonassessable and not subject to any preemptive rights. Except for the
Company's obligations under its Credit Agreement  with Peak6 Investments,
L.P., all outstanding shares of capital stock and other voting securities or
equity interests of each such Subsidiary are owned, directly or indirectly, by
the Company, free and clear of all pledges, claims, liens,  charges, options,
rights of first refusal, encumbrances and security interests of any kind or
nature whatsoever (including any limitation on voting, sale, transfer or other
disposition or exercise of any other attribute of ownership)  (collectively,
" _Liens_ "). Except as set forth in Section 4.2(a) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has outstanding any 
bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations having the right to vote (or
convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, securities having the
right to vote) with the stockholders of the Company or such Subsidiary on any
matter. Except as  set forth above in this Section 4.2(a) and except for
changes since the close of business on the Measurement Date resulting from the
exercise of Company Stock Options or vesting or settlement of Company RSU
Awards described in Section 4.2(a) of  the Company Disclosure Letter, there
are no outstanding (A) shares of capital stock or other voting securities or
equity interests of the Company, (B) securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries convertible into or exchangeable or  exercisable for shares of
capital stock of the Company or other voting securities or equity interests of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (C) stock appreciation rights,
"phantom" stock rights, performance units, interests in or rights to  the
ownership or earnings of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or other
equity equivalent or equity-based awards or rights, (D) subscriptions,
options, warrants, calls, commitments, Contracts or other rights to acquire
from the Company or  any of its Subsidiaries, or obligations of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, any shares of capital stock of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, voting securities, equity interests or
securities convertible into or exchangeable  or exercisable for capital stock
or other voting securities or equity interests of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or rights or interests described in the preceding clause (C), or
(E) obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries  to repurchase,
redeem or otherwise acquire any such securities or to issue, grant, deliver or
sell, or cause to be issued, granted, delivered or sold, any such securities.
There are no stockholder agreements, voting trusts or other agreements or 
understandings to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with
respect to the holding, voting, registration, redemption, repurchase or
disposition of, or that restricts the transfer of, any capital stock or other
voting securities  or equity interests of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

 

 

 

12  


 

 

(b) Section 4.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and
complete list of all holders, as of the close of  business on the Measurement
Date, of outstanding Equity Awards and other similar rights to purchase or
receive Shares or similar rights granted under the Company Stock Plans or
otherwise (collectively, " _Company Stock Awards_ "), indicating as
applicable, with respect to each Company Stock Award then outstanding, the
type of award granted, the number of Shares subject to such Company Stock
Award, the name of the  plan under which such Company Stock Award was
granted, the date of grant, exercise or purchase price, vesting schedule,
payment schedule (if different from the vesting schedule) and expiration
thereof, and whether (and to what extent) the vesting  of such Company Stock
Award will be accelerated or otherwise adjusted in any way by the consummation
of the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each Company Stock Option intended to qualify as an  "incentive
stock option" under Section 422 of the Code so qualifies and the exercise
price of each other Company Stock Option is no less than the fair market value
of a Share as determined on the date of grant of such Company Stock Option.
The  Company has made available to Parent true and complete copies of the
Company Stock Plans and the forms of all award agreements evidencing
outstanding Equity Awards. All Equity Awards can be involuntarily cancelled
without the award holder's  consent prior to or upon the consummation of the
Merger (including any options that have an exercise price equal to or greater
than the Merger Consideration, and therefore with respect to which no payment
will be made in connection with such  cancellation).

 

 

 

13  


 

 

Section 4.3 _Subsidiaries_. Section 4.3 of the Company Disclosure Letter sets
forth a true and complete list of each Subsidiary of the Company, including
its jurisdiction of incorporation or formation. Except for the capital  stock
of, or other equity or voting interests in, its Subsidiaries, the Company does
not own, directly or indirectly, any equity, membership interest, partnership
interest, joint venture interest, or other equity or voting interest in, or
any  interest convertible into, exercisable or exchangeable for any of the
foregoing, nor is it under any current or prospective obligation to form or
participate in, provide funds to, make any loan, capital contribution,
guarantee, credit enhancement  or other investment in, or assume any
liability or obligation of, any Person.

 


 

 

Section 4.4 _Authority_.

 


 

 

(a) Assuming the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated
in accordance with Section 251(h) of the DGCL, the  Company has all necessary
corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations
under this Agreement and to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby. Assuming the accuracy of the 
representations and warranties made in Section 5.8 of this Agreement, the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company and the
consummation by the Company of the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated  hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of the Company and no other corporate proceedings
on the part of the Company are necessary to approve this Agreement or to
consummate the Offer, the Merger and the  other transactions contemplated
hereby. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company
and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and
Merger Sub, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the  Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms (except to the
extent that enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar Laws affecting the
enforcement of  creditors' rights generally or by general principles of
equity).

 


 

 

(b) The Special Committee and the Company Board, each at a meeting duly
called and held at which all members of the  Special Committee or directors
of the Company, as applicable, were present, unanimously adopted resolutions
(i) approving and declaring advisable the terms of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the  Merger, (ii)
determining the Offer and the Merger to be fair to and in the best interests
of the Company and the stockholders of the Company (including the stockholders
other than the Rollover Holders), (iii) determining that the Merger is 
governed by Section 251(h) of the DGCL, and (iv) recommending that the holders
of Common Stock accept the Offer and tender their shares of Common Stock
pursuant to the Offer, which resolutions have not been subsequently rescinded,
modified or  withdrawn in any way as of the date of this Agreement.

 

 

 

14  


 

 

(c) Assuming the Minimum Condition is satisfied, no vote or consent of the
holders of any class or series of the  Company's capital stock or other
securities is required to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the Offer,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 


 

 

Section 4.5 _No Conflict; Consents and Approvals_.

 


 

 

(a) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
does not, and the consummation of the Offer, the  Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and compliance by the Company with the
provisions hereof will not, conflict with, or result in any violation or
breach of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)
under,  or give rise to a right of, or result in, termination, cancellation,
modification or acceleration of any obligation or to the loss of a benefit
under, or result in the creation of any Lien in or upon any of the properties,
assets or rights of the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries under, or give
rise to any increased, additional, accelerated or guaranteed rights or

the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets may be
bound, or (iii)  subject to the governmental filings and other matters
referred to in Section 4.5(b), any federal, state, local or foreign law

judgment, injunction, decree or other legally  enforceable requirement ("
_Law_ ") or any Nasdaq rule or regulation applicable to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries  or any
of their respective properties or assets may be bound, except in the case of
clauses (ii) or (iii) for any conflict, violation, breach, or default, loss,
right or other occurrence which, individually or in the aggregate, has not had
and  would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

declaration, filing with or notice to, any federal, state,  local or foreign

judicial, arbitral, legislative, executive, regulatory or self-regulatory

(a) The Company has filed with or furnished to the SEC on a timely basis true
and complete copies of all forms, reports,  schedules, statements and other
documents required to be filed with or furnished to the SEC by the Company
since January 1, 2016 (all such documents, together with all exhibits and

therein by reference, the " _Company SEC Documents_ "). As of their respective
filing dates (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of
this  Agreement, then on the date of such filing), the Company SEC Documents

Section 6.2 _No Solicitation; Recommendation of the Merger_.

 


 

 

(a) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, and neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall authorize  or permit any director,
officer, employee, investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant
or other advisor, agent or representative (collectively, " _Representatives_
")          of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, endorse, encourage or facilitate any
inquiry, proposal or offer with respect to, or the making or completion of,
any Acquisition Proposal, or any  inquiry, proposal or offer that is
reasonably likely to lead to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into,
continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any Person any information or data with  respect to,
any Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) resolve, agree or propose to do any of the
foregoing. The Company shall, and shall direct its Subsidiaries and the
Representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries, to, (A) immediately cease
and  cause to be terminated all existing discussions and negotiations with
any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or
potential Acquisition Proposal and immediately terminate all physical and
electronic data room  access previously granted to any such Person, (B)
request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information
previously furnished with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or potential
Acquisition Proposal, and (C) not terminate,  waive, amend, release or modify
any provision of any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it or
any of its Affiliates or Representatives is a party with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal, and shall  enforce
the provisions of any such agreement ( _provided_ , that the Company shall be
permitted to grant waivers of, and not enforce, any standstill agreement, but
solely to  the extent that the Company Board has determined in good faith,
after consultation with its outside counsel, that failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the
Company under applicable  Law). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time
following the date of this Agreement and prior to the Acceptance Time, (1) the
Company receives a written Acquisition Proposal that was unsolicited and did
not otherwise result from a breach of  this Section 6.2, (2) the Special
Committee determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel
and its financial advisor) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is
reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, and (3)  the Special
Committee determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel)
that the failure to take the actions referred to in clause (x) or (y) below
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the 
Company under applicable Law, then the Company may (x) furnish information
with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement
containing terms  substantially similar to, and no less favorable in any
material respect to the Company than, those set forth in the Confidentiality
Agreement (including any standstill agreement contained therein) (an "
_Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ "); _provided_ , that any non-public
information provided to any such Person shall have been  previously provided
to Parent or shall be provided to Parent prior to or concurrently with the
time it is provided to such Person, and (y) participate in discussions or
negotiations with the Person making such Acquisition Proposal regarding such 
Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall not provide (and shall not permit any
of its Representatives to provide) any commercially or competitively sensitive
non-public information in connection with the actions permitted by this
Section 6.2(a),  except in accordance with "clean room" or other similar
procedures designed to limit any adverse effect of the sharing of such
information on the Company, which procedures shall be consistent in all
material respects with the Company's practices  in dealing with the
disclosures of such information to Parent or its Representatives.

 

 

 

45  


 

 

(b) Neither the Company Board nor the Special Committee shall:

 


 

 

(i) (A) withdraw (or modify or qualify in any manner adverse to Parent or
Merger Sub) the recommendation or declaration of  advisability by the Company
Board or the Special Committee of this Agreement, the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated hereby, (B) recommend or otherwise declare
advisable the approval by the Company stockholders of any  Acquisition
Proposal, (C) resolve, agree or propose to take any such actions, or (D) make
any public announcements with respect to such actions (each such action set
forth in this Section 6.2(b)(i) being referred to herein as an " _Adverse
Recommendation Change_ "); or

 


 

 

(ii) cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,  agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture
agreement, partnership agreement or other Contract, except for an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement (each, an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ "),
in each case constituting or related to, or which is intended to or is
reasonably likely to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, or resolve, agree or
propose to  take any such actions.

 


 

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, the
Special Committee may, if the Special Committee determines in good faith 
(after consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company
under applicable Law, taking into account all adjustments to the terms of this
Agreement that  may be offered by Parent pursuant to this Section 6.2, (x)
make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to either (I) a Superior
Proposal or (II) an Intervening Event, or (y) solely in response to a Superior
Proposal received after the date  hereof that was unsolicited and did not
otherwise result from a breach of this Section 6.2, cause the Company to
terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1(d)(ii) and
concurrently enter into a binding and definitive (as opposed to a  letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding or agreement in principle) Alternative
Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company may not make an Adverse Recommendation Change in
response to a Superior Proposal or terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(d)(ii) unless:

 

 

 

46  


 

 

(A) the Company notifies Parent in writing at least three Business Days before
taking that action of its intention to do so, and specifies the reasons
therefor, including the material terms and conditions of, and the identity of
the  Person making, such Superior Proposal, and contemporaneously furnishes a
copy (if any) of such proposed Alternative Acquisition Agreement and any other
relevant transaction documents (it being understood and agreed that any
amendment to the  financial terms or any other material term of such Superior
Proposal shall require a new written notice by the Company and a new five
Business Day period); and

 


 

 

(B) if Parent makes a proposal during such three Business Day period to adjust
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company Board or the Special
Committee, after taking into consideration the adjusted terms and conditions
of  this Agreement as proposed by Parent, continues to determine in good
faith (after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisor) that
such Superior Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal and that the
failure to make an  Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this
Agreement, as applicable, would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to
the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law;

 


 

 

_provided_ _further_ ,  that neither Company Board nor the Special Committee
may make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event
unless:

 


 

 

(1) the Company provides Parent with written information describing such
Intervening Event in reasonable detail as soon as  reasonably practicable
after becoming aware of it;

 


 

 

(2) the Company notifies Parent in writing at least three Business Days before
making an Adverse Recommendation Change with  respect to such Intervening
Event of its intention to do so and specifies the reasons therefor; and

 


 

 

(3) if Parent makes a proposal during such three Business Day period to adjust
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the  Company Board, after taking
into consideration the adjusted terms and conditions of this Agreement as
proposed by Parent, continues to determine in good faith (after consultation
with outside counsel) that the failure to make such Adverse  Recommendation
Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable Law.

 


 

 

During the three Business Day period prior to its effecting an Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement as referred to above,
the  Company shall, and shall cause its financial and legal advisors to be
reasonably available to Parent and negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the
extent Parent seeks to negotiate) regarding any revisions to the terms or
structure of the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement proposed by
Parent that would result in a Superior Proposal ceasing to be a Superior
Proposal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries  shall enter into any Alternative
Acquisition Agreement unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance
with its terms (including the payment of the Company Termination Fee pursuant
to Section 8.3(b), if applicable).

 

 

 

47  


 

 

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in Section 6.2(a)
and Section 6.2(b), the Company promptly (and  in any event within 24 hours
of receipt) shall advise Parent in writing in the event the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or Representatives receives (i) any inquiry or request for
information, discussion or negotiation that is reasonably  likely to lead to
or that contemplates an Acquisition Proposal, or (ii) any proposal or offer
that is or is reasonably likely to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, in each
case together with a description of the material terms and conditions of any 
such indication, inquiry, request, proposal or offer, the identity of the
Person making any such indication, inquiry, request, proposal or offer, and a
copy of any written proposal, offer or draft agreement provided by such
Person. The Company  shall keep Parent informed (orally and in writing) in
all material respects on a timely basis of the status (including, within 24
hours after the occurrence of any amendment, modification, development,
discussion or negotiation) of any such  Acquisition Proposal, request,
inquiry, proposal or offer, including furnishing copies of any written
inquiries, correspondence and draft documentation, and written summaries of
any material oral inquiries or discussions. Without limiting any of  the
foregoing, the Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours)
notify Parent orally and in writing if it determines to begin providing
information or to engage in discussions or negotiations concerning an
Acquisition Proposal  pursuant to Section 6.2(a) or Section 6.2(b) and shall
in no event begin providing such information or engaging in such discussions
or negotiations prior to providing such notice. The Company shall provide
Parent with at least 24 hours prior  notice (or such shorter notice as may be
provided to the Special Committee) of a meeting of the Special Committee at
which the Special Committee is reasonably expected to consider an Acquisition
Proposal.

 


 

 

(d) The Company agrees that any violation of the restrictions set forth in
this Section 6.2 by any Representative of the  Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether or not such Person is purporting to act on behalf of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a
breach of this Agreement by the Company.

 


 

 

(e) The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into
any confidentiality agreement with any Person  subsequent to the date of this
Agreement that would restrict the Company's ability to comply with any of the
terms of this Section 6.2, and represents that neither it nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to any such agreement.

 


 

 

(f) The Company shall not take any action to exempt any Person (other than
Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates)  from the restrictions on
"business combinations" contained in Section 203 of the DGCL (or any similar
provision of any other Takeover Law) or otherwise cause such restrictions not
to apply, or agree to do any of the foregoing, in each case unless  such
actions are taken substantially concurrently with a termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(ii).

 


 

 

(g) Nothing contained in Section 6.2(a) shall prohibit the Company from taking
and disclosing a position contemplated by Rule  14e‑2(a), Rule 14d‑9 or Item
1012(a) of Regulation M‑A promulgated under the Exchange Act; provided,
however, that any such disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen"
communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by  Section
14d 9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be an Adverse
Recommendation Change (including for purposes of Section 8.1(c)(ii)) unless
the Company Board and the Special Committee expressly reaffirm their
recommendation to the  Company's stockholders in favor of the approval of
this Agreement and the Merger in such disclosure and expressly rejects any
applicable Acquisition Proposal.

 

 

 

48  


 

 

(h) For purposes of this Agreement:

 


 

 

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any proposal or  offer with respect to
any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in one transaction or a series
of transactions, and whether through any merger, reorganization,
consolidation, tender offer, self-tender, exchange offer, stock acquisition, 
asset acquisition, binding share exchange, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint venture or otherwise, of (A)
assets or businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries that generate 10% or
more of the net revenues  or net income (for the 12‑month period ending on
the last day of the Company's most recently completed fiscal quarter) or that
represent 10% or more of the total assets (based on fair market value) of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a  whole, immediately prior to such
transaction, or (B) 10% or more of any class of capital stock, other equity
securities or voting power of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any
resulting parent company of the Company, in each case other  than the Offer,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 


 

 

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means any unsolicited  bona fide binding written
Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board or the Special Committee
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and its
financial advisor), taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and 
other aspects of the proposal, including the financing terms thereof, and the
Person making the proposal, is (A) more favorable to the stockholders of the
Company (other than to Rollover Holders) from a financial point of view than
the Offer, the  Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including any adjustment to the terms and conditions proposed by
Parent in response to such proposal), and (B) reasonably likely of being
completed on the terms proposed on a  timely basis; _provided_ , that, for
purposes of this definition of "Superior Proposal," references in the term
"Acquisition Proposal" to "10%" shall be deemed to be  references to "50%";
and

 


 

 

(iii) " _Intervening Event_ " means a fundamental and  material event or
circumstance that relates to the Company and its Subsidiaries that was not
known or reasonably foreseeable to the Company Board prior to the execution of

consequence thereof, becomes known to the Company Board or the Special
Committee prior to the Acceptance Time that does not relate to (A) an
Acquisition Proposal, (B) Parent or  its Subsidiaries (including any Material
Adverse Effect as it relates to Parent or its Subsidiaries), or (C) any
actions taken pursuant to this Agreement.

properties, assets, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records and,
during such period, the  Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to Parent: (a) a copy of each report,
schedule, registration statement and other document filed or received by it
during such period pursuant to the requirements of  federal or state
securities laws and (b) all other information concerning its business,
properties and personnel as Parent or Merger Sub may reasonably request
(including Tax Returns filed and those in preparation and the workpapers of
its  auditors); _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not require
the Company to disclose  any information to the extent such disclosure would
contravene applicable Law. All such information shall be held confidential in
accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement between the Company
and iSubscribed, Inc., an Affiliate  of Parent, dated as of September 20,
2018(the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "). No investigation pursuant to this
Section 6.3 or information provided, made available or  delivered to Parent

Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made with, or written materials
submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection
with the Offer, the Merger  and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In exercising the foregoing rights, each of Parent and the Company
shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Subject to applicable Law
and the instructions of any Governmental  Entity, the Company and Parent
shall keep each other reasonably apprised of the status of matters relating to
the completion of the transactions contemplated hereby, including promptly

respective Subsidiaries, from any Governmental Entity and/or third party with
respect to such transactions, and, to the extent practicable under the 
circumstances, shall provide the other party and its counsel with the
opportunity to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity in
respect of any filing, investigation or other inquiry in connection with the
transactions contemplated  hereby.

 

 

 

50  


 

 

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in
no event shall Parent or any of its Affiliates  be required to (i) agree or

other action with respect to, any of the assets or businesses of Parent or any
of its Affiliates or, assuming the consummation of the Merger,  the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Affiliates, (ii) agree or proffer to limit in any
manner whatsoever or not to exercise any rights of ownership of any securities

its directors or executive officers relating to this Agreement, the Offer, the
Merger and/or the other transactions contemplated hereby and shall keep Parent
promptly and reasonably informed regarding any such litigation (including by 
providing copies of all pleadings with respect thereto). The Company shall
give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any
such litigation and shall give due consideration to Parent's views with
respect thereto. The  Company shall not agree to any settlement of any such
litigation without Parent's prior written consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 


 

 

Section 6.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company and Parent shall

Section 6.8 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 


 

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification existing in
favor of the current or former directors and  officers of the Company as
provided in the Company Charter or Company Bylaws as in effect on the date of
this Agreement for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time
shall be assumed and performed by the Surviving Corporation and  shall
continue in full force and effect for a period of six years after the
Effective Time with respect to any claims against such directors or officers
arising out of such acts or omissions, except as otherwise required by
applicable Law.

 


 

 

(b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to
be maintained in effect the Company's current  directors' and officers'
liability insurance covering each Person currently covered by the Company's
directors' and officers' liability insurance policy (a correct and complete
copy of which has been heretofore made available to Parent) for acts  or
omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , that Parent may
(i) substitute therefor policies of an insurance company the material terms of
which,  including coverage and amount, are no less favorable in any material
respect to such directors and officers than the Company's existing policies as
of the date hereof or (ii) request that the Company obtain such extended
reporting period coverage  under its existing insurance programs (to be
effective as of the Effective Time); and _provided_ _further_ ,  that in no
event shall Parent or the Company be required to pay annual premiums for
insurance under this Section 6.8(b) in excess of 300% of the amount of the
annual premiums paid by the Company for fiscal year 2018 for such purpose
(which fiscal  year 2018 premiums are hereby represented and warranted by the
Company to be as set forth in Section 6.8(b) of the Company Disclosure
Letter), it being understood that Parent shall nevertheless be obligated to
provide as much coverage as may be  obtained for such 300% amount. In
addition, Parent and Surviving Corporation shall fulfill and honor in all
respects the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to: (x)
each indemnification agreement set forth in Section 6.8(b)  of the Company
Disclosure Letter between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any
director or officer as the indemnified party therein to the extent the same is
in effect as of the date hereof; and (y) any indemnification provision 
(including advancement of expenses) and any exculpation provision set forth in
the Company Charter or the Company Bylaws or otherwise in the resolutions of
the Company set forth in Section 6.8(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, as
each is in  effect on the date hereof. Parent's and the Surviving
Corporation's obligations under the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) shall
continue in full force and effect for a period of six (6) years from the
Effective Time; provided, however, that all  rights to indemnification,
exculpation and advancement of expenses in respect of any claim threatened,
asserted or made within such period shall continue until the final disposition
of such claim.

 

 

 

52  


 

 

(c) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge  into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, Parent
shall  cause proper provision to be made so that the successor and assign of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation assumes the obligations set forth in this
Section 6.8.

 


 

 

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.8 (i) shall survive consummation of the
Merger and are intended to be for the benefit of,  and will be enforceable
by, each indemnified party, his or her heirs and his or her legal
representatives and (ii) may not be amended without the consent of each
indemnified party.

 


 

 

Section 6.9 _Public Announcements_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one
hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall, to the extent reasonably
practicable, consult with each other before issuing, and give each other  a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other
public statements with respect to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press
release or  make any public announcement prior to such consultation and

exchange or national securities  quotation system.

 


 

 

Section 6.10 _Stock Exchange Delisting; Deregistration_. Prior to the Closing
Date, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be  done all
things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable
laws and Nasdaq rules and policies to enable the delisting by the Surviving
Corporation of the Shares from Nasdaq and the deregistration of the Shares
under  the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time,
and in any event no more than 10 days after the Closing Date.

 


 

 

Section 6.11 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
Board shall take all such steps as may be necessary or appropriate to cause
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any  dispositions
of Shares (including derivative securities with respect to such Shares)

(A) (1) an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not conditional) is made directly
to the Company's stockholders or is otherwise publicly disclosed or otherwise
communicated to senior management of the Company or the Company Board, (2)
this  Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to Section
8.1(b)(i) or by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(i), and (3) within 12 months
after the date of such termination, the Company enters into an agreement in
respect of any  Acquisition Proposal, or a transaction in respect of any
Acquisition Proposal is consummated, which, in each case, need not be the same
Acquisition Proposal that was made, disclosed or communicated prior to
termination hereof ( _provided_ , that for purposes of this clause (3), each
reference to "10%" in the definition of "Acquisition  Proposal" shall be
deemed to be a reference to "50%");

 


 

 

(B) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(ii); or

 


 

 

(C) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section
8.1(d)(ii);

 


 

 

then, in any such event, the Company shall pay to Parent a fee of $3,595,838
(the " _Company          Termination Fee_ ") less the amount of
Parent Expenses previously paid to Parent (if any) pursuant to Section 8.3(c).

any Collection Costs payable, shall  be deemed to be liquidated damages and
such amounts shall be sole and exclusive remedy of Parent, Merger Sub and any
other Person against the Company's Related Parties, and none of the Company's
Related Parties shall have any other liability or  obligation (other than to
the Company) for any losses, claims, damages or liabilities suffered or
incurred by Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person relating to or arising out
of this Agreement, and neither Parent, Merger Sub nor any other person  shall
be entitled to bring or maintain any other Action against the Company or any
other of the Company's Related Party arising out of this Agreement, or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby or any matters forming the basis for

the avoidance of doubt, in no circumstances will Company be required to pay
the Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

 


 

 

(ii) Payment of the Company Termination Fee shall be made by wire transfer of
same-day funds to the accounts designated by  Parent (A) on the earliest of

any transaction contemplated by an Acquisition Proposal, as applicable, in the
case of a Company Termination Fee payable pursuant to  Section 8.3(b)(i)(A),
(B) as promptly as reasonably practicable after termination (and, in any
event, within two Business Days thereof), in the case of termination by Parent
pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(ii), or (C) simultaneously with, and as a 
condition to the effectiveness of, termination, in the case of a termination
by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(ii).

 

 

 

60  


 

 

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent
pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i) as a result of the  failure of the Minimum
Condition to be satisfied or by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(i), under
circumstances in which the Company Termination Fee is not then payable
pursuant to Section 8.3(b)(i)(A), then the Company shall reimburse Parent 
and its Affiliates for all of their reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses
(including all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, investment bankers,
experts and consultants to Parent and Merger Sub and their Affiliates)
incurred by Parent  or Merger Sub or on their behalf in connection with or
related to the authorization, preparation, investigation, negotiation,
execution and performance of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby (the " _Parent Expenses_ "), up to a maximum amount of $2,500,000;
provided, that the payment by the Company of the Parent Expenses pursuant to
this Section 8.3, (i) shall not relieve the Company of any  subsequent
obligation to pay the Company Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.3(b)
except to the extent indicated in such Section and (ii) shall not relieve the
Company from any liability or damage resulting from a willful and material
breach of  any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
set forth in this Agreement or fraud. Payment of the Parent Expense shall be
made by wire transfer of same day funds to the accounts designated by Parent
within two Business Days  after the Company's having been notified of the
amounts thereof by Parent.

 


 

 

(d) _Parent Termination Fee_.

 


 

 

(i) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
Section 8.1(d)(i) or Section 8.1(d)(iii) then,  in any such event, Parent
shall pay to the Company a fee of $3,595,838 (the " _Parent Termination Fee_
"). The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Parent Termination  Fee,
together with any Collection Costs payable, shall be deemed to be liquidated
damages and such amounts shall be sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and
any other Person against the Parent's or Merger Sub's Related Parties, and
none of  Parent's or Merger Sub's Related Parties shall have any other
liability or obligation (other than to Parent) for any losses, claims, damages
or liabilities suffered or incurred by the Company or any other Person
relating to or arising out of this  Agreement, the Limited Guaranty, the
Equity Financing Commitment, and neither the Company nor any other person
shall be entitled to bring or maintain any other Action against Parent or any
other of Parent's Related Parties arising out of this  Agreement, the Limited
Guaranty or the Equity Financing Commitment, or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or any matters forming the basis for such
termination, whether in law, in contract, in tort, or otherwise. For the 
avoidance of doubt, while the Company may pursue both a grant of specific
performance pursuant to Section 9.10 and damages (including the payment of the
Parent Termination Fee), under no circumstances will the Company be permitted
or entitled to  receive both a grant of specific performance, on the one
hand, and damages or the Parent Termination Fee, on the other hand, and in no
circumstances will Parent or Merger Sub be required to pay the Parent
Termination Fee on more than one  occasion. It is acknowledged and agreed
that, notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub may elect to
consummate the Offer, Merger and other transactions contemplated hereby in
lieu of paying the Parent Termination Fee following a  demand for payment of
the same.

 

 

 

61  


 

 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no Financing
Source Party shall have any liability or  obligation to the Company, any of
its Affiliates or any of its or their direct or indirect stockholders relating
to or arising out of this Agreement, the Limited Guaranty or in respect of any
oral representation made or alleged to be have been  made in connection
herewith or therewith, whether in equity or at law, in contract, in tort or
otherwise, and the Company shall not seek to, and shall cause its Affiliates
and its and their direct and indirect stockholders not to seek to, recover 
any money damages (including consequential, special, indirect or punitive
damages, or damages on account of a willful and material breach) or obtain any
equitable relief from or with respect to any Financing Source Party.

 


 

 

(iii) Payment of the Parent Termination Fee shall be made by wire transfer of
same-day funds to the accounts designated by the  Company as promptly as
reasonably practicable after termination (and, in any event, within two
Business Days thereof), in the case of termination by the Company pursuant to
Section 8.1(d)(i) or Section 8.1(d)(iii).

 


 

 

(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the parties
acknowledge and agree that the maximum aggregate  liability of Parent, Merger
Sub and any other of Parent's Related Parties under this Agreement, the
Limited Guaranty, the Equity Financing Commitment or relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be limited to (A) the 
Parent Termination Fee, _plus_ (B) the Collection Costs (the sum of clauses
(A) and (B), the " _Maximum  Parent Liability Amount_ "), and in no event
shall the Company or any other person seek to recover any money damages
(including consequential, indirect or punitive damages) in excess of the
Maximum Parent Liability Amount.

 


 

 

(e) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral  part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company would not enter into this
Agreement. Accordingly, if a party fails promptly to pay any amounts due
pursuant to this  Section 8.3 (the "delinquent party"), and, in order to
obtain such payment, the other party commences a suit that results in a
judgment against the Company for the amounts set forth in this Section 8.3,
the delinquent party shall pay to the other  party its costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on the amounts due pursuant to this Section 8.3
from the date such payment was required to be made until the  date of payment
at the prime lending rate as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect
on the date such payment was required to be made, up to an aggregate amount 
not to exceed $250,000 (collectively, the " _Collection Costs_ ").

 


 

 

Section 8.4 _Amendment or Supplement_. This Agreement may be amended, modified
or supplemented by the parties by action taken or authorized by the Special
Committee with respect to the Company and by the Board of Directors  of
Parent and the Board of Directors of Merger Sub with respect to Parent and
Merger Sub, respectively, as applicable, at any time prior to the Effective
Time, if applicable; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that after Merger Sub has
accepted for payment and paid for Shares pursuant to the Offer, no amendment
may be made which decreases the Merger Consideration.  This Agreement may not
be amended, modified or supplemented in any manner, whether by course of

by this Agreement, including but not limited to any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to any debt financing pursuant to Section 6.16 or the

fails to complete the Closing pursuant to and in accordance with Section 2.2,
(iii) the Company has irrevocably confirmed by written notice to Parent and
Merger Sub that (A) the Company is ready, willing and able to consummate the
Offer, the  Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and to take
such actions required of it by this Agreement to cause the consummation of the
Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement to
occur and (B) if  specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing is
funded, the Closing will occur substantially simultaneously with the drawdown

jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision  or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and

or indication to any third party that any breach or violation exists or has
actually occurred.

officers, employees, agents, partners, managers or equity holders for any
obligations or  liabilities of any party hereto under this Agreement or for

EXHIBIT A

 


 

 

CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER

 


 

 

Capitalized terms used in this _Exhibit A_ and not  otherwise defined shall
have the respective meanings assigned thereto in the Agreement and Plan of
Merger to which this _Exhibit A_ is attached (the " _Merger Agreement_ ").

 


 

 

Notwithstanding any other term of the Offer or the Merger Agreement, Merger
Sub shall not be required to accept for payment or,  subject to any
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e‑1(c) under the
Exchange Act (relating to Merger Sub's obligation to pay for or return
tendered Shares promptly after the termination or withdrawal of the Offer),
to  pay for any Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer and, subject to the
terms of the Merger Agreement, may delay the acceptance for payment of or
payment for Shares or may terminate or amend the Offer, if:

 


 

 

(a) prior to the Expiration Date, there shall not have been validly tendered
and "received" (as defined by Section 251(h)(6)  of the DGCL) (not counting
as validly tendered any Shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery
procedures that have not yet been "received" (as defined by Section 251(h)(6)
of the DGCL) in settlement or satisfaction of such guarantee) and not 
withdrawn a number of Shares that, (i) together with the Shares (including
Rollover Shares), if any, then owned by Holdings, Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, would represent at least one Share more than 50% of the number
of Shares (including  Rollover Shares) that are then issued and outstanding
on a fully diluted basis (which means, as of any time, the number of Shares
outstanding, together with all Shares that the Company would be required to
issue pursuant to the conversion or  exercise of all options, rights and
securities convertible into or exercisable for Shares or otherwise, including
after giving effect to Section 3.2(a), and regardless of the conversion or

Unless the Corporation, in writing, selects or consents to the selection of an
alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for  any current or former
stockholder (including any current or former beneficial owner) to bring
internal corporate claims (as defined below), to the fullest extent permitted
by law, and subject to applicable jurisdictional requirements, shall  be the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does
not have jurisdiction, another state court or a federal court located within
the State of Delaware). For purposes of this article, internal corporate 
claims means claims, including claims in the right of the Corporation: (a)
that are based upon a violation of a duty by a current or former director,
officer, employee or stockholder in such capacity; or (b) as to which the
General  Corporation Law confers jurisdiction upon the Court of Chancery.

 


 

 

2. CONSENT TO JURISDICTION.

 


 

 

If any action the subject matter of which is within the scope of this article
is filed in a court other than the Court of Chancery (or, if the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware does not have jurisdiction, another state
court or a federal court located within the State of  Delaware) (a "foreign
action") by any current or former stockholder (including any current or former
beneficial owner), such stockholder shall be deemed to have consented to: (a)
the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (or such  other state or
federal court located within the State of Delaware, as applicable) in
connection with any action brought in any such court to enforce this article;
and (b) having service of process made upon such stockholder in any such 
action by service upon such stockholder's counsel in the foreign action as
agent for such stockholder.

 


 

 

3. ENFORCEABILITY.

 


 

 

If any provision of this article shall be held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable as applied to any person or entity or  circumstance for any
reason whatsoever, then, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the validity,
legality and enforceability of such provision in any other circumstance and of
the remaining provisions of this article (including, without  limitation,
each portion of any sentence of this article containing any such provision
held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable that is not itself held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable) and the application of such provision to 
other persons or entities or circumstances shall not in any way be affected or
