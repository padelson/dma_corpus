26.1

|

All sums payable (other than payments of Consideration or payments under
Clause 10.9) by any party under this Agreement shall be paid free and clear of
all deductions, withholdings, set-offs or counterclaims whatsoever save only
as may be required by law. If any deductions or withholdings are required by
law in respect of any payment made under this Agreement, then (other than in

the payer shall be obliged to pay to the recipient such additional amounts as
will ensure that the recipient receives, in total, an amount which (after such
deduction or withholding has been made) is no more and no less than it would

deduction or withholding. 

| 
---|--- 

26.2

|

If the recipient of a payment under Clause 26.1 above obtains a refund of or
obtains and utilises a credit for any Tax payable by it or similar benefit by
reason of any deduction or withholding for or on account of Taxation for which
it has been compensated in accordance with Clause 26.1 then it shall reimburse
to the payer such part of such additional amounts paid to it pursuant to
Clause 26.1 as the recipient determines will leave it (after such
reimbursement) in no better and no worse position than would have been the
case if the payer had not been required to make such deduction or withholding. 

| 
---|--- 

26.3

|

Where any payment (other than payments of Consideration or payments under
Clause 10.9) is made or to be made by any party under this Agreement then the
sum payable shall be adjusted to such sum as will ensure that after payment of
any Taxation charged on such sum in the hands of the recipient (not taking
into account any Reliefs available to the recipient), the recipient shall be
left with a sum equal to the sum that it would have received in the absence of
such a charge to Taxation. 

| 
---|--- 

26.4

|

Clause 26.3 shall not apply: 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

the Relevant Consideration paid by the Purchaser for the Relevant Sale Shares
under the terms of this Agreement; or 

|

(b)

|

if and to the extent that the amount of the payment or refund has already been
adjusted to take account of the Tax that will or would be charged on receipt.

Clause 26.3 shall apply (for the avoidance of doubt, subject to the exclusions
in Clause 26.4) to any amount deducted, withheld, set off or counterclaimed as

person entitled.

Subject to paragraph 1.6 below, to the extent that the tax residency
certificate has not been provided in accordance with Paragraph 1.3 above or

Transaction Tax 

The Sellers, jointly and severally, covenant to pay the Purchaser an amount
equal to, and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser from and against
any Tax Losses suffered or incurred by the Purchaser, any Group Company or any
member of the Purchaser's Group which has any nexus with India (including
holding any assets or having any operations in India), as a result of any
Transaction Tax Proceeding or any Transaction Tax Claim arising pursuant
thereto. The covenant shall not apply if and to the extent that a withholding
in respect of the Transaction Tax has been made by the Purchaser under
paragraph 1.2 above and not subsequently paid to a Seller under paragraph
1.3(d) above.

Conduct of Transaction Tax Claims 

| 
---|--- 

3.1.

|

If any Tax Authority issues a notice (hereinafter, referred to as the "Tax
Notice") to the Purchaser, its directors, its employees or any Group Company
or any member of the Purchaser's Group (hereinafter individually referred to
as "Indemnified Party" and collectively as "Indemnified Parties") in
connection with any Transaction Tax Proceedings and/or Transaction Tax Claim,
then the Purchaser shall give notice of the same to the Relevant Seller in
writing as soon as reasonably practicable and in any case involving an
assessment with a time limit for appeal at least ten Business Days before the
expiry of that time limit. Such notice shall include copies of, or the
relevant extract of, any Tax Notice or other document received from the Tax
Authority or any other Person in respect of any such Transaction Tax
Proceeding and/or the Transaction Tax Claim. 

| 
---|--- 

3.2.

|

A failure to provide such notice in accordance with paragraph 3.1 above shall
not be a condition precedent to the Relevant Seller's liability under
paragraph 2.1, except to the extent that the Relevant Seller is actually
prejudiced thereby. For the avoidance of doubt, (a) any increase in Tax Losses
and/or Transaction Tax Claim which is attributable to such failure; or (b)
loss of any defence which would have been otherwise available to the Relevant
Seller had the failure not occurred, is actual prejudice to the Relevant
Seller. 

| 
---|--- 

3.3.

|

The Relevant Seller(s) shall on giving notice to the Indemnified Party(ies) at
any time after receiving the notice referred to in paragraph 3.1, be entitled
at their own expense to have conduct of all matters relating to the
Transaction Tax Claim, including having the conduct of any appeal, dispute,
compromise or defence of the Transaction Tax Claim and of any incidental
negotiations relating thereto provided that the Relevant Seller does not take
any step which reasonably may be considered to require it (or any Group
Company or member of the Purchaser's Group) to engage in fraudulent conduct,
conduct involving dishonesty or the commission of, of participation in, any
criminal offence.

Proceeding and/or Transaction Tax Claim. 

|

3.5.

|

The Indemnified Party(ies) shall give any information and assistance to the
Relevant Seller(s) which they may reasonably require to avoid, dispute,
resist, appeal, compromise, defend, remedy, mitigate, or otherwise in
connection with, a Transaction Tax Proceeding or a Transaction Tax Claim, as
soon as reasonably practicable upon the request and at the expense of the
Relevant Seller(s). 

| 
---|--- 

3.6.

|

The Relevant Seller(s) shall have the sole right to settle or otherwise
compromise a Transaction Tax Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party, provided the terms of the judgment or proposed settlement
has the effect of giving to Indemnified Party(ies) a full and unconditional
release from its liability in respect of such Transaction Tax Claim under the
relevant proceedings and provided that the terms of the judgement or proposed
settlement would not materially prejudice the commercial position of the
Purchaser or any Group Company. 

| 
---|--- 

3.7.

|

If the Relevant Seller(s) have not yet exercised their rights under paragraph
3.3 to have conduct of any Transaction Tax Proceeding or defend any
Transaction Tax Claim, then the Indemnified Party(ies) shall have the right
but not the obligation to assume control over any such Transaction Tax
Proceeding and/or to defend such Transaction Tax Claim, provided that: 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

the Indemnified Party(ies) shall give the Relevant Seller(s) drafts of all
communications it intends to make to the relevant Tax Authority in relation to
the Transaction Tax Claim as soon as reasonably practicable before the
communication is made, and shall reflect all reasonable comments that the
Relevant Seller(s) shall make before making the communication, and shall as
soon as reasonably practicable produce and provide the Relevant Seller(s) with
copies of all communications with the relevant Tax Authority, including notes
of telephone attendance and meetings with the relevant Tax Authority (which it
shall take), where the communications and notes relate to the Transaction Tax
Claim; and 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

the Indemnified Party(ies) shall not settle or otherwise compromise any
Transaction Tax Claim without the prior written consent of the Relevant
Seller(s) (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), provided
that if the Relevant Seller does not request the Purchaser to take any further
or alternative action within 15 days of the date of the Purchaser having given
notice to the Seller of its intention to settle or compromise such Tax Claim,
the Purchaser shall be free to satisfy or settle the relevant Tax Claim on
such terms as it may reasonably think fit. 

|

|

Payment of Transaction Tax Claim 

| 
---|--- 

4.1.

|

The Relevant Seller(s) shall, in conjunction with its rights under Paragraph
3.3 above, be entitled to request the Indemnified Parties to seek a stay,
injunction or deferral of the payment of any amounts that are required to be
paid by the Indemnified Party(ies) in relation to the Transaction Tax Claim. 

| 
---|--- 

4.2.

|

In the event that the Indemnified Party(ies)do not seek or are unable to
obtain an order from the Tax Authority or Governmental Authority staying the

to the due date of payment thereunder, the Relevant Seller(s)

shall ensure that it makes all payments for which the Indemnified Party(ies)
is liable to pay in connection with the Transaction Tax Claim to the
Indemnified Party(ies) at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the relevant
due date in order to enable the Indemnified Party(ies) to make such payment by
the relevant due date. Following receipt of the funds from the Relevant
Seller(s), the Indemnified Party shall account to the relevant Tax Authority
or Governmental Authority for the full amount of the funds received from the
Relevant Seller(s) as soon as reasonably practicable and in any event no later
than the due date to the relevant Tax Authority. The Indemnified Party(ies)
shall notify the Relevant Seller(s) in writing and provide evidence of such
payment within five (5) Business Days of such payment.

| 
---|--- 

4.3.

|

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Relevant Seller(s) may, at its sole discretion, directly pay the full amount
due under a Transaction Tax Claim to the relevant Tax Authority on its own
account, provided (i) it gives a written notice to the Indemnified Party of
its intention to do so at least twelve (12) Business Days prior to the
relevant due date for such amount; and (ii) it provides the Indemnified
Party(ies) with evidence of such payment within three (3) Business Days of
such payment being made. 

| 
---|--- 

4.4.

|

If the Relevant Seller(s) fails to make a payment in respect of a Transaction
Tax Claim in accordance with paragraphs 4.2 or 4.3 above, then the Indemnified
Party(ies) shall be entitled to pay the amount due under a Transaction Tax
Claim to the relevant Tax Authority and shall notify the Relevant Seller(s) of
the same in writing and provide evidence of such payment within three (3)
Business Days of such payment being made. The Relevant Seller(s) shall as soon
as reasonably practicable reimburse the Indemnified Party(ies), and in any
event no later than seven (7) Business Days from the receipt of evidence of

|

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if,
prior to the relevant due date, the Relevant Seller(s) obtains an interim
relief from a Tax Authority or Governmental Authority to stay or extend the
recovery of the Transaction Tax Claim (an "Injunctive Order"), then for such
time as the Injunctive Order is in force, the Relevant Seller(s) shall not be
obligated to pay to the Indemnified Party(ies) any amount in respect of such
Transaction Tax Claim. 

| 
---|--- 

4.6.

|

The Relevant Seller agrees to pay to the Indemnified Party(ies) in cleared
funds an amount equal to any costs and expenses which are reasonably and
properly incurred by the Indemnified Party(ies) in taking such action and the
Indemnified Party(ies) may send a written demand for payment of such costs and
expenses once they have been incurred. For the purpose of this paragraph 4.6,
"incurred" means the earlier of the date on which payment has been made in
respect of those costs and expenses or the date on which an invoice has been
received in respect of those costs or expenses by the Indemnified Party(ies).

|

For the period 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2020, so far as a Seller is required
to file any tax returns required by and in accordance with applicable law in
India with respect to the sale by it of the Relevant Sale Shares, such tax
return shall not take a position that is inconsistent with any Tax Computation
(with respect to the Sale Shares 1B and Sale Shares 3) and/or opinion (with
respect to the Sale Shares 1A and Sale Shares 2), in each case provided by the
Sellers pursuant to paragraph 1.3 above, if and to the extent that the
