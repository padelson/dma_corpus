that becomes final and binding on the Parties in accordance with this Section
1.4(b) is referred to herein as the "Final Purchase Price".

  

  

(c) From the Closing until such time as all matters set forth in the Objection
Notice have been fully and finally resolved in accordance herewith, Nexstar
shall (i) maintain and provide to Sellers' Representative and its advisors and
representatives reasonable access to all documents and other information
utilized by Nexstar and its representatives and advisors in connection with

and Nexstar shall, within twenty (20) calendar days following Sellers'
Representative's delivery of such Objection Notice (such 20-day period, the
"Dispute Resolution Period"), in good faith seek to resolve the items disputed
in the Objection Notice.

  

  

(e) If, during the Dispute Resolution Period, Sellers' Representative and
Nexstar resolve their differences in writing as to any disputed amount, such
resolution shall be deemed final and binding with respect to such amount for
the purpose of determining that component of the Final Purchase Price. In the
event that Sellers' Representative and Nexstar do not resolve all of the items
disputed in the Objection Notice prior to the end of the Dispute Resolution
Period, all such unresolved disputes shall be submitted by Nexstar or the
Sellers' Representative to the Accounting Firm for resolution, and each of

and the Objection Notice, respectively. The Accounting Firm shall deliver to
Nexstar and the Sellers' Representative a written determination (such
determination to include a work sheet setting forth all material calculations
used in arriving at such determination and to be based solely on information
provided to the Accounting Firm by Nexstar and the Sellers' Representative) of
the disputed amounts within thirty (30) calendar days of submission to the
Accounting Firm of such disputed amounts (such 30-day period, the
"Adjudication Period"), which determination shall be final and binding. In the
event that either Nexstar or the Sellers' Representative fails to submit its
statement regarding any items remaining in dispute within the time determined
by the Accounting Firm, then the Accounting Firm shall render a decision based
solely on the information timely submitted to the Accounting Firm by Nexstar
and the Sellers' Representative. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if either
Party prevents the other Party from obtaining access to any information that
such Party has reasonably requested pursuant to this Section 1.4, or if a
Party otherwise fails to provide such information on a timely basis after
receiving a reasonably specific request for access from the other Party, the
Accounting Firm shall have the authority, in its sole discretion to (i) extend
the Adjudication Period for such amount of time as the Accounting Firm deems
equitable; (ii) direct that the withholding Party promptly provide the other
Party with such access as the Accounting Firm deems equitable; and/or (iii)
render a decision adverse to the withholding Party in respect of any issue or
amount that the Accounting Firm deems equitable given the information that has
been withheld.

  

  

(f) In the event that the Final Purchase Price is less than the Initial
Purchase Price, the CCA Stockholders shall pay to Nexstar an amount equal to
such difference in the manner provided in Section 1.4(g). In the event that
the Final Purchase Price is greater than the Initial Purchase Price, Nexstar
shall pay to the Sellers' Representative, for the benefit of CCA Stockholders,
an amount equal to such difference in the manner provided in Section 1.4(g).

Representative shall jointly instruct the Indemnity Escrow Agent to such
effect. The Sellers' Representative shall pay to each CCA Stockholder such CCA
Stockholder's Pro Rata Portion of any amounts paid to it on behalf of the CCA
Stockholders pursuant to Section 1.4(f), less any deductions permitted in
accordance with Article 12, without interest, within three (3) Business Days
of receipt thereof by the Sellers' Representative. All payments made pursuant
to this Section 1.4(g) shall be made via wire transfer of immediately
available funds to such account or accounts as shall be designated in writing
by the recipient, without interest.

  

  

(h) All fees and expenses relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the
Accounting Firm shall be allocated between Nexstar, on the one hand, and the
CCA Stockholders, on the other hand, in the same proportion that the aggregate
amount of the disputed items so submitted to the Accounting Firm that is
unsuccessfully disputed by such Party (as finally determined by the Accounting
Firm) bears to the total amount of the disputed items so submitted. Nexstar,
on the one hand, and the CCA Stockholders, on the other hand, shall each pay
one-half of any indemnification payments due to the Accounting Firm pursuant
to the terms of the Accounting Firm's engagement hereunder.

  

  

(i) The Estimated Closing Statement and the Closing Statement and the
determinations and calculations contained therein (including the calculation
of Net Working Capital) will be prepared and calculated on a consolidated
basis for the Companies in accordance with GAAP and, to the extent consistent
with GAAP, using the same accounting principles, practices, procedures,
policies and methods used and applied by the Companies in the preparation of
its audited Financial Statements, except that such statements, calculations
and determinations: (i) will not include any purchase accounting or other
adjustment arising out of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (ii) will be based on facts and circumstances as they exist
prior to the Closing and will exclude the effect of any act, decision or event
occurring on or after the Closing, and (iii) will follow the defined terms
contained in this Agreement whether or not such terms are consistent with
GAAP.

  

  

(j) For Tax purposes, the Final Purchase Price shall reflect all adjustments
to the Initial Purchase Price resulting from the Closing Statement, any
agreement of the parties as to Final Purchase Price or the Accounting Firm's
written determination, as applicable.

half the Indemnification Escrow Amount on the six (6) month anniversary of the

The remaining Unclaimed Escrow Amount shall be released in full on the one (1)
year anniversary of the Closing Date. Any amount remaining as Indemnity Escrow

instructions delivered by such CCA Stockholder, at Closing. If a former
employee listed on Schedule 1.5, or his or her spouse or dependent (such
employees, spouses and beneficiaries hereinafter the "COBRA Beneficiaries"),
continues to receive continuous COBRA coverage from the Companies as of the
first (1st) anniversary of the Closing Date, then as of such date, Nexstar
shall be deemed to have an automatic claim against the Unclaimed Escrow Amount
for an amount in cash equal to the product of the number of COBRA
Beneficiaries on such date, multiplied by $75,000 (such product, the "COBRA
Fund") (and to the extent the amount of any such product exceeds the Unclaimed
Escrow Amount, the Sellers' Representative shall promptly pay to Nexstar an
amount in cash equal to the amount of such excess by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account of Nexstar notified to the Sellers'

first (1st) anniversary). The COBRA Fund shall be used by Nexstar as a source

indirectly from such COBRA Claims, reduced by any stop-loss insurance coverage
payments and employee insurance premiums actually received or receivable by
Nexstar with respect to such claims. Any amounts paid to the Sellers'

as set forth in Schedule 3.4(a). If, at any point prior to Closing, an
application for the renewal of any Primary FCC License (a "Renewal
Application") must be filed pursuant to the Communications Laws, CCA shall
timely execute, file and prosecute (to the extent such Renewal Application
relates to a CCA Station) and shall cause White Knight to timely execute, file
and prosecute (to the extent such Renewal Application relates to a WK Station)
with the FCC such Renewal Application in accordance with Section 5.1(b)
hereof. If an FCC Application is granted by the FCC subject to a renewal
condition, then, without limitation of Section 1.7(a), the term "FCC Consent"
shall be deemed to also include CCA's or White Knight's, as the case may be,
satisfaction of such renewal condition. To avoid disruption or delay in the
processing of the FCC Applications, Buyers agree, as a part of the FCC
Applications, to request, that the FCC apply its policy permitting the
transfer of control of FCC Licenses in transactions involving multiple
stations to proceed, notwithstanding the pendency of one or more Renewal
Applications. Buyers agree to make such representations and undertakings as
are necessary or appropriate to invoke such policy, including undertakings to
assume, as between the Parties and the FCC, the position of the applicant
before the FCC with respect to any pending Renewal Application and to assume
the corresponding regulatory risks relating to any such Renewal Application.
In addition, to the extent such agreements are available from the FCC to
facilitate grant of the FCC Applications or any other approval of the FCC
required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and exclusive of any agreements that CCA enters into pursuant to
Section 5.1, CCA shall cause the appropriate CCA Entity promptly to enter into
tolling agreements with the FCC to facilitate grant of the FCC Applications or
any Renewal Application, to extend the statute of limitations for the FCC to
determine or impose a Fine against a Station in connection with (i) any
pending complaints that such Station aired programming that contained obscene,
indecent or profane material, or (ii) any other enforcement matters against a
Station with respect to which the FCC may permit CCA to enter into a tolling
agreement, and CCA shall comply with such agreements. In addition, to the
extent such agreements are available from the FCC to facilitate grant of the
FCC Applications or any other approval of the FCC required for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and exclusive
of any agreements that CCA or White Knight enters into pursuant to Section
5.1, CCA shall promptly cause WK Seller to cause the appropriate WK Entity to
enter into tolling agreements with the FCC to facilitate grant of the FCC
Applications or any Renewal Application, to extend the statute of limitations
for the FCC to determine or impose a fine against a Station in connection with
(i) any pending complaints that such Station aired programming that contained
obscene, indecent or profane material, or (ii) any other enforcement matters
against a Station with respect to which the FCC may permit a WK Entity to
enter into a tolling agreement, and CCA shall cause WK Seller to cause any
such WK Entity to comply with such agreements. Buyers and CCA shall consult in
good faith with each other prior to entry into any such tolling agreement by a
CCA Entity or a WK Entity under this Section 1.7(d). All obligations and
liabilities of CCA and WK Seller pursuant to any such tolling agreements shall
be subject to the indemnification obligations of the CCA Stockholders pursuant
to Section 10.2(b)(ii)(B). For the purposes hereof, "Communications Laws"
shall mean the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules,
regulations and written policies of the FCC promulgated pursuant thereto).

  

  

(e) Within ten (10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement, Buyers and
CCA and, to the extent so required, White Knight shall make any required
filings with the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the United States
Department of Justice (the "DOJ") pursuant to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"), with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby (including a request for early termination of
the waiting period thereunder), and shall thereafter promptly respond to all
requests received from such agencies for additional information or
documentation. Expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period
under the HSR Act is referred to herein as the "HSR Clearance." Any filing
fees payable under the HSR Act relating to the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be borne one-half by Buyers, on the one hand, and one-half by
CCA, on the other hand.

  

  

(f) In connection with their obligations pursuant to this Section 1.7 with
respect to pursuing the FCC Consent (until such time as such FCC Consent shall
have become a Final Order), and the HSR Clearance, Buyers, on the one hand,
and CCA, on the other hand, shall, and CCA shall cause White Knight to, (i)
keep each other informed in all material respects and on a reasonably timely
basis of any material communication received by such Party (or in the case of
CCA, by White Knight) from, or given by such Party to, any governmental agency
and of any material communication received or given in connection with any
Action by a private party, in each case with respect to this Agreement, the
Business or the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) notify each other of
all documents filed with or received from any governmental agency with respect
to this Agreement, the Business or the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii)
furnish each other with such information and assistance as the other may
reasonably request in connection with their preparation of any governmental
filing hereunder and (iv) cooperate in all respects with each other in
connection with any filing or submission with a governmental agency in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and in
connection with any investigation or other inquiry by or before any
governmental agency relating to this Agreement, the Business or the
transactions contemplated hereby, including any Action initiated by a private
party. Subject to Applicable Law relating to the exchange of information, each
of Buyers, on the one hand, and CCA, on the other hand, shall have the right
to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult with the
other on, all information relating to the other Party or Parties, as the case
may be, and their respective Affiliates, that appears in any filing made with,
or written materials submitted to, any third party and/or any governmental
agency with respect to this Agreement, the Business or the transactions
contemplated hereby. The FCC Consent and HSR Clearance are referred to herein
collectively as the "Governmental Consents."

  

  

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein (other than the
first sentence of Section 1.7(b) or as expressly provided in this Section
1.7(g) or in Section 1.7(h) and Section 1.7(i)): (i) neither Buyers nor any
Affiliate of Buyers shall have any obligation to defend against, contest or
resist any Action by a Governmental Entity or other Person which questions the
validity or legality of the transactions contemplated hereby or seeks damages
in connection therewith, or if an injunction or other order is issued in any
such Action to seek to have lifted or otherwise challenge such injunction or
other order; and (ii) neither Buyers nor any of their Affiliates shall be
required under this Section 1.7 (and CCA shall not, and shall not permit White
Knight to, agree to any of the following (without the prior written consent of
Nexstar)): (A) to proffer to, or agree to, sell, divest, lease, license,
transfer, dispose of, hold separate or encumber before or after the Closing
any assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines, businesses or
interest therein of Buyers, any of their Affiliates (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the CCA Shares or the WK Shares); (B) to consent to any
sale, divestiture, lease, license, transfer, disposition or other encumbrance
by Buyers or any of their Affiliates of any of their respective assets,
licenses, operations, rights, product lines, businesses or interest therein
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the CCA Shares or the WK Shares); (C)
to consent to any agreement to take any of the foregoing actions; or (D) to
agree to any changes to or restriction on, or other impairment of Buyers'
ability to own or operate, any such assets, licenses, product lines,
businesses or interests therein or Buyers' ability to transfer or otherwise
exercise full ownership rights with respect to the CCA Shares or the WK
Shares; provided, however, and for the avoidance of doubt, that Buyers and CCA
shall cooperate in good faith to respond promptly to any request by the FTC or
the DOJ, as the case may be. As used herein, "Governmental Entity" means any
(i) federal, state, municipal or other government, (ii) governmental or quasi-
governmental entity of any nature (including any governmental agency, branch,
department, official, or entity and any court or other tribunal) or (iii) body
exercising or entitled to exercise any administrative, executive, judicial,
legislative, police, regulatory, or taxing authority or power of any nature,
including any arbitral tribunal.

  

  

(h) In addition to, and not in limitation of, any other provision of this
Agreement, since Nexstar and/or WK Buyer are not qualified under Applicable
Law to acquire attributable interests in the CCA Station or WK Station serving
the Evansville and Shreveport markets (the "Overlap Markets"), then (i) not
later than the seventh (7th) Business Day following execution of this
Agreement (x) Nexstar shall enter into an agreement with a third party that is
qualified under Applicable Law to acquire an attributable interest in WEVV-TV
to cause the applicable CCA Entity(ies) to transfer the FCC Licenses for WEVV-
TV and all related license assets used or useful in the operation of WEVV-TV
to such third party contemporaneously with the Closing and (y) WK Buyer shall
enter into an agreement with a third party that is qualified under Applicable
Law to acquire an attributable interest in KSHV-TV to cause the applicable WK
Entity(ies) to transfer the FCC Licenses for KSHV-TV and all related license
assets used or useful in the operation of KSHV-TV from the applicable WK
Entity to such third party contemporaneously with the Closing (the assets
described in this clause (i) being the "Overlap Station Assets;" each third
party described in this clause (i) being a "Third Party Buyer;" and each
transfer described in this clause (i) being a "Third Party Transaction") and
(ii) Nexstar or WK Buyer, as applicable, shall cause such Third Party Buyer to
consummate each Third Party Transaction concurrently with the Closing;
provided that, if the applicable Buyer and a Third Party Buyer are unable to
consummate a Third Party Transaction concurrently with the Closing, then such
Buyer will agree to, and at the Closing will, cause the Overlap Stations
Assets to be placed in a divestiture trust contemporaneously with the Closing
in order to facilitate the grant of the FCC Consent. Nexstar and WK Buyer will
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the actions described in this
Section 1.7(h) to not unnecessarily delay or otherwise impair the receipt of
the FCC Consent or the consummation of the transactions hereunder.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, neither
the failure to enter into or consummate a Third Party Transaction contemplated
by this Section 1.7 nor the terms of any such Third Party Transaction shall
relieve Buyer of its obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or pay the entire Purchase Price at the Closing.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, until
such time as the FCC Consent shall have become a Final Order and the HSR
Clearance shall have been obtained, Nexstar and WK Buyer shall take all
actions required, and comply with all conditions imposed on them, in order to
obtain the FCC Consent and HSR Clearance with respect to the Overlap Markets
and the Overlap Station Assets (including, but not limited to, any requirement
that Nexstar consummate, and cause any Third Party Buyer to consummate, one or
more Third Party Transactions at the Closing, or utilize an FCC divestiture
trust or trusts or other similar structures or transactions in connection with
the consummation of the Transactions at the Closing to the extent related to
such Overlap Station Assets or the Overlap Markets). Nexstar shall be
responsible for the payment of all Taxes and other costs and expenses,
including filing fees for any applicable application with the FCC (the
"Divestiture Application") and under the HSR Act, incurred in connection with
or as a result of the asset purchase agreement and any divestiture trust or
other similar structure or transaction or Third Party Transaction. If the
Closing occurs when the FCC Consent is not a Final Order, Nexstar shall cause
any Third Party Buyer(s) of the Overlap Station Assets to enter into an unwind
agreement relating to the transactions contemplated by this Section 1.7(h) in
a form that is reasonably acceptable to the Sellers' Representative.

  

  

(i) In addition to, and not in limitation of, any other provision of this
Agreement, Nexstar shall promptly enter into a purchase agreement with WK
Buyer pursuant to which WK Buyer shall have the right to acquire the FCC
Licenses for KMSS-TV and KPEJ-TV and all related license assets used or useful
in the operation of KMSS-TV and KPEJ-TV (the "Nexstar/Mission APA"), and
Buyers shall cause the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Nexstar/Mission APA to occur simultaneously with the Closing. Until such time
as the FCC Consent shall have become a Final Order, Nexstar and WK Buyer will
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the actions described in this
Section 1.7(i) to not unnecessarily delay or otherwise impair the receipt of
the FCC Consent, or the consummation of the transactions hereunder.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no transaction
contemplated by this Section 1.7(i) shall relieve Buyer of its obligation to
pay the entire Purchase Price at the Closing. Nexstar shall be responsible for
the payment of all Taxes and other costs and expenses, including filing fees
for any applicable application with the FCC (the "Nexstar/Mission
Application") and under the HSR Act, incurred in connection with or as a
result of the Nexstar/Mission APA or any other related asset purchase
agreement and the consummation of the transactions related to KMSS-TV and
KPEJ-TV. If the Closing occurs when the FCC Consent is not a Final Order, WK
Buyer shall enter into an unwind agreement relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Section 1.7(i) in a form that is reasonably acceptable to
the Sellers' Representative.

relief from carriage of a Station from the FCC and (y) neither any CCA Entity
nor any White Knight Entity has received any written notice from any MVPD with
more than 5,000 subscribers in any of the Station's DMAs of such MVPD's

provisions of any of the Real Property Leases. Schedule 3.7(b) includes a list

and otherwise qualified to be the licensee of, acquire, own and operate the WK
Stations under the Communications Laws. Each Buyer is in compliance with
Section 310(b) of the Communications Laws and the FCC's rules governing alien
ownership. Except for the Conflicting Interests, there are no facts or
circumstances that would, under the Communications Laws and the existing
procedures of the FCC, disqualify Nexstar as a holder of the FCC Licenses held
by the CCA Entities or as the owner and operator of the CCA Stations. Except
for the Conflicting Interests, there are no facts or circumstances that would,
under the Communications Laws and the existing procedures of the FCC,
disqualify WK Buyer as a holder of the FCC Licenses held by the WK Entities or
as the owner and operator of the WK Stations. Except for the continuation of
FCC authority for Station KYLE-TV to operate as a "satellite" of Station KWKT-
TV (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not be a condition to Closing),
no waiver of or exemption from any provision of the Communications Laws and
policies of the FCC is necessary for the FCC Consent to be obtained. To
Buyers' Knowledge, subject to divestiture of the Conflicting Interests
pursuant to Buyers' covenants in this Agreement, there are no facts or
circumstances that might reasonably be expected to (a) result in the FCC's
refusal to grant the FCC Consent or otherwise disqualify Buyers, (b)
materially delay obtaining the FCC Consent or (c) cause the FCC to impose a
material condition or conditions on its granting of the FCC Consent.

other sources of immediately available funds to enable it to make payment of
the Purchase Price, all related fees and expenses in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any other amounts to be paid
by it in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Buyers acknowledge and
agree that the obligation of Buyers to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement is not conditioned upon Buyers' ability to
finance or pay the Purchase Price and that any failure of Buyers to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall constitute a material
breach by Buyers of this Agreement giving rise to Sellers' Representative's
right (a) to terminate this Agreement under Section 11.1(c) hereof, subject to
the terms and conditions of Section 11.1(c), or alternatively, (b) to seek
specific performance under Section 11.4.

expenses, each Buyer shall be Solvent. For purposes of this Agreement: (i)

determination, (A) the Present Fair Salable Value of its assets will, as of
such date, exceed all of its liabilities, contingent or otherwise, as of such
date, (B) such Person will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small
amount of capital for the business in which it is engaged or will be engaged
and (C) such Person will be able to pay its debts as they become absolute and

and amounts of cash to be received by it and the timing of and amounts of cash
to be payable on or in respect of its indebtedness, in each case after giving
effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the term
"Solvency" shall have a correlative meaning; (ii) "debt" means liability on a
"Claim"; (iii) "Claim" means (A) any right to payment, whether or not such a
right is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent,
matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, secured or unsecured or (B) the
right to an equitable remedy for a breach in performance if such breach gives
rise to a right to payment, whether or not such equitable remedy is reduced to
judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured,
disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured or unsecured; and (iv)
"Present Fair Salable Value" means the amount that may be realized if the
aggregate assets of a Person (including goodwill) are sold as an entirety with

for the sale of comparable business enterprises.

of any Company (the "Company Indemnified Parties"). The provisions of the
Organizational Documents of the Companies with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of liability shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from the Closing
Date in any manner that would adversely affect the rights of the Company

any Company or any successor or assign (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving Person in such
consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets any other Person, then, in each such case, provisions

forth with respect to Buyers and the Companies in this Section 5.3.

  

  


 

  

ARTICLE 6

  

  

JOINT COVENANTS

  

  

Buyers, on one hand, and CCA and the CCA Stockholders, on the other hand,
hereby covenant and agree as follows:

  

  

6.1 Confidentiality

  

  

.

  

  

(a) CCA and Nexstar (or an Affiliate of Nexstar) are parties to a
nondisclosure agreement (the "NDA") with respect to the CCA Entities, the
White Knight Entities and their stations. To the extent not already a direct
party thereto, each Buyer hereby assumes the NDA and agrees to be bound by the
provisions thereof applicable to Nexstar's Affiliate which is a party thereto,
and such NDA shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the NDA, Buyers'
obligations under the NDA shall terminate upon the Closing.

  

  

(b) From and after the Closing for a period of one (1) year, each CCA
Stockholder and the WK Seller shall treat and hold as confidential and refrain
from disclosing to any third party all Confidential Information, other than,
(i) in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
Claim hereunder or to comply with Applicable Law and (ii) in the case of any
CCA Stockholder that is an employee or director of CCA or any Company, as
necessary in the good faith performance of his or her duties in such capacity.
Notwithstanding the foregoing restrictions, in the event that a CCA
Stockholder or the WK Seller is requested or required by Applicable Law or
legal process (including pursuant to written or oral question or request for
information or documents in any legal proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena or
civil investigative demand) to disclose any Confidential Information, such
Person will, to the extent practicable, notify Nexstar promptly of the request
or requirement so that Nexstar may seek (at its sole cost) an appropriate
protective order or waive compliance with the provisions of this Section
6.1(b). If, in the absence of a protective order or the receipt of a waiver
hereunder, any such Person is, based on the advice of legal counsel, required
to disclose any Confidential Information, such Person may disclose the
Confidential Information solely to the extent so required; provided, however,
that such Person shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain (at
the Buyer's cost) an order or other assurance that confidential treatment will
be accorded to such portion of the Confidential Information required to be
disclosed as the Buyer shall designate. For purposes of this Agreement, the
term "Confidential Information" means proprietary information concerning the
Companies' or the Business' respective operations, assets, liabilities,
financial condition and affairs, and Confidential Information may include
trade secrets, customer lists, supplier lists, details of consultant and
employment Contracts, pricing policies, operational methods, marketing plans
or strategies, product development techniques or plans, business acquisition
plans and acquisition candidates, technical processes, designs and design
projects, processes, inventions, software, source codes, object codes, systems
documentation and research projects and other business affairs, but
Confidential Information shall not include any such information which is or
becomes generally available to the public or to participants in the industry
in which CCA and the Companies operate other than as a result of disclosure in
violation of this Section 6.1(b). In addition, the Parties acknowledge that
Affiliates of certain CCA Stockholders hold equity and voting interests in
entities that own other broadcast television stations. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, Confidential Information hereunder
shall not include information that has applicability to the broadcast
television industry generally.

  

  

6.2 Announcements

  

  

. Prior to Closing, no Party shall, without the prior written consent of the
other, issue any press release or make any other public announcement
concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except to the
extent that such Party is so obligated by Applicable Law or any rule or
regulation of any securities exchange upon which the securities of such Party
are listed or traded, in which case such Party shall give advance notice and
an opportunity to comment to the other, and except that the Parties shall
cooperate to make a mutually agreeable announcement.

  

  

6.3 Control

  

  

. Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this Agreement, this
Agreement is not intended to and shall not be interpreted to transfer control
of any Station or to give Buyers the right to, directly or indirectly,
control, supervise or direct the business or operations of the Business prior
to Closing. Consistent with the Communications Laws, control, supervision and
direction of the operation of the Business prior to Closing shall remain the
responsibility of the respective FCC Licensees as the holders of the FCC
Licenses.

  

  

6.4 Acknowledgement; Termination of Certain Agreements

  

  

. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, CCA is a party
to certain agreements with Duane Lammers as of the date hereof, copies of
which have not been made available to the Buyers and which the Parties agree,
for purposes of this Agreement, such agreements are not Material Contracts.
Effective immediately prior to the Closing, the Companies shall terminate (a)
the Stockholders' Agreement, the CCA Management Services Agreement, the WK
Management Services Agreements and (b) any other Contract between any of the
Companies, on the one hand, and any of Duane Lammers, any CCA Stockholder, the
WK Seller or any of their respective Affiliates, on the other hand (other than
this Agreement, any of the other Transaction Documents or any of the
agreements identified on Schedule 6.4, each of which shall continue in full
force and effect after the Closing), in each case without any Liability to the
Buyers or, after the Closing, any of the Companies. Effective as of the
Closing, each CCA Stockholder and the WK Seller hereby absolutely and
unconditionally releases each of the Companies from any and all Claims, rights
and causes of action any such Person has or may have against any of the
Companies with respect to any of such terminated agreements, other than any
item reflected as a liability in the Sellers' Representative's estimate of
Closing Indebtedness or its estimate of current liabilities for the purposes
of computing its estimate of Net Working Capital, as applicable, described in
Section 1.4(a)(i), which, in either case, the Companies shall be required to
pay after Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Section 6.4, none of the provisions of this Section 6.4 shall apply to the
termination and repayment of, or release of any rights or causes of action
under, CCA's senior and subordinated indebtedness for borrowed money, which
shall in all cases be governed by the terms thereof and the CCA Payoff
Letters.

  

  

6.5 Consents

  

  

. Each of the Buyers, CCA and the Sellers' Representative shall, and CCA shall
cause each of the CCA Entities and the White Knight Entities to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain (i) any third party consents
necessary for the consummation of the transaction contemplated hereby (which
may take the form of a new agreement on the existing terms in all material
respects or, if not on such terms, as reasonably acceptable to Buyer if
required by the applicable third party), and (ii) estoppel certificates
reasonably acceptable to Buyers from lessors under any Real Property Leases
requiring consent to assignment (if any), but no such third party consents or
estoppel certificates are conditions to Closing except for the consents with
respect to the Material Contracts identified on Schedule 6.5 (the "Required
Consents"), and no Party shall be obligated to make any payment to any third
party to obtain any consent under this Section 6.5 other than ministerial
processing fees.

  

  

6.6 Employee Matters

  

  

.

  

  

(a) For a period of one (1) year following the Closing Date (or, if earlier,
the date of termination of the relevant Employee), Buyers shall: (i) provide
severance benefits to the Employees in accordance with the terms of the
Nexstar severance policy ("Nexstar Severance Policy") as set forth in Schedule
6.6(a) hereto, applied in a manner consistent with the manner in which Nexstar
has applied such policy under similar circumstances, and not amend such
program in any way with respect to the Employees except as required by
Applicable Law or to increase benefits payable to the Employees under the
program; (ii) credit the Employees for their past service with the Company
and/or its Affiliates and, to the extent currently credited by any Company,
any prior owner of any Station, for purposes of benefits under the Nexstar
Severance Policy; and (iii) make or cause to be made available to the
Employees either (A) such additional benefits and compensation plans, programs
and arrangements as are provided to similarly situated employees of Buyers, or
(B) additional benefits and compensation that are substantially similar in the
aggregate to those provided to such individuals as of the date hereof
(excluding any nonqualified retirement or equity-based benefits); provided,
that nothing herein shall limit the Buyers' ability to terminate any Employee
at any time after the Closing.

  

  

(b) Buyers agree that they shall cooperate with the Companies and the Sellers'
Representative and process if necessary (including through the Companies) any
amounts due and payable in connection with the cancellation of the Stock
Options under the 2007 Option Plan listed on Schedule 2.2 (in each case, net
of all applicable withholdings) to the extent that such payments (such
payments, "CCA Option Payments") are (i) payable after the Closing and (ii)
included in the Sellers' Representative's estimate of Closing Indebtedness,
Company Transaction Expenses or current liabilities for the purposes of
computing its estimate of Net Working Capital, as applicable, described in
Section 1.4(a)(i).

  

  

(c) Nothing in this Section 6.6 or any other provision of this Agreement shall

particular term or condition of employment for any Person, (ii) be construed
to establish, amend, or modify any benefit or compensation plan, program,
agreement or arrangement, (iii) prohibit or limit the ability of Buyers or any
of their Affiliates (including, following the Closing, any of the Companies)
to amend, modify or terminate any benefit or compensation plan, program,
agreement or arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored or
maintained by any of them or (iv) confer any rights or benefits including any
third-party beneficiary rights on any Person other than the Parties to this
Agreement.

  

  

6.7 Access to and Retention of Records

  

  

. For a period of six (6) years following the Closing Date, Nexstar shall,
subject to Section 6.1(b) and any other restrictions imposed from time to time
in good faith upon advice of counsel respecting the provision of privileged
communications or competitively sensitive information and any applicable
confidentiality agreement with any Person, provide the Sellers'
Representative, the CCA Stockholders and its and their authorized
representatives with reasonable access (for the purpose of examining and
copying at the Sellers' Representative's sole cost), during normal business
hours and after reasonable advance notice, to books and records and other
information and materials in the possession of Nexstar or any of the Companies
which relates to the Companies or the Business for periods prior to the
Closing Date, as may be reasonably requested for tax, financial reporting and
any other reasonable business purposes; provided that such inspection and
copying shall be conducted in a manner that will not unreasonably disrupt the
normal course of the Buyers or the Companies' respective businesses. Unless
otherwise consented to in writing by the Sellers' Representative and the CCA
Stockholders, Nexstar shall not, and shall cause each Company not to, for a
period of six (6) years following the Closing Date, destroy, alter or
otherwise dispose of any books and records of the Companies, or any portions
thereof, relating to periods prior to the Closing Date without first offering
to surrender to the Sellers' Representative and the CCA Stockholders such
books and records or such portions thereof.

  

  

6.8 Further Action

  

  

. In furtherance (and not in limitation) of the provisions set forth in this
Agreement, at all times prior to the Closing, Buyers, CCA and the CCA
Stockholders shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
take or cause to be taken all action necessary or desirable in order to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as is
practicable.

  

  

6.9 Notice

  

  

. Each Party will give prompt written notice to the other Parties of any fact
or condition that causes or constitutes a breach of any of its
representations, warranties or covenants in this Agreement, or of any Action
that is instituted or threatened against such Party to restrain, prohibit or
otherwise challenge the legality or propriety of any transaction contemplated
by this Agreement; provided, that delivery of any such notice will not be
deemed to cure any misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant
contained herein or affect the rights of any Party hereunder with respect
thereto. Without limiting the foregoing, pending the Closing, CCA shall give
Buyers prompt written notice of the occurrence of any of the following:

  

  

(a) the commencement of any proceeding before the FCC or any other
Governmental Entity involving any of the FCC Licenses or which would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, other than

broadcasting industry that do not have a disproportionate impact on the
Business or the Stations as compared with other broadcast television stations
generally;

  

  

(b) any material labor grievance, material controversy, strike or material
dispute affecting the Business or the Stations and the scheduling of any
bargaining discussions with the certified bargaining unit;

  

  

(c) any violation by any Company or any Station of any Applicable Laws which
would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect;

  

  

(d) any notice received by any Company of any material breach, material
default, claimed material breach or material default or termination of any
Material Contract;

  

  

(e) any material correspondence received by any Company from or sent by any
Company to any MVPD concerning must carry status, retransmission consent or
other matters relating to MVPD carriage of any Station or otherwise arising
under the Communications Laws, including any material correspondence related
to the status of negotiations with any MVPD; and

  

  

(f) the loss of carriage or change in channel position of any Station on any
MVPD or the cessation of broadcasting or failure of a Station to broadcast
with at least 80% of its authorized power for more than twenty-four (24)
consecutive hours or any other development which has, or may reasonably be
expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on the operation of the Business
or the Stations.

  

  

6.10 Title Insurance; Survey

  

  

. Buyers may obtain, at their sole option and expense, and CCA shall and shall
cause each White Knight Entity (as applicable) to grant Buyers access (subject
to the terms of any lease or consent of any landlord for the Leased Real
Property) to obtain (a) commitments for owner's and lender's title insurance
policies on the Owned Real Property and commitments for lessee's and lender's
title insurance policies for all Leased Real Property (collectively the "Title
Commitments"), and (b) an ALTA survey on each parcel of Real Property (the
"Surveys"); provided, however, that CCA and each White Knight Entity (as
applicable) shall provide Buyers with any existing Title Commitments and
Surveys in their possession. CCA shall, and shall cause each White Knight
Entity (as applicable) to, reasonably cooperate with Buyers in obtaining such
Title Commitments and Surveys, provided that neither any CCA Entity nor any
White Knight Entity shall be required to incur any cost, expense or other
liability in connection therewith. CCA shall provide any affidavit, indemnity
or other assurances reasonably requested by the title company to issue the
Title Commitments; provided, that any such documentation shall be deemed
documentation executed by the Companies pursuant to Section 6.12(b).

  

  

6.11 Environmental Assessments; Phase I Investigations

  

  

. Within sixty (60) days from the date of this Agreement, Buyers shall have
the right, at their sole cost and expense, to engage an environmental
consulting firm to conduct Phase I Environmental Site Assessments and
Compliance Reviews, as such terms are commonly understood ("Phase I
Environment Assessments"), with respect to the Real Property, provided such
Phase I Environment Assessments shall be conducted only (i) during regular
business hours, (ii) with no less than two (2) Business Days prior written
notice to CCA, (iii) in a manner which will not unduly interfere with the
operation of the Business or the use of access to or egress from the Real
Property and (iv) without any material damage to any property, real or
personal, of CCA. For avoidance of doubt, the Phase I Environmental
Assessments shall not entail any sampling or testing of soil, ground water,
surface water, air or other media. At or prior to Closing, CCA shall deliver
to Nexstar a certificate of an environmental consulting firm certifying that
the remediation of the Real Property described on Schedule 3.7 and marked with
an "^" has been completed.

  

  

6.12 Cooperation; Financing Assistance

  

  

.

  

  

(a) Buyers shall exercise reasonable efforts to cooperate with CCA to release
any Liens on the CCA Shares and the WK Shares, in each case, other than any
Permitted Liens. Buyers acknowledge that CCA may make use of the proceeds from
the Purchase Price for the repayment of indebtedness associated with any Liens
on the CCA Shares, the WK Shares or the Assets.

  

  

(b) The Companies agree to: (i) use good faith efforts to provide, and to
cause their respective officers, employees, counsel, auditors and
representatives to provide, to Buyers reasonable cooperation (including with
respect to timeliness) in connection with the arrangement of debt or equity
financing of Buyers, the proceeds of which will be used to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby (the "Financing") as may be reasonably
requested by Buyers, subject to confidentiality restrictions reasonably
acceptable to the Companies, including (A) furnishing Buyers and their
financing sources with the financial information of the Companies and any
other pertinent information regarding the Companies as may be reasonably
requested by Buyers to consummate the Financing, (B) assisting Buyers in
facilitating the pledge and perfection of liens effective as of Closing
securing the Financing, (C) assisting Buyers, as it pertains to the Financing,
in Buyers' obtaining any appraisals, surveys, title insurance, engineering
reports, environmental and other inspections or other documents as promptly as
practicable that may be reasonably requested by Buyers to facilitate the
satisfaction on a timely basis of all conditions to obtaining the Financing
solely, in each case, to the extent that such assistance does not involve
making any representations and warranties not contained herein and solely to
the extent providing such assistance does not increase the liability of any
CCA Stockholder, the Companies or WK Seller for a breach thereof in excess of
the liability of such Person has hereunder; and (ii) use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide to Buyers in connection with the Financing (A)
unaudited consolidated monthly financial statements of the Companies on or
prior to the 30th day after the end of each month ending prior to the Closing
Date, (B) unaudited consolidated quarterly financial statements of the
Companies on or prior to the 45th day after the end of each fiscal quarter
ending prior to the Closing Date, and (C) audited consolidated annual
financial statements of the Companies on or prior to the 90th day after the
end of each fiscal year ending prior to the Closing Date. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, the Companies shall not be required
to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other Liability, other
than Reimbursable Costs, in connection with the Financing prior to the
Closing, and the CCA Stockholders and the WK Seller shall not be required to
pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other Liability in
connection with the Financing at any time; and the effectiveness of any
documentation executed by the Companies with respect to the matters set forth
in this Section 6.12(b) shall be subject to the consummation of the Closing.
The CCA Stockholders shall not have any liability under any loan agreement or
other document relating to the Financing. Whether or not the Closing occurs,
neither the CCA Stockholders nor the WK Seller shall be required to bear any
out-of-pocket cost or expense or to pay any commitment or other similar fee or
make any other payment in connection with the Financing or complying with this
Section 6.12(b). Whether or not the Closing occurs, Buyers shall indemnify and
hold harmless the CCA Stockholders, each Company, and each of their respective
officers, directors, members, managers, employees, agents, and subsidiaries,
from and against any and all losses and Damages, suffered or incurred by them
in connection with the arrangement or consummation of the Financing or any
borrowings thereunder (including any action taken in accordance with this
Section 6.12(b) and any information utilized in connection therewith), except
in the case of the applicable indemnitee's gross negligence or willful
misconduct. Whether or not the Closing occurs, Buyers shall promptly (but, in
any event, by the earlier of thirty (30) days after the incurrence thereof or
on the Closing Date) reimburse the Companies for all reasonable and documented
third party costs and expenses incurred by the Companies in connection with
the cooperation or other actions contemplated by this Section 6.12(b)
("Reimbursable Costs"). Buyers hereby (X) acknowledge and agree that the
obtaining of the Financing is not a condition to Closing, and (Y) reaffirm
their obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, subject to the terms of this Agreement, whether or not the
Financing or any alternative financing is available on the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Companies and
the CCA Stockholders shall not have any liability pursuant to this Section
6.12(b) as a result of the failure of a third party to take any action or
refrain from taking any action contemplated hereby, and each such Person
hereby acknowledges that any such third party failure shall not, and shall not
be construed to, serve as a basis for Buyer to not consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement at the Closing, whether arising by breach of
contract, tort or otherwise. Buyers shall provide CCA with written notice of
any breach or default of this Section 6.12(b) by the Companies (an "Assistance
Breach Notice"), and the Companies shall have a until the tenth (10th)
Business Day after receipt of such Assistance Breach Notice to establish to
the reasonable satisfaction of Buyers' the Companies' compliance with the
terms of this Section 6.12(b).

  

  

(c) Available Financing.

  

  

(i) From time to time, at Sellers' Representatives' reasonable request, Buyers
shall inform Sellers' Representative in reasonable detail of the status of
Buyers' efforts to arrange and consummate the available financing, including
but not limited to debt or equity commitments (the "Available Financing");

  

  

(ii) No later than July 24, 2013, Buyers shall provide to Sellers'
Representative reasonable evidence (in Sellers' Representative's reasonable
judgment) of sufficient sources of cash to consummate all transactions
contemplated hereby and pay Buyer\'s expenses in connection therewith, it
being acknowledged that such reasonable evidence need not include binding
equity or debt commitments. Sellers' Representative may give written notice of
breach or default of this Section 6.12(c)(ii) to Buyers (a "Financing Breach
Notice"), and Buyers shall have a until the thirtieth (30th) day after receipt
of such Financing Breach Notice to provide the evidence described in the
preceding sentence. In the event of Buyers' receipt of a Financing Breach
Notice and Buyers' failure to provide such evidence by such thirtieth (30th)
day, Section 5.2(a) hereof shall immediately terminate, which termination
shall be the sole remedy for any breach or default of this Section
6.12(c)(ii);

  

  

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
provisions of this Section 6.12(c) shall not amend or modify Buyers'
obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
pay the Purchase Price at Closing upon satisfaction of the conditions to
Closing set forth in Article 8 hereof, and no failure to obtain Available
Financing shall excuse or otherwise modify Buyers' obligation to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement at Closing, subject to the
satisfaction of the conditions to Closing set forth in Article 8; and

  

  

(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the provisions
of this Section 6.12(c), including but not limited to any termination of
Section 5.2(a) pursuant to this Section 6.12(c), shall not amend or modify
CCA's or the CCA Stockholders' obligation to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement upon satisfaction of the conditions to Closing
set forth in Article 7 hereof.

  

  

6.13 Fulfillment of Conditions

  

  

. CCA will use commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy each of the
conditions for Closing of Buyers set forth in Article 8, and Buyers will use
their commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy each of the conditions for
Closing of CCA Stockholders set forth in Article 7.

  

  

6.14 Tax Matters

  

  

.

  

  

(a) Each CCA Stockholder (severally but not jointly) shall indemnify Buyers
and their Affiliates and hold them harmless up to the Cap, and solely from
amounts in the Indemnity Escrow (and further subject to all the limitations
set forth in ARTICLE 10) from and against: (i) all Taxes imposed on the
Companies for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods, and (ii) with respect to any
Straddle Period, all Taxes imposed on the Companies attributable to the
portion of such Straddle Period that ends on and includes the Closing Date;
provided, however, that the CCA Stockholders shall not be liable for the
foregoing Taxes to the extent such Taxes are taken into account in determining
an adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to Article 1, and, provided,
further, that the CCA Stockholders shall not indemnify or hold harmless Buyers
or any of their Affiliates from and against any Taxes arising from or
attributable to (A) an action or transaction described in or contemplated by
Section 1.7(h) or (i) hereof, or any action or transaction outside the
ordinary course of business taken with respect to the Companies and/or their
assets or business on the Closing Date but after Closing, or (B) any elections
made by Buyers or their Affiliates. Each CCA Stockholder shall be liable only
for its Pro Rata Portion of any Damages under this Section 6.14(a).

  

  

(b) Buyers shall, and shall cause the Companies to, indemnify the CCA
Stockholders and their Affiliates and hold them harmless from and against any
Taxes imposed on or with respect to the Companies for which the CCA
Stockholders are not liable under this Agreement.

  

  

(c) The amount of any Tax that is attributable to the portion of a Straddle
Period that ends on and includes the Closing Date shall: (i) in the case of a
Tax based on or measured by income, receipts or transactions, or other event-
specific Taxes or payments, be determined based on an interim closing of the
books of the Companies as of the close of business on the Closing Date, and
(ii) in the case of other Taxes, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for
the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is
the number of days in the Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing
Date and the denominator of which is the total number of days in the Straddle
Period. All determinations necessary to give effect to the foregoing
allocation shall be made in a manner consistent with the past practice of the
Companies.

  

  

(d) CCA shall be responsible for the preparation and timely filing of all Tax
Returns of the Companies that are filed prior to Closing.

  

  

(e) Buyers shall be responsible for the preparation and timely filing of all
Tax Returns of the Companies that are required to be filed after the Closing
Date that were not previously filed; including, for the avoidance of doubt:
(i) Tax Returns for any short taxable period that ends on the Closing Date,
and (ii) Tax Returns for all Straddle Periods; provided, however, that at
least thirty (30) days prior to filing any such Tax Return(s), Buyers shall
provide the Sellers' Representative with (i) a draft of each such Tax Return
and (ii) a statement of any Taxes owed in connection with the filing of such
Tax Return and the CCA Stockholders' share thereof. All Tax Returns of the
Companies for any taxable period beginning prior to the Closing Date shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with the past practice of the Companies,
except to the extent required by Applicable Law. The Sellers' Representative
shall be entitled to review and comment on any such Tax Return before it is
filed, and Buyers shall make such changes to such Tax Return as the Sellers'
Representative may reasonably request, and neither Buyers nor any Company
shall file such Tax Return without the Sellers' Representative's consent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. In
the event the Sellers' Representative objects to a Tax Return pursuant to its
consent rights, and the Parties cannot resolve the objection, a filing
extension shall be obtained and the matter shall be resolved by an independent
accounting firm agreed upon by the Parties. If there are no unresolved
objections, then, to the extent applicable, at least two (2) days prior to the
due date for filing such a Tax Return, the Parties shall instruct the Escrow
Agent to pay to Nexstar (for the benefit of the CCA Entities) or to WK Buyer
(for the benefit of the White Knight Entities), as applicable, out of the
Indemnity Escrow, the funds required for the payment of those Taxes due with
respect to such Tax Return that are the responsibility of the CCA Stockholders
in the aggregate under this Agreement, but, for the avoidance of doubt, only
to the extent that such Taxes were not taken into account in determining an
adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to Article 1. Buyers shall also be
responsible for the preparation and timely filing of all Tax Returns of the
Companies for any Post-Closing Tax Period and for the payment of all Taxes due
with respect thereto.

  

  

(f) The CCA Stockholders, the Sellers' Representative, Buyers, and the
Companies shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by
any of the other Parties, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns
pursuant to this Section 6.14 and any Tax Proceeding (as defined below) with
respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the provision by the CCA
Stockholders, the Sellers' Representative, Buyers or any of the Companies, as
the case may be, to the other Party any reasonably requested power of attorney
with respect to Tax Returns or Tax Proceedings involving any of the Companies
in order to carry out the agreements set forth in this Section 6.14. The CCA
Stockholders, on the one hand, and Buyers and the Companies, on the other
hand, further agree (after Closing): (i) to retain all books and records with
respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Companies relating to any taxable
period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute
of limitations (and, to the extent notified by any other Party, any extensions
thereof) of the respective taxable periods, (ii) upon any other Party's
request, to give such other Party access to such books and records which are
reasonably relevant to a Tax Proceeding or Tax Return involving the Companies
and to make employees and personnel available on a mutually convenient basis
to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder, (iii) to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with
any Governmental Authority, and (iv) to give each other Party reasonable
written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books
and records, and, if any such other Party so requests, to allow such other
Party within a reasonable time to take possession of such books and records to
the extent they would otherwise be destroyed or discarded.

  

  

(g) Buyers agree that they shall not amend (or cause or permit any Company to
amend) any Tax Return of the Companies for any taxable period beginning before
the Closing Date without the prior written consent of the Sellers'
Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

  

  

(h) The CCA Stockholders shall be entitled to receive any refunds or credits
of any Taxes for any Pre-Closing Tax Period and the pre-Closing portion of any
Straddle Period (including any interest in respect thereof, and including any
reduction of Post-Closing Tax Period Taxes as a result of application of any
refund or credit for a Pre-Closing Tax Period against such Taxes), and Buyers
shall cause the amount of any refunds or credits of Taxes (including interest)
to which CCA Stockholders are entitled under this Section 6.14, but which are
received by or credited to Buyers or any Company after the Closing Date, to be
paid to the Sellers' Representative within two (2) Business Days following
such receipt or crediting. In addition, at the request of the CCA
Stockholders, Buyers shall (and shall cause the Companies to) cooperate with
the CCA Stockholders in seeking any Tax refunds or credits described in this
Section 6.14. The Sellers' Representative shall pay to each CCA Stockholder
its Pro Rata Portion of any amounts received by it pursuant to this Section
6.14(h) by wire transfer of immediately available funds.

  

  

(i) After Closing, the CCA Stockholders, on the one hand, and Buyers and the
Companies, on the other hand, shall promptly deliver to the other any notice
received by it (or by an Affiliate thereof) from any Governmental Entity
relating to Taxes for which such other Person is or may be liable under this
Agreement. To the extent that a Person's failure to provide such notice
materially prejudices the other Party's ability to defend the claim or dispute
that is the subject of such notice, then such other Party's indemnification
obligations shall be null and void with regard to such claim or dispute.

  

  

(j) Tax Proceedings.

  

  

(i) The Sellers' Representative, on behalf of the CCA Stockholders, shall have
the right to conduct and control any audit, examination, litigation or other
proceeding with respect to Taxes (a "Tax Proceeding") involving the Companies
to the extent it relates to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, provided, however,
that the Sellers' Representative will not, without the written consent of
Buyers, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, settle or
compromise any such Tax Proceeding in a manner that would have the effect of
materially increasing the Taxes of the Companies in a Post-Closing Tax Period.
Buyers shall have the right to participate in such proceeding at their own
expense.

  

  

(ii) In the case of any Tax Proceeding relating to a Straddle Period: (A) the
Party(ies) with the greatest amount of potential liability at stake shall have
the right to control such proceeding, and (B) the non-controlling Party shall
have the right to participate in such proceeding at its own expense and to
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, to any
settlement or compromise thereof to the extent such settlement or compromise
would have the effect of increasing the Taxes imposed on such Party. For
purposes of this Section 6.14(j)(ii), the CCA Stockholders together shall be
considered a single Party.

  

  

(k) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 6.14, any amounts owed by the
CCA Stockholders, on the one hand, or Buyers or the Companies, on the other
hand, to the other Party pursuant to this Section 6.14 shall be paid within
two (2) Business Days of notice from the recipient.

  

  

(l) For the avoidance of doubt, in accordance with Section 10.1, (i) the
provisions of this Section 6.14 shall survive the Closing until the date that
is twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, at which time they shall
terminate; and (ii) with respect to any claim under this Section 6.14, in the
event of a conflict between this Section 6.14 and Section 10.3, this Section
6.14 shall govern.

  

  

6.15 Transfer Taxes

  

  

. All Transfer Taxes arising out of or in connection with the Transactions
shall be paid fifty percent (50%) by Buyers and fifty percent (50%) by the CCA
Stockholders, except that Buyers shall be responsible for all Transfer Taxes
arising with respect to the transaction referenced in or contemplated by
Sections 1.7(h) or (i). Sellers' Representative and Buyers shall cooperate in
the preparation, execution and filing of all Transfer Tax Returns and shall
cooperate to seek and to secure any available exemptions from such Transfer
Taxes.

  

  

6.16 FIRPTA Certificate

  

  

. The CCA Stockholders shall deliver to Buyers on the Closing Date, duly
completed and executed certificates of non-foreign status pursuant to section
1.1445-2(b)(2) of the Treasury Regulations sufficient to exempt Buyers from
the requirements of Code Section 1445(a). The sole remedy for failure to
provide any such certificate shall be to permit Buyers to make any withholding
as required pursuant to Section 1445 of the Code.

  

  

6.17 CCA Payoff Letters

  

  

. CCA shall obtain, and deliver to Buyers, the CCA Payoff Letters at least
three (3) Business Days prior to Closing. Except for Permitted Liens, at or
prior to the Closing, CCA shall obtain the release of all Liens disclosed in
the Schedules hereto and any other Liens on the CCA Shares or the assets of
the CCA, and shall file or at Closing deliver to Buyers for filing or
authorize the filing by Buyers of releases of all such Liens with each
Governmental Entity in which any such Lien or evidence thereof shall have been
previously filed. Except for Permitted Liens, at or prior to the Closing, CCA
shall obtain the release of all Liens disclosed in the Schedules hereto and
any other Liens on the WK Shares or the assets of the White Knight Entities,
and shall file or at Closing deliver to Buyers for filing or authorize the
filing by Buyers of releases of all such Liens with each Governmental Entity
in which any such Lien or evidence thereof shall have been previously filed.

  

  

6.18 Equity Incentive Plan

  

  

. No later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing, CCA shall take
such actions as are required to cause all outstanding Stock Options to
purchase CCA Shares granted under the 2007 Option Plan or any other plan or
Contract, whether vested or unvested, to be cancelled upon the Closing, and
thereafter, except as specifically provided herein, CCA shall have no further
obligations in respect of the 2007 Option Plan or any Stock Options granted
thereunder whatsoever. All costs and expenses associated with the actions
contemplated by this Section 6.18 shall be paid by CCA and, to the extent
unpaid as of the Effective Time, shall be included in the Closing
Indebtedness, unless otherwise included in the Sellers' Representative's
estimate of Company Transaction Expenses or its estimate of current
liabilities for the purposes of computing its estimate of Net Working Capital,
as applicable, described in Section 1.4(a)(i). Nexstar shall cause CCA to pay
such costs and expenses in accordance with the terms of payment applicable
thereto to the extent they are not paid as of the Effective Time, in each
case, net of all applicable withholdings.

  

  

6.19 Capital Expenditures

  

  

. Schedule 6.19 sets forth a list of budgeted capital expenditures of the
Companies, identifying each project (a "Cap Ex Project") and the budgeted
expense associated with each such Cap Ex Project (a "Project Budget"). If any
Cap Ex Project is not completed by Closing, any unspent amount in the Project
Budget related to such Cap Ex Project not completed by Closing (in the
aggregate with all such unspent amounts related to any Cap Ex Projects not
completed by Closing, the "Project Adjustment") shall reduce the Purchase
Price as set forth in Section 1.2(a). With respect to those items described on
Schedule 6.19 and marked "%", the CCA Stockholders' sole liability with
respect to the condition of the asset so marked is capped at the Project
Adjustment and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
Buyers shall have no other claim hereunder with respect thereto.

appropriate to terminate the White Knight Broadcasting 401(k) Plan and the
Communications Corporation of America 401(k) Plan (each a "401(k) Plan" and
together the "401(k) Plans") in accordance with their terms and the
requirements of Applicable Law.

  

  

(b) Benefit Plan Compliance Corrections. Prior to the Closing, CCA shall, and
shall cause the other Companies to, take all actions as are reasonably
necessary or appropriate to bring the Benefit Plans into material compliance
with Applicable Law, by addressing (i) the failure of any entity that
participated in any 401(k) Plan in 2009 or after to have timely and properly
adopted or executed any participation agreement or other documentation
required for such entity to participate thereunder, and (ii) any multiple
employer plan reporting and disclosure and non-discrimination testing failures
under the Benefit Plans, with such actions to include, if applicable: (A)
submitting a filing to the Internal Revenue Service under the Voluntary
Correction Program with Service Approval ("VCP") component of the Employee
Plans Compliance Resolution System ("EPCRS") pursuant to Revenue Procedure
2013-12 (or any superseding Revenue Procedure) and the taking of all actions
required by the Internal Revenue Service to obtain and implement the
requirements of a compliance statement as defined in and pursuant to the
provisions of EPCRS (to the extent the relevant 401(k) Plan is eligible for
the EPCRS, or if the relevant 401(k) Plan is not eligible for the EPCRS, by
taking all actions as are reasonably necessary or appropriate to bring the
relevant 401(k) Plan into material compliance with Applicable Law), and (B)
submitting a filing under the Department of Labor's Voluntary Fiduciary
Correction Program ("VFCP") and using commercially reasonable efforts to take
all actions necessary to obtain an agreement with the Department of Labor that
no penalties will be imposed in connection with any breach of fiduciary duty
or prohibited transaction relating to the 401(k) Plans. For the avoidance of
doubt, final remediation of the issues described in this Section 6.20(b) is
not a condition to Closing.

  

  

6.21 Intellectual Property Registrations

  

  

. Prior to the Closing, CCA shall, and shall cause the other Companies to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to take all steps necessary to update the
records of the applicable registrar to indicate CCA or ComCorp Broadcasting,

Broadcasting, Inc. all right, title and interest in and to, the domain names
set forth on Schedule 3.10(a), and shall deliver to Buyers written evidence

10.3 Procedures with Respect to Third Party Claims

  

  

.

  

  

(a) Any Claim for indemnification pursuant hereto on behalf of any Buyer
Indemnified Party shall be made by Nexstar, and any Claim for indemnification
pursuant hereto on behalf of any CCA Indemnified Party shall be made by the
Sellers' Representative. A Party seeking indemnification pursuant hereto (an
"indemnified party") shall give prompt written notice to the Party from which
indemnification is being demanded (the "indemnifying party") of any demand,
suit, Claim or assertion of liability by third parties that is subject to
indemnification hereunder (a "Third Party Claim"), but a failure to give such
notice or delaying such notice shall not affect the indemnified party's rights
or the indemnifying party's obligations, except to the extent the indemnifying
party's ability to remedy, contest, defend or settle with respect to such
Third Party Claim is thereby materially prejudiced and provided that, where
applicable, such notice is given within the time period described in Section
10.1.

  

  

(b) The indemnifying party shall have the right to undertake the defense of,
opposition to, compromise of, or settlement of, such Third Party Claim with
counsel selected by it. In the event that the indemnifying party does not
undertake such defense, opposition, compromise or settlement, the indemnified
party may undertake the defense, opposition, compromise or settlement of such
Third Party Claim with counsel selected by it that is reasonably acceptable to
the indemnifying party at the indemnifying party's cost, except that the
indemnified party shall not, without the indemnifying party's prior written
consent, settle or compromise any Third Party Claim or consent to entry of any
judgment.

  

  

(c) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding:

  

  

(i) the indemnified party shall have the right, at its own cost and expense,
to participate in the defense, opposition, compromise or settlement of the
Third Party Claim;

  

  

(ii) the indemnifying party may not assume or continue to conduct the defense
of such Third Party Claim if (1) the indemnifying party fails to provide
written notice of its intent to assume the defense of such claim within thirty
(30) days of receiving notice from the indemnified party of such Third Party
Claim, (2) the amount in dispute exceeds the maximum amount for which the
indemnifying party can then be liable pursuant to this Article 10 in light of
the limitations on indemnification contained herein, if applicable, (3) the
claim seeks non-monetary, equitable or injunctive relief or alleges violation
of criminal law, (4) the indemnifying party does not, upon assumption of such
defense in accordance with this Section 10.3, conduct the defense of the claim
actively and diligently (in which case, the indemnifying party shall cease to
control such claim), or (5) such claim includes as the named parties in any
such claim both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the
indemnified party or the indemnifying party reasonably determines upon the
advice of counsel that representation of both parties by the same counsel
would be prohibited by applicable codes of professional conduct;

  

  

(iii) the indemnifying party shall not, without the indemnified party's prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), settle or compromise any Third Party Claim or consent to entry of
any judgment which (A) settlement, compromise or judgment does not include the
giving by the Person making the Third Party Claim to the indemnified party of
a release, without prejudice, from all liability and obligations in respect of
such Third Party Claim, and (B) contains any covenants or undertakings binding
on the indemnified party other than customary agreements to keep the terms of
such settlement or compromise confidential; and

  

  

(iv) in the event that the indemnifying party undertakes the defense of or
opposition to any Third Party Claim, the indemnified party, by counsel or
other representative of its own choosing and at its sole cost and expense,
shall have the right to consult with the indemnifying party and its counsel
concerning such Third Party Claim and the indemnifying party and the
indemnified party and their respective counsel shall cooperate in good faith
with respect to such Third Party Claim.

  

  

10.4 No Special Damages, Mitigation

  

  

. No indemnifying party shall be liable to any indemnified party for special,
indirect, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages or lost profits, unless
and to the extent such damages are payable to a third party. Each party agrees
to exercise its commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any Damages in
respect of any pending or threatened Third Party Claim.

  

  

10.5 Offset

  

  

. The amount of any Damages indemnifiable by any indemnifying party to any
indemnified party pursuant to this Article 10 will be reduced to reflect (a)
the value of any net Tax benefit (whether monetary or otherwise) that will be
realized, directly or indirectly, by the indemnified party as a result of such
Damages and (b) any amount actually recovered or recoverable by the
indemnified party under insurance policies or otherwise with respect to such
Damages.

  

  

10.6 Treatment of Indemnity Benefits

  

  

. All payments made by the CCA Stockholders or Buyers, as the case may be, to
or for the benefit of the other pursuant to any indemnification obligations
under this Agreement shall be treated as adjustments to the Purchase Price for
Tax purposes and such agreed treatment shall govern for purposes of this
Agreement.

  

  

10.7 Environmental Liabilities

  

  

. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary (and subject in all respects
to the Cap), with respect to any Claim for indemnification regarding any
breach of any representation or warranty under Section 3.9, the CCA
Stockholders shall have no obligation to indemnify or hold harmless a Buyer
Indemnified Party for (a) any Damages that would not have arisen but for any
intrusive investigation (including any soil, groundwater or surface water
sampling) by Buyers or any of their agents or representatives, except to the
extent such intrusive investigation was consented to by the Sellers'
Representative, was required by or required to attain compliance with
Environmental Laws or environmental permits or a Governmental Entity, was
necessary to address a significant risk to human health or safety, or was
affirmatively required in writing by a landlord or by a lease agreement, or
(b) any investigation, monitoring or remedial costs or other related costs
that exceed the cost to meet a reasonably cost-effective standard or remedy
required by applicable Environmental Laws that is consistent with the
commercial or industrial use of the site as of the Closing Date, as applicable
(including any site-specific standards based on risk assessments and any
remedies or standards that require or are limited to the imposition of deed
restrictions, land use restrictions or monitored natural attenuation), that do
not materially interfere with the use of or materially impair the value of the
property and provided that such remedy is acceptable to (i) the Governmental
Entity with jurisdiction over the condition if the approval of such
Governmental Entity is required therefor under applicable Environmental Laws
and (ii) any landlord (with respect to conditions on leased real property) if
the approval of such landlord is required therefor, including under the
applicable lease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyers may clean up to more
stringent standards, but the incremental increased cost shall be borne by
Buyers and not subject to indemnification by the CCA Stockholders.

  

  

10.8 Exclusive Remedies

  

  

. Buyers, CCA and the CCA Stockholders acknowledge and agree that (except in
the case of fraud and expect for remedies provided in Section 1.4, Section
6.12(b) and Section 11.4), if the Closing occurs, the indemnification
provisions of Section 6.12(b), Section 6.14 and this Article 10 shall be the
sole and exclusive remedies of the Buyer Indemnified Parties and the CCA
Indemnified Parties for any breach of the representations or warranties or
nonperformance of, breach or default under any covenants or agreements of the
Parties contained in this Agreement or any Buyer Ancillary Agreements or CCA
Ancillary Agreements, and no Party shall have any liability to any other Party
or any of the Buyer Indemnified Parties or CCA Indemnified Parties under any
circumstances for special, indirect, consequential, punitive or exemplary
damages or lost profits, unless and to the extent such damages are payable to
a third party; provided, however, that nothing contained in this Agreement
shall relieve or limit the liability of any Party from any liability or Losses
arising out of or resulting from such party's fraud with scienter in
connection with the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, the CCA
Ancillary Agreements or the Buyer Ancillary Agreements. In furtherance of the
foregoing, each of Buyers and the CCA Stockholders, on behalf of themselves
and on behalf of the Buyer Indemnified Parties and the CCA Indemnified
Parties, respectively, hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted under
Applicable Law, except in the case of fraud, any and all rights, Claims and
causes of action it or they may have against the other(s) arising out of or
resulting from any Applicable Law (including any such rights, Claims or causes
of action arising under or based upon common law, tort or otherwise and
relating to this Agreement, any CCA Ancillary Document or any Buyer Ancillary
Document or the transactions contemplated hereby), other than any rights,
Claims or Actions arising under this Article 10.

  

  

10.9 Effect of Investigation

  

  

. The right to indemnification or any other remedy based on representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in this Agreement, any CCA Ancillary
Agreement or Buyer Ancillary Agreement shall not be affected by any
investigation conducted at any time, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of
being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or
compliance with, any such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

the performance of their covenants, contained in this Agreement and (iii) all

(c) by written notice of Sellers' Representatives to Buyers if (i) CCA and the
CCA Stockholders are not in material breach of their obligations under this
Agreement, (ii) Buyers breach their representations or warranties, or default

all such breaches and defaults by Buyers that are not cured within the Cure

that no Cure Period shall apply to Buyers' obligations to pay the Escrow
Deposit Fund on the date hereof and to pay the Purchase Price at Closing; or

  

  

(d) by written notice of Buyers to Sellers' Representatives, or by Sellers'
Representatives to Buyers, if the Closing does not occur by the date that is
eighteen (18) months after the date of this Agreement (such date, the "Outside

material breach of this Agreement by the Party providing such notice of
termination.

  

  

11.2 Cure Period

  

  

. Buyers, on the one hand, or the Sellers' Representative, on the other hand,
as the case may be, shall give the other prompt written notice upon learning
of any breach or default by the other Party under this Agreement, and such
notice shall include a description of the breach. The term "Cure Period" as
used herein means a period commencing on the date Buyers or Sellers'
Representatives receive from the other written notice of breach or default
hereunder and continuing until the earlier of (i) thirty (30) calendar days
thereafter or (ii) five (5) Business Days after the date otherwise scheduled
for Closing; provided, however, that if the breach or default is non-monetary
and cannot reasonably be cured within such period but can be cured before the
date five (5) Business Days after the scheduled Closing Date, and if diligent
efforts to cure promptly commence, then the Cure Period shall continue as long
as such diligent efforts to cure continue, but not beyond the date five (5)
Business Days after the date otherwise scheduled for Closing.

  

  

11.3 Termination and Survival

  

  

. Subject to Section 11.2 and Section 11.6, in the event of a termination of
this Agreement by either Sellers' Representative, on the one hand, or Buyers,
on the other hand, as provided in Section 11.1, this Agreement shall terminate
and, subject to Section 11.5, there shall be no liability or obligation on the
part of any CCA Stockholder, the Sellers' Representative, Buyers or their
respective directors, officers, employees, incorporators, members, partners,
equityholders, Affiliates, agents, attorneys or representatives; provided that
the provisions of this Section 11.3 and Section 6.1 (Confidentiality), Section
6.12(b) (Financing Assistance), Section 11.5 (Liquidated Damages), Section
11.6 (Return of Escrow Deposit), Article 12 (Sellers' Representative),
(Section 13.1 (Expenses), Section 13.6 (Entire Agreement), Section 13.9
(Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial), Section 13.10
(Neutral Construction), Section 13.12 (Counterparts; Delivery by
Facsimile/Email), Section 13.13 (Interpretation) and Section 13.15 (Mutual
Non-Recourse) shall remain in full force and effect and survive any
termination of this Agreement; provided, however, that, subject to Section
11.6, any such termination shall not relieve any Party of any liability for
any breach or default of this Agreement that occurred prior to such
termination.

  

  

11.4 Specific Performance

  

  

.

  

  

(a) Subject to Sections 11.4(b), 11.5 and 1.6, the Parties hereto acknowledge
and agree that the Parties hereto would be irreparably damaged if any of the
provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or are otherwise breached and that any non-performance or
breach of this Agreement by any Party hereto could not be adequately
compensated by monetary damages alone and that the Parties hereto would not
have any adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, in addition to any other right
or remedy to which any Party hereto may be entitled, at law or in equity
(including monetary damages), subject to Sections 11.4(b), 11.5 and 1.6, prior
to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.1, such Party
shall be entitled to enforce any provision of this Agreement by a decree of
specific performance and to temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive
relief, subject to obtaining any required Governmental Consents, to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of any of the provisions of this Agreement
without posting any bond or other undertaking. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the Parties hereto agree that, subject to Section 11.4(b),
the Party seeking specific performance shall be entitled to enforce
specifically (a) a Party's obligations under Section 1.7; and (b) a Party's
obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the obligation to consummate the Closing and to pay the Purchase
Price, if applicable), if the conditions set forth in Section 1.6, Article 7
or Article 8, as applicable, have been satisfied (other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) or waived.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is explicitly agreed that the Sellers'
Representative, on behalf of the CCA Stockholders, shall be entitled to seek
specific performance of Buyers' obligation to consummate the Closing
(including the consummation of the purchase of the CCA Shares and the WK
Shares). Without limiting the foregoing, CCA agrees that Buyers may enforce
CCA's rights with respect to the White Knight Entities' obligations under the
Options and the Option Exercise Agreement, as it relates to the WK Shares, and
under the Option Exercise Agreement directly against the WK Seller, and Buyers
hereby agree that they shall enforce any Claim under the Options and the
Option Exercise Agreement against WK Seller prior to making a Claim against
the CCA Stockholders under Section 6.14 or Article 10. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Sellers' Representative may take any of the actions permitted by
this Section 11.4 on behalf of and in the name of the CCA Stockholders.

  

  

11.5 Liquidated Damages

  

  

.

  

  

(a) If Sellers' Representative, on behalf of the CCA Stockholders, terminates
this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.1(c) under circumstances where (x) all
of the conditions set forth in Section 1.6, Article 7 and Article 8 (other
than those conditions that (i) by their nature would be satisfied at the
Closing by actions that the Sellers' Representative has indicated in writing
to Buyers that the CCA Stockholders are willing and able to take or (ii) are
unsatisfied as a result of Buyers' breach of their representations and
warranties or default in the performance of their covenants and agreements
contained in this Agreement and the failure of such breaches or defaults to be
cured within the Cure Period to the extent provided herein) have been
satisfied or waived and (y) the Buyers have not consummated the Closing within
two (2) Business Days after the date on which the Closing is scheduled to
occur pursuant to Section 1.6(a), then the Escrow Deposit Fund shall be paid
to CCA (or CCA's designee) pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement, Nexstar and the Sellers' Representative shall execute and
deliver to the Escrow Agent written instructions to such effect and such
payment shall constitute liquidated damages. Buyers acknowledge and agree that
the payment of the Escrow Deposit Fund pursuant to this Section 11.5 shall
constitute payment of liquidated damages and not a penalty and that such
liquidated damages amount is reasonable in light of the substantial but
indeterminate harm anticipated to be caused by Buyers' material breach or
default under this Agreement, the difficulty of proof of loss and damages, the
inconvenience and non-feasibility of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy,
and the value of the transactions to be consummated hereunder.

  

  

(b) Each of the CCA Stockholders, the Companies and the WK Seller acknowledge
and agree that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 11.1, under circumstances of
termination by Sellers' Representative delineated in Section 11.5(a), except
in the case of fraud with scienter, the sole and exclusive remedy of such
Party hereunder shall be the right to seek payment from the Escrow Deposit
Fund pursuant to this Section 11.5 and in no event shall the Sellers'
Representative, any of the CCA Stockholders, the WK Seller, any Company or any
of their respective Affiliates seek any damages or any other recovery,
judgment of any kind, including consequential, indirect, or punitive damages
against any Buyer, and the Sellers' Representative, any of the CCA
Stockholders, the WK Seller, any Company or any of their respective Affiliates
shall be precluded from any other remedy against any Buyer at law or in equity
or otherwise.

  

  

(c) The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 11.5
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
that, without these agreements, no Party would enter into this Agreement.

  

  

11.6 Return of Escrow Deposit

  

  

. In all cases of termination of this Agreement, other than a termination of
this Agreement by Sellers' Representative on behalf of the CCA Stockholders
which results in the payment of the Escrow Deposit Fund to CCA (or Seller's
designee) in accordance with Section 11.5 hereof, the Escrow Deposit Fund
shall be paid to Buyers upon a termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms, and Nexstar and the Sellers' Representative shall execute and
deliver to the Escrow Agent written instructions to such effect.

(g) as the Sellers' Representative, to enforce and protect the rights and
interests of the CCA Stockholders and to enforce and protect the rights and
interests of all CCA Stockholders arising out of or under or in any manner
relating to this Agreement and the Transaction Documents, and to take any and
all actions which the Sellers' Representative believes are necessary or
appropriate under this Agreement or the Transaction Documents for and on
behalf of CCA Stockholders, including (i) consenting to, compromising or
settling any such Claims, conducting negotiations with Buyers and the
Companies and their respective representatives regarding such Claims, (ii)
asserting or instituting any Claim against any Person (including pursuant to
Section 6.12(b), Section 6.14 or Article 10); (iii) investigating, defending,
contesting or litigating any Claim (including pursuant to Section 6.12(b),
Section 6.14 or Article 10) (other than Claims for which such CCA Stockholder
is solely liable) initiated by Buyers or any other Person, or by any
Governmental Entity against the Sellers' Representative, the Companies and/or
any of the CCA Stockholders, and receive process on behalf of any or all CCA
Stockholders in any such Claim and compromise or settle on such terms as the
Sellers' Representative shall determine to be appropriate, and give receipts,
releases and discharges with respect to, any such Claim, action, proceeding or
investigation; (iv) file any proofs of debt, Claims and petitions as the
Sellers' Representative may deem advisable or necessary; (v) settle or
compromise any Claims (including pursuant to Section 6.12(b), Section 6.14 or

in any such Claim (including pursuant to Section 6.12(b), Section 6.14 or
Article 10) (other than Claims for which such CCA Stockholder is solely
liable), it being understood that the Sellers' Representative (i) shall not
have any obligation to take any such actions, (ii) shall not have any
liability for any failure to take any such actions and (iii) shall not have
the power to settle or compromise any Claims for which the CCA Stockholder may
have separate defenses or which settlement or compromise would result in any
CCA Stockholder being treated differently than any other CCA Stockholder.

  

  

(h) to refrain from enforcing any right of CCA Stockholders arising out of or
under or in any manner relating to this Agreement and the Transaction
Documents; provided, however, that no such failure to act on the part of the
Sellers' Representative, except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement or
in the Transaction Documents, as applicable, shall be deemed a waiver of any
such right or interest by the Sellers' Representative or by the CCA
Stockholders, unless such waiver is in writing signed by the waiving party or
by the Sellers' Representative;

  

  

(i) to make, execute, acknowledge, receive and deliver all such other
agreements, settlement agreements, release of Claims, guarantees, orders,
receipts, endorsements, notices, requests, information, instructions,
certificates, stock powers, letters and other writings, and, in general, to do
any and all things and to take any and all action that the Sellers'
Representative, in its reasonable discretion, may consider necessary or
appropriate in connection with or to carry out the Transactions;

  

  

(j) to hold, in anticipation of Closing, and to deliver to Buyers at Closing,

(k) to take all such actions as may be reasonably necessary after the date
hereof, including without limitation after the Closing Date, to carry out any
of the Transactions, including the actions required or permitted to be taken
by the Sellers' Representative under Section 6.14 or Article 10 and the
defense and/or settlement of any Claims for which indemnification is sought
pursuant to Section 6.12(b), Section 6.14 or Article 10 (in each case, other
than Claims the Damages for which any CCA Stockholder (i) is or may be solely
liable, (ii) is or may be liable in an amount different from the amount of
such Damages for which any other CCA Stockholder may be liable subject to pro
rata calculation, or (iii) may have different defenses than any other CCA
Stockholder).

  

  

(l) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Sellers'
Representative may not take or refrain from taking any action that would have
the legal or practical effect of treating any CCA Stockholder differently from
any other CCA Stockholder or result in any CCA Stockholder being subject to
any injunctive or equitable relief or non-monetary damages or making any
admission of wrong doing; provided, that, for the avoidance of doubt, nothing
in this Section 12.1(l) shall prohibit the Sellers' Representative from
taking, prior to Closing, any action explicitly permitted by the Stockholders'
Agreement or any other agreement among the CCA Stockholders or related to the
Companies, or, after Closing, with respect to the CCA Stockholders only, any
action that would have been explicitly permitted under the Stockholders'
Agreement or such other agreement if it remained in effect.

  

  

12.2 Payment of Purchase Price

  

  

. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Sellers' Representative
may retain a reasonable portion of the Purchase Price and any other amounts
received by it hereunder to fund the COBRA Fund, any CCA Option Payment not
paid by the Company, expenses, charges and Damages incurred by the Sellers'
Representative in connection with this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents, with any excess being delivered to CCA Stockholders at such time as
the Sellers' Representative shall determine, but in no event later than the
date that is one (1) Business Day after the release of all remaining amounts
from the Indemnity Escrow, except for the COBRA Fund, from which any excess
shall be delivered to the CCA Stockholders not later than the date that is one
(1) Business Day after payment by Buyers of any excess to the Sellers'
Representative. On the Closing Date, Buyers shall deliver the Initial Purchase
Price to the Sellers' Representatives at which time the Sellers'
Representative shall (i) determine each CCA Stockholder's Pro Rata Portion of
the expenses, charges and Damages to be paid by the CCA Stockholders
hereunder, (ii) deduct from the amounts otherwise payable to each CCA
Stockholder hereunder, such CCA Stockholder's Pro Rata Portion of such
expenses, charges and Damages, and (iii) distribute the remaining amounts to
CCA Stockholders based upon their respective Pro Rata Portions thereof. At any
time that an amount is to be paid to the CCA Stockholders hereunder or at any
time as determined by the Sellers' Representative, the Sellers' Representative
shall calculate the Pro Rata Portion of the Transaction Proceeds for each CCA
Stockholder as of such date of determination. Each CCA Stockholder hereby
agrees to cooperate with the Sellers' Representative and otherwise make such
payments of any portion of the Transaction Proceeds received by such CCA
Stockholder in excess of its Pro Rata Portion thereof to any CCA Stockholder
or CCA Stockholders who have received less than their Pro Rata Portion thereof
in order to effect the principle that, as of any date of determination, each
CCA Stockholder shall receive a portion of the Transaction Proceeds equal to
its Pro Rata Portion thereof.

  

  

12.3 Other Powers and Duties of the Sellers' Representative

  

  

. The appointment of the Sellers' Representative is deemed coupled with an
interest and is irrevocable, and the Parties hereto and any other Person may
conclusively and absolutely rely, without inquiry, upon any action of the
Sellers' Representative in all matters referred to herein. Any action taken by
the Sellers' Representative will be in writing and will be signed by the
Sellers' Representative. All notices required to be made or delivered by
Buyers to the CCA Stockholders will be made to the Sellers' Representative,
which will discharge in full all other notice requirements of the Buyers to
the CCA Stockholders with respect thereto. The CCA Stockholders hereby confirm
and ratify all that the Sellers' Representative does or causes to be done by
virtue of its appointment as the representative of the CCA Stockholders
hereunder to the extent consistent with the terms of this Agreement. The
Sellers' Representative will act for the CCA Stockholders on all of the
matters set forth in this Agreement, consistent with the obligations of the
CCA Stockholders under this Agreement, but the Sellers' Representative is not
responsible for any liability or obligation of any CCA Stockholder and is not
responsible to the CCA Stockholders for any loss or damages which the CCA
Stockholders may suffer by the performance of the Sellers' Representative's
duties under this Agreement, other than loss or damages arising from breach of
its obligations or duties hereunder, violation of any Applicable Law or fraud
or lack of good faith in the performance of such duties or obligations under
this Agreement and in no event do any such losses or damages include
consequential, incidental, indirect, special, exemplary or punitive losses or
damages of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits),
even if the Sellers' Representative has been advised of the likelihood of such
loss or damage and regardless of the form of action. The Sellers'
Representative does not have any duties or responsibilities, except those
expressly set forth in this Agreement, the duty to act in good faith and the
duty to comply with Applicable Law and no other implied covenants, functions,
responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities are read into this
Agreement or otherwise exist against the Sellers' Representative.

  

  

12.4 Reliance by the Sellers' Representative

  

  

. The Sellers' Representative is entitled to rely, and is fully protected in
relying, upon any statements furnished to it by any Party hereto which may
reasonably be deemed by the Sellers' Representative to be reliable or any
other evidence reasonably deemed by the Sellers' Representative to be
reliable, and the Sellers' Representative is entitled to act on the advice of
counsel selected by it. The Sellers' Representative is fully justified in
failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement unless it has
received such advice or concurrence of the CCA Stockholders as it deems
appropriate or it has been expressly indemnified to its satisfaction by the
CCA Stockholders (severally but not jointly) against any and all liability and
expense that the Sellers' Representative may incur by reason of taking or
continuing to take any such action.

  

  

12.5 Expenses of the Sellers' Representative

  

  

. The Sellers' Representative is entitled to retain counsel and other advisors
and to incur such expenses (including court costs and reasonable attorneys'
fees and expenses) as the Sellers' Representative deems to be necessary or
appropriate in connection with its performance of its obligations under this
Agreement, including in connection with the defense of any Claim related
hereto, including any Claim for indemnification, and any matter arising under
this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents. Each CCA Stockholder will
bear its Pro Rata Portion of all reasonable fees and expenses incurred by the
Sellers' Representative in performing its duties hereunder.

  

  

12.6 Indemnification

  

  

.

  

  

(a) Each CCA Stockholder hereby agrees (severally but not jointly in
proportion to its Pro Rata Portion) to indemnify the Sellers' Representative
and its members, shareholders, directors, officers and employees (in its
capacity as such) against, and to hold the Sellers' Representative and its
members, shareholders, directors, officers and employees (in its capacity as
such) harmless from, any and all Damages of whatever kind which may at any
time be imposed upon, incurred by or asserted against the Sellers'
Representative and its members, shareholders, directors, officers and
employees in such capacity in any way relating to or arising out of the
Sellers' Representative's action or failure to take action pursuant to this
Agreement or in connection herewith in such capacity; provided, however, that
no CCA Stockholder shall liable for the payment of any portion of such Damages
to the extent resulting from the fraud of the Sellers' Representative, or
breach of Applicable Law or breach of this Agreement by the Sellers'
Representative. Each CCA Stockholder hereby authorizes the Sellers'
Representative to apply proceeds otherwise distributable to such CCA
Stockholder pursuant to this Agreement to satisfy any of such CCA
Stockholder's obligations under this Section 12.6. Each CCA Stockholder
acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing indemnities shall survive the
resignation or removal of the Sellers' Representative or the termination of
this Agreement.

  

  

(b) In the event of any indemnification under this Agreement, upon written
notice from the Sellers' Representative to the CCA Stockholders as to the
existence of a deficiency toward the payment of any such indemnification
amount, each CCA Stockholder shall promptly deliver to the Sellers'
Representative full payment of his or her Pro Rata Portion of the amount of
such deficiency.

  

  

12.7 Accounting

  

  

. Upon the written request of any CCA Stockholder, the Sellers' Representative
shall provide such CCA Stockholder with an accounting of all monies received
and distributed by the Sellers' Representative, in its capacity as the
Sellers' Representative, and shall provide such CCA Stockholder with such
other reasonable information regarding the Sellers' Representative's actions,
in its capacity as the Sellers' Representative, as such holder may reasonably
request.

  

  

12.8 Administration

  

  

. Without limiting any provision of Article 12 hereof, each of the Parties
acknowledges and agrees that the Sellers' Representative is a party to this
Agreement solely to perform certain administrative functions in connection
with the consummation of the Transactions. Accordingly, each of the Parties
acknowledges and agrees that the Sellers' Representative (solely in its
capacity as such) shall have no liability to, and shall not be liable for any
Damages of, any Party or any Person entitled to indemnification under the
other sections of this Agreement in connection with any obligations of the
Sellers' Representative under this Agreement or the Transaction Documents or
otherwise in respect of this Agreement or the Transactions. In furtherance
(and not in limitation) of the provisions set forth in this Article 12, the
CCA Stockholders shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
take or cause to be taken all reasonable actions necessary or desirable to
effect this Article 12 or as otherwise reasonably requested by the Sellers'
Representative in connection with the Transactions as promptly as is
practicable.

  

  

12.9 Resignation

  

  

. The Sellers' Representative may at any time resign by giving written notice
of its resignation to Buyers and the CCA Stockholders (at the address
specified in Annex E hereto) specifying the date on which its resignation
shall become effective; provided that such resignation shall not be effective
until the CCA Stockholders, by the affirmative vote of the CCA Stockholders
holding CCA Shares that represent over 50% of the number of outstanding CCA
Shares immediately prior to the Closing, appoint a successor Sellers'
Representative which agrees in writing with the Parties hereto to be bound by
the provisions of this Agreement applicable to the Sellers' Representative,
and notify Buyers in writing of such appointment.

  

  

12.10 Survival/General

  

  

. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, the
agreements in this Article 12 shall survive termination of this Agreement. All
of the indemnities, immunities and powers granted to the Sellers'
Representative under this Agreement shall survive the Closing Date and/or any
termination of this Agreement and/or the Transaction Documents. The provisions
of this Article 12 shall be binding upon any successor, executor, trustee or
permitted assign of a CCA Stockholder.

  

  

ARTICLE 13

  

  

MISCELLANEOUS

  

  

13.1 Expenses

  

  

. Except as may be otherwise specified herein, each Party shall be solely
responsible for all costs and expenses incurred by it in connection with the
negotiation, preparation and performance of and compliance with the terms of
this Agreement. If more than one HSR Act filing is necessary because a Party
has more than one ultimate parent entity, then such Party shall pay the HSR
Act filing fees for any additional filings. Each Party is responsible for any
commission, brokerage fee, advisory fee or other similar payment that arises
as a result of any agreement or action of it or any party acting on its behalf
in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. In
the event of any litigation regarding or arising from this Agreement prior to
the Closing, the prevailing Party as determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction in a final non-appealable judgment shall be entitled to recover
its reasonable costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses)
incurred therein or in the enforcement or collection of any judgment or award
rendered therein.

  

  

13.2 Further Assurances

  

  

. After Closing, each Party shall from time to time, at the request of and
without further cost or expense to the other, execute and deliver such other
instruments of conveyance and assumption and take such other actions as may
reasonably be requested in order to more effectively consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

13.3 Assignment

  

  

. Except as specifically outlined in Section 1.7, no Party may assign this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Parties hereto,
provided, however, that each Buyer may by written notice to, but without
consent of, CCA, assign its rights and obligations hereunder to an Affiliate
of such Buyer, provided that any such assignment does not materially delay the
processing of the FCC Applications, the grant of the FCC Consent, the HSR
Clearance or the Closing. The terms of this Agreement shall bind and inure to
the benefit of the Parties' respective successors and any permitted assigns,
and no assignment shall relieve any Party of any obligation or liability under
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Buyer may assign any or
all of its rights under this Agreement to any of its Affiliates or to its or
its subsidiaries' lenders as collateral security without the consent of any of
the other parties hereto, and no assignment shall relieve any Party of any
obligation or liability under this Agreement.

or contemplated hereby or thereby, and any amendments hereto or thereto, to
the extent signed and delivered by facsimile transmission or electronic mail

agreement or instrument and shall be considered to have the same binding legal
effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person.
