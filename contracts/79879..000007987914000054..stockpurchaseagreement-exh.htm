(c)In the event that Primary Seller does not object to the Closing Balance
Sheet or the Purchaser's Proposed Calculations by written notice of objection
(the "Notice of Objection") delivered to Purchaser within forty-five (45) days
after Primary Seller's receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet and the
Purchaser's Proposed Calculations, the calculation of the Final Purchase Price
pursuant to the Purchaser's Proposed Calculations shall be deemed final and
binding. A Notice of Objection under this Section 2.3(c) shall set forth in

(d)If Primary Seller delivers a Notice of Objection to Purchaser within the
forty-five (45) day period referred to in Section 2.3(c), then any element of
the Purchaser's Proposed Calculations that is not in dispute on the date such
Notice of Objection is given shall be treated as final and binding, and any
disputed elements (all amounts in dispute, together with any corresponding
amounts, the "Disputed Amounts") shall be resolved as set forth in this
Section 2.3(d):



(i)the Primary Parties shall promptly endeavor in good faith to resolve the
Disputed Amounts. If a written agreement determining the Disputed Amounts has
not been reached within ten (10) Business Days after the date of receipt by
Purchaser from Primary Seller of the Notice of Objection, the resolution of
such Disputed Amounts shall be submitted to any partner of any of the "Big
Four" global accounting firms other than KPMG Cardenas Dosal, S.C., different
than the partner(s) that at such point would be in charge of the external
audit of the financial information of the Company or any of the Parties (the
"Expert"), which the Primary Parties shall mutually select and jointly and
irrevocably appoint;



(ii)the Primary Parties shall use their Commercially Reasonable Efforts to
cause the Expert to render a decision in accordance with this Section 2.3(d)
within thirty (30) days of the submission of the Disputed Amounts to the
Expert. For the purposes hereof, upon submission of the Disputed Amounts to
the Expert, the Primary Parties shall provide to the Expert all documents that
each of them deems necessary, including a statement of reasons explaining
their corresponding position. Such documents shall be delivered no later than
fifteen (15) days following the submission of the Disputed Amounts to the
Expert. Within ten (10) days following the receipt of such documents, the
Expert may request the Primary Parties to provide further information, in the
understanding that such additional information shall only be requested for
clarifying purposes. During such term, the Expert may set up meetings with the
Primary Parties as the Expert may deem reasonably necessary;



(iii)the determination made by the Expert shall be final and binding upon each
Party hereto in terms of Article 2252 of the Federal Civil Code (Codigo Civil
Federal); accordingly, the Final Purchase Price shall be recalculated based
upon the final determination of the Expert with respect to the Disputed
Amounts and the Final Purchase Price, as so recalculated, shall be deemed to
be final and binding;



(iv)if the Primary Parties submit any Disputed Amounts to the Expert for
resolution, Sellers and Purchaser shall each pay their own costs and expenses
incurred under this Section 2.3(d). 

Sellers shall be responsible for that fraction of the fees and costs of the
Expert where (A) the numerator is the absolute value of the difference between
Primary Seller's aggregate position with respect to the Final Purchase Price
and the Final Purchase Price as recalculated based upon Expert's final
determination with respect to the Disputed Amounts; and (B) the denominator is
the absolute value of the difference between Primary Seller's aggregate
position with respect to the Final Purchase Price and Purchaser's aggregate
position with respect to the Final Purchase Price, and Purchaser shall be
responsible for the remainder of such fees and costs; and



(v)the Primary Parties shall use their Commercially Reasonable Efforts to
cause the Expert's determination of the Disputed Amounts to be no less than
the lesser of the amount claimed by either Primary Seller or Purchaser, and no
greater than the greater of the amount claimed by either Primary Seller or
Purchaser; provided that if, notwithstanding the Commercially Reasonable
Efforts of Primary Seller or Purchaser, (i) the Expert's determination of any
Disputed Amount is less than the lesser of the amounts claimed by either
Primary Seller or Purchaser, then such disputed amount shall be deemed to be
the lesser of the amounts claimed by either Primary Seller or Purchaser or
(ii) the Expert's determination of any Disputed Amount is more than the
greater of the amounts claimed by either Primary Seller or Purchaser, then
such disputed amount shall be deemed to be the greater of the amounts claimed
by either Primary Seller or Purchaser.



(e)Upon the determination, in accordance with Sections 2.3(c) or Section
2.3(d) hereof, of the Final Purchase Price, Primary Seller (on behalf of
Sellers) shall make, or Purchaser shall make or cause to be made, as the case
may be, the payment required by this Section 2.3(e). The amount payable by
Sellers or Purchaser pursuant to this Section 2.3(e) is referred to herein as
the "Purchase Price Adjustment" and shall be treated as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price for any Income Tax purposes. Accordingly:



(i)if the Final Purchase Price is greater than the Closing Purchase Price,
then within three (3) Business Days after the determination of the Final
Purchase Price: (a) the Primary Parties shall cause the escrow agent to
immediately release to Primary Seller on behalf of Sellers the Purchase Price
Escrow Fund in full; and (b) Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid to
Primary Seller on behalf of Sellers, an amount equal to the difference between
the Closing Purchase Price and the Final Purchase Price. Any amount to be paid
by Purchaser pursuant to this Section 2.3(e)(i) shall be paid by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to one or more accounts designated by Primary
Seller on behalf of Sellers in writing to Purchaser promptly after the final
determination of the Final Purchase Price; and



(ii)if the Final Purchase Price is less than the Closing Purchase Price, then
within three (3) Business Days after the determination of the Final Purchase
Price: (a) the Primary Parties shall cause the escrow agent to immediately
release from the Purchase Price Escrow Fund: (1) to Purchaser or its
designees, an amount equal to the difference between the Closing Purchase
Price and the Final Purchase Price; and (2) to Primary Seller on behalf of
Sellers, the balance, if any, of the Purchase Price Escrow Fund; and (b) in
the event that the amount of funds in the Purchase Price Escrow Fund is less
than the Purchase Price Adjustment, then Primary Seller on behalf Sellers
shall pay or cause to be paid to Purchaser or its designees such difference.
Any amount to be paid by Primary Seller on behalf of Sellers pursuant to this
Section 2.3(e)(ii) shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to one or more accounts designated by Purchaser in writing to Primary
Seller promptly after the final determination of the Final Purchase Price.



(f)For purposes of the calculations set forth in Section 2.2(b) and Section
2.3, it is acknowledged and agreed that the Estimated Closing Funded
Indebtedness, Closing Funded Indebtedness, 

Estimated Closing Cash, Closing Cash, Estimated Closing Accrued Income Tax
Liability, Closing Accrued Income Tax Liability, Estimated Closing Deferred
Tax Liability, Closing Deferred Tax Liability, Estimated Working Capital and
Working Capital each shall be calculated in Pesos, and that to the extent any
of the Subject Companies' accounts included in such amounts are not kept in
Pesos, the amounts of such accounts shall be converted into Pesos for the
purposes of such calculations in accordance with the Accounting Principles and
the principles and methodologies used in the preparation of the Audited
Financial Statements, the Target Working Capital, the Signing Funded
Indebtedness and the Closing Deferred Tax Liabilities, as applicable. It is
further acknowledged and agreed that the calculations set forth in Section 2.2
and Section 2.3 shall be made, and any Purchase Price Adjustment shall be
determined, in Pesos, and then converted into Dollars using the Exchange Rate
applicable on the Estimate Delivery Date.

of its certificate of incorporation or by-laws.

(a) Purchaser has the requisite corporate power and authority and has taken
all corporate or other action necessary to execute and deliver this Agreement,
the Escrow Agreement and all other 

instruments and agreements to be delivered by Purchaser as contemplated hereby
and thereby, to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder and to

delivery and performance by Purchaser of this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement
and all other instruments and agreements to be delivered by Purchaser as

obligations hereunder and thereunder have been duly authorized and approved by
the board of directors of Purchaser. This Agreement and the Escrow Agreement
has been, and all other instruments and agreements to be executed and
delivered by Purchaser as contemplated hereby and thereby will be, duly
executed and delivered by Purchaser. Assuming that this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of Sellers
and each other Person (other than Purchaser) party thereto, this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of
Purchaser, enforceable against Purchaser in accordance with their terms,
except as such enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally. Assuming that all other
instruments and agreements to be delivered by Purchaser as contemplated hereby
and thereby constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of Sellers and
each other Person (other than Purchaser) party thereto, such instruments and
agreements will constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of Purchaser
enforceable against Purchaser in accordance with their terms, except as such
enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors' rights generally.



(b)The execution and delivery of this Agreement and all other instruments and
agreements to be delivered by Purchaser as contemplated hereby do not, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby will not, (i)
conflict with any of the provisions of the certificate of incorporation or by-
laws or equivalent charter documents of Purchaser, as amended to the date of
this Agreement; (ii) conflict with or result in breach of, or constitute a
default under, or result in the acceleration of any obligation or loss of any

or (iii) subject to (A) the applicable Antitrust Laws and (B) the approval of
the board of directors of Purchaser, contravene any Law or any Order

Antitrust Authorities and the Foreign Investment Approval.

Affiliates will have any Liability for any fee, commission or broker's or
finder's fees in connection with this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby to any agent, broker, Person or firm acting on behalf of
Purchaser.



Section 4.5 Financing. Purchaser, on the Closing Date, will have sufficient
funds available, in each of such cases so as to enable it to consummate or
cause to be consummated the purchase of the Shares and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.



Section 4.6 Solvency. Assuming the accuracy of all of the Sellers' and the
Company's representations and warranties, immediately after giving effect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Purchaser and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, shall be Solvent. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Solvent" when used with respect to any Person, means that, as of
any date of determination, (i) the Present Fair Salable Value of its assets
will, as of such date, exceed all of its liabilities, contingent or otherwise,
as 

of such date; (ii) such Person will not have, or have access to, as of such
date, an unreasonably small amount of capital for the business in which it is
engaged or will be engaged; and (iii) such Person will be able to pay its

to payment, whether or not such a right is reduced to judgment, liquidated,
unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed,

performance if such breach gives rise to a right to payment, whether or not
such equitable remedy is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed,
contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable,
secured or unsecured. "Present Fair Salable Value" means the amount that may
be realized if the aggregate assets of such Person (including goodwill) are
sold as an entirety with reasonable promptness in an arm's length transaction
under present conditions for the sale of comparable business enterprises.



Section 4.7 Proceedings. Purchaser has not received, as of the date hereof,
written notice of any Proceedings that are pending that challenge, or that may
have the effect of preventing, delaying, making illegal any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, to the Knowledge of

investigation, verification, review and analysis of the business, operations,
assets, liabilities, results of operations, financial condition, technology
and prospects of the Subject Companies, which investigation, review and
analysis was conducted by Purchaser and its Affiliates and to the extent

Representatives, in materials made available in any "data room" (virtual or
otherwise), including any cost estimates delivered or made available,
financial projections or other projections, in presentations by the management
of the Subject Companies, in "break-out" discussions, in responses to
questions submitted by or on behalf of Purchaser, its Affiliates or their
respective Representatives, whether orally or in writing, in materials
prepared by or on behalf of the Company, or in any other form (such
information, collectively, "Due Diligence Materials"), or (B) the pro-forma
financial information, projections or other forward-looking statements of the
Subject Companies, in each case in expectation or furtherance of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and



(ii)without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Sellers make no

or counsel, or that it had any sort of attorney-client relationship with any
such Persons; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed as a waiver
of any attorney-client privilege between any of the Subject Companies and any
of their Affiliates' respective Representatives or legal counsel.

Section 5.1 Access to Information Concerning Properties and Records.



(a) Sellers and the Company, after the date hereof through Closing Date,
shall, and shall cause the Subject Companies to: (i) provide, to Purchaser and
its Affiliates and Representatives access, as reasonably requested by
Purchaser, to the offices, properties, books and records of the Subject
Companies (it being understood that such access will be coordinated through
Primary Seller, and granted during regular business hours upon reasonable
advance notice in writing, and provided that any such access by Purchaser
shall not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the
Subject Companies); and (ii) furnish to Purchaser and its Affiliates and
Representatives such financial and operating data and other information
relating to the Subject Companies as such Persons may reasonably request;
provided, that, Purchaser will not have access to (A) individual performance
or evaluation records; (B) information that is subject to attorney-client
privilege or other privilege; or (C) information that, in the reasonable
opinion of Sellers or the Subject Companies, would (1) result in a breach of
confidentiality obligations to which Sellers or the Subject Companies are
bound or (2) result in a violation of applicable Laws, including Antitrust
Laws; and provided, further, (3) that such access shall not unreasonably
disrupt the operations of the Subject Companies. Sellers and the Company shall
cooperate in good faith with Purchaser to identify and implement alternative
means for Purchaser to be granted access to any employees, offices,
properties, books and records, data or information to which Purchaser are not
granted access pursuant to this Section 5.1 due to limitations under
applicable Law, attorney-client privilege or other privilege or the terms of
any confidentiality or similar agreements, including, for example and without
limitation, entering into a common interest agreement, seeking third party
consent under Contracts, establishing a process that, through the use of steps
such as targeted redactions, provision of information to counsel to review
and, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, to summarize for its client,
or use of a "clean room" environment for analysis and review of information
accessible to limited Persons (such as external advisors), will provide
Purchaser with timely access to the substance of the information described in
this Section 5.1(a) in a manner that allows the Company to comply with
Contracts and applicable Law and preserve the attorney-client or other
privilege, as the case may be. No investigation 

by Purchaser of other information received by Purchaser or its Affiliates or
Representatives shall operate as a waiver or otherwise affect any
representation, warranty or agreement given or made by the Sellers or the
Company hereunder.



(b)After the Closing Date, Sellers shall provide to Purchaser and its
Affiliates and Representatives access to the employees, offices, properties,
books and records of the Sellers to the extent relating to the Subject
Companies prior to the Closing and, upon request of Purchaser, use
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cooperate in the defense or pursuit of any
claim or action that relates to occurrences involving the Subject Companies
prior to the Closing Date. In addition, Sellers shall make available to
Purchaser the documents described in Section 3.11(i) after the Closing Date if
and as needed by Purchaser or its Affiliates in connection with any inquiry,
investigation, request or Proceeding by any Governmental Entity.



Section 5.2 Confidentiality.



(a) Information obtained by Purchaser and its Representatives in connection

provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement by and between the Company and
Purchaser, dated August 1, 2012, as amended (the "Confidentiality Agreement").



(b)Each Seller and the Company acknowledges that it is in possession of
Confidential Material. Each Seller and the Company shall, and shall cause its
respective shareholders to, treat confidentially and not disclose all or any
portion of such Confidential Material and will use such Confidential Material
solely for the purpose of consummating the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and for no other purpose. Each Seller and the Company acknowledges
and agrees that such Confidential Material is proprietary and confidential in
nature and may be disclosed to its Representatives only to the extent
necessary for such Seller to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. If any Seller, the Company or any of their respective shareholders
is requested or required to disclose (after such Person has used its
Commercially Reasonable Efforts (litigation excepted) to avoid such disclosure
and, to the extent not prohibited by Law, after promptly advising and
consulting with Purchaser about such Seller's intention to make, and the
proposed contents of, such disclosure) any of the Confidential Material
(whether by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil
investigative demand or similar process), to the extent not prohibited by Law,
Sellers shall provide Purchaser with prompt notice of such request so that
Purchaser may seek an appropriate protective order or other appropriate
remedy. At any time that such protective order or remedy has not been
obtained, such Seller, the Company or such shareholder, as applicable, may
disclose only that portion of the Confidential Material which such Person's
counsel advises is legally required to disclose or of which disclosure is
required to avoid sanction for contempt or any similar sanction, and such
Seller, the Company and/or such shareholder shall exercise its Commercially
Reasonable Efforts (excluding litigation), at Purchaser's sole cost, to obtain
assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to such Confidential
Material so disclosed.



(c)Without limiting the foregoing, in the event and to the extent any of
Purchaser, any of its Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives
provides to Sellers, the Company, any Subject Company or any of their
respective Affiliates or Representatives any confidential or proprietary
information concerning Purchaser or its Affiliates, including their assets,
liabilities, business or operations, in whatever form, whether written or
oral, and whether furnished before or after the date of this Agreement
("Purchaser Confidential Information"), each of the Sellers and the Company

for any purpose or disclose it to any Person.

Schedule are those which are related to events or circumstances that occurred
after the date of this Agreement, and (ii) the Update Schedule shall not be
given effect for purposes of, and shall not limit or otherwise affect, the

comments; and (iv) not agree to participate in any substantive meeting or
discussion with any such Antitrust Authority in respect of any filing,
investigation or inquiry concerning this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby unless, to the extent reasonably practicable, it consults
with the other Party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Antitrust
Authority, gives the other Party the opportunity to attend. Purchaser shall
furnish Primary Seller with copies (redacted in Purchaser's discretion to
preserve Purchaser Confidential Information, but in the understanding,
however, that Sellers' external counsel shall receive non-redacted versions of
any of such information, subject to protection of any attorney-client
privilege or other privilege and to the extent permitted by applicable Law) of
all correspondence, filings and formal or informal written communications
between them and their Affiliates and their respective Representatives on one
hand and any such Antitrust Authority or its respective staff on the other
hand, with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.



(c)Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, acquire or
agree to acquire, by merging with or into or consolidating with, or by
purchasing a substantial portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any
other manner, any business or any corporation, partnership, association or
other business organization or division thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree
to acquire any assets, if the entering into of a definitive agreement relating
to, or the consummation of such acquisition, merger or consolidation could

increase the risk of not obtaining, any consents of any Governmental Entity
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or the expiration
or termination of any applicable waiting period; (ii) in any way increase the
risk of any Governmental Entity entering an Order prohibiting or conditioning
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; (iii) in any way

business (or portion thereof) of Purchaser, Purchaser's Subsidiaries or
Affiliates, or of the Subject Companies or their Affiliates; (ii) conduct,

Section 5.9; or (vi) take any other action that would, or would reasonably be
expected to, materially and adversely affect Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates (including after the Closing 

Date, the Subject Companies). Purchaser shall have the sole and exclusive
right to determine, at its option, whether to contest through litigation on
the merits, negotiation or other action any position or claim, including any
demands for sale, divestiture or disposition of assets or business of
Purchaser or its Affiliates or, effective as of the Closing Date, the Subject
Companies or their respective Affiliates, asserted by any Antitrust
Authorities or other Governmental Entity in connection with Antitrust Laws
which would operate to hinder or delay the Closing.



Section 5.10 Preservation of Records. For a period of seven (7) years after
the Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause the Subject Companies to preserve and
retain all corporate, accounting, tax, legal, auditing, human resources and
other books and records of the Subject Companies (including (i) any documents
relating to any governmental or non-governmental claims, actions, suits,
proceedings or investigations; and (ii) all Tax Returns, schedules, work
papers and other material records or other documents relating to Taxes)

Companies prior to the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, during

dispose of any such books and records which are offered to, but not accepted
by, Primary Seller. Notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, the
obligations of Purchaser contained in this Section 5.10 shall be binding upon
the successors and assigns of Purchaser. In the event Purchaser, or any of
their respective successors or assigns, (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person; or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties
or assets to any Person, then, and in each case, proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of Purchaser, as the case may be,
honor the indemnification and other obligations set forth in this Section
5.10.



Section 5.11 Non-Competition; Non-Interference. In consideration of the

connected in any manner with, any business of the type and character engaged
in and competitive with that conducted by the Subject Companies within the two
(2) years prior to the Closing Date (any such business, a "Competing
Business"). For these purposes, (A) ownership of securities of four percent
(4%) or less of any class of securities of a publicly traded company shall not
be considered to be competition to the extent such investment is merely of a
passive nature and no rights to designate board members or officers in the
company are granted to the Sellers or such Person pursuant to that investment,
and (B) the resale, in Central America, other than Guatemala, by
concessionaries, distributors or other Persons, through license or other
permission from the Subject Companies, of Comex branded products purchased by
such Persons from the Subject Companies, shall not be considered to be
competition;

the Sellers or any of the Subject Companies have made a presentation, or with
which the Sellers or any of the Subject Companies have had discussions, not to
purchase products sold or otherwise commercialized by any of the Subject
Companies; or



(iii)solicit for Sellers or any Person other than the Purchaser or any of the
Subject Companies the business of any Person which is a customer or client of
the Sellers or any of the Subject Companies, or was their customer or client
within one (1) year prior to the date of this Agreement or in any way
interfere with the relationship between the Purchaser or any of the Subject
Companies 

and any such Person or business relationship (including making any negative or
disparaging statements or communications about the Purchaser or any of the
Subject Companies).



Section 5.12 Non-Solicitation of Employees. From and after the date of this
Agreement, no Seller nor any Person set forth in Section 5.12 of the Sellers

officers listed in Exhibit D hereto ("Comex Senior Management Team").

(a)Each Seller, in each case on behalf of itself and its successors and
assigns, and all shareholders of the Sellers and all Persons claiming by,
though, or under any of them, jointly and severally (each, a "Related
Person"), hereby fully and irrevocably releases, acquits and forever
discharges Purchaser and the Subject Companies and each of their respective
past, present and future officers, directors, shareholders, managing
directors, representatives, employees, principals, agents, Affiliates,
Subsidiaries (direct and indirect), joint ventures, predecessors, successors
and assigns (collectively, the "Released Parties"), from any and all losses,
claims, demands, rights, encumbrances, contracts (other than, if applicable,
employment contracts), covenants or proceedings, of whatever kind or nature in
Law, equity or otherwise, whether known or unknown, and whether or not
concealed or hidden, all of which such Seller or any Related Person now owns
or holds or has at any time owned or held or may hereafter own or hold against
any Released Party at any time related to any matter occurring on or prior to
the Closing Date, relating to the business, affairs, governance or management
of any Subject Company, except for (i) rights and claims arising under this
Agreement, (ii) rights directly arising from such Person's employment with any
of the Subject Companies, including rights to unpaid salary, wages, health and
welfare benefits, expense reimbursement consistent with company policies and
rights under any employment agreement, (iii) rights to indemnification, if
any, under the organizational documents of the Subject Companies, and (iv)
rights and claims arising under any existing contractual relationship.



(b)Each Seller hereby irrevocably covenants to refrain from, directly or
indirectly, asserting any claim or demand, or commencing, instituting or
causing to be commenced, any proceeding of any kind against the Released
Parties, based upon any matter released hereby.



Section 5.15 Transaction Expenses. Purchaser and Sellers shall bear their own
respective costs and expenses, including fees and disbursements of attorneys,
accountants, brokers, financial and other advisors and service providers,
travel and entertainment expenses, and meeting and presentation expenses,
incurred or to be incurred in connection with the negotiation, preparation and
execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and the Closing. Sellers shall pay all Company Transaction
Expenses.

and after the date of this Agreement may continue conducting, in their
discretion and at their own cost, Phase I environmental investigations at the
Subject Companies' facilities identified on Annex B. At Purchaser's discretion
and also at Purchaser's own cost, Purchaser and its Affiliates and
Representatives also may conduct Phase II environmental investigations. In
such case, Purchaser shall deliver to Sellers a proposed Phase II 

work schedule for all facilities and a proposed scope of work for each
facility for Sellers' approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned. Purchaser shall use its Commercially Reasonable
Efforts to complete such investigations on or before October 15, 2014. Sellers
shall use their Commercially Reasonable Efforts to assist Purchaser in
completing such investigations on or before October 15, 2014.



(b)Purchaser and its Affiliates and Representatives shall have the right to
take soil, sediment and groundwater samples, and take other investigative
measures, including the installation of groundwater monitoring wells, at such
facilities. The investigations shall be performed in a safe and workmanlike
manner, pursuant to generally accepted standards, practices and procedures for
the performance of similar activities in the industry. Purchaser or their
Representatives will obtain all Permits required by applicable Laws and will
otherwise comply with all applicable Laws in the performance of the
investigations. At Purchaser's request, Sellers shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to assist Purchaser in its efforts to obtain such Permits.
Purchaser and their Representatives will use Commercially Reasonable Efforts
to ensure that the investigation activities do not unreasonably interfere with
the Subject Companies' operations at such facilities.



(c)Sellers and the Company shall, and shall cause the Subject Companies to,
(i) grant reasonable access to such facilities to conduct the investigation
activities described in this Section 5.16; (ii) provide commercially
reasonable cooperation to Purchaser and its Affiliates and Representatives in
the performance of such investigation activities; and (iii) inform Purchaser
and their Representatives of the location of all underground utilities and

final data prepared by Purchaser's Representatives with respect to the
investigations described in this Section 5.16.



(e)Purchaser shall promptly notify Sellers of any Environmental Matter
discovered during the investigation activities that requires, or is reasonably
likely to require, the Subject Company to notify or disclose the Environmental
Matter to a Governmental Entity. If, in the opinion of Sellers' or the Subject
Company's legal counsel, such Environmental Matter is required to be noticed
or disclosed to a Governmental Entity, Sellers shall, or cause the Subject
Company to, prior to the Closing, promptly notify or disclose such
Environmental Matter to the appropriate Governmental Entity in accordance with
applicable Law.

(f)Upon completion of the investigation activities contemplated in this
Section 5.16, if the aggregate maximum potential Environmental Liabilities, in
the opinion of Purchaser provided on a basis consistent with normal industry
practice and standards in the environmental consulting industry in the market
in which the relevant Subject Company's facility is located, exceeds
$18,000,000, then the Indemnification Escrow Amount shall be increased by an
amount equal to the amount by which the aggregate maximum potential
Environmental Liabilities exceeds $18,000,000.



Section 5.17 Inventory. Sellers and the Company shall perform or cause to be
performed prior to the Closing an inventory count of the Subject Companies in
accordance with the Subject Companies' biannual inventory count procedures,
and Purchaser and its Representatives shall be entitled to attend and observe
such count. The Parties will agree upon a mutually acceptable weekend for such
inventory count and will cooperate to limit any impact on the Subject
Companies, provided that such count will occur no more than fifteen (15) days
prior to the Closing Date.

Sellers shall not be liable for any claim for indemnification pursuant to
Section 8.2(i) unless and until the aggregate amount of Losses which may be
recovered from Sellers equals or exceeds $2,000,000 (the "Deductible"), in

resulting therefrom, the terms "material", "materiality", "Material Adverse
Effect" or similar qualifications contained in such representations and
warranties shall be disregarded.



(d)All of the funds in the Indemnity Escrow Fund from time to time shall be
available to satisfy indemnity claims made by Purchaser Indemnitees under this

attributable to a particular Seller.



(e)The rights of the Parties to indemnification or other remedies under this
Agreement, including with respect to any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement, shall not be affected or waived in any manner by reason of any
disclosure by or to, investigation by or awareness or knowledge of any
Indemnified Party, or by reason of the fact that any Indemnified Party knew or
should have known at any time that the relevant representation or warranty was
or could have been inaccurate or that the relevant covenant or agreement had
been breached; provided that for the avoidance of doubt, the Sellers
Disclosure Letter shall be given effect for purposes of determining whether
there has been an inaccuracy in, misrepresentation of or breach of, any
applicable representation or warranty contained in this Agreement.

reserve or accrual, when compared to the corresponding reserve or accrual in
the Target Working Capital, results in a reduction of the Closing Purchase
Price or the Final Purchase Price under the provisions of Section 2.2 or
Section 2.3 of this Agreement, respectively; (ii) any amounts recovered by the
Indemnified Party pursuant to any indemnification by or indemnification
agreement with any third party; or (iii) any insurance proceeds or other cash
receipts or sources of reimbursement received as an offset against such Loss
(each source of recovery referred to in clauses (ii) and (iii), a "Collateral
Source"). Indemnification under this Article VIII shall not be available
unless the Indemnified Party uses Commercially Reasonable Efforts (litigation
excepted) to seek recovery from all Collateral Sources. The Indemnifying Party
may require an Indemnified Party to assign the rights to seek recovery under
insurance pursuant to the preceding sentence to the extent such assignment is
permitted by the relevant insurance policy; provided, however, that the
Indemnifying Party will then be responsible for pursuing such claim at its own
expense. If the amount to be netted hereunder in connection with a Collateral
Source from any payment required under Section 8.2 or Section 8.3 is received
after payment by the Indemnifying Party of any amount otherwise required to be
paid to an Indemnified Party to this Article VIII, the Indemnified Party shall
repay to the Indemnifying Party, promptly after such determination, any amount
that the Indemnifying Party would not have had to pay pursuant to this Article
VIII had such receipt been made at the time of such payment (or in the case
where the Indemnified Party is a Purchaser Indemnitee, the Indemnified Party
shall promptly deposit such amount with the escrow agent pursuant to the
Escrow Agreement, such amount to be held pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and shall become part of the
Indemnification Escrow Fund thereunder).



(b)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Sellers shall not be liable for any Losses that result from, arise out of, or
relate to breaches of the representations and warranties contained in Section
3.20 or the indemnification obligation contained in Section 8.2(iii) to the
extent such Losses result from, arise out of, or relate to:



(i)any change in any Environmental Law on or after the Closing Date;



(ii)any voluntary disclosure to any Governmental Entity on or after the
Closing Date by or on behalf of the Purchaser Indemnitees, except to the
extent such voluntary disclosure is made in connection with a Person's
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to mitigate or otherwise limit or reduce
Losses;



(iii)any investigation actions for purposes of risk assessment, and any
corrective, removal or remedial actions or other measures taken in response to
or to investigate, correct, remedy or bring into compliance any environmental
conditions involving or relating to a Subject Company ("Corrective Actions")
initiated after the Closing Date to the extent they (A) exceed the minimum
Corrective Actions reasonably necessary to comply with or avoid Liability
under any Environmental Law or (B) are substantially more costly than the most
cost-effective means that are reasonably necessary to achieve compliance with
any Environmental Law (including the use of reasonable and customary deed
restrictions or other reasonable and customary regulatory controls where
applicable).



(c)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, with
respect to any indemnification claim made for a breach of the representations
and warranties provided in Section 

3.20 or the indemnification obligation contained in Section 8.2(iii),
Purchaser shall conduct and control any Corrective Actions required to satisfy
the indemnification obligations thereunder.



(d)Purchaser acknowledges that its and the Purchaser Indemnitees' sole and
exclusive remedy against Sellers, their Affiliates or any of their officers,
directors, employees, agents or partners ("Seller-Related Persons") for any
Losses relating to Environmental Liabilities is under Section 8.2 (as limited
by this Section 8.5) of this Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing, from
and after the Closing Date, except for any Losses for which Sellers are
obligated to indemnify Purchaser Indemnitees pursuant to Section 8.2 (as
limited by this Section 8.5) (i) Purchaser hereby releases, on its own behalf
(and agrees that its Affiliates, successors and assigns, officers, directors,
employees and Representatives shall be accordingly limited), to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law, all Seller-Related Persons from any
Environmental Liabilities incurred by the Purchaser Indemnitees; and (ii)
Purchaser hereby waives, on its own behalf (and agrees that its Affiliates,
successors and assigns, officers, directors, employees and Representatives
hereunder shall be accordingly limited), to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, any claim or remedy for Environmental Liabilities against any
Seller-Related Person now or hereafter available under any applicable
Environmental Law, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation, and Liability Act or similar international, foreign, federal, or
regional Law, whether or not in existence on the date hereof.



(e)With respect to the Golden Parachute Obligations, Sellers shall be
obligated to bear the cost of any payments made pursuant to the Golden
Parachute Obligations by the corresponding Subject Company to any of the
Recipients, and any cost associated with medical insurance made available to
the Recipients. For such purposes, Purchaser shall notify Primary Seller in
writing, certified by an officer of Purchaser, of the termination of the labor
relationship with the Recipient and the payment and cost of the corresponding
Golden Parachute Obligation with respect to such Recipient, and the Primary
Parties shall, promptly upon receipt of such notice, instruct the escrow agent
to release, in favor of the corresponding Subject Company, the amount
corresponding to the relevant Golden Parachute Obligation from the Golden
Parachute Escrow Fund. Within three (3) Business Days following on the date
that is two (2) years after the Closing Date, the Primary Parties shall cause
the escrow agent to release any remaining balance in the Golden Parachute
Escrow Fund to Primary Seller on behalf of Sellers. The Parties hereby agree
that if any Golden Parachute Obligation is paid with funds of the Golden
Parachute Escrow Fund, neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates (including,
after the Closing Date, the Subject Companies) will enter into any labor
relationship with the corresponding Recipient for a period of twelve (12)
months commencing on the date in which the Golden Parachute Obligation was
paid to the Recipient; provided, however, that in no event shall this
provision prohibit or limit in any way the hiring of such Recipient as part of
an acquisition, merger, consolidation or similar transaction in which such
Recipient becomes an employee of Purchaser or its Affiliates.



Section 8.6 Indemnification Procedure.



(a) Any Person seeking indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2 or Section 8.3,
including any claim by a Person described in Section 8.7 (an "Indemnified
Party"), which might give rise to indemnification hereunder, shall deliver to
the Party from which indemnification is sought (the "Indemnifying Party") a
certificate (a "Claim Certificate"), which Claim Certificate shall:



(i)state that the Indemnified Party will incur liability for, or has otherwise
suffered, as the case may be, Losses for which such Indemnified Party believes
it is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement; and



(ii)to the extent known by the Indemnified Party, specify in reasonable detail
each individual item of Loss included in the amount so stated, the date such
item should be paid and the basis for any anticipated Losses; provided,
however, that in no event shall any Indemnified Party's failure to so specify
limit its rights to indemnification hereunder.



(b)In the event that the Indemnifying Party shall object to the
indemnification of an Indemnified Party in respect of any claim or claims
specified in any Claim Certificate (other than a Third Party Claim, which is
addressed in Section 8.7), the Indemnifying Party shall, within thirty (30)
days after receipt by the Indemnifying Party of such Claim Certificate,
deliver to the Indemnified Party a notice to such effect, specifying in
reasonable detail the basis for such objection. In this case, the Indemnified
Party shall be permitted to submit such dispute to arbitration as set forth in
Section 10.9.



(c)Claims for Losses specified in any Claim Certificate to which an
Indemnifying Party shall not object in writing within thirty (30) days of
receipt of such Claim Certificate (other than a Third Party Claim, which is
addressed in Section 8.7) and claims for Losses the validity and amount of
which have been finally determined in accordance with this Agreement or shall
have been settled as described in Section 8.7, are hereinafter referred to,
collectively, as "Agreed Claims". Within ten (10) Business Days of the
determination of the amount of any Agreed Claim, if the Indemnified Party is
(i) any Seller Indemnitee, Purchaser shall pay to the Indemnified Party an
amount equal to the Agreed Claim by wire transfer in immediately available
funds to the bank account or accounts designated by the Indemnified Party in a
notice to the Indemnifying Party not less than two (2) Business Days prior to
such payment, or (ii) any Purchaser Indemnitee, (A) the Primary Parties shall
execute and deliver to the escrow agent in terms of the Escrow Agreement a
joint written instruction instructing the escrow agent to pay to the
Indemnified Party an amount equal to the Agreed Claim by wire transfer in
immediately available funds to the bank account or accounts designated by
Purchaser in such joint written instruction, and (B) to the extent the amount
of the Agreed Claims exceeds the then-remaining Indemnification Escrow Funds
and such excess may be attributable to any of Sellers Indemnification
obligations other than pursuant to Section 8.2(i), then the Primary Seller on
behalf of Sellers shall pay to the Indemnified Party an amount equal to such
excess amount by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the bank
account or accounts designated by Purchaser.



Section 8.7 Third-Party Claims.



(a) If a claim by a third party is made against any Indemnified Party (a
"Third Party Claim"), and if such Indemnified Party intends to seek indemnity
with respect thereto under this Article VIII, such Indemnified Party shall
promptly notify the Indemnifying Party of such Third Party Claim; provided,
that the failure to so notify shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
obligations hereunder, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is
actually and materially prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Party shall have
three (3) Business Days after receipt of such notice to assume the conduct and
control, through counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party at the
expense of the Indemnifying Party, of the settlement or defense of such Third
Party Claim; provided, that the Indemnifying Party shall permit the
Indemnified Party to participate in such settlement or defense through counsel
chosen by such Indemnified Party; provided, that the fees and expenses of such
counsel shall be borne by such Indemnified Party, and provided, further, that
the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume control of such defense
(unless otherwise agreed by the Indemnified Party) and shall pay the fees and
expenses of counsel retained by the Indemnified Party if (i) such Third Party
Claim for indemnification relates to or arises in connection with any criminal
proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation or involves an
action brought by or on behalf of a Governmental Entity; (ii) such Third Party
Claim seeks an attachment (embargo), injunctive or equitable relief or other
non-monetary relief against the Indemnified Party; (iii) the Indemnifying
Party, in the reasonable judgment of the Indemnified Party, failed or is
failing to vigorously 

prosecute or defend such Third Party Claim (in which case the Indemnifying
Party shall surrender control to the Indemnified Party upon request of the
Indemnified Party); (iv) a conflict of interest exists or arises that
prohibits, in the reasonable judgment of the Indemnified Party, a single
counsel from representing both the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party in
connection with the defense of such Third Party Claim; (v) the defense of such
Third Party Claim by the Indemnifying Party will, in the reasonable judgment
of the Indemnified Party, have a material adverse effect on the Indemnified
Party or any business thereof; or (vi) the Indemnifying Party does not have
sufficient financial resources, in the reasonable judgment of the Indemnified
Party, to satisfy the amount of any adverse monetary judgment that is
reasonably likely to result.



(b)If the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim in
accordance with Section 8.7(a), the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
employ separate counsel in any such action or claim and to participate in the
defense of such Third Party Claim, but the fees and expenses of such counsel
shall not be at the expense of the Indemnifying Party. So long as the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, neither the
Indemnified Party nor the Indemnifying Party (except as provided in Section
8.7(d)) shall admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or
discharge, such Third Party Claim without the other party\'s prior written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Indemnified Party
shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to pay or settle any such Third
Party Claim at its own expense, provided that, in such event, the Indemnified
Party shall waive any rights to indemnity hereunder in respect of the matter
so settled without the Indemnifying Party\'s consent.



(c)If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within
three (3) Business Days after the receipt of the Indemnified Party's notice of
a Third Party Claim of indemnity hereunder that it elects to undertake the
defense thereof, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to contest, settle
or compromise the Third Party Claim but shall not thereby waive any right to
indemnity therefor pursuant to this Agreement.



(d)The Indemnifying Party shall not, except with the consent of the
Indemnified Party, enter into any settlement unless such settlement (i) is
entirely indemnifiable and paid by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this
Article VIII; (ii) includes as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the
Person or Persons asserting such Third Party Claim to all Indemnified Parties
of an unconditional release from all liability with respect to such Third
Party Claim or consent to entry of any judgment; and (iii) does not impose any
injunctive relief or other restrictions of any kind or nature on any
Indemnified Party.



(e)Each of the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall make
available to the other records relating to such Third Party Claim and shall
furnish, at the other Party's expense to the other Party and/or its counsel,
such employees of such Party as may be reasonably necessary for the
preparation of the defense of any such Third Party Claim or for testimony as
witnesses in any proceeding relating to such Third Party Claim.



Section 8.8 Sole Remedy/Waiver. The Parties hereto acknowledge and agree that
in the event that the Closing occurs, the remedies provided for in this
Agreement shall be the Parties' sole and exclusive remedy for any breach of
the representations and warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement
(except with respect to (x) any fraud and/or any intentional omission or
intentional misrepresentation, and (y) claims for injunctive or equitable
relief, specific performance or similar remedies, including pursuant to
Section 10.12). The Parties further acknowledge and agree that from and after
the Closing, Sellers shall have full Liability for all representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements of the Company under this Agreement.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, the Parties acknowledge and
agree that each Party shall be entitled to all available claims and causes of
action in respect of any fraud, intentional omission, intentional 

misrepresentation or similar claims, and claims for injunctive or equitable
relief, specific performance or similar remedies, and that each Party
expressly preserves all elements of any such claim, including reliance.



Section 8.9 Release of Funds from the Indemnification Escrow Fund. Funds from
the Indemnification Escrow Fund will be released from time to time in
accordance with this Section 8.9:



(i)on the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing Date, Purchaser and
Sellers shall jointly instruct the escrow agent to disburse from the
Indemnification Escrow Fund to Sellers the funds that, as of such date,
represent the then-remaining amount of the Indemnification Escrow Fund, if
any, in excess of the sum of (i) $83,728,726.47 plus (ii) any additional
amount by which the Indemnification Escrow Fund was increased pursuant to
Section 5.16(f) (such excess amount, the "Release Amount"), with such Release
Amount to be reduced by (y) the amount, if any, which Sellers and Purchaser
have instructed the escrow agent to disburse funds from the Indemnification
Escrow Fund but which have not actually been disbursed as of such date, and
(z) the amount of any claim submitted by any Purchaser Indemnitee prior to
such date, in accordance with this Article VIII that remains pending as of
such date; and



(ii)on the ninetieth (90th) day after the fifth (5th) anniversary of the
Closing Date, Purchaser and Sellers shall jointly instruct the escrow agent to
disburse from the Escrow Fund to each Seller its respective share of the then-
remaining funds in the Indemnification Escrow Fund, with such Indemnification
Escrow Fund to be reduced by (A) the amount, if any, which Sellers and
Purchaser have instructed the escrow agent to disburse funds from the
Indemnification Escrow Fund but which have not actually been disbursed as of
such date, and (B) the amount of any claim submitted by any Purchaser
Indemnitee prior to such date in accordance with this Article VIII that
remains pending as of such date.





Article IX



TAX MATTERS



Section 9.1 Tax Returns Due After the Closing Date.



(a) Full Year 2013 and Short Period 2014 Tax Returns.



(i)With respect to Tax Returns for the Subject Companies for all periods
ending on or prior to the Closing Date which are due to be filed after the
Closing Date, including the Subject Companies' Tax Return for the 2013
accounting year (if not filed before the Closing Date) (the "Pre-Closing
Returns") and Tax Returns for the period from January 1, 2014 to the Closing
Date (the "Short Period", with the Tax Returns for the Short Period being
collectively referred to as the "Short Period Returns"), the Company shall
engage an outside accounting firm, to be selected by the Primary Seller, which
firm shall prepare the Pre-Closing Returns and the Short Period Returns of the
Subject Companies (at the Company's expense) in a manner consistent with prior
period practices of the Subject Companies and under the overall direction and
control of the Primary Seller.



(ii)At least forty-five (45) days prior to the deadline for filing any Pre-
Closing Return or Short Period Return, Primary Seller or said accounting firm
shall provide drafts of such Tax Returns and complete access to all
information relied upon as support for such Tax Returns, including transfer
pricing documentation, to Purchaser for its review. Purchaser shall advise
Primary Seller of any 

disagreement with items shown on such draft Tax Returns within twenty (20)
Business Days after Purchaser's receipt of such copies.



(iii)If Purchaser advises Primary Seller of its disagreement with any items on
Primary Seller's proposed 2013 Return or Short Period Return, Purchaser and
Primary Seller shall cooperate to resolve any such disagreement as promptly as
practicable.



(iv)If Purchaser does not disagree with Primary Seller's draft Tax Returns, or
if Purchaser and Primary Seller are able to resolve any such disagreements
prior to the due date for such Tax Returns, then the agreed upon Tax Returns
shall be filed on or prior to the due dates therefor. If Purchaser and Primary
Seller are unable to resolve any disagreement with respect to any such Tax
Return prior to the due date therefor, then Primary Seller's proposed Tax
Return(s) in dispute will be filed, as prepared, with the appropriate Tax
authority on or before the due date and such disagreement shall be resolved in
accordance with Section 9.1(a)(v) below. Purchaser shall have an appropriate
officer of the applicable Subject Company sign such Tax Returns to be filed
pursuant to this Section 9.1(a)(iv) and shall cause the applicable Subject
Company to timely file such Tax Returns. With respect to any Tax to be paid
pursuant to any Pre-Closing Return or Short Period Return, Sellers shall
promptly pay to Purchaser (or be paid by Purchaser, if a credit) the full
amount of such Tax (net of any amount of such Tax included in the Closing
Accrued Income Tax Liability).



(v)In respect of any disagreement over a draft Pre-Closing Return or Short
Period Return that cannot be resolved by Purchaser and Primary Seller prior to
the due date for such Tax Return, the disagreement shall be referred to a
nationally recognized independent accounting firm recognized by the Instituto
Mexicano de Contadores Publicos, A.C. (or any other accounting professional
association of any other relevant jurisdiction concerning non-Mexican income
taxes) chosen by and mutually acceptable to both Purchaser and Primary Seller,
which firm shall decide the matter within thirty (30) days after it is
submitted to them. The fees of such accounting firm shall be divided equally
between the Purchaser and Sellers. The decision of such independent accounting
firm shall be final and binding upon the Parties absent fraud or gross
negligence. In the event the decision of such accounting firm includes filing
an amended Tax Return for a pre-Closing period and/or the Short Period, the
Sellers shall be responsible for filing all such amended Tax Returns, and
Sellers shall be responsible for the payment, if any, of any additional Tax
(including inflation adjustments, penalties and interest thereon) due and
payable pursuant to such amended Tax Return, and Sellers shall be entitled to
any overpayment of Tax pursuant to such amended Tax Return. Once prepared,
Purchaser shall have an appropriate officer of the applicable Subject Company
sign such amended Tax Returns prepared pursuant to this Section 9.1(a)(v) and
shall cause the applicable Subject Company to timely file such amended Tax
Returns. With respect to any Tax covered by this Section 9.1, (A) to the
extent such Tax is owed, Sellers shall promptly pay to Purchaser the amount of
such Tax (net of any amount of such Tax included in the Closing Accrued Income
Tax Liability), and (B) to the extent such Tax is a refund, Purchaser shall
promptly pay to Primary Seller (on behalf of Sellers) the amount of such Tax
refund (net of any amount of such Tax refund included in the Closing Accrued
Income Tax Liability).



(vi)Purchaser shall not be responsible for the completeness and accuracy of
any Tax Returns filed pursuant to this Section 9.1(a) and nothing in this
Article IX shall reduce or diminish the Purchaser Indemnitees' rights to
indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2(iv).



(b)Straddle Period Taxes. In the case of any taxable period that includes (but
does not end on) the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"): 



(i)Property Taxes. Sellers shall be responsible for all real, personal and
intangible property Taxes ("Property Taxes") allocated to the portion of the
Straddle Period on and prior to the Closing Date, regardless of when such
Property Taxes become due and payable. Property Taxes allocated to the portion
of the Straddle Period on and prior to the Closing Date shall be equal to the
amount of such Property Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days that are in the
Straddle Period on and prior to the Closing Date and the denominator of which
is the total number of days in the Straddle Period. The Tax liability for any
Property Taxes allocated to periods on and prior to the Closing Date (but
payable after the Closing Date) shall be paid by Sellers to Purchaser on the
Closing Date.



(ii)2014 Income Tax Return. Sellers shall be responsible for income Tax of the
Subject Companies allocated to the pre-Closing portion of any Straddle Period
(the "Sellers' Straddle Period Income Tax"). The portion of such income Tax
allocated to the pre-Closing portion of the Straddle Period shall be equal to
the amount of the entire 2014 income Tax liability multiplied by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the number of days during the Straddle Period that
are in the period on and prior to the Closing Date and the denominator of
which is the number of days in the Straddle Period. With respect to any
Sellers' Straddle Period Income Tax, (A) to the extent such Tax is owed,
Sellers shall promptly pay to Purchaser the amount of such Tax (net of any
amount of such Tax included in the Closing Accrued Income Tax Liability), and
(B) to the extent such Tax is a refund, Purchaser shall promptly pay to
Primary Seller (on behalf of Sellers) the amount of such Tax refund (net of
any amount of such Tax refund included in the Closing Accrued Income Tax
Liability).



(iii)Purchaser shall prepare (at the Company's expense) the relevant 2014
Income Tax Returns of each of the Subject Companies. At least thirty (30) days
prior to filing such Tax Returns, Purchaser shall provide a copy of such Tax
Returns and complete access to all information relied upon as support for such
Tax Returns, including transfer pricing documentation, to Primary Seller for
its review. Primary Seller shall advise Purchaser of any disagreement with
items shown on such Tax Returns within fifteen (15) Business Days after
Primary Seller's receipt of such copy. If Primary Seller advises Purchaser of
its disagreement with any items on such Tax Returns, Purchaser and Primary
Seller shall cooperate to resolve any such disagreement as promptly as
practicable. If Purchaser and Primary Seller are unable to resolve any such
disagreement by the due date of such Tax Returns, the disputed Tax Returns
will be filed, as prepared, with the appropriate Tax authority on or before
the due date and such disagreement shall be referred to a nationally
recognized independent accounting firm recognized by the Instituto Mexicano de
Contadores Publicos, A.C. (or any other accounting professional association of
any other relevant jurisdiction concerning non-Mexican income taxes) chosen by
and mutually acceptable to both Purchaser and Primary Seller, which firm shall
decide the matter within thirty (30) days after it is submitted to them. The
fees of such accounting firm shall be divided equally between the Purchaser
and Sellers. The decision of such accounting firm shall be final and binding
upon all Parties absent fraud or gross negligence.



(c)Audit - Sales and Use Taxes and VAT. In the event that an audit relating to
sales and use or value added Taxes of a Subject Company includes both
pre‑Closing and post‑Closing periods, Primary Seller and Purchaser will use
their respective Commercially Reasonable Efforts to direct the tax auditor to
calculate any pre‑Closing assessment based exclusively on pre‑Closing
transactions and/or statistical samples and any post‑Closing assessment based
exclusively on post‑Closing transactions and/or statistical samples.
Notwithstanding Primary Seller's and Purchaser's efforts pursuant to the
preceding sentence, Sellers shall be liable for any assessment, Liability or
other amounts determined to be due with respect to periods 

or transactions on or prior to the Closing Date and Purchaser shall be liable
for any assessment, Liability or other amounts determined to be due with
respect to periods or transactions following the Closing Date.



Section 9.2 Tax Refunds. Sellers shall be entitled to any refund of any Taxes
of any of the Subject Companies which relate to Tax periods or portions
thereof ending on or before the Closing Date. Purchaser shall pay to Sellers
any such refund (net of any Taxes of Purchaser or any Subject Company and net
of any Tax refunds included in the Closing Accrued Income Tax Liability)
within fifteen (15) days after the receipt thereof. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein, Purchaser shall have no obligation to reimburse
Sellers for any Tax attributes, net operating losses or the like.



Section 9.3 Cooperation on Tax Matters.



(a) Purchaser, the Subject Companies and Sellers shall cooperate fully, as and
to the extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the
filing of Tax Returns pursuant to Section 9.1 and any audit, litigation or
other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the other Party's request) the provision of records and
information that are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or
other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis
to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. Purchaser and Sellers each shall cause the Subject Companies: (i)
to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the
Subject Companies and their subsidiaries relating to any taxable period
beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by Purchaser or Sellers,
any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any taxing authority; and (ii)
to give Purchaser and Sellers reasonable written notice prior to transferring,
destroying or discarding any such books and records and, to the extent
requested by Purchaser or Sellers, as the case may be, to allow any such
requesting party to take possession of such books and records.



(b)Purchaser and Sellers further agree, upon request, to use their best
efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any Governmental
Entity or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or
eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including, but not limited to, with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby).



Section 9.4 Amended Returns and Retroactive Elections. Purchaser shall not,
and shall not cause or permit the Subject Companies or any of their
Subsidiaries to (i) amend any Tax Returns filed with respect to any tax year
ending on or before the Closing Date or with respect to any Straddle Period;
or (ii) make any Tax election that has retroactive effect to any such year or
to any Straddle Period, in each such case without the prior written consent of
the Sellers, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any other right.

successors (causahabientes) and assigns (cesionarios). Except with respect to
Article VIII of this Agreement, which shall inure to the benefit of each
Purchaser Indemnitee and Seller Indemnitee, all of whom are intended as
express third-party beneficiaries thereof, no other Person not party to this
Agreement shall be entitled to the benefits of this Agreement. Neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be
assigned by any of the Parties without the prior written consent of the other
Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties acknowledge and agree that
Purchaser shall be entitled to designate the Purchaser Designees to acquire

relieve Purchaser of its obligations and liabilities under this Agreement.

except by a written instrument executed by all Parties to this Agreement.



Section 10.7 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in several
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, and all of
which together shall be deemed to be one and the same instrument. Signed
counterparts of this Agreement may be delivered by facsimile and by scanned
.pdf image.



Section 10.8 Applicable Law. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE LEGAL RELATIONS BETWEEN
THE PARTIES HERETO SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
LAWS OF THE UNITED MEXICAN STATES, WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICT OF LAWS
RULES THEREOF.



Section 10.9 Arbitration.



(a) Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of, relating to or in
connection with this Agreement, including any question regarding its
existence, validity or termination, or regarding a breach of this Agreement,
shall be referred to and settled by arbitration under and in accordance with
the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (the "ICC
Rules"). The Parties acknowledge and agree that the arbitrators may award
specific performance, injunctive or equitable relief in accordance with the
ICC Rules.

(b) The arbitration proceeding will take place in Dallas, Texas, U.S., and
will be conducted in the English language. The arbitration panel will consist
of three (3) arbitrators appointed pursuant to the ICC Rules; provided,
however, that the Primary Parties shall have thirty (30) days from the
confirmation of the second arbitrator to agree upon the third arbitrator who
shall act as president. Failing such agreement, the third arbitrator shall be
appointed by the International Chamber of Commerce.



Section 10.10 Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
contained in this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other authority to be invalid, void, unenforceable or against its regulatory
policy, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions
contained in this Agreement shall remain valid and binding and shall in no way
be affected, impaired or invalidated, and this Agreement shall be reformed,
construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as if such invalid, illegal or
unenforceable term, provision, covenant or restriction or any portion thereof
had never been contained herein.



Section 10.11 Article 1949 of the Federal Civil Code. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, the Parties hereby recognize and
acknowledge that in the event of any breach of any of the Parties' obligations
herein, the non-defaulting party shall be allowed to proceed in terms of
Article 1949 of the Federal Civil Code of Mexico (Codigo Civil Federal).



Section 10.12 Specific Enforcement. The Parties agree that irreparable damage
may occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached
or threatened to be breached and that an award of money damages may be
incalculable and/or inadequate in such event. Accordingly, notwithstanding the
provisions of Section 10.9, and without limiting the rights of the Parties to
refer a matter to arbitration in accordance with Section 10.9, it is
acknowledged that in addition to any other remedy to which the Parties may be
entitled at law, the Parties shall be entitled to request from the arbitrators
or any court of competent jurisdiction an Order for specific performance to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement. Each Party further agrees that neither the other
Party nor any other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any
bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining
any remedy referred to in this Section 10.12, and each Party hereto
irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing
or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.



Section 10.13 Rules of Construction. The Parties hereto agree that they have
been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement and have participated jointly in the drafting of this Agreement and,
therefore, waive the application of any Law, holding or rule of construction
providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be construed
against the Party drafting such agreement or document.
