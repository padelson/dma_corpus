the Effective Time are unvested or are subject to a repurchase option, risk
of forfeiture or other condition under any applicable restricted stock
purchase agreement or other agreement with Compaq, then the shares of HP
Common Stock issued in exchange for such shares of Compaq Common Stock will
also be unvested and subject to the same repurchase option, risk of
forfeiture or other condition, and the certificates representing such shares
of HP Common Stock may accordingly be marked with appropriate legends. Compaq
shall take all action that may be necessary to ensure that, from and after
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation is entitled to exercise
any such repurchase option or other right set forth in any such restricted
stock purchase agreement or other agreement.   (c) CANCELLATION OF TREASURY

fractional shares of HP Common Stock that otherwise would be received by such
holder) shall, upon surrender of such holder\'s Certificate(s) (as defined in
Section 1.7(c)), receive from HP an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest
whole cent), without interest, equal to the product of: (i) such fraction,
multiplied by (ii) the average closing price of one share of HP Common Stock

ending on the trading day one day prior to the Effective Time, as reported on

accordance with this Article I, the shares of HP Common Stock issuable
pursuant to Section 1.6(a) in exchange for outstanding shares of Compaq
Common Stock. In addition, HP shall make available as necessary from time to
time after the Effective Time as needed, cash in an amount sufficient for
payment in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and any
dividends or distributions which holders of shares of Compaq Common Stock may
be entitled pursuant to Section 1.7(d). Any cash    -5-   and HP Common
Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as
the "EXCHANGE FUND."   (c) EXCHANGE PROCEDURES. Promptly after the Effective
Time, HP shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record (as
of the Effective Time) of a certificate or certificates (the "CERTIFICATES")
which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares
of Compaq Common Stock whose shares were converted into the right to receive
shares of HP Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.6(a), cash in lieu of any
fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or other
distributions pursuant to Section 1.7(d): (i) a letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as HP
may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing whole
shares of HP Common Stock, cash in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to
Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section
1.7(d). Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent
or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by HP, together with
such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance
with the instructions thereto and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificates shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the number of whole shares of HP
Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates surrendered by such
holder) to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.6(a) (which
shall be in uncertificated book entry form unless a physical certificate is
requested or is otherwise required by applicable law or regulation), payment
in lieu of fractional shares which such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or distributions payable
pursuant to Section 1.7(d), and the Certificates so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates
will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes,
to evidence the ownership of the number of full shares of HP Common Stock
into which such shares of Compaq Common Stock shall have been so converted
and the right to receive an amount in cash in lieu of the issuance of any
fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or
distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.7(d).    -6-    (d)
DISTRIBUTIONS WITH RESPECT TO UNEXCHANGED SHARES. No dividends or other
distributions declared or made after the date hereof with respect to HP
Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time and no payment in
lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.6(f) will be paid to the
holders of any unsurrendered Certificates with respect to the shares of
HP Common Stock represented thereby until the holders of record of
such Certificates shall surrender such Certificates. Subject to applicable
law, following surrender of any such Certificates, the Exchange Agent shall
deliver to the record holders thereof, without interest (i) promptly after
such surrender, the number of whole shares of HP Common Stock issued in
exchange therefor along with payment in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
Section 1.6(f) and the amount of any such dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time and theretofore paid with respect
to such whole shares of HP Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment
date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable
with respect to such whole shares of HP Common Stock.   (e) TRANSFERS OF
OWNERSHIP. If shares of HP Common Stock are to be issued in a name other than
that in which the Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor are
registered, it will be a condition of the issuance thereof that the
Certificates so surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper
form for transfer and that the Persons (as defined in Section
8.3(d)) requesting such exchange will have paid to HP or any agent designated
by it any transfer or other Taxes (as defined in Section 2.6) required by
reason of the issuance of shares of HP Common Stock in any name other than
that of the registered holder of the Certificates surrendered, or established
to the satisfaction of HP or any agent designated by it that such Tax has
been paid or is not payable.   (f) REQUIRED WITHHOLDING. Each of the
Exchange Agent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to
this Agreement to any holder or former holder of Compaq Common Stock such
amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the
Code or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law or under any
other applicable Legal Requirement (as defined in Section 2.2(d)). To the
extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, the amount of such
consideration shall be treated for all    -7-   purposes under this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such consideration would
otherwise have been paid.   (g) NO LIABILITY. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Section 1.7, neither the Exchange Agent, the Surviving
Corporation nor any party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of HP
Common Stock or Compaq Common Stock for any amount properly paid to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
law.   (h) INVESTMENT OF EXCHANGE FUND. The Exchange Agent shall invest any
cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by HP on a daily
basis; PROVIDED that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the
amounts payable to Compaq stockholders pursuant to this Article I. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investment shall become a part
of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable to
Compaq stockholders pursuant to this Article I shall promptly be paid to
HP.   (i) TERMINATION OF EXCHANGE FUND. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates six (6)
months after the Effective Time shall, at the request of the Surviving
Corporation, be delivered to the Surviving Corporation or otherwise on the
instruction of the Surviving Corporation, and any holders of the Certificates
who have not surrendered such Certificates in compliance with this Section
1.7 shall after such delivery to Surviving Corporation look only to the
Surviving Corporation for the shares of HP Common Stock pursuant to Section
1.6(a), cash in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and
any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 1.7(d) with respect
to the shares of Compaq Common Stock formerly represented thereby. Any such
portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of
Compaq Common Stock immediately prior to such time as such amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity (as
defined in Section 2.3(c)) shall, to the extent permitted by law, become the
property of HP free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.   1.8 NO FURTHER OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN COMPAQ
COMMON STOCK. All shares of HP Common Stock issued upon the surrender for
exchange of shares of Compaq Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof
(including any cash paid in respect thereof pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and
1.7(d)) shall be deemed to    -8-   have been issued in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Compaq Common Stock,
and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the
Surviving Corporation of shares of Compaq Common Stock which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they
shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article I.   1.9 LOST,
STOLEN OR DESTROYED CERTIFICATES. In the event any Certificates shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such shares of HP Common
Stock, cash for fractional shares, if any, as may be required pursuant to
Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section
1.7(d); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that HP may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against HP, Compaq or
the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been
lost, stolen or destroyed.   1.10 TAX CONSEQUENCES. It is intended by the
parties hereto that the Merger shall constitute a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. The parties hereto adopt this
Agreement as a plan of reorganization within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a).   1.11 FURTHER ACTION. At
and after the Effective Time, the officers and directors of HP and the
Surviving Corporation will be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of Compaq and Merger Sub, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments
or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of Compaq and
Merger Sub, any other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of
record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title
and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets
acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in
connection with, the Merger.    -9-    ARTICLE II  REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES OF COMPAQ   Compaq represents and warrants to HP and Merger Sub,
subject to the exceptions specifically disclosed in writing in the disclosure
letter supplied by Compaq to HP dated as of the date hereof and certified by
a duly authorized officer of Compaq (the "COMPAQ DISCLOSURE LETTER"), as
follows:   2.1 ORGANIZATION; STANDING AND POWER; CHARTER DOCUMENTS;
SUBSIDIARIES.   (a) ORGANIZATION; STANDING AND POWER. Compaq and each of
its Subsidiaries (as defined below) is a corporation or other organization
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization, has the requisite
power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on
its business as now being conducted, except where the failure to be so
organized, existing and in good standing would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in Section 8.3(c)) on Compaq, and
is duly qualified and in good standing to do business in each jurisdiction in
which the nature of its business or the ownership or leasing of its
properties makes such qualification necessary other than in such
jurisdictions where the failure to so qualify or to be good standing,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Compaq. For purposes of this Agreement,
"SUBSIDIARY," when used with respect to any party, shall mean any corporation
or other organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated, at least a
majority of the securities or other interests of which having by their terms
ordinary voting power to elect a majority of the Board of Directors or others
performing similar functions with respect to such corporation or
other organization is directly or indirectly owned or controlled by such
party or by any one or more of its Subsidiaries, or by such party and one or
more of its Subsidiaries.   (b) CHARTER DOCUMENTS. Compaq has delivered or
made available to HP: (i) a true and correct copy of the Certificate of
Incorporation (including any Certificate of Designations) and Bylaws of
Compaq, each as amended to date (collectively, the "COMPAQ CHARTER
DOCUMENTS") and (ii) the certificate of incorporation and bylaws, or like
organizational documents (collectively, "SUBSIDIARY CHARTER DOCUMENTS"), of
each of its Significant    -10-   Subsidiaries (as defined in Rule 1-02
of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC")), and
each such instrument is in full force and effect. Compaq is not in violation
of any of the provisions of the Compaq Charter Documents and each Subsidiary
is not in violation of its respective Subsidiary Charter Documents, except in
the case of a Subsidiary, as would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Compaq.   (c) SUBSIDIARIES. Exhibit 21 to
Compaq\'s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2000 includes all the Subsidiaries of Compaq which are Significant
Subsidiaries. All the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other equity
interests in, each such Significant Subsidiary have been validly issued and
are fully paid and nonassessable and are, except as set forth in such Exhibit
21, owned directly or indirectly by Compaq, free and clear of all pledges,
claims, liens, charges, encumbrances, options and security interests of any
kind or nature whatsoever (collectively, "LIENS"), including any restriction
on the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock or
other ownership interests, except for restrictions imposed by applicable
securities laws.   2.2 CAPITAL STRUCTURE.   (a) CAPITAL STOCK. The
authorized capital stock of Compaq consists of: (i) 3,000,000,000 shares of
Compaq Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share and (ii) 10,000,000 shares of
preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "COMPAQ PREFERRED STOCK"),
3,000,000 of which shares have been designated as Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock, all of which will be reserved for issuance
upon exercise of preferred stock purchase rights (the "COMPAQ RIGHTS")
issuable pursuant to the rights agreement approved by the Board of Directors
of Compaq in connection with its approval of this Agreement substantially in
the form previously provided to HP (the "COMPAQ RIGHTS AGREEMENT"). At the
close of business on June 30, 2001: (i) 1,753,000,000 shares of Compaq Common
Stock were issued and outstanding, (ii) 59,000,000 shares of Compaq Common
Stock were issued and held by Compaq in its treasury, and (iii) no shares of
Compaq Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding. All of the outstanding
shares of capital stock of Compaq are, and all shares of capital stock of

consents, waivers and approvals under any of Compaq\'s or any of
its Subsidiaries\' Contracts required to be obtained in connection with
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which, if

-15-   consents, authorizations, filings, approvals and registrations which
if not obtained or made would not be material to Compaq or HP or materially
adversely affect the ability of the parties hereto to consummate the Merger
within the time frame in which the Merger would otherwise be consummated in

registration, declaration or filings. The consents, approvals, orders,
authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings set forth in (i)
through (v) are referred to herein as the "NECESSARY CONSENTS."   2.4 SEC
FILINGS; FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.   (a) SEC FILINGS. Compaq has filed all
required registration statements, prospectuses, reports, schedules, forms,
statements and other documents (including exhibits and all other information
incorporated by reference) required to be filed by it with the SEC since
January 1, 1998. Compaq has made available to HP all such registration
statements, prospectuses, reports, schedules, forms, statements and other
documents in the form filed with the SEC. All such required registration
statements, prospectuses, reports, schedules, forms, statements and other
documents (including those that Compaq may file subsequent to the date
hereof), as amended, are referred to herein as the "COMPAQ SEC REPORTS." As
of their respective dates, the Compaq SEC Reports (i) were prepared in
accordance and complied in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "SECURITIES ACT"), or the Exchange
Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder
applicable to such Compaq SEC Reports and (ii) did not at the time they were
filed contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, except to the extent corrected prior to the date hereof
by a subsequently filed Compaq SEC Report. None of Compaq\'s Subsidiaries is
required to file any forms, reports or other documents with the SEC.   (b)
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. Each of the consolidated financial statements
(including, in each case, any related notes thereto) contained in the Compaq
SEC Reports (the "COMPAQ FINANCIALS"), including each Compaq SEC Report filed
after the date hereof until the Closing: (i) complied as to form in
all material respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC
with respect thereto, (ii) was prepared in accordance with United States
generally accepted    -16-   accounting principles ("GAAP") applied on
a consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited interim financial
statements, as may be permitted by the SEC on Form 10-Q, 8-K or any successor
form under the Exchange Act), and (iii) fairly presented in all material
respects the consolidated financial position of Compaq and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results
of Compaq\'s operations and cash flows for the periods indicated. The balance
sheet of Compaq contained in the Compaq SEC Reports as of December 31, 2000
is hereinafter referred to as the "COMPAQ BALANCE SHEET." Except as disclosed
in the Compaq Financials, since the date of the Compaq Balance Sheet and
through the date hereof, neither Compaq nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
liabilities required under GAAP to be set forth on a consolidated balance
sheet (absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise) which, individually or in
the aggregate, would be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on Compaq, except for liabilities incurred since the date of the Compaq
Balance Sheet in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practices and liabilities incurred pursuant to this Agreement.   2.5 ABSENCE
OF CERTAIN CHANGES OR EVENTS. Since the date of the Compaq Balance Sheet and
through the date hereof there has not been: (i) any Material Adverse Effect
on Compaq, (ii) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend on,
or other distribution (whether in cash, stock or property) in respect of, any
of Compaq\'s or any of its Subsidiaries\' capital stock, or any purchase,
redemption or other acquisition by Compaq or any of its Subsidiaries of any
of Compaq\'s capital stock or any other securities of Compaq or
its Subsidiaries or any options, warrants, calls or rights to acquire any
such shares or other securities except for (A) repurchases from Employees
following their termination pursuant to the terms of their pre-existing stock
option or purchase agreements, or (B) the Compaq Rights Dividend, or (iii)
any split, combination or reclassification of any of Compaq\'s or any of its
Subsidiaries\' capital stock.   2.6 TAXES. For the purposes of this
Agreement, the term "TAX" or, collectively, "TAXES," shall mean any and all
federal, state, local and foreign taxes, assessments and other governmental
charges, duties, impositions and liabilities, including taxes based upon or
measured by gross receipts, income, profits, sales, use and occupation, and
value added, ad valorem, transfer, franchise, withholding, payroll,
recapture, employment, excise and property taxes, together with all interest,
penalties and additions imposed with respect to such   -17-   amounts,
and any obligations with respect to such amounts arising as a result of being
a member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group for
any period or under any agreements or arrangements with any other Person
and including any liability for taxes of a predecessor entity. Compaq and
each of its Subsidiaries have filed all material federal, state, local and
foreign returns, estimates, information statements and reports relating to
Taxes ("TAX RETURNS") required to be filed by any of them and have paid, or
have adequately reserved (in accordance with GAAP) for the payment of, all
Taxes required to be paid (whether or not shown on any Tax Returns), and the
most recent financial statements contained in the Compaq SEC Reports reflect
an adequate reserve (in accordance with GAAP) for all Taxes payable by Compaq
and its Subsidiaries through the date of such financial statements. No
material deficiencies for any Taxes have been asserted or assessed, or, to
the Knowledge (as defined in Section 8.3(b)) of Compaq, proposed, against
Compaq or any of its Subsidiaries that are not subject to adequate reserves
(in accordance with GAAP). No audit or other examination of any Tax Return of
Compaq or any of its Subsidiaries is presently in progress, nor has Compaq or
any of its Subsidiaries been notified of any request for such an audit or
other examination. Neither Compaq nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any
action or knows of any fact, agreement or plan or other circumstance that is
reasonably likely to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.   2.7 INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY.   (a) NO INFRINGEMENT. To the Knowledge as of the date hereof
of Compaq, the products, services and operations of Compaq do not infringe
or misappropriate the Intellectual Property (as defined below) of any third
party where such infringement or misappropriation, individually or in the
aggregate, would be reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on
any material division or business unit or other material operating group of
product or service offerings of Compaq or otherwise have a Material Adverse
Effect on Compaq. "INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY" shall mean any or all of the
following and all rights in, arising out of, or associated therewith: (i) all
United States, international and foreign patents and applications therefor
and all reissues, divisions, renewals, extensions, provisionals,
continuations and continuations-in-part thereof, (ii) all inventions (whether
patentable or not), invention disclosures, improvements, trade secrets,
proprietary information, know how, technology, technical data and customer
lists, and all documentation relating to any of the foregoing, (iii)

databases and data collections and all rights therein throughout the world,
(viii) all moral and economic rights of authors and inventors, however
denominated, throughout the world, and (ix) any similar or equivalent rights
to any of the foregoing anywhere in the world.   (b) NO IMPAIRMENT. The
Merger (including the assignment by operation of law of any Contract to the
Surviving Corporation) will not result in: (i) HP or any Subsidiary of HP
(other than Compaq and its Subsidiaries, but only to the extent existing
prior to the Merger) being bound by any material non-compete or other
material restriction on the operation of any business of HP or its
Subsidiaries, (ii) HP or any Subsidiary of HP (other than Compaq and
its Subsidiaries, but only to the extent existing prior to the Merger)
granting any rights or licenses to any material Intellectual Property of HP
or any Subsidiary of HP to any third party (including a covenant not to sue
with respect to any material Intellectual Property of HP or any Subsidiary of
HP), or (iii) the termination or breach of any Contract to which Compaq is a
party, which termination or breach would reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on any material division or business unit or other
material operating group of product or service offerings of the Surviving
Corporation or HP or otherwise have a Material Adverse Effect on either of
them.   2.8 COMPLIANCE; PERMITS.   (a) COMPLIANCE. Neither Compaq nor any
of its Subsidiaries is, in any material respect, in conflict with, or in
default or in violation of any Legal Requirement applicable to Compaq or any
of its Subsidiaries or by which Compaq or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective businesses or properties is, or Compaq believes is
reasonably likely to be, bound or affected, except, in each case, or in the
aggregate, for conflicts, violations and defaults that would not have a
Material Adverse Effect on Compaq. As of the date hereof, no material
investigation or review by any Governmental Entity is pending or, to the
Knowledge of Compaq, has been threatened in a writing delivered to Compaq
or     -19-    any of its Subsidiaries, against Compaq or any of its
Subsidiaries. There is no material judgment, injunction, order or decree
binding upon Compaq or any of its Subsidiaries which has or would reasonably
be expected to have the effect of prohibiting or materially impairing any
material business practice of Compaq or any of its Subsidiaries, any
acquisition of material property by Compaq or any of its Subsidiaries or the
conduct of business by Compaq and its Subsidiaries as currently
conducted.   (b) PERMITS. Compaq and its Subsidiaries hold, to the
extent legally required, all permits, licenses, variances, exemptions, orders
and approvals from Governmental Entities ("PERMITS") that are required for
the operation of the business of Compaq, as currently conducted, the failure
to hold which would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on Compaq (collectively, "COMPAQ PERMITS"). As of the date hereof, no
suspension or cancellation of any of the Compaq Permits is pending or, to the
Knowledge of Compaq, threatened. Compaq and its Subsidiaries are in
compliance in all material respects with the terms of the Compaq Permits.  
2.9 LITIGATION. As of the date hereof, there are no claims, suits, actions or
proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of Compaq, overtly
threatened against Compaq or any of its Subsidiaries, before any court,
governmental department, commission, agency, instrumentality or authority, or
any arbitrator that seeks to restrain or enjoin the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or which would reasonably be expected,
either singularly or in the aggregate with all such claims, actions or
proceedings, to be material to the Compaq.   2.10 BROKERS\' AND FINDERS\'
FEES. Except for fees payable to Salomon Smith Barney pursuant to an
engagement letter dated July 19, 2001, a copy of which has been provided to
HP, Compaq has not incurred, nor will it incur, directly or indirectly, any
liability for brokerage or finders\' fees or agents\' commissions or any
similar charges in connection with this Agreement or any
transaction contemplated hereby.   2.11 TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES.
Except as set forth in the Compaq SEC Reports, since the date of the
Compaq\'s last proxy statement filed with the SEC, no event has occurred as
of the date hereof that would be required to be reported by Compaq pursuant
to Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the    -20-   SEC
(substituting, for the purposes of this representation and warranty,
each appearance of $60,000 in Item 404 with $500,000). Section 2.11 of the
Compaq Disclosure Letter identifies each Person who is an "affiliate" (as
that term is used in Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act) of Compaq
as of the date hereof.   2.12 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.   (a) DOCUMENTS.
Section 2.12(a) of the Compaq Disclosure Letter sets forth a list of the
following: (i) all severance and employment agreements of Compaq with
directors or executive officers, (ii) all material severance programs and

of Compaq or its Subsidiaries relating to any of its current or
former employees, consultants or directors (each, an "EMPLOYEE") pursuant to

transactions contemplated hereby (whether alone or upon the occurrence of any
additional or subsequent events), (iv) each document embodying each
Retirement Plan (as defined in Section 2.12(c)) of Compaq (a "COMPAQ
RETIREMENT PLAN"), (v) each Compaq Purchase Plan, and (vi) each stock option
plan, stock award plan, stock appreciation right plan, phantom stock plan,
stock option, other equity or equity-based compensation plan, equity or other
equity based award to any Person (whether payable in cash, shares or

Employee) pursuant to which any stock, option, warrant or other right to
purchase or acquire capital stock of Compaq or right to payment based on the
value of Compaq capital stock has been granted or otherwise issued, but, in
any case excluding the Compaq Purchase Plans (collectively, "COMPAQ STOCK
OPTION PLANS"). Compaq has delivered or made available to HP for review each
of the items listed on Section 2.12(a) of the Compaq Disclosure Letter and a
current actuarial valuation and/or audited statement of assets and
liabilities for each Compaq Retirement Plan. Section 2.12(a) of the Compaq
Disclosure Letter also identifies whether each Compaq Stock Option Plan (A)
is a "broadly-based" plan, as defined in Section 312.04(h) of the NYSE Listed
Company Manual or (B) has been approved by Compaq\'s stockholders (plans
which are either "broadly-based" plans or approved by Compaq\'s stockholders
(as identified on Section 2.12(a) of the Compaq Disclosure Letter) are
referred to herein as "COMPAQ BROAD PLANS").   -21-     (b) BENEFIT PLAN
COMPLIANCE.   (i) With respect to each material collective
bargaining agreement, bonus, pension, profit sharing, deferred compensation,
incentive compensation, stock ownership, stock purchase, stock option,
phantom stock, stock-related or performance award, retirement, vacation,
severance, disability, death benefit, hospitalization, medical, loan (other
than travel allowances and relocation packages), fringe benefit, disability,
sabbatical and other plan, arrangement or understanding providing benefits to
any Employee, employment agreement, consulting agreement or severance
agreement with any current or former officer or director of Compaq or its
Subsidiaries, or any material employment agreement, consulting agreement or
severance agreement for any Employee (collectively, "BENEFIT PLANS") of
Compaq or any of its Subsidiaries ("COMPAQ BENEFIT PLANS"), no material event
has occurred and there exists no material condition or set of circumstances,
in connection with which Compaq or any of its Subsidiaries would be subject
to any material liability under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), the Code or any other applicable Legal
Requirement.   (ii) Each Compaq Benefit Plan has been, in all
material respects, administered and operated in accordance with its terms,
with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and all other applicable
material Legal Requirements and the terms of all applicable collective
bargaining agreements. Each Compaq Benefit Plan, including any material
amendments thereto, that is capable of approval by, and/or registration for
and/or qualification for special tax status with, the appropriate taxation,
social security and/or supervisory authorities in the relevant country,
state, territory or the like (each, an "APPROVAL") has received such Approval
or there remains a period of time in which to obtain such Approval
retroactive to the date of any material amendment that has not previously
received such Approval.   (iii) To the Knowledge of Compaq, no material oral
or written representation or commitment with respect to any material aspect
of any Compaq Benefit Plan has been made to an Employee of Compaq or any of
its Subsidiaries by an authorized Compaq Employee that is not materially
in accordance with the written or otherwise preexisting terms and provisions
of such Compaq Benefit Plans. To the Knowledge of Compaq, neither Compaq nor
any of its Subsidiaries has entered into any agreement, arrangement or
understanding,    -22-   whether written or oral, with any trade union,
works council or other Employee representative body or any material number or
category of its Employees which would prevent, restrict or materially impede
the implementation of any lay-off, redundancy, severance or similar program
within its or their respective workforces (or any part of them).   (iv)
There are no material unresolved claims or disputes under the terms of, or in
connection with, any Compaq Benefit Plan (other than routine undisputed
claims for benefits), and no action, legal or otherwise, has been commenced
with respect to any material claim.   (c) RETIREMENT PLAN FUNDING. The
latest actuarial valuation of each Funded Retirement Plan (as defined below)
of Compaq or its Subsidiaries discloses that, as of the effective date of the
valuation, the aggregate value of the assets of such Funded Retirement Plan
is equal to or greater than the aggregate value of its liabilities assessed
on an ongoing and terminated basis and calculated in accordance with the
actuarial methods and assumptions used in such valuation pursuant to such
Funded Retirement Plan and applicable Legal Requirements and GAAP. In respect
of each Retirement Plan of Compaq or its Subsidiaries that is not a Funded
Retirement Plan, Compaq or its Subsidiaries have made adequate provision for
accrued liabilities in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements. For
purposes of this Agreement, "RETIREMENT PLAN" shall mean a material
arrangement for the provision of Retirement Benefit Rights (as defined below)
to Employees (and, if applicable, beneficiaries thereof). For purposes of
this Agreement, "RETIREMENT BENEFIT RIGHTS" shall mean, with respect to an
entity, any pension, lump sum, gratuity, or a like benefit provided
or generally intended to be provided on retirement or on death in respect of
an Employee\'s relationship as a service provider to an entity or its
Subsidiaries. Material post-retirement health benefits and any other self-
insured health benefit arrangements are deemed to be "Retirement Benefit
Rights." Material deferred compensation payments required to be made to an
Employee in respect of the termination of employment are also deemed to be
"Retirement Benefit Rights." "FUNDED RETIREMENT PLAN" means, with respect to
party, a Retirement Plan under which the assets to satisfy the benefit
obligations are legally segregated from the general assets of such party or
its Subsidiaries and are not subject to the creditors of such party or its
Subsidiaries.    -23-    (d) MULTIPLE EMPLOYER AND MULTIEMPLOYER PLANS.
At no time has Compaq or any other person or entity under common control
within the meaning of Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code (a
"CONTROLLED GROUP AFFILIATE") with Compaq participated in and/or been
obligated to contribute to any Compaq Benefit Plan in which any persons which
are not or were not at the relevant time, Controlled Group Affiliates of
Compaq and/or their Employees, have participated. No Compaq Benefit Plan is a
"multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA.   (e)
CONTINUATION COVERAGE. No Compaq Benefit Plan provides health benefits
(whether or not insured), with respect to Employees after retirement or other
termination of service (other than coverage mandated by applicable Legal
Requirements or benefits, the full cost of which is borne by the Employee)
other than individual arrangements the amounts of which are not material.  
(f) EFFECT OF TRANSACTION. The execution of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not (either
alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent events)
constitute an event under any Compaq Benefit Plan that will or may result in
any material payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise), acceleration of
payment, forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in
benefits or obligation to fund benefits with respect to any Employee. There
is no contract, agreement, plan or arrangement with an Employee to which
Compaq or any of its Subsidiaries is a party as of the date of this
Agreement, that, individually or collectively and as a result of the
transaction contemplated hereby (whether alone or upon the occurrence of any
additional or subsequent events), would reasonably be expected to give rise

Act, or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations
of the SEC thereunder applicable to such HP SEC Reports and (ii) did not at
the time they were filed contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, except to the extent corrected prior to
the date hereof by a subsequently filed HP SEC Report. None of HP\'s
Subsidiaries is required to file any forms, reports or other documents with
the SEC.   (b) FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. Each of the consolidated
financial statements (including, in each case, any related notes thereto)
contained in the HP SEC Reports (the "HP FINANCIALS"), including each HP SEC
Report filed after the date hereof until the Closing: (i) complied as to form
in all material respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC
with respect thereto, (ii) was prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a

hereinafter referred to as the "HP BALANCE SHEET." Except as disclosed in the
HP Financials, since the date of the HP Balance Sheet and through the date
hereof, neither HP nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities required
under GAAP to be set forth on a consolidated balance sheet (absolute,
accrued, contingent or otherwise) which, individually or in the aggregate,
would be reasonably expected   -34-   to have a Material Adverse Effect
on HP, except for liabilities incurred since the date of the HP Balance Sheet
in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices and
liabilities incurred pursuant to this Agreement.   3.5 ABSENCE OF CERTAIN
CHANGES OR EVENTS. Since the date of the HP Balance Sheet and through the
date hereof there has not been: (i) any Material Adverse Effect on HP, (ii)
any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend on, or other
distribution (whether in cash, stock or property) in respect of, any of HP\'s
or any of its Subsidiaries\' capital stock, or any purchase, redemption
or other acquisition by HP or any of its Subsidiaries of any of HP\'s capital
stock or any other securities of HP or its Subsidiaries or any options,
warrants, calls or rights to acquire any such shares or other securities
except for (A) repurchases from Employees following their termination

agreements or (B) repurchases pursuant to HP\'s public stock repurchase

Subsidiaries have filed all material Tax Returns required to be filed by any
of them and have paid, or have adequately reserved (in accordance with GAAP)
for the payment of, all Taxes required to be paid (whether or not shown on
any Tax Returns), and the most recent financial statements contained in the
HP SEC Reports reflect an adequate reserve (in accordance with GAAP) for all
Taxes payable by HP and its Subsidiaries through the date of such financial
statements. No material deficiencies for any Taxes have been asserted or
assessed, or to the Knowledge of HP, proposed, against HP or any of its
Subsidiaries that are not subject to adequate reserves (in accordance with
GAAP). Neither the HP nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action or
knows of any fact, agreement or plan or other circumstance that is reasonably
likely to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.   3.7 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.   (a)
NO INFRINGEMENT. To the Knowledge as of the date hereof of HP, the products,
services and operations of HP do not infringe or misappropriate the

misappropriation, individually or in the aggregate, would be   
-35-   reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on any
material division or business unit or other material operating group of
product or service offerings of HP or otherwise have a Material Adverse
Effect on HP.   (b) NO IMPAIRMENT. The Merger will not result in the
termination or breach of any Contract to which HP is a party, which
termination or breach would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on any material division or business unit or other material operating
group of product or service offerings of HP or otherwise have a Material
Adverse Effect on HP.   3.8 COMPLIANCE; PERMITS.   (a) COMPLIANCE. Neither
HP nor any of its Subsidiaries is, in any material respect, in conflict with,
or in default or in violation of any Legal Requirement applicable to HP or
any of its Subsidiaries or by which HP or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective businesses or properties is, or HP believes is reasonably
likely to be, bound or affected, except, in each case, or in the aggregate,
for conflicts, violations and defaults that would not have a Material Adverse
Effect on HP. As of the date hereof, no material investigation or review by
any Governmental Entity is pending or, to the Knowledge of HP, has been
threatened in a writing delivered to HP or any of its Subsidiaries, against
HP or any of its Subsidiaries. There is no material judgment, injunction,
order or decree binding upon HP or any of its Subsidiaries which has or would
reasonably be expected to have the effect of prohibiting or materially
impairing any material business practice of HP or any of its Subsidiaries,
any acquisition of material property by HP or any of its Subsidiaries or the
conduct of business by HP and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted.  
(b) PERMITS. HP and its Subsidiaries hold, to the extent legally required,

as currently conducted, the failure to hold which would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on HP (collectively, "HP

HP Permits is pending or, to the Knowledge of HP, threatened. HP and its
Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material respects with the terms of the
HP Permits.   3.9 LITIGATION. As of the date hereof, there are no
claims, suits, actions or proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of HP,
overtly threatened against HP or any of its Subsidiaries, before any court,
governmental department,    -36-   commission, agency, instrumentality
or authority, or any arbitrator that seeks to restrain or enjoin the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or which would
reasonably be expected, either singularly or in the aggregate with all such
claims, actions or proceedings, to be material to HP.   3.10 BROKERS\' AND
FINDERS\' FEES. Except for fees payable to Goldman, Sachs and Co. pursuant to
an engagement letter dated July 25, 2001, a copy of which has been provided
to Compaq, HP has not incurred, nor will it incur, directly or indirectly,
any liability for brokerage or finders\' fees or agents\' commissions or any
similar charges in connection with this Agreement or any
transaction contemplated hereby.   3.11 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.   (a)
BENEFIT PLAN COMPLIANCE.    (i) With respect to the Benefit Plan of HP or
any of its Subsidiaries ("HP BENEFIT PLAN"), no material event has occurred
and there exists no material condition or set of circumstances, in connection
with which HP or any of its Subsidiaries would be subject to any material
liability under the ERISA, the Code or any other applicable Legal
Requirement.   (ii) Each HP Benefit Plan has been, in all
material respects, administered and operated in accordance with its terms,
with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and all other applicable
material Legal Requirements and the terms of all applicable collective
bargaining agreements. Each HP Benefit Plan, including any material
amendments thereto, that is capable of Approval has received such Approval or
there remains a period of time in which to obtain such Approval retroactive

Approval.   (iii) To the Knowledge of HP, no material oral or written
representation or commitment with respect to any material aspect of any HP
Benefit Plan has been made to an Employee of HP or any of its Subsidiaries
by an authorized HP Employee that is not materially in accordance with the
written or otherwise preexisting terms and provisions of such HP Benefit
Plans. To the Knowledge of HP, neither HP nor any of its Subsidiaries has
entered into any agreement, arrangement or understanding, whether written or
oral, with any trade union, works council or other Employee representative
body or any material    -37-   number or category of its Employees which

off, redundancy, severance or similar program within its or their respective
workforces (or any part of them).   (iv) There are no material unresolved
claims or disputes under the terms of, or in connection with, any HP Benefit
Plan (other than routine undisputed claims for benefits), and no action,
legal or otherwise, has been commenced with respect to any material
claim.   (b) RETIREMENT PLAN FUNDING. The latest actuarial valuation
of each Funded Retirement Plan of HP or its Subsidiaries discloses that, as
of the effective date of the valuation, the aggregate value of the assets of
such Funded Retirement Plan is equal to or greater than the aggregate value
of its liabilities assessed on an ongoing and terminated basis and calculated
in accordance with the actuarial methods and assumptions used in such
valuation pursuant to such Funded Retirement Plan and applicable Legal
Requirements and GAAP. In respect of each Retirement Plan of HP or its
Subsidiaries that is not a Funded Retirement Plan, HP or its Subsidiaries
have made adequate provision for accrued liabilities in accordance with
applicable Legal Requirements.   (c) MULTIPLE EMPLOYER AND MULTIEMPLOYER
PLANS. At no time has HP or Controlled Group Affiliate with HP participated
in and/or been obligated to contribute to any HP Benefit Plan in which any
persons which are not or were not at the relevant time, Controlled Group
Affiliates of HP and/or their Employees, have participated. No HP Benefit
Plan is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of
ERISA.   (d) CONTINUATION COVERAGE. No HP Benefit Plan provides
health benefits (whether or not insured), with respect to Employees after
retirement or other termination of service (other than coverage mandated by
applicable Legal Requirements or benefits, the full cost of which is borne by
the Employee) other than individual arrangements the amounts of which are not
material.   (e) EFFECT OF TRANSACTION. The execution of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not (either
alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent events)
constitute an event under any HP Benefit Plan that will or may result in any
material payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise), acceleration of
payment, forgiveness of    -38-   indebtedness, vesting, distribution,
increase in benefits or obligation to fund benefits with respect to any
Employee. There is no contract, agreement, plan or arrangement with an
Employee to which HP or any of its Subsidiaries is a party as of the date of
this Agreement, that, individually or collectively and as a result of the
transaction contemplated hereby (whether alone or upon the occurrence of any
additional or subsequent events), would reasonably be expected to give rise
to the payment of any amount that would not be deductible pursuant to Section
280G of the Code.   (f) LABOR. No collective bargaining agreement is
being negotiated or renegotiated in any material respect by HP or any of
its Subsidiaries. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no material
labor dispute, strike or work stoppage against HP or any of its Subsidiaries
pending or, to the Knowledge of HP, threatened which may materially interfere
with the respective business activities of HP or any of its Subsidiaries. As
of the date of this Agreement, to the Knowledge of HP, none of HP, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective representatives or Employees has
committed any material unfair labor practice in connection with the operation
of the respective businesses of HP or any of its Subsidiaries, and there is
no material charge or complaint against HP or any of its Subsidiaries by the
National Labor Relations Board or any comparable governmental agency pending
or threatened in writing.   3.12 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.   (a) HAZARDOUS
MATERIAL. Except as would not result in a Material Adverse Effect on HP, no
underground storage tanks and no amount of any Hazardous Material are
present, as a result of the actions of HP or any of its Subsidiaries or any
affiliate of HP, or, to the Knowledge of HP, as a result of any actions of
any third party or otherwise, in, on or under any property, including the
land and the improvements, ground water and surface water thereof, that HP or
any of its Subsidiaries has at any time owned, operated, occupied
or leased.   (b) HAZARDOUS MATERIALS ACTIVITIES. Except as would not
result in a Material Adverse Effect on HP (i) neither HP nor any of its
Subsidiaries has transported, stored, used, manufactured, disposed of,
released or exposed its Employees or others to Hazardous Materials in
violation of any law in effect on or before the Closing Date and (ii) neither
HP nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in any Hazardous Materials
Activities in violation of any rule, regulation,    -39-   treaty or
statute promulgated by any Governmental Entity in effect prior to or as of

Hazardous Material Activity.   3.13 CONTRACTS. All HP Material Contracts (as
defined below) are valid and in full force and effect except to the extent
they have previously expired in accordance with their terms or if the failure
to be in full force and effect, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to be material to HP. Neither HP nor any of its
Subsidiaries has violated any provision of, or committed or failed to perform
any act which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both would constitute
a default under the provisions of, any HP Material Contract, except in each
case for those violations and defaults which, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to be material to HP. For
purposes of this Agreement, "HP MATERIAL CONTRACT" shall mean any Contract,
or group of Contracts, with a Person (or group of affiliated Persons) the
termination or breach of which would be reasonably expected to have a
material adverse effect on any material division or business unit or other
material operating group of product or service offerings of HP or otherwise
have a Material Adverse Effect on HP.   3.14 DISCLOSURE. None of the

Acquisition Proposal, or propose to do so.    -55-    (f) COMPLIANCE

Compaq Option so assumed by HP under this Agreement will continue to have,
and be subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth in the applicable
Compaq Option (including any applicable stock option agreement or other
document evidencing such Compaq Option) immediately prior to the Effective
Time (including any repurchase rights or vesting provisions), except that (i)
each Compaq Option will be exercisable (or will become exercisable in
accordance with its terms) for (or will relate to, in the case of a Compaq
SAR)) that number of whole shares of HP Common Stock equal to the product of
the number of shares of Compaq Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise
of such Compaq Option (or, in the case of Compaq SARs, the number of shares
of Compaq Common Stock subject to such Compaq SAR) immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest
whole number of shares of HP Common Stock and (ii) the per share exercise
price for the shares of HP Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such
assumed Compaq Option (or the base price to which the assumed Compaq SAR
relates) will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise
price per share of Compaq Common Stock at which such Compaq Option
was exercisable (or the base price subject to the Compaq SAR) immediately
prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest
whole cent. Each assumed Compaq Option (including each Compaq SAR) shall be
vested immediately following the Effective Time as to the same percentage of

Compaq SAR) by its terms in effect prior to the date hereof provides for
acceleration of vesting. As soon as reasonably practicable, HP will issue to
each Person who holds an assumed Compaq Option (including each Compaq SAR) a
document evidencing the foregoing assumption of such Compaq Option (including
each Compaq SAR) by HP.   -62-    (b) INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS. The

immediately prior to, the Effective Time, as the last day of such offering
period and by making such other pro-rata adjustments as may be necessary to
reflect the shortened offering period but otherwise treating such shortened
offering period as a fully effective and completed offering period for all
purposes under such Compaq Purchase Plan. Prior to the Effective Time, Compaq

efforts to give each Continuing Employee full credit for prior service with
Compaq or its Subsidiaries for purposes of (i) eligibility and vesting under

or severance HP Benefit Plan and (iii) determination of "retiree" status
under any equity compensation HP Benefit Plan, for which the
Continuing Employee is otherwise eligible and in which the Continuing
Employee is offered participation, in each case except where such crediting
would (A) result in a duplication of benefits or (B) otherwise cause HP or
its Subsidiaries or any HP Benefit Plan or trust relating thereto to accrue
or pay for benefits that relate to any    -63-   time period prior to
the Continuing Employee\'s participation in the HP Benefit Plan.   (f)
EMPLOYEE COMMUNICATIONS. With respect to matters described in Section 5.9,

reference is made in this Agreement to Exhibits, such reference shall be to
an Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. When a reference is
made in this Agreement to Sections, such reference shall be to a section of
this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. For   -80-   purposes of this
Agreement, the words "INCLUDE," "INCLUDES" and "INCLUDING," when used herein,
shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement
are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning
or interpretation of this Agreement. When reference is made herein to "THE
BUSINESS OF" an entity, such reference shall be deemed to include
the business of all such entity and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. An
exception or disclosure made in Compaq Disclosure Letter with regard to a
representation of Compaq, or in the HP Disclosure Letter with regard to a
representation of HP or Merger Sub, shall be deemed made with respect to any
other representation by such party to which such exception or disclosure is
clearly relevant.   (b) For purposes of this Agreement, the term
"KNOWLEDGE" means, with respect to a party hereto, with respect to any matter
in question, that any of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer
or General Counsel of such party, has actual knowledge of such matter,
after inquiry of their respective direct reports.   (c) For purposes of
this Agreement, the term "MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT," when used in connection
with an entity, means any change, event, violation, inaccuracy, circumstance
or effect (any such item, an "EFFECT"), individually or when taken together
with all other Effects that have occurred prior to the date of determination
of the occurrence of the Material Adverse Effect, that is or is reasonably
likely to (i) be materially adverse to the business, assets (including
intangible assets), capitalization, financial condition or results of
operations of such entity taken as a whole with its Subsidiaries (or, if such
entity is Compaq, Compaq taken as a whole with its Subsidiaries or HP taken
as a whole with its Subsidiaries) or (ii) materially impede the authority of
such entity, or, in any case, HP, to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof and applicable Legal
Requirements; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, for purposes of clause (i) above, in
no event shall any of the following, alone or in combination, be deemed to
constitute, nor shall any of the following be taken into account in
determining whether there has been or will be, a Material Adverse Effect on
any entity: (A) any Effect resulting from compliance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, (B) any Effect resulting from the announcement
or pendency of the Merger (provided that the exception in this clause (B)
shall not apply to the use of the term "Material Adverse Effect" in Sections
6.2(a) and 6.3(a) with respect to the representations   -81-   and
warranties contained in Section 2.3, Section 2.7(b), Section 2.14,
Section 3.3 and Section 3.13), (C) any change in such entity\'s stock price
or trading volume, in and of itself, (D) any failure by such entity to meet
published revenue or earnings projections, in and of itself, (E) any Effect
that results from changes affecting any of the industries in which such
entity operates generally or the United States economy generally (which
changes in each case do not disproportionately affect such entity in any
material respect), (F) any Effect that results from changes affecting general
worldwide economic or capital market conditions (which changes in each case
do not disproportionately affect such entity in any material respect), or (G)
stockholder class action litigation arising from allegations of a breach of
fiduciary duty relating to this Agreement.   (d) For purposes of this
Agreement, the term "PERSON" shall mean any individual, corporation
(including any non-profit corporation), general partnership, limited
partnership, limited liability partnership, joint venture, estate, trust,
company (including any limited liability company or joint stock company),
firm or other enterprise, association, organization, entity or Governmental
Entity.   8.4 COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same
agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being
understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart.   8.5
ENTIRE AGREEMENT; THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARIES. This Agreement and the documents
and instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto as contemplated
by or referred to herein, including the Compaq Disclosure Letter and the HP
Disclosure Letter (i) constitute the entire agreement among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof, it being understood that the Confidentiality Agreement
shall continue in full force and effect until the Closing and shall survive
any termination of this Agreement and (ii) are not intended to confer upon
any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder, except as specifically
provided, following the Effective Time, in Section 5.11. Without limiting the
foregoing, it is expressly understood and agreed that the provisions of
Sections 5.9(d), 5.9(e), 5.12(b) and 5.12(c) are statements of intent and no
Continuing Employee or other Person (including any party hereto) shall have
any rights or remedies, including    -82-   rights of enforcement, with
respect thereto and no Continuing Employee or other Person is or is intended
to be a third-party beneficiary thereof.   8.6 SEVERABILITY. In the event
that any provision of this Agreement or the application thereof, becomes or
is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or
unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force
and effect and the application of such provision to other Persons or
circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of
the parties hereto. The parties further agree to replace such void
or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable
provision that will achieve, to the greatest extent possible, the economic,
business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.   8.7
OTHER REMEDIES; SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE.   (a) OTHER REMEDIES. Except as
otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred
upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other
remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the
exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any
other remedy. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.   (b)
SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any
court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or
in equity.   8.8 GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of
the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts
of law thereof.   8.9 RULES OF CONSTRUCTION. The parties hereto agree that
they have been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of
this Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any law, regulation,
holding or    -83-   rule of construction providing that ambiguities in
an agreement or other document will be construed against the party drafting
such agreement or document.   8.10 ASSIGNMENT. No party may assign either
this Agreement or any of its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder
without the prior written approval of the other parties. Any purported
assignment in violation of this Section 8.10 shall be void. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to
the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns.   8.11 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF HP, MERGER SUB AND
COMPAQ HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF HP, MERGER SUB
OR COMPAQ IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT
HEREOF.   *****      -84-    IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto
have caused this Agreement to be executed by their duly authorized respective
officers as of the date first written above.    HEWLETT-PACKARD
