-5- (c) _Post-Closing Adjustments to Merger Consideration._

 

(i) _Final Closing Statement_. Within ninety (90) days following the Closing
Date, Parent shall deliver to the Holder Representative a statement (the " _
_Closing Statement__ " and, in its final and binding form as determined below,
the " _ _Final Closing Statement__ ") setting forth the Merger Consideration
and each component thereof as of immediately prior to the Closing (including
the Funded Debt, which shall be determined as of immediately prior to the
Closing, but after giving effect to the Merger and the other Transactions in
accordance with  _Section 4.1(b)(ii)_), including final determinations as to
the amounts of (A) the Company Cash, (B) the Funded Debt and (C) the Closing
Net Working Capital. The Final Closing Statement and the components thereof
shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP on a basis consistent with the
terms of this Agreement and the Companys accounting policies in effect as of
such date. The Holder Representative and Parent shall cooperate as reasonably
requested in connection with the preparation of the Closing Statement. During
the thirty (30)-day period immediately following the Holder Representatives
receipt of the Closing Statement, the Holder Representative shall
be permitted to review Parents working papers related to the preparation of
the Closing Statement and determination of the Merger Consideration and the
components thereof. The Closing Statement shall become final and binding upon
the parties upon the earlier of (x) thirty (30) days following the Holder
Representatives receipt thereof, unless the Holder Representative shall give
written notice of its disagreement (a " _ _Notice of Disagreement__ ") to
Parent prior to such date and (y) the Holder Representative notifies Parent
of its acceptance thereof. Any Notice of Disagreement shall specify in
reasonable detail the nature and dollar amount of any disagreement so
asserted. The Closing Statement shall become final and binding upon the
resolution in writing of all disagreements the parties may have with respect
thereto (whether by the written agreement of the parties or pursuant to the
arbitration provisions set forth below). During the fifteen (15) days
following delivery of a Notice of Disagreement, Parent and the Holder
Representative shall seek in good faith to resolve any differences which they
may have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of
Disagreement. Following delivery of a Notice of Disagreement, Parent and its
agents and Representatives (as defined in _Section 6.2(a)_ below) shall be
permitted to review the Holder Representatives and its Representatives
working papers relating to the Notice of Disagreement. If, at the end of the
fifteen (15)-day period referred to above, the matters in dispute have not
been fully resolved, then the parties shall submit to Deloitte and Touche LLP
(or such other mutually agreed independent accountants of nationally
recognized standing) (any such accounting firm, the " _ _Accounting Firm__ ")
for review and resolution of all matters (but only such matters) which remain
in dispute, and the Accounting Firm shall make a final determination of the
Merger Consideration and the components thereof to the extent such amounts are
in dispute, in accordance with the guidelines and procedures set forth in
this Agreement. The parties will reasonably cooperate with the Accounting Firm
during the term of its engagement. The Accounting Firm shall be provided
reasonable access to the books, records and other relevant information of the
Company, Parent and the Holder Representative to the extent necessary to
calculate the Merger Consideration. In resolving any matters in dispute, the
Accounting Firm may not assign a value to any item in dispute greater than the
greatest value for 

 



-6-  such item assigned by Parent in the Closing Statement, on the one hand, or
the Holder Representative in the Notice of Disagreement, on the other hand, or
less than the smallest value for such item assigned by Parent in the Closing
Statement, on the one hand, or the Holder Representative in the Notice of
Disagreement, on the other hand. The Accounting Firms determination shall be
based solely on presentations by Parent and the Holder Representative which
are in accordance with the guidelines and procedures set forth in this
Agreement ( _i.e._ , not on the basis of an independent review). The Closing
Statement and the determination of the Merger Consideration and
the components thereof shall become final and binding on the parties on the
date the Accounting Firm delivers its final resolution in writing to the
parties (which the Accounting Firm shall be instructed to deliver not more
than forty-five (45) days following submission of such disputed matters). The
Accounting Firm shall allocate its costs and expenses between Parent and the
Holder Representative, on behalf of the Holders, based upon the percentage of
the contested amount submitted to the Accounting Firm that is ultimately
awarded to Parent, on the one hand, or the Holder Representative on behalf of
the Holders, on the other hand, such that Parent bears a percentage of such
costs and expenses equal to the percentage of the contested amount awarded to
the Holders and the Holders bear a percentage of such costs and expenses equal
to the percentage of the contested amount awarded to Parent (such amount to be
released from the Holder Representative Expense Account (as defined in
_Section 4.4(g)_ below) in accordance with _Section 4.2_).

(ii) _Merger Consideration Adjustments_. The Merger Consideration shall be
(x) _increased_ , by an amount in cash equal to the amount, if any, by which
the Merger Consideration (as finally determined pursuant to _Section
4.1(c)(i)_) is greater than the Estimated Merger Consideration or (y)
_decreased_ , by an amount in cash equal to the amount, if any, by which the
Estimated Merger Consideration is greater than the Merger Consideration (as
finally determined pursuant to  _Section 4.1(c)(i)_). No adjustment shall be

(A) in the event of an upward adjustment, based on the positive sum of (1) the
amount of the Closing Net Working Capital  _minus_ the Target Working Capital
(which amount may be positive or negative) (the " _ _Working Capital
Adjustment Amount__ "), (2) the amount of the Company Cash minus the Estimated
Company Cash (which amount may be positive or negative) (the " _ _Company
Cash Adjustment Amount__ ") and/or (3) the amount of the Estimated Funded Debt
_minus_ the Funded Debt (which amount may be positive or negative) (the " _
_Funded Debt Adjustment Amount__ "), the Holder Representative and Parent
shall first deliver prompt joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent (as
defined in _Section 4.2(a)(i)_ below) instructing the Escrow Agent to pay the
amount of the Working Capital Adjustment Amount, the Company Cash Adjustment
Amount and the Funded Debt Adjustment Amount, as applicable, to the Holders
from the Working Capital Escrow Account and, to the extent such upward
adjustment exceeds the amount in the Working Capital Escrow Account, Parent
shall pay such additional amount in immediately available funds by wire
transfer to the Payments Administrator for further distribution to the Holders
promptly, but in no event later than two (2) business days after the final
determination of the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 4.1(c)(i)_; or

 



-7- (B) in the event of a downward adjustment based on the negative sum of
the Working Capital Adjustment Amount, the Company Cash Adjustment Amount and
the Funded Debt Adjustment Amount, as applicable, the Holder Representative
and Parent shall deliver prompt joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent
instructing the Escrow Agent to pay the amount of such downward adjustment to
Parent from the Working Capital Escrow Account. To the extent such adjustment
exceeds the amount then-available in the Working Capital Escrow Account, the
Holders shall pay the amount of such remainder, severally and not jointly, in
proportion to their respective portions of the Merger Consideration in
accordance with the Payment Schedule, in immediately available funds by wire
transfer to Parent. To the extent that there is no downward adjustment, or
the downward adjustment does not exceed the amount then-available in the
Working Capital Escrow Account, Parent and the Holder Representative shall
deliver prompt joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing
the Escrow Agent to pay the remaining Working Capital Reserve Amount (as
defined in _Section 4.2(a)(ii)_ below) to the Payments Administrator for
further distribution to the Holders. Such set off payments shall be made
and/or instructions shall be given to the Escrow Agent, as applicable, within
two (2) business days of final determination of the Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section 4.1(c)(i)_.

 

(d) _Modifications to Payment Schedule_. The Company may, in its reasonable
discretion, modify, change or amend the Payment Schedule at any time and from
time to time prior to the Closing Date to correct any inaccuracy in the
Payment Schedule or to otherwise update the Payment Schedule to reflect
changes to the Companys capital structure permitted in accordance with 
_Section 6.1_ including the exercise of options or put rights effected in
accordance with the Companys certificate of incorporation; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company will provide the final Payment Schedule to
Parent no later than 5:00 P.M. (Eastern Time) on the date that is at least
two (2) business days prior to the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt,
no modification, amendment or change made to the Payment Schedule shall alter
the aggregate amount of Merger Consideration payable by Parent.

(a) _Reserve Amounts_.

 

(i) _Indemnity Reserve_. At or immediately prior to the Closing, Parent shall
deposit an amount in cash equal to $23,850,000 as security for post-Closing
indemnification claims that may be payable to Parent pursuant to _Article IX_

term of eighteen (18) months commencing on the Closing Date (the " _
_Indemnity Escrow Account__ ") with JPMorgan Chase Bank, NA (the " _ _Escrow
Agent__ ").

 

(ii) _Working Capital Adjustment Reserve_. At Closing, Parent shall deposit
$1,500,000 in cash as security for amounts that may become payable to Parent

and, together with the Indemnity Reserve Amount, the " _ _Reserve Amounts__
") in an account (the " _ _Working Capital Escrow Account__ " and, together
with the Indemnity Escrow Account, the " _ _Escrow Accounts__ ") with the

Capital Escrow Account until the Merger Consideration is finally determined in
accordance with _Section 4.1(c)_.

Escrow Agent by Parent and the Holder Representative pursuant to the terms of

paid or are not applicable.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Funds that

foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Holder
Representative, the Payments Administrator or any other Person shall be liable

venture, estate, trust, association, organization, Governmental Entity (as
defined in _Section 5.1(f)(i)_ below) or other entity of any kind or nature.

making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate or
other instrument to be lost, stolen or destroyed and subject to such other
reasonable conditions as may be imposed by the Payments Administrator
(including, if required by the Payments Administrator, the posting by such
Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Payments Administrator may

Certificate or other instrument, without interest, the portion of the Merger
Consideration to which the holder of such Shares, Warrants or other equity
securities (other than Company Options), as applicable, is entitled in
accordance with the Payment Schedule. 

(f) _Appraisal Rights_. No Person who has perfected a demand for appraisal
rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (each such Person, a " _
_Dissenting Stockholder__ ") shall be entitled to receive the portion of the
Merger Consideration to which such Person would otherwise be entitled pursuant
to _Section 4.1_ with respect to the Shares owned by such Person unless and
until such Person shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such Persons right
to appraisal under the DGCL. Each Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to
receive only the payment provided by Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to
Shares owned by such Dissenting Stockholder. The Company shall give Parent (i)
prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of
such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to applicable Laws
that are received by the Company relating to stockholders rights of appraisal
and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to Dissenting Stockholders under the DGCL, _provided_ that the
Company shall have the right to participate in such negotiations and
proceedings. Except to the extent otherwise permitted pursuant to _Section
6.1(a)_, the Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisal, offer to settle or settle any such demands or approve any
withdrawal of any such demands. If any Person who would otherwise be deemed a
Dissenting Stockholder shall have failed properly to perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost the right to dissent with respect to any Shares,
such Shares shall thereupon be treated as though such Shares had been
converted into the right to receive a portion of the Merger Consideration in
accordance with the Payment Schedule pursuant to _Section 4.1_. The Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to enforce its rights under Article 3 of
that certain Fourth Amended and Restated Voting Rights Agreement, dated March
10, 2015, by and among the Company and the holders of Shares party thereto,
with respect to any stockholder that seeks to exercise its appraisal rights.
The aggregate amount, if any, by which any payment provided to Dissenting
Stockholders by Section 262 of the DGCL exceeds the portion of the Merger
Consideration to which such Dissenting Stockholders would otherwise be
entitled pursuant to _Section 4.1_, shall be paid to Parent in accordance
with _Section 9.2(a)_.

(g) _Holder Representative Expense Amount_. At the Closing, Parent shall
deposit into an account designated by the Holder Representative (the " _
_Holder Representative Expense Account__ ") an amount equal to $400,000 (the "
_ _Holder Representative Expense Amount__ "). The Holder
Representative Expense Amount may be used at any time by the Holder
Representative to fund any expenses incurred by it in the performance of its
duties and obligations hereunder, including those duties and obligations
identified in _Section 10.1_. The 

 



-13-  Holder Representative Expense Amount will be held by the Holder
Representative for so long as the Holder Representative determines is
reasonably necessary for it to fulfill its obligations and duties under this
Agreement; _provided_ , that following the completion of all such obligations
and duties and the satisfaction of all expense reimbursements to which the
Holder Representative is entitled in connection therewith, the
Holder Representative shall distribute any amounts remaining in the Holder
Representative Expense Account to the Payments Administrator for further
distribution to the Holders on a pro rata basis pursuant to their respective
portions of the Merger Consideration in accordance with the Payment Schedule.
The Holders will not receive any interest or earnings on the Holder
Representative Expense Amount and irrevocably transfer and assign to the
Holder Representative any ownership right that they may otherwise have had in
any such interest or earnings. The Holder Representative will not be liable
for any loss of principal of the Holder Representative Expense Amount other
than as a result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Holder
Representative will hold these funds separate from its corporate funds, will
not use these funds for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes
and will not voluntarily make these funds available to its creditors in the
event of bankruptcy. For tax purposes, the Holder Representative Expense
Amount will be treated as having been received and voluntarily set aside by
the Holders at the time of the Closing.

 

(h) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
to any Holder pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code
or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the
case may be, such withheld amounts (i) shall be timely remitted by Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental
Entity and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Holder in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.

_provided_ ,  _further_ , that, with respect to clauses (A), (B), (C) and
(F), such change, event, circumstance or development does not (1) primarily
relate only to (or have the effect of primarily relating to) the Company
or (2) disproportionately adversely affect the Company compared to other

number of Shares required to approve such matter as required under the DGCL,
the Company s organizational documents and any Contract to which the Company
or, to the Companys knowledge, any of the Holders is a party (such approval,

Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby (collectively, the " _
_Transactions__ ") and resolved to recommend adoption of this Agreement to the
Companys stockholders (the " _ _Company Recommendation__ ") and (B) directed
that this Agreement be submitted to the stockholders for their adoption. The
Company Board has taken all action so that Parent will not be an "interested
stockholder" or prohibited from entering into or consummating a "business
combination" with the Company (in each case as such term is used in Section
203 of the DGCL) as a result of the execution of this Agreement or the
consummation of the Transactions. __

three-fourths of the outstanding Series C, Series D and Series E Preferred

-18-  are required to be made by the Company with, nor are any consents,

connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by
the Company and the consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions,
except those that the failure to make or obtain would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or impair
the ability of the Company to consummate the Merger and the other
Transactions.

(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
does not, and the consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions will
not, constitute or result in (A) a breach or violation of, or a default under,
the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company, (B) with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, a breach or violation of, a termination
(or right of termination) or a default under, the creation or acceleration of
any obligations under or the creation of a Lien on any of the assets of

mortgage, indenture, arrangement or other obligation (each, a " _ _Contract__
") binding on the Company or under any Law to which the Company is
subject, (C) the loss or impairment of, payment of any additional amounts

will, either alone or in combination with another event, (A) entitle any
Employees, directors, officers or consultants (who are natural persons) of the
Company to severance pay or any increase in severance pay, (B) accelerate the

of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions.

(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and
Merger Sub do not, and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Merger
and the other Transactions will not, constitute or result in (A) a breach or

Subsidiaries, (B) with or without notice, lapse of time or both, a breach or
violation of, a termination (or right of termination) or a default under,

any party under any of such Contracts, except, in the case of clause (B) or

be expected to prevent or materially delay the ability of Parent and Merger
Sub to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions.

prevent, materially delay or impair the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to
consummate the Merger and the other Transactions. Immediately after giving
effect to the transactions contemplated hereby, neither Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation will: (x) be insolvent (either because its financial
condition is such that the sum of its debts is greater than the fair value of

and prior to the Effective Time will have no, assets, liabilities or
obligations of any nature other than those incident to its formation and
pursuant to this Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions.

(g) _Brokers_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub, nor any of their respective
officers, directors or employees has employed any broker or finder or incurred
any liability for any brokerage fees, commissions or finders fees in
connection with the Merger or the other Transactions except that Parent has

its directors, officers, Employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants
and other advisors or representatives (such directors, officers, Employees,

or representatives, collectively, " _ _Representatives__ ") shall, directly
or indirectly:

may ascertain facts from the Person making such Acquisition Proposal about
such Person and its Representatives for the purpose of the Company Board or
any committee thereof informing itself about such Acquisition Proposal
and the Person that made it).

(b) Notwithstanding anything in _Section 6.2(a)_ to the contrary, prior to
the time, but not after, the Requisite Stockholder Approval is obtained, the
Company may (i) provide information in response to a request therefor by a
Person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that
did not result from a breach of this  _Section 6.2_ if the Company receives
from the Person so requesting such information an executed confidentiality
agreement on terms not less restrictive to the other party in the aggregate
than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in _Section
10.7_ below) (it being understood that such confidentiality agreement need not
include a standstill or prohibit the making, or amendment, of an Acquisition
Proposal) and promptly thereafter discloses (and, if applicable, provides

provided to Parent; (ii) engage or participate in any discussions or
negotiations with any Person who has made such an unsolicited bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) after having complied with _Section
6.2(d)_, approve, recommend, or otherwise declare advisable or propose to
approve, recommend or declare advisable (publicly or otherwise) such an
Acquisition Proposal, if and only to the extent that, (x) prior to taking any
action described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above, the Company Board or any
committee thereof determines in good faith after consultation with its outside
legal counsel that failure to take such action, in light of the Acquisition
Proposal and the terms of this Agreement, would be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Laws, (y) in each such case
referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, the Company Board or any committee
thereof has determined in good faith based on the information then available
and after consultation with its financial advisor that such Acquisition
Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal (as defined in _Section
6.2(c)_ below) or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal, and
(z) in the case referred to in clause (iii) above, the Company Board or any
committee thereof determines in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal is
a Superior Proposal.



 



-43- (c) _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement:

 

" _ _Acquisition Proposal__ " means (x) any proposal or offer with respect to
a merger, joint venture, partnership, consolidation, dissolution,
liquidation, tender offer, recapitalization, reorganization, share exchange,
business combination or similar transaction involving the Company and (y) any
acquisition by any Person resulting in, or proposal or offer, which if
consummated would result in, any Person becoming the beneficial owner of
directly or indirectly, in one or a series of related transactions, 25% or
more of the total voting power or of any class of equity securities of the
Company or 25% or more of the consolidated total assets of the Company, in
each case other than the Merger and the Transactions and excluding any
transactions by or among existing affiliated stockholders of the Company
executed pursuant to arrangements in effect as of the date of this Agreement
or for trust and estate planning purposes.

" _ _Superior Proposal__ " means an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition
Proposal that would result in any Person becoming the beneficial owner,
directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the assets (on a consolidated
basis) or more than 50% of the total voting power of the equity securities of
the Company that the Company Board or any committee thereof has determined in
its good faith judgment is reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance
with its terms, taking into account all legal, financial and regulatory
aspects of the proposal and the Person making the proposal, and if
consummated, would result in a transaction more favorable to the Companys
stockholders from a financial point of view than the transaction contemplated
by this Agreement (after taking into account any revisions to the terms of
the transaction contemplated by, and pursuant to, _Section 6.2(d)_ of this
Agreement and the time likely to be required to consummate such Acquisition
Proposal).

 

(d) _No Change in Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement_. The
Company Board and each committee of the Company Board shall not:

(i) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to
withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent, the
Company Recommendation with respect to the Merger; or

(ii) except as expressly permitted by, and after compliance with, _Section
8.3_ hereof, cause or permit the Company to enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement,
merger agreement or other agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement
referred to in _Section 6.2(a)_ entered into in compliance with _Section
6.2(a)_) (an " _ _Alternative Acquisition Agreement__ ") relating to any
Acquisition Proposal.

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, but
subject to _Section 6.2(b)_, prior to the time, but not after, the Requisite
Stockholder Approval is obtained, the Company Board or any committee thereof
may withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify the Company Recommendation in
connection with a Superior Proposal or may approve, recommend or
otherwise declare advisable any Acquisition Proposal made after the date of
this Agreement in compliance with this _Section 6.2_ that the Company Board
or any committee thereof determines in good faith is a Superior Proposal (a "
_ _Change of Recommendation__ ") if the Company Board or any committee
thereof determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary obligations under applicable Laws. In determining whether to make a
Change of Recommendation in response to a Superior Proposal or otherwise, the
Company Board shall take into account any changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Parent and any other information provided by Parent in
response to such notice. Any material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal
will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of _Section
6.2(b)_ and _Section 6.2(e)_.

 



-44- (e) _Existing Discussions_. The Company agrees that it will immediately (i)
cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal and (ii) suspend any existing activities with respect to
an initial public offering of the Companys equity securities. The Company
agrees that it will take the necessary steps to promptly after announcement of
this Agreement inform the individuals or entities referred to in the first
sentence hereof of the obligations undertaken in this _Section 6.2_. The
Company also agrees that it will promptly after announcement of this Agreement
request each Person that has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement
in connection with its consideration of an existing Acquisition Proposal to
return or destroy all confidential information heretofore furnished to such
Person by or on behalf of the Company.

 

(f) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this _Section 6.2_
shall be deemed to prohibit the Company from complying with its disclosure
obligations under U.S. federal or state law with regard to an Acquisition
Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such disclosure has the effect of
withdrawing or adversely modifying the Company Recommendation, Parent, shall
have the right to terminate this Agreement as set forth in _Section 8.5(b)_.

(g) _Notice_. The Company agrees that it will promptly (and, in any event,
within twenty-four (24) hours) notify Parent if any inquiries, proposals or
offers with respect to an Acquisition Proposal are received by, any such
information is requested from, or any such discussions or negotiation are
sought to be initiated or continued with, it or any of its Representatives
indicating, in connection with such notice, the material financial terms and
conditions of any proposals or offers (including, if applicable, copies of
any written requests, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements) and
thereafter shall keep Parent informed, on a current basis, of the status and
material financial terms of any such proposals or offers (including any
amendments thereto) and the status of any such discussions or negotiations,
including any change in the Companys intentions as previously notified.

 

6.3. _Requisite Stockholder Approval_. In accordance with applicable Laws,

and delivered by such holders, the " _ _Stockholder Written Consent__ ") for
the purposes of adopting this Agreement and approving the Merger and
acknowledging that the adoption and approvals are irrevocable and result
in the waiver of any right of such stockholders to demand appraisal in
connection with the Merger pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. As promptly as
practicable and, in any event, prior to the expiration of the Stockholder
Consent Delivery Period, if the Stockholder Written Consent is duly executed
and delivered to the Company, the Company shall deliver to Parent a copy
thereof (including by facsimile or other electronic image scan transmission),
certified as correct and complete by an executive officer of the Company.

in accordance with applicable Laws and its certificate of incorporation and
bylaws, all reasonable action necessary to duly call, give notice of, convene

their respective parts under this Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate
and make effective the Merger and the other Transactions as soon as

or any of the other Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in
this Agreement shall require, or be construed to require, Parent, the Company

other Governmental Entity authorizes its staff to seek a preliminary
injunction or restraining order to enjoin consummation of the Merger; and 
_provided_ , _further_ , that Parent shall pay all required filing fees in

information relating to Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or the Company, as
the case may be, that appears in any filing made with, or written materials
submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection
with the Merger and the other Transactions. In exercising the foregoing
rights, each of the Company and Parent shall act reasonably and as promptly as
practicable. The Company and Parent shall each request early termination of

Neither the Company nor Parent shall permit any of its officers or any other
Representatives or agents to participate in any meeting with any Governmental
Entity in respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry relating to
the Merger and the other Transactions unless it consults with the other party
in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives
the other party the opportunity to attend and participate thereat.

(d) _Limitations on Actions_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the parties hereby agree and acknowledge that
neither this _Section 6.5_ nor the "reasonable best efforts" standard shall
require, or be construed to require, other than as set forth in the proviso
below, Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates to (A)(1) sell, lease, license, transfer, dispose of,
divest or otherwise encumber, or hold separate pending any such action, or
(2) propose, negotiate or offer to effect, or consent or commit to, any such
sale, leasing, licensing, transfer, disposal, divestiture or other
encumbrance, or holding separate, before or after the Effective Time, of any
assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines, businesses or interest
therein of Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation (or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or other Affiliates), or (B) take or agree to take any
other action or agree or consent to any limitations or restrictions on
freedom of actions with respect to, or its ability to retain, or make changes
in, any such assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines, businesses
or interest therein of Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation (or
any of their respective Subsidiaries or other Affiliates), except, in each
case as is not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a
material adverse effect on the projected revenues of the Company in any year
from and after the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent can compel
the Company to take any of the actions referred to above (or agree to take
such actions) if such actions are only effective after the Effective Time.

(e) _Inventory_. The Company shall, upon receiving reasonable advance notice
from Parent, purchase all such Inventory as Parent shall reasonably request
(the reasonableness of Parents request to be determined in respect of
Parents post-Closing Inventory requirements) prior to the Closing; _provided_
, _however_ , that Parent shall reimburse the Company for all out-of-pocket
fees and expenses incurred by the Company in connection with ordering such
Inventory.

 



-47- 6.6. _Access and Reports_. Subject to applicable Law, upon reasonable notice,
the Company shall afford Parents officers and other authorized
Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours throughout the
period prior to the Effective Time, to its Employees, properties, assets,
books, contracts, Tax Returns and records and, during such period, the
Company shall furnish promptly to Parent all information concerning its
business, properties, finances, operations, assets, litigation matters,
environmental compliance, cash-flow reports and personnel as may reasonably
be requested; _provided_ that no investigation pursuant to this _Section 6.6_
shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by the
Company herein or the conditions to the obligations of the parties hereto
under this Agreement; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the foregoing shall
not require the Company to (a) permit any inspection, or to disclose any
information, that in the reasonable judgment of the Company (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) would result in the disclosure
of any trade secrets of third parties or violate any of its obligations with
respect to confidentiality if the Company shall have used reasonable best
efforts to obtain the consent of such third party to such inspection or
disclosure or (b) disclose any privileged information of the Company. All
requests for information made pursuant to this _Section 6.6_ shall be
directed to the executive officer or other Person designated by the Company.
All such information shall be governed by the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement and the Common Interest Agreement (as defined in _Section 10.7_
below), as applicable.

 

6.7. _Publicity_. The initial press release regarding the Merger shall be a
press release issued by Parent. Thereafter, each of the Company and Parent
shall consult with the other prior to issuing any press releases or otherwise
making public announcements with respect to the Merger and the other
Transactions and prior to making any filings with any third party and/or
any Governmental Entity (including any national securities exchange) with
respect thereto, except in any case in which the management of any such party
hereto shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) that such disclosure is required by applicable Law or
by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any national
securities exchange or by the request of any Governmental Entity.

 

6.8. _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) Parent agrees that, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and
continuing through the end of the calendar year in which the Closing occurs,
the Employees of the Company will continue to be provided "employee welfare
benefits" (within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA) and "employee pension
benefits" (within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA) (excluding in each
case, equity awards and long-term incentive compensation) that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than the employee welfare benefits and employee
pension

 



-48-  benefits that are generally made available to similarly situated employees
of Parent or its Subsidiaries (other than the Company). Parent will use
reasonable best efforts to cause any employee benefit plans of Parent (" _
_Parent Plans__ ") which the Employees of the Company are entitled to
participate in to (1) take into account for purposes of eligibility, vesting
and benefit accrual thereunder, except for benefit accrual under defined
benefit pension plans or frozen plans, for purposes of qualifying for
subsidized early retirement benefits or to the extent it would result in a
duplication of benefits, service by Employees of the Company as if such
service were with Parent, to the same extent such service was credited under
a comparable Benefit Plan and (2) with respect to the Benefit Plan plan year
in which the Closing occurs, cause any deductible, coinsurance and out-of-
pocket expenses incurred by any Employee and his or her covered dependents
under a comparable Benefit Plan during the portion of such plan year ending on
the date such Employees participation in the corresponding Parent Plan begins
to be taken into account under such Parent Plan for purposes of satisfying
all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable
to the Employee and his or her covered dependents for that plan year as if
such amounts had been paid in connection with such Parent Plan. Parent shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor in accordance with their
terms all employee benefit obligations to current and former Employees, in
each case to the extent set forth on Section 6.8(a) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, all employee severance plans (or policies) in existence on the date
hereof and all employment or severance agreements entered into by the Company
or adopted by the Company Board prior to the date hereof.

 

(b) Subject to the obligations set forth in _Section 6.8(a)_ above,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, if requested by Parent in writing,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms of the applicable plan
or arrangement, the Company shall (i) cause to be amended its employee benefit
plans and arrangements to the extent necessary to provide that no employees
of Parent and its Subsidiaries shall commence participation therein following
the Effective Time unless the Surviving Corporation or such Subsidiary
explicitly authorizes such participation and (ii) cause the Companys
401(k) Plan to be terminated, contingent on the occurrence of the Closing,
effective the business day preceding the day on which the Effective Time
occurs. In the event that Parent requests that the Companys 401(k) Plan be
terminated, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that the Companys
401(k) Plan will be terminated, as set forth above, pursuant to resolution of
the Company Board (the form and substance of which shall be subject to review
and approval by Parent at least three (3) business days prior to the
Effective Time) not later than the day immediately preceding the Effective
Time.

(c) (i) At least five (5) business days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall submit for approval by its stockholders, in conformance with
Section 280G of the Code and the regulations thereunder (the " _ _280G
Stockholder Vote__ "), any payments that could constitute a "parachute
payment" pursuant to Section 280G of the Code (each, a " _ _Parachute
Payment__ "), (ii) at least seven (7) business days prior to the Closing
Date, the right to any Parachute Payment shall have been irrevocably waived by
each of the applicable "disqualified individuals" (as defined under Section
280G of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder) and (iii) the
Company shall have delivered to Parent true and complete copies of all
disclosures and documents that comprise the stockholder approval of each
Parachute Payment in sufficient time to allow Parent to comment thereon but no
less than five (5) business days prior to the 280G Stockholder Vote, and
shall reflect all reasonable comments of Parent thereon. To the extent any
disqualified individual fails to waive any Parachute Payments or the Company
fails to perform a proper 280G Stockholder Vote with respect to any
disqualified individual, then the value of any otherwise available U.S.
federal Tax deduction associated with Parachute Payments made by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their affiliates on or following the Closing
Date and lost pursuant to Section 280G of the Code shall be treated as
Transaction Expenses.

 



-49- (d) The Company agrees to cause each of its officers and directors to repay
any outstanding loans or notes to the Company prior to or at the Effective
Time.

(e) The Company will be responsible for fulfilling all obligations under
WARN and any similar state or local Law that are triggered prior to the
Effective Time, and Parent will be responsible for fulfilling all obligations
under WARN and any similar state or local Law that are triggered from and
after the Effective Time. In furtherance of the foregoing, if requested by
Parent in writing, the Company will provide Parent with a list of each
Employee whose employment has terminated within the 90 days preceding the
Closing Date, including whether such termination was voluntary or
involuntary, and if involuntary, whether with or without cause.

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to (i) be treated as an
amendment of any particular Benefit Plan (other than _Section 6.8(b)_), (ii)
create any third-party beneficiary rights in any employee of the Company, or
any beneficiary or dependent thereof, with respect to the compensation, terms
and conditions of employment and/or benefits that may be provided to any
continuing employee by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
affiliates or under any benefit plan which Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or any of their affiliates may maintain or (iii) prevent Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their affiliates from (A) amending or
terminating any particular benefit plan in accordance with its terms or (B)
terminating the employment of any particular employee.

6.9. _Director and Officer Indemnification; D andO Insurance_.

 

(a) _Director and Officer Indemnification_.

 

(i) _Company Indemnified Parties_. From and after the Effective Time, each of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation agrees that it will indemnify and hold
harmless each present and former director and officer of the Company when
acting in such capacity, determined as of the Effective Time (the " _ _Company
Indemnified Parties__ "), against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
incurred in connection with any civil, criminal or administrative action,
suit, claim, investigation or other proceeding (other than any
such proceeding brought by or on behalf of, or otherwise involving as a
plaintiff or a claimant, a Holder or Holders) arising out of matters existing
or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the
Company would have been permitted under Delaware law and its certificate of
incorporation or by-laws in effect on the date hereof to indemnify such Person
(and Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as
incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, _provided_ that
the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such
advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to
indemnification); and _provided_ , _further_ , that any determination required
to be made with respect to whether a directors or officers conduct complies
with the standards set forth under Delaware law and the Companys certificate
of incorporation and bylaws shall be made by independent counsel selected by
the Surviving Corporation. The Company Indemnified Parties shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to seek full recovery under DandO Insurance and
any other applicable insurance policies covering any Loss by exhausting any
available remedies against insurers to the same extent as they would if such
Loss were not subject to indemnification hereunder or under the Companys
or the Surviving Corporations certificate of incorporation or bylaws. In the
event that an insurance or other recovery is made by any Company Indemnified
Party with respect to any Loss for which any such Person has been indemnified
hereunder, then a refund equal to the aggregate amount of the recovery (net
of any reasonable costs in connection with such recovery) shall be promptly
delivered to the indemnifying party.

 



 



-50- (ii) _Indemnification Procedures_. Any Company Indemnified Party wishing to
claim indemnification under this _Section 6.9(a)_, upon learning of any such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Parent
thereof, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve Parent or the
Surviving Corporation of any liability it may have to such Company
Indemnified Party except to the extent such failure materially prejudices the
indemnifying party. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (A)
Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to assume the defense
thereof and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable to such
Company Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any
other expenses subsequently incurred by such Company Indemnified Parties in
connection with the defense thereof, except that if Parent or the Surviving
Corporation elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the Company
Indemnified Parties advises that there are issues which raise conflicts of
interest between Parent or the Surviving Corporation and the Company
Indemnified Parties, the Company Indemnified Parties may retain counsel
satisfactory to them, and Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall pay all
reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Company Indemnified
Parties promptly as statements therefor are received; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated pursuant to this
_Section 6.9(a)(ii)_ to pay for only one firm of counsel for all Company
Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction unless the use of one counsel for such
Company Indemnified Parties would present such counsel with a conflict of
interest, _provided_ , that the fewest number of counsels necessary to avoid
conflicts of interest shall be used; (B) the Company Indemnified Parties will
cooperate in the defense of any such matter; and (C) Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected without their
prior written consent; and _provided_ , _further_ , that Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall not have any obligation hereunder to any Company
Indemnified Party if and when a court of competent jurisdiction shall
ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final, that the
indemnification of such Company Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated
hereby is prohibited by applicable Law. If such indemnity is not available
with respect to any Company Indemnified Party, then the Surviving Corporation
and the Company Indemnified Party shall contribute to the amount payable in
such proportion as is appropriate to reflect relative faults and benefits.

(iii) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (A) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (B) shall transfer all
or substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual,
corporation or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this _Section
6.9(a)_.

 



-51- (iv) The provisions of this _Section 6.9(a)_ are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Company Indemnified
Parties.

(v) The rights of the Company Indemnified Parties under this  _Section
6.9(a)_ shall be in addition to any rights such Company Indemnified Parties
may have under the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company, or
under any applicable Contracts or Laws.

 

(b) _D andO Insurance_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall obtain
and fully pay for "tail" insurance policies with a claims period of at least
six (6) years from and after the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with
the same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier
with respect to directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance (collectively, " _ _D andO Insurance__") with benefits and
levels of coverage at least as favorable as the Companys existing policies
with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time (including in connection with this Agreement, the Merger or the other
Transactions or other actions contemplated hereby).

 

6.10. _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable
to the Merger or the other Transactions, the Company and the Company Board
shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that such
Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize
the effects of such statute or regulation on such Transactions.

6.11. _Litigation_. Each party hereto shall promptly provide the
other parties hereto with prompt notice of, and copies of all pleadings and
correspondence relating to, any civil, criminal or administrative actions,
suits, claims, hearings, arbitrations, investigations or other proceedings
against any such party hereto or any of its directors or officers arising out
of or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions (a " _ _Transaction
Proceeding__ "). The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate
in the defense, settlement, or compromise of any such Transaction Proceeding
against the Company or any of its directors or officers, and no such
settlement or compromise shall be agreed to without the prior written consent
of Parent.

 

6.12. _Financing Matters_.

 

(a) _Company Indebtedness_. At the Closing, Parent and the Company shall
effect the indefeasible payment in full in cash of all of the Companys
"Obligations" as defined under that certain Credit and Security Agreement,
dated as of May 29, 2014 and as amended on November 6, 2014, by and among the
Company, MidCap Funding V, LLC, and the lenders named therein (the " _
_Credit and Security Agreement__ "), together with (i) accrued and unpaid
interest thereon and (ii) any fees, expenses, premiums and penalties payable
with respect to the repayment of such indebtedness under the Credit and
Security Agreement, resulting from all events occurring prior to or as of the
Closing Date, including the Closing. The Obligations shall be considered
Funded Debt hereunder.

 



-52- (b) _Parent Financing_. From the date of this Agreement to the earlier of (x)
the Closing Date and (y) the date this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with its terms, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts, and shall
cause its officers, employees and advisors to use their reasonable best
efforts, to provide such reasonable and customary cooperation and information
as may be reasonably requested by Parent in connection with obtaining any
financing in connection with consummating the Merger and the other
Transactions, including (i) providing to Parent unaudited quarterly financial
statements of the Company within forty (40) calendar days after the end of
each fiscal quarter of the Company, audited annual financial statements of the
Company within sixty (60) calendar days after the end of each fiscal year of
the Company and any other financial information reasonably necessary to assist
Parent in preparing pro forma financial statements, (ii) providing to Parent
an electronic version of the Companys trademarks, service marks and
corporate logo (solely for the purpose of using such trademarks, service marks
and corporate logo in marketing materials in connection with facilitating the
syndication of the financing), and (iii) obtaining customary payoff letters,
Lien terminations and instruments of discharge to be delivered on the Closing
Date to allow for the payoff, discharge and termination in full on the Closing
Date of any debt of the Company that Parent desires to payoff, discharge
and terminate on the Closing Date or that is otherwise subject to mandatory
prepayment (howsoever described) as a result of the consummation of the Merger
or the other Transactions.

 

6.13. _Tax Matters_.

(a)  _Tax Indemnity_. The Holders shall indemnify and hold Parent harmless
from all Holder Taxes (as defined below), other than any Taxes of the Company
resulting from the receipt by the Company of the Asset Purchase Price. Parent,
in its sole discretion, shall elect to be paid the indemnification
obligations for Holder Taxes due and payable to Parent by the Holders either
(i) in accordance with the procedures set forth in _Section 9.2(a)(iii)_ or
(ii) by the Holders, severally and not jointly, in proportion to their
respective portions of the Merger Consideration in accordance with the Payment
Schedule in immediately available funds by wire transfer to Parent. The
parties agree to treat payments made pursuant to this _Section 6.13_ as
adjustments to the Merger Consideration for Tax purposes, unless otherwise
required by applicable Law. The limitations on indemnification set forth in
_Article IX_ of this Agreement shall not apply with respect to Holder Taxes.
For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent that the amounts otherwise payable
(x) to the Parent under this _Section 6.13(a)_ or _Section 6.13(c)_ or (y)
in respect of the Transfer Taxes (as defined below) are included as
liabilities in the Working Capital Adjustment Amount calculated pursuant to
_Section 4.1(c)_, such amounts shall not be paid pursuant to this _Section
6.13_.

 

(b) _Tax Refunds_. The Holders shall be entitled to any refunds of Taxes (or
credits for overpayment), including any interest received from a governmental
authority, attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or the portion of any
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date (" _ _Tax Refund__ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the amount of such Tax Refund shall be net of any related
expenses incurred in connection with the preparation and filing of any Tax
Return giving rise to such Tax Refund and any increases in Taxes (including as
the result of any reduction in Tax attributes) of the Company as a result of
such Tax Refund. Promptly upon the receipt of any such Tax Refund (or credit
for overpayment), Parent shall pay to Holders as additional consideration such
amounts within fifteen (15) days of receipt thereof or entitlement thereto.
If reasonably requested by the Holder Representative and at the Holders
expense, Parent shall take any action necessary for the Company to promptly
claim such Tax Refunds.

 



-53- (c) _Tax Returns._

 

(i) The Company shall prepare and timely file (including extensions) all Tax
Returns of the Company that are required to be filed on or before the Closing
Date, and such Tax Returns shall be prepared consistent with the past practice
of the Company unless otherwise required by applicable Law. The Company shall
timely pay or shall cause to be timely paid any and all Taxes due
with respect to such Tax Returns.

(ii) Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall file, or cause to be filed,
when due all Tax Returns of the Company that are required to be filed after
the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, shall provide the Holder Representative a
reasonable opportunity (of no less than fifteen (15) days) to review any Tax
Returns with respect to which the Holders may have any potential liability for
Taxes under _Section 6.13(a)_. The Holder Representative shall notify the
Parent of any objections that the Holder Representative may have to any items
set forth in any such draft Tax Return, and (A) the Parent or the Surviving
Corporation and the Holder Representative shall agree to consult and resolve
in good faith any such objections to the extent such objections relate solely
to Holder Taxes and (B) the Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall consider
in good faith any other reasonable objections. If the Parent or Surviving
Corporation and the Holder Representative are unable to reach an agreement
with respect to any objections described in clause (A) above within ten (10)
days after receipt by the Parent or Surviving Corporation of such objection
notice, the disputed items shall be resolved by an independent accountant and
any determination by the independent accountant shall be final. The costs,
fees and expenses of the independent accountant shall be borne by the Parent
and the Holders in inverse proportion as they may prevail on the disputed
items resolved by the independent accountant, utilizing the values of such
items as initially submitted by the parties to the independent accountant.

 

(iii) The Holders shall pay to Parent the Taxes for which the Holders are
liable pursuant to _Section 6.13(a)_ but which are payable with Tax Returns
to be filed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation pursuant to this _Section
6.13(c)_ at least ten (10) business days prior to the due date for the filing
of such Tax Returns.

 

(d) _Contest Provisions._

 

(i) Parent shall notify the Holder Representative in writing within ten (10)
business days of receipt by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their
respective Subsidiaries of notice of any pending or threatened Tax audits or
assessments which may affect the Tax liabilities of the Surviving Corporation
or its Subsidiaries for which Holders would be required to indemnify Parent
pursuant to _Section 6.13(a)_ (" _ _Tax Contest__ "), and failure to comply
with such notice requirement shall not be deemed a waiver of Parents right to
indemnification hereunder unless the Holders ability to contest such
liability is materially adversely affected.

(ii) The Holder Representative shall have the right, at its election and at
the Holders expense, to control any Tax Contest related solely to Holder
Taxes; _provided_ ,

 



-54-   _however_ , that (A) Parent shall have the right at its own expense,
directly or through its designated representatives, to participate fully in
such Tax Contest, including to review in advance and comment upon submissions
made in the course of such Tax Contest and to attend any in-person or
telephonic meetings, (B) Parents consent shall be required for any settlement
by the Holder Representative that could affect the Tax liability of Parent or
the Company in any taxable period to the extent such Tax liability is not or
would not be solely the liability of the Holders, provided that such consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, and (C) if the
Holder Representative does not assume or is not conducting the defense of any
such Tax Contest actively and diligently, Parent may assume control of such
Tax Contest and defend such Tax Contest in a manner as it may deem
appropriate including settling such Tax Contest after giving notice thereof
to the Holder Representative. With respect to all Tax Contests that the Holder
Representative does not elect to control pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence and all other proceedings with respect to Taxes, Parent shall have
the sole responsibility for, and shall control, such Tax Contest or
proceedings; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Holder Representatives consent
(not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for any
settlement that could affect the liability of the Holders under this
Agreement. These procedures, and not the procedures set forth in _Section
9.2(c)_, shall apply to any audits, examinations, proposed adjustments or
other type of controversy involving any Tax matters.

(e) _Transfer Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, all
transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such Taxes
and fees (including penalties and interest) incurred in connection with the
Merger and the other Transactions (" _ _Transfer Taxes__ ") shall be borne
equally by Parent, on one hand, and the Holders, on the other hand. Such
Transfer Taxes shall be paid by the party legally responsible to pay such
Taxes (with the Parent paying the Holders, if the Holders are legally
responsible to pay the tax, at least five (5) business days before the Tax
payment due date). The parties agree to cooperate in the filing of any returns
with respect to the Transfer Taxes, including by promptly supplying any
information in its possession that is reasonably necessary to complete such
returns.

(f) _Survival of Obligations_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, the provisions of this _Section 6.13_ shall survive for the
full period of all applicable statutes of limitations (giving effect to any
waiver, mitigation or extension thereof).

 

For purposes of this Agreement, (x) the term " _ _Holder Taxes__ " shall mean
any and all Taxes (1) imposed on or with respect to the Company, or for which
it may otherwise be liable, for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (as defined below)
and for the portion of any Straddle Period (as defined below) ending on the
Closing Date, (2) of any other Person for which the Company is or has been
liable as a transferee or successor, (3) resulting from or arising out of any
breach of or inaccuracy in any of the representations and warranties contained
in _Section 5.1(p)_ and any nonfulfillment or breach (A) by the Company of
_Section 6.1(a)(xiii)_ or _Section 6.13(c)(i)_ or (B) by the Holders or the
Holder Representative of _Section 6.13(c)(ii)_ through _Section 6.13(e)_,
(4) any obligation or other liability of the Company to indemnify any other
Person in respect of or relating to Taxes or for any amounts calculated by
reference to Taxes or to pay an amount pursuant to any Tax sharing or Tax
allocation agreement entered into prior to the Closing Date, (5) any Taxes of
the Holders, or any other direct or indirect beneficial owner of the Companys
securities, for any taxable period, and (6) any and all Taxes of any member of
any consolidated, combined or unitary group of which the Company or any
predecessor of the

 



-55-  Company is or was a member prior to the Closing by reason of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1502-6(a) or any analogous or similar foreign, state or
local Law. For the avoidance of doubt, the term "Holder Taxes" shall not
include any Excise Tax Amount taken into account in calculating the Merger
Consideration in accordance with _Section 4.1_ or any other Taxes that are
included as liabilities in the Working Capital Adjustment Amount calculated
pursuant to _Section 4.1(c)_. In the case of any Taxes that are imposed on or
with respect to income, gains, receipts, sales or payments and are payable for
a Straddle Period, the portion of such Taxes related to the Pre-Closing Tax
Period shall be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the
relevant Tax period ended on and included the Closing Date (and for such
purpose, the Taxable period of any partnership or other pass-through entity or
non-U.S. entity in which the Company holds a beneficial interest shall be
deemed to terminate at such time), and in the case of any other Taxes for a
Straddle Period, the portion of such Taxes related to the Pre-Closing Tax
Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable
period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days
in the taxable period prior to and including the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period; (y) the
term " _ _Pre-Closing Tax Period__ " shall mean any taxable year or other
taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date; and (z) the term " _
_Straddle Period__ " shall mean any taxable period that begins on or before
and ends after the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree
that, to the maximum extent permitted by Law, the income tax deduction
attributable to the payment of the Transactional Expenses shall be
attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period and Parent shall be responsible for
any increase in Taxes of the Company as a result of receipt by the Company of
the Asset Purchase Price.

6.14. _Regulatory Review_. Promptly (and in any event within three (3)
business days) after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall engage Ed
Kimmelman (the " _ _Regulatory Auditor__ ") for review and assessment of the
matters set forth on _Schedule 6.14_, with the scope of the Regulatory
Auditors audit to be consistent with medical devices industry best practice
and otherwise as mutually agreed by the parties acting in good faith. The
parties will reasonably cooperate with the Regulatory Auditor during the term
of his engagement. The Company shall give the Regulatory Auditor reasonable
and customary access to the books, records, employees, agents, vendors and
other relevant information of the Company to the extent reasonably necessary
or appropriate to conduct an audit within the agreed scope of the Regulatory

Indemnification Amount shall be immediately released from the Indemnity Escrow
Account and paid to Parent at the Effective Time in accordance with the
Escrow Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Holders and the Holder
Representative hereby agree to waive any right to dispute such Claim Notice or
the Closing Indemnification Amount pursuant to the procedures set forth in
_Section 9.2(c)_ below or otherwise. __

(b) _Indemnification by Parent and Surviving Corporation_. Parent and, after
the Closing, Parent and the Surviving Corporation each agree to and shall
indemnify the Holders and each of their respective officers, directors,
employees, beneficiaries, heirs and assigns and hold them harmless against any
Losses which any of them may suffer, sustain or become subject to, as the
result of, in connection with, relating or incidental to or by virtue of the
breach by Parent of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made
by Parent or Merger Sub or, after the Closing, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation in this Agreement. The amount of Parents and, after the Closing,
Parents and the Surviving Corporations aggregate liability under this
_Section 9.2(b)_ shall not exceed in the aggregate Parents payment
obligations under _Article IV_. All indemnification of the Holders by Parent
and the Surviving Corporation under this _Section 9.2_ shall be effected by
payment by Parent to the Payments Administrator in immediately
available funds by wire transfer to be further distributed to the Holders in
proportion to their respective portions of the Merger Consideration in
accordance with the Payment Schedule.

 



-66- (c) _Indemnification Procedures_.

 

 __(i) _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement, a party entitled to
indemnification under this Agreement shall be referred to as an " _
_Indemnified Party__ ," and a party obligated to indemnify an Indemnified
Party under this Agreement shall be referred to as an " _ _Indemnifying
Party__." __

 

 __(ii) _Claim Notices_. Each Indemnified Party shall provide written notice
to the Indemnifying Party of any claim or demand that it may have under this
_Section 9.2_ (a " _ _Claim Notice__ "), and, in the event that there is
asserted against an Indemnified Party any claim, demand, action, proceeding or
investigation instituted by a Person other than Parent or the Holder
Representative on behalf of the Holders for which the Indemnifying Party may
be obligated to indemnify hereunder (such claim, a " _ _Third Party Claim__
"), such Indemnified Party shall provide a Claim Notice with respect thereto
within thirty (30) days following such Indemnified Partys receipt of such
Third Party Claim; provided, however, that failure to give such notification
shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent
the Indemnifying Party shall have been actually materially prejudiced as a
result of such failure. __

(A) A Claim Notice with respect to a claim other than a Third Party Claim
shall contain a brief summary of the facts underlying or related to such claim
to the extent then known by the Indemnified Party, the subsection(s) of this
_Section 9.2_ pursuant to which the Indemnified Party is seeking
indemnification, a list of those representations, warranties and covenants
that the Indemnified Party believes may have been breached in relation to such
claim (if any), and a statement that the Indemnified Party seeks
indemnification for Losses relating to such claim. A Claim Notice need not
state the amount of Losses that the Indemnified Party believes it has incurred
or suffered relating to such claim.

 

(B) A Claim Notice with respect to a Third Party Claim shall contain a brief
summary of the facts underlying or relating to such claim to the extent then
known by the Indemnified Party and any correspondence or notices (including
court papers) received from the relevant third party (to the extent not
prohibited by contract or applicable Law from furnishing), the subsection(s)
of this _Section 9.2_ pursuant to which the Indemnified Party is seeking
indemnification, a list of those representations, warranties and covenants
that the Indemnified Party believes may have been breached in relation
to such claim (if any) and a statement that the Indemnified Party seeks
indemnification for Losses relating to such claim. From and after the delivery
of a Claim Notice with respect to a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party
shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party, within ten (10) business days after
the Indemnified Partys receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents
(including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating to the
Third Party Claim.

 



-67- (iii) _Control of Contests by Indemnifying Party_. The Indemnifying Party
shall be entitled to assume, conduct and control, through counsel of its own
choosing (reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party) and at its own
expense, the defense of any Third Party Claim (unless (A) the claim for
indemnification relates to or arises in connection with any criminal or
quasi-criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation;
(B) the Indemnified Party reasonably believes an adverse determination with
respect to the action, lawsuit, investigation, proceeding or other claim
giving rise to such claim for indemnification would be detrimental to or
injure the Indemnified Partys reputation or future business prospects; (C)
the claim seeks an injunction or equitable relief against the Indemnified
Party; (D) the Indemnified Party has been advised by counsel that a reasonable
likelihood exists of a conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and
the Indemnified Party; (E) upon petition by the Indemnified Party, the
appropriate court rules that the Indemnifying Party failed or is failing to
vigorously prosecute or defend such claim; or (F) the Indemnified Party
reasonably believes that the Loss relating to the claim could exceed the
maximum amount that such Indemnified Party could then be entitled to recover
under the applicable provisions of this _Section 9.2_; in which case the
Indemnified Party could elect in its sole discretion to assume, conduct
and control such defense and the Indemnifying Party, if it had previously
assumed such defense but no longer meets all of the conditions set forth in
clauses (A) through (F) above, will cooperate with the Indemnified Party with
respect to the prompt transfer of such defense from the Indemnifying Party to
the Indemnified Party if so elected by the indemnified party). The Holder
Representative shall act on behalf of the Holders where they are Indemnifying
Parties hereunder in assuming, conducting and controlling the defense of
Third Party Claims, including those Third Party Claims set forth in _Schedule
9.2(a)_ hereto. Unless the Indemnified Party shall have notified the
Indemnifying Party of the existence of one or more of the conditions set
forth in clauses (A) through (F) of the first sentence of this _Section
9.2(c)(iii)_, the Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days (or such
lesser number of days set forth in the Claim Notice as may be required by any
Governmental Entity, any court proceedings or regulatory inquiry or
investigation) from receipt of the Claim Notice with respect to a Third Party
Claim (the " _ _Notice Period__ ") to notify the Indemnified Party of its
election to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim; provided, that the
Holder Representative, on behalf of the Holders, shall be entitled,
immediately following the Effective Time without regard to the notice
provisions above, to assume the defense of those Third Party Claims set forth
in _Schedule 9.2(a)_ hereto. If the Indemnifying Party notifies the
Indemnified Party within the Notice Period that it elects to assume the
defense of such Third Party Claim, it shall be conclusively established for
purposes of this Agreement that the Indemnifying Party is obligated to and
shall indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnified Party from, against and in
respect of all Losses incurred or suffered by the Indemnified Party to the
extent arising from such Third Party Claim, without any reservation of rights,
subject only to the limitations contained in this _Section 9.2_. If the
Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party within the Notice Period
that it elects to defend such Third Party Claim, it shall have the right to
so defend, with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party that is reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnified Party, at the Indemnifying Partys expense. Once
the Indemnifying Party has duly assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim,
the Indemnified Party shall have the right, but not the obligation, to
participate in the defense thereof, including the opportunity to participate
in any discussions or correspondence with any Governmental Entity

 



-68-  and to employ counsel separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying
Party. The Indemnified Party shall participate in any such defense at its own
expense unless (x) the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party are both
named parties to the proceedings and the Indemnified Party shall have
concluded in good faith that representation of both parties by the same
counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests
between them or the availability to the Indemnified Party of one or more
defenses or counterclaims that are inconsistent with one or more of those that
may be available to the Indemnifying Party in respect thereof or (y)
the Indemnified Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim after the
Indemnifying Party has failed to diligently pursue a Third Party Claim it has
assumed, as provided hereunder, and in the case of both (x) or (y), all such
expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with such
participation shall be borne by the Indemnifying Party.

(iv) _Control of Contests by Indemnified Party_. In the event the
Indemnifying Party (A) elects not to defend the Indemnified Party against a
Third Party Claim, whether by not giving the Indemnified Party timely notice
of its desire to so defend or otherwise, (B) is not entitled to defend the
Third Party Claim as a result of the Indemnified Partys election to defend
the Third Party Claim as provided hereunder, or (C) after assuming the defense
of a Third Party Claim, fails to conduct the defense of such Third Party
Claim in a reasonably diligent manner within ten (10) days after receiving
written notice from the Indemnified Party to the effect that the Indemnifying
Party has so failed, the Indemnified Party shall have the right but not the
obligation to assume its own defense; it being understood that the Indemnified
Partys right to indemnification for such Third Party Claim shall not be
adversely affected by assuming the defense of such Third Party Claim.

 

(v) _Settlement of Claims_. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party shall have
assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have
no Liability with respect to any compromise or settlement of such claims
effected without its written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned) unless (A) there is no finding or admission
of any violation of Law or any violation of the rights of any person and no
effect on any other claims that may be made against the Indemnifying Party or
any of its Affiliates, (B) there is no imposition of a consent order,
decree, injunction or other equitable relief that would restrict the future
activity of the Indemnifying Party or its Affiliates, and (C) the sole relief
provided is monetary damages and a full, complete and unconditional release
from all Liabilities with respect to such claim is provided to the
Indemnifying Party and its Affiliates. The Indemnifying Party shall not
consent to the entry of judgment, admit any liability with respect to, or
settle, compromise or discharge, such Third Party Claim without the
Indemnified Partys prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) unless (x) there is no finding
or admission of any violation of Law or any violation of the rights of
any person and no effect on any other claims that may be made against the
Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, (y) there is no imposition of a
consent order, decree, injunction or other equitable relief that would
restrict the future activity of the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates, and
(z) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are concurrently paid in
full by the Indemnifying Party and a full, complete and unconditional release
from all Liabilities with respect to such claim is provided to the
Indemnified Party and its Affiliates.

 



-69- (vi) _Cooperation_. Each party shall cooperate, and cause their respective
Affiliates to cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any Third Party
Claim and shall furnish or cause to be furnished such records, information and
testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings,
trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.
Such cooperation also shall include the retention and, upon the Indemnifying
Partys request, the provision to the Indemnifying Party of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder;
provided, that such cooperation shall not unreasonably interfere with the
business or operations of such party. All Losses incurred or suffered by the
Indemnified Party in connection with responding to, complying with or
satisfying the Indemnifying Partys requests for cooperation shall be promptly
reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party disputes the
amount of, or otherwise refuses or fails to reimburse, any such Losses which
the Indemnified Party has incurred and for which the Indemnified Party has
sought reimbursement from the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall
not be obligated to continue providing cooperation with respect to the defense
of the relevant Third Party Claim until such dispute has been resolved or all
such Losses have been reimbursed in full. 

(d) _Loss Tax Benefits; Use of Insurance; Subrogation_. The amount of any
Losses subject to indemnification under this _Article IX_ shall be calculated
net of (i) any Loss Tax Benefit (as defined below), (ii) any insurance
proceeds received or receivable by the Indemnified Party on account of such
Losses and/or (iii) any indemnification paid or payable by any third party as
follows:

(i) The Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to seek
full recovery under all insurance policies covering any Loss by exhausting
any available remedies against insurers to the same extent as such Indemnified
Party would if such Loss were not subject to indemnification hereunder. In the
event that an insurance or other recovery is made by any Indemnified Party
with respect to any Loss for which any such Person has been indemnified
hereunder, then a refund equal to the aggregate amount of the recovery (net of
any reasonable costs in connection with such recovery) shall be promptly
delivered to the Indemnifying Party.

(ii) The Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to all rights of the
Indemnified Party in respect of any Loss borne by the Indemnifying Party. The
Indemnified Party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use reasonable
best efforts to bring indemnity claims against any third party who has an
indemnification obligation to any of them with respect to any Loss and to
diligently pursue such claims until finally adjudicated.

For purposes of this Agreement, " _ _Loss Tax Benefit__ " shall mean the
excess, if any, of the actual Tax savings or benefits to the Indemnified Party
arising from the accrual or payment of any such Losses over the actual Tax
detriment (such as lost amortization or depreciation or a tax imposed on
receipt of an indemnity payment) to the Indemnified Party resulting from or
arising out of such Loss.

 

(e) _Mitigation_. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, no
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to any indemnification under this
Agreement with respect to any breach of any representation, warranty or
covenant to the extent the Indemnified Party could have, with reasonable
efforts, mitigated or prevented the Loss with respect to such breach. Each
Indemnified Party shall take all reasonable steps to mitigate Losses for
which indemnification may be claimed by them pursuant to this Agreement upon
and after becoming aware of any event that could reasonably be expected to
give rise to any such Losses.

 



-70- (f) _Type of Damages_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, no Person shall be liable under this _Article IX_ for any (i)
exemplary or punitive damages or (ii) consequential, diminution in value
damages, lost profits or special damages, and, in particular, without
limitation, no "multiple of profits" or "multiple of cash flow" or similar
valuation methodology shall be used in calculating the amount of any Losses,
except (x) to the extent awarded in a final, non-appealable determination in
connection with a Third Party Claim, or (y) in the case of clause (ii), to
the extent such damages are reasonably foreseeable in connection with the
event that gave rise thereto or the matter or matters for which
indemnification is sought hereunder.

 

(g) _Remedies Exclusive_. Except in the case of a final adjudication of actual
fraud (and except for the Holder Representatives rights to indemnification
under _Section 10.1_), the remedies provided for in this _Article IX_ shall
constitute the sole and exclusive remedy for any post-Closing claims made for
breach of the representations, warranties and covenants contained in this
Agreement and for Third Party Claims. To the maximum extent permitted by law,
the parties hereto (other than the Holder Representative) and the Indemnified
Parties hereby waive all other rights and remedies with respect to any matter
in any way relating to this Agreement or arising in connection herewith,
whether under any laws at common law, in equity or otherwise. Except as
provided in this _Article IX_ (and without prejudice to the Holder
Representatives rights under _Section 10.1_), no claim, action or remedy
shall be brought or maintained by any party against any other party, and no
recourse shall be brought or granted against any of them, by virtue of or
based upon any alleged misstatement or omission respecting an inaccuracy in or
breach of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of
any of the parties hereto set forth or contained in this Agreement.

 

(h) _Characterization of Indemnification Payments_. The parties agree to treat
all payments made pursuant to this _Article IX_ as adjustments to the Merger
Consideration for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required to applicable Law.
Any Loss for which any Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under
this _Article IX_ shall be determined without duplication of recovery by
reason of the state of facts giving rise to such Loss constituting a breach of
more than one representation, warranty or covenant. No Indemnified Party shall
be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement for any Loss arising from
a breach of any representation, warranty or covenant set forth herein (and
the amount of any Loss incurred in respect of such breach shall not be
included in the calculation of any limitations on indemnification set forth
herein) to the extent such Loss was already taken into account in calculating
Net Working Capital as provided in _Section 4.1(b)(iii)_.

(i)  _Coordination with Tax Covenant_. In the event any provision of this
_Article IX_ is inconsistent with any provision of _Section 6.13_, the
provisions of _Section 6.13_ shall control.

-73- (iii) The Holder Representative may perform any and all of its duties through
its agents, representatives, attorneys, custodians, and/or nominees.

(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary:

 

(A) the Holder Representative shall not be required to have any duties or
responsibilities except for those expressly set forth in the HR Agreements,
and under no circumstances will the Holder Representative be deemed to be a
fiduciary to any Holder or any other Person under the HR Agreements;

 

(B) no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or
Liabilities on behalf of any Holder shall otherwise exist against or with
respect to the Holder Representative;

(C) the Holder Representative is obligated only to perform the duties
specifically set forth in the HR Agreements, and the Holder Representative

agreement, instrument, or document.

 

(d) _Indemnification_. The Company (prior to the Closing) and the Holders

Representative from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages,

staffs and all expense of document location, duplication and shipment)
(collectively, " _ _Representative Losses__ ") arising out of or in connection
with the Holder Representatives execution and performance of this Agreement
and the agreements ancillary hereto, in each case as such Representative Loss
is suffered or incurred; provided, that in the event that any such
Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to have been directly caused by the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Holder Representative, the
Holder Representative will reimburse the Holders the amount of such
indemnified Representative Loss to the extent attributable to such gross
negligence or willful misconduct. If not paid directly to the Holder
Representative by the Holders, any such Representative Losses may be recovered
by the Holder Representative from (i) the funds in the Holder Representative
Expense Account and (ii) the amounts in the Indemnity Escrow Account at
such time as remaining amounts would otherwise be distributable to the
Holders in accordance with this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement; provided,
that while this _Section 10.1(d)_ allows the Holder Representative to be paid
from the Holder Representative Expense Account and the Indemnity Escrow
Account, this does not relieve the Holders from their obligation to promptly
pay such Representative Losses as they are suffered or incurred, nor does it
prevent the Holder Representative from seeking any remedies available to it
at law or otherwise. In no event will the Holder Representative be required to
advance its own funds on behalf of the Holders or otherwise. For the avoidance
of doubt, this _Section 10.1(d)_ shall survive the resignation or removal of
the Holder Representative and/or the termination of any HR Agreement.

 



-74- (e) _Limitation of Liability_. THE HOLDER REPRESENTATIVE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE,
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, FOR ANY (i) LOSSES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION
WITH THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE HOLDER REPRESENTATIVE UNDER THE HR
AGREEMENTS OR AGREEMENTS ANCILLARY THERETO, OTHER THAN LOSSES OR THAT HAVE
DIRECTLY RESULTED FROM THE HOLDER REPRESENTATIVES WILLFUL MISCONDUCT, BAD
FAITH OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR (ii) SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE
DAMAGES OR LOSSES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS), EVEN IF THE
HOLDER REPRESENTATIVE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES OR
DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION.

(f) _Resignation; Successor Holder Representative_.

(i) The Holder Representative may resign by furnishing written notice of its
resignation to the Holders, Parent and the Company (if such resignation
occurs prior to the Closing) or to Parent and the Surviving Corporation (if
resignation occurs after the Closing). Such resignation shall be effective
thirty (30) days after the delivery of such notice or upon the earlier
appointment by the Holders of a successor, and the Holder Representatives
sole responsibility thereafter shall be to safely keep any assets then held by
it on behalf of the Holders and to deliver the same to a successor
Holder Representative. If the Holders have failed to appoint a successor
Holder Representative prior to the expiration of thirty (30) days following
the delivery of such notice of resignation, the Holder Representative may
petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a
successor Holder Representative or for other appropriate relief, and any such
resulting appointment shall be binding upon the Holders, Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company and the Surviving Corporation. 

(ii) Any corporation or association into which the Holder Representative may
be converted or merged, or with which it may be consolidated, or to which it
may sell or transfer all or substantially all of its corporate trust business
and assets as a whole or substantially as a whole, or any corporation or
association resulting from any such conversion, sale, merger, consolidation
or transfer to which the Holder Representative is a party, shall be and become
the successor Holder Representative under the HR Agreements and shall have and
succeed to the rights, powers, duties, immunities, privileges,
liabilities and obligations of its predecessor, without the execution or
filing of any instrument or paper or the performance of any further act.

(g)  _Reasonable Reliance_. In the performance of its duties hereunder, the
Holder Representative shall be entitled to (i) rely upon any document or
instrument reasonably believed by the Holder Representative to be genuine,
accurate as to content and signed by any Holder or any party hereunder and
(ii) assume that any Person purporting to give any notice in accordance with
the provisions hereof has been duly authorized to do so.

 



-75- (h) _Removal of Holder Representative_. A majority in interest of the Holders,
voting together as a single class, shall have the right at any time to remove
the then-acting Holder Representative and to appoint a successor Holder
Representative; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither such removal of the
then-acting Holder Representative nor such appointment of a successor Holder
Representative shall be effective until the delivery to Parent and the Escrow
Agent of executed counterparts of a writing signed by such majority in
interest of the Holders with respect to such removal and appointment,
together with an acknowledgement signed by the successor Holder Representative
appointed in such writing that he, she or it accepts the responsibilities of
successor Holder Representative and agrees to perform and be bound by all of
the provisions of the HR Agreements applicable to the Holder Representative.
Each successor Holder Representative shall have all of the power, authority,
rights and privileges conferred by this Agreement upon the original
Holder Representative, and the term " Holder Representative" as used herein
and in the Escrow Agreement shall be deemed to include any interim or
successor Holder Representative.

 

(i) _Access to Information_. The Holder Representative shall have access to
information of and concerning any claim for indemnification under _Section
9.2_ that was in the possession, custody or control of the Company, its
Representatives or the Holders (prior to the Closing) and is in the
possession, custody or control of Parent or the Surviving Corporation (after
the Closing); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Holder Representative shall
treat confidentially and not, except in connection with enforcing its rights
under the HR Agreements, disclose any non-public information from or
concerning any such claims to any Person (except to the Holder
Representatives attorneys, accountants or other advisers and to the Holders.

(j)  _Effect on Rights of Parent and Merger Sub_. Anything set forth in this
_Section 10.1_ to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall anything
contained in this _Section 10.1_ amend, alter, waive, terminate (or
otherwise limit) or be deemed to amend, alter, waive terminate (or otherwise
limit) any of the rights and remedies of Parent or Merger Sub set forth in any
other provision of this Agreement (including the schedules and exhibits
hereto), including  _Section 4.1_ and _Section 9.2_ of this Agreement.

10.2. _Modification or Amendment_. Subject to the provisions of the
applicable Laws, at any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties hereto
may modify or amend this Agreement, by written agreement executed and
delivered by duly authorized officers of each of the respective parties.

 

10.3. _Waiver of Conditions_. The conditions to each of the parties
obligations to consummate the Merger are for the sole benefit of such party
and may be waived by such party in whole or in part to the extent permitted by
applicable Laws.

10.4. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each such counterpart being deemed to be an original instrument,
and all such counterparts shall together constitute the same agreement.

 



-76- 10.5. _GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL; SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE_.

 

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL BE
INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE
STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF TO
THE EXTENT THAT SUCH PRINCIPLES WOULD DIRECT A MATTER TO ANOTHER JURISDICTION.

-80- 10.12. _Interpretation; Construction_.

only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to
limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. Where a reference in
this Agreement is made to an Article, Section, Annex, Exhibit or Schedule,
such reference shall be to an Article, Section, Annex, Exhibit or Schedule to
this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation" or words of like import. The
use of the masculine, feminine or neuter gender, or the singular or plural
form of words used herein (including defined terms) shall not limit any
provision of this Agreement. Reference herein to a particular Person includes
such Persons successors and assigns to the extent such successors and
assigns are permitted by the terms of any applicable Contract. Reference to a
particular Contract (including this Agreement), document or instrument means
such Contract, document or instrument as amended or modified and in effect
from time to time in accordance with the terms thereof. Any reference to a
particular Law means such Law as amended, modified or supplemented (including
all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder) and, unless otherwise
provided, as in effect from time to time. The terms "cash" and "$" mean United
States Dollars. The use of the terms "hereunder," "hereof," "hereto" and words
of similar import shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular Article, Section, paragraph or clause of, or Annex to, this
Agreement.

 

(b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement. 

(c) The Company has or may have set forth information in the Company
Disclosure Letter in a section thereof that corresponds to the section of
this Agreement to which it relates. The fact that any item of information is
disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter shall not be construed to mean that
such information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement.

 

10.13. _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation of
Law or otherwise; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may designate, by
written notice to the Company, another wholly-owned direct or indirect
Subsidiary in lieu of Merger Sub, in which event all references herein to
Merger Sub shall be deemed references to such other Subsidiary, except that
all representations and warranties made herein with respect to Merger Sub as
of the date hereof shall be deemed representations and warranties made with
respect to such other Subsidiary as of the date of such designation, provided
that any such designation shall not materially impede or delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise
materially impede the rights of the stockholders of the Company under this
Agreement. Any purported assignment in violation of this Agreement is void.

10.14. _Conflicts and Privileges_. It is acknowledged by each of the parties
hereto that the Holder Representative and the Holders have been represented
by Wiggin and Dana LLP (" _ _Wiggin__ ") in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby. Parent and Merger Sub hereby agree that in the event that
a dispute arises after the Closing between Parent and its Subsidiaries, on
the one hand, and the Holder Representative and the Holders, on the other
hand, Wiggin may represent the Holder Representative and the Holders in such
dispute even though the interests of the Holder Representative and the
Holders may be directly adverse to Parent and its Subsidiaries, and even
though Wiggin may have represented the Company in a matter substantially
related to such dispute, or may be handling ongoing matters for the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries. Parent and Merger Sub further agree that, as
to all communications among Wiggin, the Company, the Holder Representative
and/or any Holder that relate in any way to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, the attorney-client privilege and the expectation of client
confidence belongs to the Holder Representative and the Holders and may be
controlled by the Holder Representative and the Holders and shall not pass to,
or be claimed by, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute
arises between Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, on the
one hand, and a third party other than the Holder Representative or a Holder,
on the other hand, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries may
assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential
communications to such third party.
