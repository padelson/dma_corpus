selected by mutual agreement of Parent and the Holders' Representative within
ten (10) Business Days following the giving of the Dispute Submission Notice,
each of Parent and the Holders' Representative shall promptly select an
accounting firm and promptly cause such two accounting firms to mutually
select a third independent accounting firm to act as the Accounting Firm
within twenty (20) Business Days of the giving of the Dispute Submission
Notice. The Accounting Firm will promptly, in accordance with the rules set
forth in the Accounting Firm's engagement letter and its customary practices,
review only those unresolved items and amounts specifically set forth and
objected to in the Dispute Notice and resolve the dispute with respect to each
such specific unresolved item and amount in accordance with this Agreement. In
any such case, a single partner of the Accounting Firm selected by such
Accounting Firm in accordance with its normal procedures and having expertise
with respect to settlement of such disputes and the industry in which the
Acquired Companies operate shall act for the Accounting Firm in the
determination proceeding, and the Accounting Firm shall render a written
decision as to each disputed matter, including a statement in reasonable
detail of the basis for its decision and its calculation of the Final Cash
Purchase Price (as defined below) based on such decision. In no event shall
the decision of the Accounting Firm (i) provide for a calculation of any
element of the Cash Purchase Price that is less than the lower calculation
thereof shown in the Proposed Final Closing Statement or in the Dispute Notice
or greater than the higher calculation thereof shown in the Proposed Final
Closing Statement or in the Dispute Notice. The fees and expenses of the
Accounting Firm shall be apportioned among the Holders' Representative and
Parent based upon the relative extent to which the positions of the Holders'
Representative and Parent are upheld by the Accounting Firm. The relative
extent to which such positions are upheld will be determined by comparing (a)
the difference between the Final Cash Purchase Price as finally determined
pursuant to this _Section 2.11.4_ and the Cash Purchase Price assuming all of
the positions asserted by Parent had been upheld in their entirety by the
Accounting Firm and (b) the difference between the Final Cash Purchase Price
as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.11.4_ and the Cash Purchase
Price assuming all of the positions asserted by the Holders' Representative
had been upheld in their entirety by the Accounting Firm. By way of
illustration, (i) if Parent's calculations would have resulted in a $100,000
net payment from the Adjustment Escrow Account to Parent (or if the amount on
deposit in the Adjustment Escrow Account is not sufficient, from the Indemnity
Escrow Account), the Holders' Representative's calculations would have
resulted in a $100,000 net payment to the Holders from Parent and the
Accounting Firm's final determination results in an aggregate net payment of
$50,000 to the Holders under _Section 2.11.5_ , Parent and the Holders'
Representative shall pay 75% and 25%, respectively, of such fees and expenses
and (ii) if each of such parties' calculation differs from the Accounting
Firm's calculation by $100,000 or more, Parent and the Holders' Representative
shall split such fees and expenses evenly. The decision of the Accounting Firm
with respect to the disputed items of the Proposed Final Closing Statement
submitted to it will be final, conclusive and binding on the parties. Each of
the parties to this Agreement agrees to use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate with the Accounting Firm (including by executing a
customary engagement letter reasonably acceptable to it) and to cause the
Accounting Firm to resolve any such dispute as soon as practicable after the
commencement of the Accounting Firm's engagement.

 



 

 



   



 

2.11.5. _Cash Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 



 

(a) As used herein, the " _Final Cash Purchase Price_ " shall mean (i) if
a Dispute Notice is not delivered within the 60 Business Day period provided
in _Section 2.11.3_ , the Cash Purchase Price reflected in the Proposed Final
Closing Statement as prepared by Parent or (ii) if such a Dispute Notice is
delivered within the 60 Business Day period provided in _Section 2.11.3_ , the
Cash Purchase Price as finally determined pursuant to the dispute resolution
provisions of this _Section 2.11.5_ reflecting (x) adjustments agreed to in
writing by Parent and the Holders' Representative with respect to any matters
raised in the Dispute Notice that are resolved by agreement of the parties and
(y) adjustments made pursuant to the decision of the Accounting Firm with
respect to any matters raised in the Dispute Notice that are resolved by the

Purchase Price set forth in the Estimated Closing Statement, the Closing Per
Share Cash Merger Consideration and Closing Cash Option Consideration will be
recalculated by the Surviving Corporation and the Holders' Representative
using such final figures and Pro Rata Shares of each of the Holders set forth
in the Pro-Rata Schedule in lieu of such estimated figures, and Parent shall
pay (1) by wire transfer of immediately available funds, to each Stockholder
such Stockholder's Pro Rata Share of the amount, if any, by which such Final
Cash Purchase Price exceeds the Estimated Cash Purchase Price and (2) by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the Surviving Corporation for the
benefit of each Option Holder (to be paid to such Option Holders in the first
payroll period after such amount has become due and payable), such Option
Holder's Pro Rata Share of the amount, if any, by which such Final Cash
Purchase Price exceeds the Estimated Cash Purchase Price. Alternatively, the
amount, if any, by which such Estimated Cash Purchase Price exceeds such Final
Cash Purchase Price shall be paid to Parent from the Adjustment Escrow Account
in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement and this Agreement, and
if the amount on deposit in the Adjustment Escrow Account is not sufficient to
make payment in full to Parent specified in this sentence, then from the
Indemnity Escrow Account an amount equal to any such deficiency. To the extent
that the deficiency referred to in the immediately preceding sentence exceeds
the amount of the Indemnity Escrow Funds, no further payments shall be
required in respect of such excess.

 



 

(c) Any payments under this _Section 2.11.5_ shall be made within five (5)
Business Days following the determination of the Final Cash Purchase Price and
funds then remaining in the Adjustment Escrow Account, if any, shall be
released to (i) the Stockholders by the Escrow Agent in accordance with their
respective Pro Rata Shares and the instructions contained in their Transmittal
Documents and (ii) to the Surviving Corporation to be distributed to the
Option Holders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares via the
Surviving Corporation's payroll system in the first payroll period after such
amount has become due and payable.

 



 

 



   



 

2.12. _Escrow and Holders ' Representative Fund_.

 



 

2.12.1. The Escrow Agent will hold the Escrow Funds in escrow pursuant to
and in accordance with this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. All then
remaining Indemnity Escrow Funds shall be released on the First Survival End
Date, subject to holdback for unresolved claims, as more fully set forth in
the Escrow Agreement. Any release of Indemnity Escrow Funds or Adjustment
Escrow Funds to the Holders shall be made (i) by distribution by the Holders'
Representative (with the reasonable assistance of the Surviving Corporation)
to the Stockholders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares and
the instructions contained in the Transmittal Documents and (ii) to the
Surviving Corporation to be distributed to the Option Holders in accordance
with their respective Pro Rata Shares via the Surviving Corporation's payroll
system in the first payroll period after such amount has become due and
payable.

 



 

2.12.2. The Holders' Representative Fund Amount, and all interest and
other amounts earned thereon (the total of such amounts in the account, at any
given time, the " _Holders '_ ___Representative_ ___Fund_ "), will be held by
the Holders' Representative for the purpose of paying Holders' Representative
Expenses incurred by the Holders' Representative as contemplated by _Section
10.13_. Any release of the Holders' Representative Fund shall be made (i) by
distribution by the Escrow Agent to the Stockholders in accordance with their
respective Pro Rata Shares and (ii) to the Surviving Corporation to be
distributed to the Option Holders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata
Shares via the Surviving Corporation's payroll system in the first payroll
period after such amount has become due and payable.

 



 

2.13. _Illustrative Calculations_. For illustrative purposes only,
_Exhibit_ _I_ sets forth example calculations of the Cash Purchase Price, the

total amount of the Debt Financing. Assuming the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in _Article 5_ and the completion of the Marketing Period

commitments under the Debt Commitment Letter have been withdrawn or rescinded
in any respect.

7.2.20. agree or commit to do any of the things referred to elsewhere in
_Section 7.2.1_ through _7.2.19_ above.

 



 

From the date of this Agreement until the Closing, or the earlier termination
of this Agreement in accordance with _Article 8_ , in the event any Acquired
Company (i) amends, modifies, supplements or waives any rights or seeks
remedies under any Material Company Contract or (ii) enters into any Contract
that if it had been entered into prior to the date hereof would have been a
Material Company Contract, the Company shall promptly notify Parent of such
event and provide such information regarding such event as Parent may
reasonably request.

 



 

 



   



 

7.3. _Confidentiality_.

 



 

7.3.1. _Confidentiality Agreement_. The provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement, to the extent not inconsistent with the express terms of this
Agreement, are hereby ratified, confirmed and agreed to as though fully set
forth herein. The Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in effect until the
Closing, at which point it shall terminate.

 



 

7.3.2. _Announcements_. Any public announcements, reports, statements or
press releases by any party hereto or any of its Affiliates regarding the
Contemplated Transactions must be approved in advance (as to form, content,
timing and manner of distribution) by each of Parent and the Holders'
Representative, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed; _provided_ , that any party may issue a press release, make a
public announcement or make disclosure in filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") to the extent necessary for such party to
comply with applicable securities laws, and, shall provide a copy to the
Holders' Representative (if such party is Parent or, after the Closing, the
Company) or Parent (if such party is the Holders' Representative or, prior to
the Closing, the Company) in advance of its release such that the other party
has a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such filings; _provided_
_further_ the parties acknowledge that Parent will be required by rules and
regulations of the SEC (i) to announce the signing of this Agreement and to
file such announcement and a copy of this Agreement on Form 8-K and (ii) to
file copies of press releases and material agreements with respect to the Debt
Financing, including Definitive Agreements, on Form 8-K. Parent shall provide
the Company with the form of the proposed press release and content of other
proposed disclosure (and reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon)
prior to filing. In addition, Parent may provide additional financial and
other information regarding the Acquired Companies in any investor
presentation, offering and other documentation related to a Debt Financing,
related script or press release, the contents of which shall be mutually
agreed upon by the Company and Parent, and any information contained therein
may be included in a Form 8-K to the extent required by the rules and
regulations of the SEC based on the advice of counsel to Parent; _provided_
that Parent will not disclose, either publicly or selectively, any material
and non-public information about the Company that is not contained in such
investor presentation, offering or other documentation related to a Debt
Financing, related script or press release. The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to assist Parent in preparing any such filings or other
materials as requested by Parent, in each case to the extent consistent with
the Company's obligations under Section 7.13.

 



 

7.4. _Preparation for Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions
hereof, each of the Company and Parent agrees to use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary or desirable under applicable Legal Requirements to
consummate the Contemplated Transactions as promptly as practicable, including
preparing and filing as promptly as practicable with the applicable
Governmental Authorities all documentation to effect all necessary filings,
notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information,
applications and other documents necessary to consummate the Contemplated
Transactions. In furtherance (and not in limitation) of the foregoing:

 



 

 



   



 

7.4.1. _Antitrust Matters_. Each of the Company and Parent agrees to file
all appropriate notifications and filings pursuant to the HSR Act or any
applicable foreign antitrust and competition laws with respect to the
Contemplated Transactions in the most expeditious manner practicable, but in
any event within ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof and to supply
promptly any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested of such party by the relevant Governmental Authorities in connection
with the HSR Act or any applicable foreign antitrust and competition laws.
Each of the Company and Parent agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to
take such actions as are necessary or reasonably advisable to promptly avoid
or eliminate any impediment under the HSR Act or any applicable foreign
antitrust and competition laws that may be asserted by any United States or
foreign governmental antitrust authority so as to enable the parties to
expeditiously consummate the Contemplated Transactions, including in the case
of Parent and Merger Sub committing to or effecting, by consent decree, hold
separate order or otherwise, the sale or disposition of such assets,
securities, facilities or other properties as are required to be divested in
order to facilitate the expiration or termination of the HSR Act waiting
period or otherwise obtain all applicable merger control clearances under the
HSR Act or any applicable foreign antitrust and competition laws. Parent shall
pay the filing fees associated with the HSR filings and any applicable foreign
antitrust and competition laws. Each of the Company and Parent agrees not to
participate in any substantive meeting or discussion, either in person or by
telephone, with any United States or foreign governmental antitrust authority
in connection with the Contemplated Transactions unless it consults with the
other party in advance, if at all possible, and, to the extent not prohibited
by such governmental antitrust authority, gives the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate. The Company and Parent will supply each
other with copies of all correspondence, filings or communications with
governmental antitrust authorities, with respect to the Contemplated
Transactions; _provided_ , that to the extent any of the documents or
information are commercially or competitively sensitive, the Company or
Parent, as the case may be, may satisfy its obligations by providing such
documents or information to the other party's outside antitrust counsel, with
the understanding that such antitrust counsel shall not share such documents
and information with its client (although such antitrust counsel may use such
documents and information in advocating on behalf of its client with any
governmental antitrust authority).

 



 

7.4.2. _Certain Filings, Notices and Consents, Etc_. Each of Parent and
the Company shall, and the Company shall cause each Acquired Company to (a)
use, commercially reasonable efforts to obtain or provide, as applicable, as
soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, each consent,
waiver, approval, order or authorization of, filing with, or notice to, any
Governmental Authority as required as set forth on _Schedule 3.4.1_ or under
any other Contract to which an Acquired Company is a party and for which the
consent, waiver, approval, order or authorization of, filing with, or notice
to any Person is required and (b) cooperate with one another (i) in
determining whether any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any
Governmental Authority is required, or any other actions, consents, approvals
or waivers are required to be obtained from third parties to any Material
Company Contracts (other than those set forth on _Schedule 3.4.1)_ in
connection with the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions and (ii) in
taking such other actions, making any other such filings, or furnishing
information required in connection therewith and seeking timely to obtain any
such actions, consents, approvals or waivers; _provided_ , that nothing in
this Agreement shall obligate or be construed to obligate any Acquired Company
or Parent to make or cause to be made any payment or concession to any third
party in order to obtain any such action, consent, approval or waiver under
any Material Company Contract or any consents, approvals or waivers set forth
on _Schedule 3.4.1_ ; _provided_ , _further_ , the obtaining of any such
consents, approvals or waivers shall not be deemed to be conditions to the
obligations of the parties to consummate the Contemplated Transactions.

 



 

 



   



 

7.5. _Business Records_. Parent acknowledges that the Holders'
Representative or the Holders may from time to time from and after the Closing
require access to the Records from the pre-Closing period in connection with
an Action, the preparation of tax returns or financial statements or other
legitimate business purpose, and agrees that subject to an execution of a
confidentiality agreement in form reasonably satisfactory to Parent, upon
reasonable prior notice and solely in connection with an Action, the
preparation of tax returns or financial statements or other legitimate
business purpose, Parent will, and will use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Acquired Companies to, during normal business hours, provide the
Holders' Representative, the Holders and each of their respective Affiliates
and their respective Representatives with either access to or copies of the
Records from the pre-Closing period. If the Acquired Companies shall desire to
dispose of any such Records prior to the second anniversary of the Closing
Date, the Company shall, prior to any such disposition, notify the Holders'
Representative and provide the Holders' Representative (or, if applicable, its
designee) and the Holders and its and their respective Representatives a
reasonable opportunity, at the Holders' Representative's or such Holder's
expense, to make copies of or remove such Records.

 



 

7.6. _Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

7.6.1. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements,
all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from
liability for acts or omissions occurring in connection with or prior to the
Closing now existing in favor of each Person who is now, or has been at any
time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Closing, a director,
officer, employee or agent of any Acquired Company (" _D andO Indemnified
Persons_"), including as provided in the Organizational Documents of any
Acquired Company, or any Contract between any Acquired Company and any DandO
Indemnified Person set forth on _Schedule 7.6.1_ , will survive the Closing
and will continue in full force and effect in accordance with their respective
terms for a period of not less than six (6) years after the Closing Date (or,
in the case of any Contract, in accordance with its terms), and will not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of any DandO Indemnified Person.

 



 

 



   



 

7.6.2. On or before the Closing Date, Parent will obtain for the Company
and for the benefit of the DandO Indemnified Persons, and beginning on the
Closing Date and for at least a six (6) year period thereafter, Parent will
cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect, a so-called "tail"
policy for such period covering acts or omissions occurring on or before the
Closing Date with respect to those Persons who are currently covered by the
Acquired Companies' directors' and officers' liability insurance policies or
employment practices liability insurance policies on terms with respect to
such coverage and amounts at least as favorable to such Persons as those of
such policies in effect on the date hereof.

 



 

7.6.3. It is the intent of the parties that with respect to all
obligations with respect to indemnification and advancement of expenses under
this _Section 7.6_ that the Acquired Companies shall be the indemnitors of
first resort and accordingly shall be the primary source of advancement,
reimbursement and indemnification relative to any Person that was a direct or
indirect holder of Equity Interests of any Acquired Company at or prior to the
Closing (or any Person that is or was an Affiliate of such holder of Equity
Interests, other than any Acquired Company). Neither Parent nor any Acquired
Company shall have the right to seek contribution, indemnity or other
reimbursement for any of its obligations under this _Section 7.6_ from any
such Person that was a direct or indirect holder of Equity Interests of any
Acquired Company at or prior to the Closing (or any Person that is or was an
Affiliate of such holder of Equity Interests, other than any Acquired
Company).

 



 

7.6.4. If any of the Acquired Companies (or any of their respective
successors or assigns) transfers all or substantially all of its Equity
Interests, properties or assets to any Person, through any single transaction
or combination of transactions of any kind, then, and in each such case,
Parent will cause proper provision to be made so that such Person fully
assumes the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.6_.

 



 

7.6.5. This _Section 7.6_ shall be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, any Person that was a direct or indirect holder of Equity
Interests of any Acquired Company at or prior to the Closing (and any Person
that is or was an Affiliate of such holder of Equity Interests, other than any
Acquired Company) and any DandO Indemnified Person, and in each case, their
respective successors, assigns, heirs, executors, administrators and estates,
and such Persons shall be express third party beneficiaries of this Agreement
for such purposes.

 



 

 



   



 

7.7. _Conflicts of Interest; Privilege_. Parent, on behalf of its itself
and its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies following the Closing)
(Parent and all such other Persons, " _Parent Related Parties_ ") hereby
waives, any claim that Ropes and Gray LLP or any other legal counsel
representing any of the Acquired Companies prior to the Closing (each, a "
_Prior Company Counsel_ ") in connection with this Agreement or its subject
matter or the Contemplated Transactions (" _Pre-Closing Representation_ ") has
a conflict of interest or is otherwise prohibited from representing any
Holder, the Holders' Representative or any of their respective officers,
directors, members, managers or Affiliates (" _Seller Related Parties_ ") in
any dispute with any Parent Related Parties or any other matter involving this
Agreement or its subject matter or the Contemplated Transactions, in each
case, after the Closing Date, even though the interests of one or more of the
Seller Related Parties in such dispute or other matter may be directly adverse
to the interests of one or more Parent Related Parties and even though Prior
Company Counsel may have represented one or more of the Acquired Companies in
a matter substantially related to such dispute or other matter and may be
handling ongoing matters for one or more Parent Related Parties. Parent, on
behalf of the Parent Related Parties, hereby covenants and agrees, that, as to
all communications between any Prior Company Counsel, on the one hand, and any
Seller Related Parties or any Acquired Company (with respect to the Acquired
Companies, solely prior to the Closing), on the other hand, that relate in any
way to the Pre-Closing Representation, the attorney-client privilege and the
expectation of client confidence belong to and shall be controlled by the
Holders' Representative or applicable Holder, and shall not pass to or be
claimed by any Parent Related Parties. This _Section_ _7.7_ shall survive the
Closing and shall remain in effect following the Closing. Without limitation
of the foregoing, no Parent Related Parties may use or rely on any
communications described in the immediately preceding sentence in any claim,
dispute, action, suit or proceeding against or involving any of the Seller
Related Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if after the Closing a dispute
arises between Parent or the Acquired Companies, on the one hand, and a third
party other than (and unaffiliated with) the Holders, on the other hand, then
the Company (to the extent applicable) may assert the attorney-client
privilege to prevent disclosure to such third party of confidential
communications by Prior Company Counsel; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither
Parent nor any Acquired Company may waive such privilege without the prior
written consent of the Holders' Representative, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. This _Section_ _7.7_ is for the
benefit of the Seller Related Parties and each Prior Company Counsel, and the
Seller Related Parties and each Prior Company Counsel are express third party
beneficiaries of this _Section_ _7.7_. This _Section_ _7.7_ shall be
irrevocable, and no term of this _Section_ _7.7_ may be amended, waived or
modified, without the prior written consent of each of the Holders and Prior
Company Counsel affected thereby.

 



 

7.8. _Transfer Taxes_. Parent shall be responsible for all Transfer Taxes
(as well as the filing of all Tax Returns with respect thereto) in connection
with the Contemplated Transactions.

 



 

 



   



 

7.9. _Tax Returns_.

 



 

(a) Following the Closing, Parent shall prepare, or cause to be prepared,
and timely file or cause to be timely filed, all Tax Returns that are required
to be filed for the Acquired Companies (other than the Professional
Corporations) that relate to (or include) any Pre-Closing Tax Period and that
are due after the Closing Date. Any such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a
manner consistent with all positions taken, methods used, and elections made
in prior periods in filing Tax Returns for the Acquired Companies (other than
the Professional Corporations) to the extent consistent with applicable law
and before filing any such Tax Return, Parent shall provide Holders'
Representative with a copy of such Tax Return for review and comment at least
twenty (20) Business Days prior to the last date for timely filing such Tax
Return (giving effect to any valid extensions thereof). At least ten (10)
Business Days prior to the due date for the filing of any Tax Return provided
to Holders' Representative pursuant to this _Section 7.9_ , the Holders'
Representative shall notify Parent of the existence of any objection or any
comment the Holders' Representative may have to any items set forth on such
draft Tax Return, and if, after consulting in good faith, Parent and the
Holders' Representative are unable to resolve such objection(s), such
objection(s) shall be referred to the Accounting Firm for resolution in
accordance with the procedures set forth in _Section 7.9_. If the Accounting
Firm is unable to make a determination with respect to any disputed item
before five (5) Business Days prior to the due date for the filing of the Tax
Return in question, then (i) Parent may file such Tax Return reflecting
Parent's position with respect to any disputed item and (ii) if the Accounting
Firm subsequently determines that such Tax Return should be amended, Parent
shall file an amended Tax Return reflecting the Accounting Firm's
determination. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be paid in
the manner prescribed in _Section 7.9_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement (including _Article 9_ ), the Holders and the
Holders' Representative shall have no liability under this Agreement
(including via the Escrow Agreement) with respect to (and Parent shall pay or
cause to be paid) (x) any Taxes that were taken into account in the
calculation of Net Working Capital as used in the Final Purchase Price, (y)
Taxes incurred as a result of actions outside the ordinary course taken after
the Closing or (z) Taxes incurred in any period that is not a Pre-Closing Tax
Period. Following the Closing, neither Parent nor any Acquired Company (other
than the Professional Corporations) shall amend any Tax Return to the extent
that such Tax Return relates to any Pre-Closing Tax Period without the prior
written consent of the Holders' Representative (which will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). Parent shall, if the Holders'
Representative requests and at the expense of the Holders' Representative,
cause the relevant entity to file for and obtain any refunds or credits to
which the Holders may be entitled under _Section 7.9(b)_. Parent shall control
(at the expense of the Holders' Representative) the prosecution and content of
any such refund or credit claim, but shall keep the Holders' Representative
fully apprised of the status of such refund or credit claim and allow Holders'
Representative to participate in the assertion of any such claim.

 



 

(b) Any refunds (including, for the avoidance of doubt, overpayments of
estimated Taxes) of, or credits against, Taxes of, or with respect to, the
Acquired Companies (other than the Professional Corporations) for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period that were not taken into account as a current asset in
calculating Net Working Capital will be for the benefit of the Holders, and
Parent or the Surviving Corporation will forward the amount of any such
refunds (whether received as a refund or as a credit against or an offset of
Taxes otherwise payable), together with any interest thereon, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to (i) the Stockholders, in accordance with
such Stockholders' Pro Rata Shares (calculated by the Surviving Corporation in
accordance with the Pro-Rata Schedule) and (ii) to the Surviving Corporation
to be distributed to the Option Holders in accordance with their respective
Pro Rata Shares (calculated by the Surviving Corporation in accordance with
the Pro-Rata Schedule) in the next payroll period thereafter, in each case,
within twenty (20) days of receipt.

 



 

 



   



 

(c) Parent, the Company and the Holders' Representative will, and will
cause their respective Affiliates to, provide each other with such cooperation
and information as any of them reasonably may request in connection with any
Tax matters relating to the Acquired Companies. Such cooperation and
information will include providing copies of relevant Tax Returns or portions
thereof, together with accompanying schedules, related work papers and
documents relating to rulings or other determinations by tax authorities.
Parent will retain, or cause the Company to retain, all Tax Returns, schedules
and work papers, records and other documents in its possession relating to Tax
matters of the Acquired Companies for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods until the
later of (i) the expiration of the statute of limitations of the taxable
periods to which such Tax Returns and other documents relate or (ii) six (6)
years following the due date (without extension) for such Tax Returns. Any
information obtained under this _Section 7.9(c)_ will be kept confidential
except as may be otherwise necessary in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns or claims for refund or in conducting an audit or other proceeding.

 



 

(d) No election under Section 338(g) of the Code, or any similar provision
of state, local or foreign law, may be made with respect to the Contemplated
Transactions.

 



 

(e) Parent shall promptly notify the Holders' Representative in writing of
the commencement of any audit or examination of any Tax Return of the Acquired
Companies for any Pre-Closing Tax Period and any other proposed change or
adjustment, claim, dispute, arbitration or litigation that, if sustained,
would reasonably be expected to give rise to a claim for indemnification in
respect of Taxes under this Agreement (a " _Tax Claim_ "). Such notice shall
describe the asserted Tax Claim in reasonable detail and shall include copies
of any notices and other documents received from any Taxing Authority in
respect of any such asserted Tax Claim. The Holders' Representative shall
have the right to control any Tax Claims in the Tax audit, examination, and
settlement stage and, if not settled, in any further contest; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Holders' Representative shall inform Parent of the status
and progress of such Tax Claim and that Parent will have the opportunity to
participate in such Tax Claim at its expense. The Holders' Representative may
not settle any Tax Claim (either at the audit or examination stage or
thereafter) without first obtaining Parent's consent (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). In the event that Holders'
Representative does not exercise its right to control any Tax Claim, Parent
shall control such Tax Claim; provided, however, that Parent shall inform the
Holders' Representative of the status and progress of such Tax Claim and the
Holders' Representative will have the opportunity to participate in such Tax
Claim at its expense. Parent shall not settle any Tax Claim (either at the
audit or examination stage or thereafter) without first obtaining the Holders'
Representative's consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed).

 



 

7.10. _Exclusivity_. From the date of this Agreement until the Closing,
or the earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article 8_ ,
the Company shall not (and the Company shall not cause any of its
Representatives to) solicit or initiate the submission of any proposal or
offer from any Person relating to, or enter into or consummate any transaction
relating to, the acquisition of all or substantially all of the equity
interests or assets of the Company (whether by merger, recapitalization, share
exchange, sale of assets or any other similar transaction) or participate in
any discussions or negotiations regarding, furnish any information with
respect to, or assist or participate in any effort or attempt by any Person to
do or seek any of the foregoing.

 



 

 



   



 

7.11. _Further Assurances_. Each of the Holders' Representative and
Parent, upon the request of the other from time to time after the Closing, and
at the expense of the requesting party but without further consideration,
shall sign such documents and take such actions as may be necessary or
otherwise reasonably requested to make more fully effective the consummation
of the Contemplated Transactions.

 



 

7.12. _280G_. Prior to the Closing Date, assuming the Company's receipt
of the requisite waivers referred to in the next sentence of this _Section
7.12_ , the Company will seek stockholder approval, in accordance with Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, of the right of any "disqualified individual" to
receive or retain any payments that could, in the absence of such stockholder
approval, constitute "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Section
280G of the Code. Prior to seeking such approval, the Company shall provide
Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on all documents
associated with seeking such stockholder approval, shall make any changes that
Parent reasonably requests, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to seek
and obtain waivers from the intended recipients of such payments such that
unless such payments are approved by the relevant stockholders to the extent
and in the manner prescribed under 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, such payments
shall not be required to be made. Promptly following receipt of such approval,
the Company will deliver to Parent a copy of the executed action effecting
such approval.

 



 

 



   



 

7.13. _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent and
Merger Sub shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, or cause
to be obtained, the proceeds of the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions
described in the Debt Commitment Letter, including using their commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letter until
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated, (ii)
negotiate definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing (the "
_Definitive Agreements_ ") consistent in all material respects with the terms
and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (including, as
necessary, the "flex" provisions contained in the Fee Letter) or, if
available, on other terms that would not constitute a Prohibited Amendment (as
defined below) and (iii) satisfy all conditions in the control of Parent and
Merger Sub to obtaining the Debt Financing. In the event that all conditions
contained in the Debt Commitment Letter have been satisfied or waived, Parent
and Merger Sub shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Lenders to fund the Debt Financing (and shall pay any related fees and
expenses on the Closing Date) required to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and shall enforce their respective rights
against the Lenders under the Debt Financing. Parent and Merger Sub shall give
the Company prompt notice of any breach by any party to the Debt Commitment
Letter of which Parent and Merger Sub have become aware or any termination of
any of the Debt Commitment Letter. Parent and Merger Sub shall not, without
the prior written consent of the Company, (A) permit any amendment or
modification to, or any waiver of any material provision or remedy under, or
replace, the Debt Commitment Letter if such amendment, modification, waiver,
or replacement (w) would (i) add new (or modify any existing) condition to the
Debt Financing Commitments, in each case that would reasonably be expected to
prevent, impede, materially delay or render less likely the ability of Parent
and Merger Sub to timely consummate, or cause to be consummated, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) make the timely funding of
the Debt Financing or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Debt
Financing less likely to occur, (x) reduces the amount of the Debt Financing
such that the aggregate funds (taking into account any alternative debt
financing, as described below) that would be available to Parent and Merger
Subs at the Closing would be less than the Purchase Price and any fees,
expenses and other amounts payable by or on behalf of Parent and Merger Sub
pursuant to this Agreement, (y) could reasonably be expected to prevent,
impede, materially delay or render less likely the consummation of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (z) adversely impacts the
ability of Parent or Merger Sub to enforce its material rights against the
other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements with
respect thereto (each of clauses (w) through (z) being referred to as a "
_Prohibited Amendment_ "); or (B) terminate the Debt Commitment Letter, unless
the Debt Commitment Letter is replaced in a manner consistent with the
foregoing clause (A); _provided_ , that (i) the Debt Commitment Letter may be
amended or modified to add or replace one or more lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities which had not executed the
Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof, provided that no such addition
or replacement would reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or materially
delay the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to finally consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) the Debt Commitment
Letter may be amended or modified to replace the facilities with a first-
lien/second-lien bank-only financing structure, subject to the prior review
and approval of the Company (which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, it being understood that the Company shall be deemed to be acting
reasonably in withholding its consent if any of the terms of such amendment or
modification would constitute a Prohibited Amendment). Upon any such
amendment, supplement or modification of the Debt Financing Commitments in
accordance with this _Section 7.13(a)_ , the term "Debt Financing Commitments"
shall mean the Debt Financing Commitments as so amended, supplemented or
modified. In the event that any portion of the Debt Financing becomes
unavailable (and such portion is necessary for Parent to pay the Purchase
Price and any fees, expenses and other amounts payable by or on behalf of
Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement), regardless of the reason
therefor, Parent and Merger Sub will (1) use their commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such
event and in any event no later than the last day of the Marketing Period,
alternative debt financing in an amount sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement on substantially equivalent or
more favorable terms (taking into account any "flex" provisions in the Debt
Commitment Letter) from the same or other sources and which would not prevent,
impede or materially delay and would not reasonably be expect to prevent,
impede or materially delay the consummation of the Debt Financing or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and promptly provide to the
Company a true and complete copy of the commitment letter entered into in
connection therewith (together with any related fee letter (which may be
redacted as to fee and other economic terms, provided that such fee letters
contain enough information to allow for an accurate calculation of the maximum
amount of flex and original issue discount which could result under such
letters)) and (2) promptly notify the Company of such unavailability and the
reason therefor. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event
shall the commercially reasonable efforts of Parent and Merger Sub be deemed
or construed to require Parent or Merger Sub to, and Parent and Merger Sub
shall not be required to, (i) pay any fees or other compensation or expenses
in excess of those contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments as in effect
on the date hereof (taking into account any "flex" provisions in the Debt
Commitment Letter) or (ii) agree to any term that is less favorable than, any
applicable economic provision of, or terms which are otherwise materially less
favorable, taken as a whole, to Parent and Merger Sub than the terms contained
in, the Debt Financing Commitments as in effect on the date hereof or the Fee
Letter (including any flex provision therein) as in effect on the date hereof.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this _Section 7.13_ or in any other
provision of this Agreement, in no event shall Parent or Merger Sub be
required to consummate the Closing any earlier than the final day of the
Marketing Period. For the purposes of this Agreement, the terms "Debt
Commitment Letter" and "Debt Financing Commitments" shall be deemed to include
any commitment letter (or similar agreement) or commitment with respect to any
alternative financing arranged in compliance herewith (and any Debt Commitment
Letter and Debt Financing Commitment remaining in effect at the time in
question). Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the Company with prompt oral
and written notice of (1) any breach or default by any party to the Debt
Commitment Letter or the Definitive Agreements of which Parent or Merger Sub
becomes aware, (2) the receipt of any written notice or other written
communication from any Lender or other financing source with respect to any
breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to the Debt
Commitment Letters or the Definitive Agreements of any provision thereof and
(3) if Parent or Merger Sub becomes aware that the Debt Commitment Letter
ceases to be in full force and effect and the legal, valid, binding and
enforceable obligations of Parent or of the other parties thereto; provided,
that in no event shall Parent or Merger Sub be under any obligation to

Memoranda that has been provided to the Company (the " _Information_ ") to
include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a fact
necessary to make such statements, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not materially misleading (after giving effect to all
supplements and updates thereto from time to time), the Company shall, and
shall cause each Acquired Company to, promptly notify Parent and update the

terminating this Agreement pursuant to _Article 8_ at any time at or prior to
Closing if such termination right is then exercisable in accordance with the

after the termination of this Agreement, it being understood that in no event
shall Parent be required to pay or cause to be paid the Parent Termination Fee
on more than one occasion. Upon payment of the Parent Termination Fee (and any
additional amounts payable under and in accordance with _Section 8.3(d)_ ),
neither Parent nor any other member of the Parent Group shall have any further
liability with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby (including the Debt Financing) to the Company or any other Person
(whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise), and none of
the Company, any Holder or any other Person shall have any claim or recourse

Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners, stockholders or
assigns.

 



 

 



   



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the
event that Parent or Merger Sub fail to effect the Closing for any reason or
no reason or any of them otherwise breaches this Agreement prior to the
Closing (or any representation, warranty or covenant hereof) (whether
willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise) or otherwise fail to
perform hereunder prior to the Closing (whether willfully, intentionally,
unintentionally or otherwise), then, except for the right of the Company to an
injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief
pursuant to, and only to the extent expressly permitted by, _Section 10.12_ ,
the Company's right (subject to the terms, conditions and limitations hereof)
to terminate this Agreement and receive the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to
_Section 8.3(a)_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy (whether at law, in
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) of the Acquired Companies and any
former, current or future, direct or indirect, equityholder, director,
officer, employee, agent, representative, Affiliate or assignee of any of the
Acquired Companies (collectively, the " _Company Parties_ ") against any
member of the Parent Group, for any Losses suffered as a result of any breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement (whether willfully,
intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise) in this Agreement or failure to
perform under this Agreement (whether willfully, intentionally,
unintentionally or otherwise) or other failure of the Merger to be consummated
(whether willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise).

on its behalf and on behalf of all Company Parties, agrees not to commence any
action or proceeding against any Lender in connection with this Agreement or
the Debt Financing and agrees to cause any such action or proceeding asserted
by any Company Party against any Lender in connection with this Agreement or
the Debt Financing to be dismissed or otherwise terminated; _provided_ that

(d) Parent and Merger Sub each acknowledge the agreements contained in
this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and that, without these agreements, the Company would not enter
into this Agreement, and that any amounts payable pursuant to this _Section
8.3_ do not constitute a penalty but constitute payment of liquidated damages
and that the Company's liquidated damages amount is reasonable in light of the
substantial but indeterminate harm anticipated to be caused by Parent's or
Merger Sub's breach or default under this Agreement, the difficulty of proof
of loss and damages, the inconvenience and non-feasibility of otherwise
obtaining an adequate remedy, and the value of the transactions to be
consummated hereunder. Accordingly, if Parent fails to timely pay the Parent
Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section 8.3_ and, in order to obtain such
payment, the Company commences a lawsuit, the prevailing party in such lawsuit
shall be entitled to recover from the other party its out-of-pocket reasonable
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) actually paid in
connection with such lawsuit (which shall not, for the avoidance of doubt,
include any other losses incurred by any Person in connection with this
Agreement).

 



 

 



   



 

(e) The provisions of _Sections 8.3(b)_ , _8.3(c)_ and _8.3(d)_ are
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each member of
the Parent Group.

it has indemnification obligations pursuant to Section 9.2.2(d).

 



 

 



   



 

9.2.4. _Limitations on Liability_. __

 



 

(a) For purposes of determining the amount of Losses subject to
indemnification hereunder, qualifications as to materiality (whether by
reference to "material" or "Material Adverse Effect" or otherwise) contained
in the representations and warranties set forth herein shall not be given
effect.

 



 

(b) Except with respect to claims pursuant to _Section 9.2.2(a)_ or
_Section 9.2._ _1_ with respect to Company Fundamental Representations, and
_Section 9.2.3_ _(a)_ with respect to Parent Fundamental Representations
(collectively, " _Limitation Exceptions Claims_ "), and _Section 9.2.2(b)_ ,
_Section 9.2.2(c)_ , _Section 9.2.2(d)_ , and _Section 9.2.3(b)_ , neither the
Parent Indemnified Persons nor the Seller Indemnified Persons shall be
entitled to assert any claim for indemnification under this _Article 9_ with
respect to a single course of conduct or related set of circumstances,
occurrences or events unless the Losses arising therefrom exceed $50,000 (the
" _De Minimis Exception_ " and any Losses in excess of such De Minimis
Exception being referred to herein as " _Indemnifiable Losses_ "). For the
avoidance of doubt, Limitation Exceptions Claims and claims pursuant to
_Section 9.2.2(b)_ , _Section 9.2.2(c)_ , _Section 9.2.2(d)_ and _Section
9.2.3(b)_ shall not be subject to the De Minimis Exception.

 



 

(c) Except with respect to (i) Limitation Exceptions Claims (which shall
not be subject to any deductible), (ii) claims pursuant to _Section 9.2.2(b)_
(which shall be subject to the Misclassification Loss Deductible set forth in
_Section 9.2.4(d)_ below), (iii) claims pursuant to _Section 9.2.2(c)_ (which
shall not be subject to any deductible), (iv) claims pursuant to _Section
9.2.2(d)_ (which shall be subject to the Healthcare Billing and HIPAA Loss
Basket set forth in _Section 9.2.4(e)_ below) and (v) claims pursuant to
_Section 9.2.3(b)_ (which shall be subject to the deductible set forth in last
sentence of Section 9.2.4(e) below), neither the Parent Indemnified Persons
(in respect of _Section 9.2.1_ ) nor the Seller Indemnified Persons (in
respect of _Section 9.2.3_ _(a)_ ) shall be entitled to assert any claim for
indemnification until such time as the aggregate of all Indemnifiable Losses
that such Parent Indemnified Persons may have under _Section 9.2.1_ or such
Seller Indemnified Persons may have under _Section 9.2.3_ _(a)_ , as
applicable, exceed $3,000,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), in which event the
Parent Indemnified Persons or Seller Indemnified Persons, as applicable, shall
be indemnified for all Indemnifiable Losses in excess of the Deductible
(subject to the other limitations and procedures contained in this Article 9).
For the avoidance of doubt, Limitation Exceptions Claims and claims pursuant
to _Section 9.2.2(b)_ , _Section 9.2.2(c)_ , _Section 9.2.2(d)_ and _Section
9.2.3(b)_ shall not be subject to the Deductible.

 



 

 



   



 

(d) The Parent Indemnified Persons shall not be entitled to assert any
claim for indemnification under _Section 9.2.2(b)_ until such time as the
aggregate Misclassification Losses that such Parent Indemnified Persons have
suffered or incurred exceeds $250,000 (the " _Misclassification Loss
Deductible_ "), in which event the Parent Indemnified Persons shall be
indemnified for all Misclassification Losses in excess of the
Misclassification Loss Deductible (subject to the other limitations and
procedures contained in this _Article 9_ ). The aggregate liability for
indemnification claims under _Section 9.2.2(b)_ shall not exceed $7,500,000.

 



 

(e) The Parent Indemnified Persons shall not be entitled to assert any
claim for indemnification under _Section 9.2.2(d)_ until such time as the
aggregate Healthcare Billing and HIPAA Losses that such Parent Indemnified
Persons have suffered or incurred and the other fees and expenses for which
indemnification is to be provided under _Section 9.2.2(d)_ , collectively,
exceeds $1,000,000 (the " _Healthcare Billing_ _and HIPAA_ _Loss Basket_ "),
in which event the Parent Indemnified Persons shall be indemnified for all
Healthcare Billing and HIPAA Losses, including such Losses in the Healthcare
Billing and HIPAA Loss Basket (subject to the other applicable limitations and
procedures contained in this _Article 9_ ). The aggregate liability for
indemnification claims under _Section 9.2.2(d)_ (including any liability for
reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by a Parent Indemnified
Person in successfully enforcing such Parent Indemnified Person's
indemnification rights and remedies under _Section 9.2.2(d)_ ) shall not
exceed: (i) from the Closing Date until the first anniversary of the Closing
Date with respect to claims for which written notice shall have been delivered
on or prior to such first anniversary, $40,000,000; and (ii) thereafter
$20,000,000 (minus any amounts in excess of $20,000,000 paid or payable under
_Section 9.2.2(d)_ on or prior to such first anniversary). The Seller
Indemnified Persons shall not be entitled to assert any claim for
indemnification under _Section 9.2.3(b)_ until such time as the aggregate fees
and expenses for which indemnification is to be provided under _Section 9.2._
_3_ _(_ _b_ _)_ exceeds $250,000.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this _Article 9_
, and subject to the other limitations in this _Article 9_ , the aggregate
liability for indemnification claims under _Sections 9.2.1_ and _9.2.2_ shall
not exceed the sum of the cash merger consideration and stock merger
consideration (valued at the Initial Value) actually received by, or held in
escrow for the benefit of, the Holders pursuant to _Article 2_. The aggregate
liability for indemnification claims under _Sections 9.2.1_ shall be limited
to an amount equal to the Indemnity Escrow Amount and shall be payable only
from the Indemnity Escrow Funds from time to time held in the Indemnity Escrow
Account. Except with respect to Limitation Exceptions Claims, the aggregate
liability for indemnification claims under _Section 9.2.3_ _(a)_ shall be
limited to an amount equal to the Indemnity Escrow Amount and shall be paid
directly by Parent to the applicable Seller Indemnified Person with respect to
such Indemnifiable Loss. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this _Article 9_ , the maximum aggregate liability of any individual Holder
pursuant to this _Article 9_ shall in no event exceed the sum of the portion
of the cash merger consideration and the stock merger consideration (valued at
the Initial Value) actually received by, or held in escrow for the benefit of,
such Holder pursuant to _Article 2_.

 



 

 



   



 

(g) The amount of Losses for which indemnification is available under this
_Article 9_ shall be calculated net of any insurance proceeds (net of any
deductibles and costs or expenses of recovery, including any associated
retropremiums) actually received by an Indemnified Person under insurance
policies with respect to such Losses. In the event that any Indemnifying Party
required to provide indemnification under this _Article 9_ makes any payment
hereunder in respect of any Losses, such Indemnifying Party shall be
subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to the rights of such Indemnified
Person against any insurer or other third party with respect to such Losses
(and the Indemnified Persons shall not take any actions to adversely affect
such subrogation rights without the consent of the Indemnifying Party). In
addition, the amount of Losses for which indemnification is available under
this _Article 9_ shall be (i) in the case of claims under _Section 9.2.1_ or
_9.2.2(c)_ , calculated net of all amounts reflected in the Closing Debt
Amount, the Seller Transaction Expenses or the Net Working Capital, as
applicable, and (ii) in the case of any claims under _Section 9.2.1_ , _9.2.2_
or _9.2.3_ , reduced by any Tax benefit actually realized by the Parent
Indemnified Persons or Seller Indemnified Persons, as applicable, on account
of such Loss in the taxable year of such Loss or in a taxable year prior to
such Loss (determined by comparing the Taxes that were actually paid taking
into account any deductions attributable to such Loss in such taxable year
with those Taxes that would have been payable in the absence of such
deductions in such taxable year, and assuming that such deductions are the
last item of deduction on the applicable Tax Return). For the avoidance of
doubt, this _Section 9.2.4(_ _g_ _)_ shall not apply with respect to claims
against either Insurer under either Policy.

 



 

(h) No party will in any event be liable under this _Article 9_ , and no
claim for indemnification may in any event be asserted under this _Article 9_
, for any loss of, or based on any multiple of, profits or earnings, any
diminution in value or any incidental, punitive, indirect, special or
consequential damages; _provided_ , that an Indemnified Person may assert a
claim for indemnification under this _Article 9_ for any Losses for
incidental, punitive, indirect, special or consequential damages if such
Indemnified Person is required by a Governmental Order to pay such damages to
a third party.

 



 

 



   



 

9.2.5. _Source of Recovery_. Subject in all cases to the other
limitations and procedures contained in this _Article 9_ , all indemnification
payments or reimbursements to any Parent Indemnified Person pursuant to this
_Article 9_ shall be made as follows:

 



 

(a) Except with respect to the Limitation Exceptions Claims and claims
pursuant to _Section 9.2.2(b)_ , _Section 9.2.2(c)_ and _Section 9.2.2(d)_ ,
(i) from the Indemnity Escrow Account (but only if and to the extent that
Indemnity Escrow Funds are available to pay for such Losses) or (ii) if the
amount then on deposit in the Indemnity Escrow Account is not sufficient to
make the payment in full to such Parent Indemnified Person, under the
Policies, in an amount equal to the amount of any such deficiency.

 



 

(b) With respect to claims pursuant to _Section 9.2.2(b)_ , (i) from the
Indemnity Escrow Account (but only if and to the extent that Indemnity Escrow
Funds are available to pay for such Losses) and (ii) thereafter, if the amount
then on deposit in the Indemnity Escrow Account is not sufficient to make the
payment in full to such Parent Indemnified Person, from the Holders in an
amount equal to the amount of any such deficiency, calculated for each Holder
in accordance with its Pro Rata Share.

 



 

(c) With respect to the claims pursuant to _Section 9.2.2(c)_ , (i) first,
from the Indemnity Escrow Account (but only if and to the extent that
Indemnity Escrow Funds are available to pay for such Losses), (ii) second, at
the Parent Indemnified Person's option, to the extent that amounts are
recoverable in respect of such Losses under the terms and conditions of the
Policies (and, for clarity, to the extent any retention under the Policies is
applicable to any Loss, the amount of such retention shall be deemed to be not
recoverable), if the amount then on deposit in the Indemnity Escrow Account is
not sufficient to make the payment in full to such Parent Indemnified Person,
under the Policies, in an amount equal to the amount of any such deficiency,
and (iii) third, if the Parent Indemnified Person elects not to seek payment
or reimbursement under the Policies, or the amount then remaining under the
Policies and not subject to claims thereunder is not sufficient to make the
payment or reimbursement in full to such Parent Indemnified Person, from the
Holders in an amount equal to the amount of any such deficiency, calculated
for each Holder in accordance with its Pro Rata Share.

 



 

(d) With respect to any claims pursuant to _Section 9.2.2(d)_ , from the
Healthcare Billing and HIPAA Escrow Account. Claims pursuant to _Section
9.2.2(d)_ shall be satisfied through return by the Escrow Agent to Parent of
such number of Remainder Escrow Parent Shares (the " _Shares Subject to
Claims_ ") as shall equal the applicable amount of Losses incurred by the
Parent Indemnified Person divided by the greater of (i) the closing price of
Parent Common Stock on the last trading day immediately prior to the date such
claim is made by the Parent Indemnified Person (the " _Claim Time Per Share
Price_ "), and (ii) the Initial Value.

 



 

(e) With respect to the Limitation Exceptions Claims against the Holders,
(i) first, from the Indemnity Escrow Account (but only if and to the extent
that Indemnity Escrow Funds are available to pay for such Losses), (ii)
second, to the extent that amounts are recoverable in respect of such Losses
under the terms and conditions of the Policies (and, for clarity, to the
extent any retention under the Policies is applicable to any Loss, the amount
of such retention shall be deemed to be not recoverable), if the amount then
on deposit in the Indemnity Escrow Account is not sufficient to make the
payment in full to such Parent Indemnified Person, under the Policies, an
amount equal to the amount of any such deficiency, and (iii) third, after such
time as the aggregate Losses that the Parent Indemnified Persons have suffered
or incurred (that are of the type addressed by _Section 9.2.1_ or _9.2.2(a)_ )
exceed the amount of coverage available under the Policies not subject to
other claims thereunder, from the Holders in an amount equal to the amount of
any such deficiency, calculated for each Holder in accordance with its Pro
Rata Share; _provided_ , _however_ , that (1) the Parent Indemnified Person
shall seek recovery under the Policies, and shall not seek indemnification
from the Holders with respect to such Limitations Exception Claims under
_Section 9.2.2(a)_ if, and to the extent, there is coverage available under
either Policy not subject to claims thereunder, and (2) in each case without
the prior written consent of the Holders' Representative, Parent shall not
amend or modify either Policy or any provisions thereof to reduce the coverage
available thereunder, or amend or modify either Policy or any provisions
thereof in a manner that would be adverse to the Holders, in each case,
without the prior written consent of the Holders' Representative.

 



 

 



   



 

(f) In the event any Parent Indemnified Person shall be entitled to
receive payment or reimbursement of any amounts from a Holder pursuant to (b),
(c) or (e) of this _Section 9.2.5_ , as applicable, such amount shall be paid
by each such Holder by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such
Parent Indemnified Person to an account designated by such Parent Indemnified
Person; _provided_ , _however_ , if the amount to be paid by a Holder exceeds
the amount of cash merger consideration actually received by such Holder
pursuant to _Article 2_ , such deficiency shall be paid by such Holder to the
Parent Indemnified Person by either, or a combination of, the following
methods: (i) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such Parent
Indemnified Person in an amount equal to the number of shares of Parent
Company Stock received and previously disposed of by such Holder multiplied by
the Initial Value thereof (for the avoidance of doubt, any shares of Parent
Common Stock released from the Healthcare Billing and HIPAA Escrow Account in
satisfaction of a claim for indemnification under _Section 9.2.2(d)_ shall not
constitute shares previously disposed of by a Holder for purposes of this
clause (i)); and (ii) by return to Parent of that portion of the Parent
Company Stock received (or held in escrow for), and not disposed of, by such
Holder. If any such deficiency is to be paid pursuant to subsection (ii), and
the applicable shares of stock merger consideration are then the Remainder
Escrow Parent Shares, such deficiency shall be satisfied through return by the
Escrow Agent to Parent of such number of Remainder Escrow Parent Shares equal
to the amount of the remaining deficiency divided by the greater of (i) the
closing price of Parent Common Stock on the last trading day immediately prior
to the date of such release and (ii) the Initial Value.

 



 

 



   



 

9.2.6. _Third Party Claims_.

 



 

(a) _Notice of Claim_. If any third party (i.e., any Person who is not a
party to this Agreement or an Affiliate thereof) notifies an Indemnified
Person with respect to any matter (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") which may give
rise to a claim for indemnification hereunder against an Indemnifying Party,
then such Indemnified Person will promptly (and, in any event, within thirty
(30) days) give written notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party, said notice
to describe in reasonable detail all facts and circumstances then known to
such Indemnified Person with respect to such Third Party Claim and the claimed
items and amounts of Losses with respect thereto, as well as all provisions of
this Agreement that are the bases for the indemnification claim with respect
to such Third Party Claim, and said notice shall enclose all documents then in
the possession of the Indemnified Person with respect to such Third Party
Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to _Section_ _9.1_ , no delay on
the part of the Indemnified Person in notifying the Indemnifying Party will
relieve the Indemnifying Party from any obligation under this _Article 9_ ,
except to the extent such delay actually and materially prejudices the
Indemnifying Party.

 



 

(b) _Assumption of Defense_. The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to
participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim that is the subject of a
notice given by the Indemnified Person pursuant to _Section_ _9.2.6(a)_. In
addition, upon written notice to the Indemnified Person, the Indemnifying
Party shall have the right to defend the Indemnified Person against the Third
Party Claim with counsel of its choice reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Person; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Third Party Claim
involves any material customer or material supplier of any of the Acquired
Companies, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to defend or assume
control of the defense of such Third Party Claim and may not consent to the
entry of any judgment or enter into any compromise or settlement with respect
to, such Third Party Claim unless such Indemnifying Party agrees to be (or in
the case of an indemnity claim brought under _Section 9.2.1_ or _Section
9.2.2_ , the Holders' Representative agrees on behalf of the Holders that the
Holders will be) fully responsible for all Losses arising from or relating to
such Third Party Claim, subject to the other limitations and procedures in
this Article 9. In such event, the Indemnified Person may retain separate co-
counsel at its sole cost and expense and participate in the defense of the
Third Party Claim (though not of record, and shall not communicate with the
Person asserting the Third Party Claim, or such Person's Representatives,
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)); _provided_ , _however_
, that if (i) there exists, or would reasonably be likely to exist, a conflict
of interest that would make it inappropriate in the commercially reasonable
judgment of the Indemnified Person for the same counsel to represent both the
Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying Party, or (ii) the Indemnified Person
elects to pursue one or more defenses or counterclaims available to it that
are inconsistent with one or more of those that are being pursued by the
Indemnifying Party in respect of such Third Party Claim or any litigation
relating thereto, then the Indemnified Person may participate in the defense
of (but not compromise or settle) such Third Party Claim and may retain its
own counsel in each jurisdiction for which the Indemnified Person reasonably
determines counsel is required, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not consent to the
entry of any judgment or enter into any compromise or settlement with respect
to the Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Person (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)
unless such judgment, compromise or settlement (i) provides for the payment of
money as sole relief for the claimant and (ii) subject to the making of such
payment, results in the full and general release of such Indemnified Person
from all liabilities arising from or relating to the Third Party Claim. For
the avoidance of doubt, any amounts paid or to be paid by an Indemnifying
Party in respect of its attorneys' fees and other experts and professionals
expenses incurred in connection with its defense, settlement or other
resolution of any Third Party Claims, shall not be deemed to be Losses for
purposes of this _Article 9_ , and, in the case of any indemnification claim
under _Section 9.2.1_ , shall in no event be paid from the Indemnity Escrow
Funds.

 



 

 



   



 

(c) _Indemnified Person 's Control_. If: (i) the Indemnifying Party does
not deliver the notice contemplated by _Section_ _9.2.6(b)_ within thirty (30)
days after the Indemnified Person has given notice of the Third Party Claim
pursuant to _Section_ _9.2.6(a)_ , (ii) the Indemnifying Party is not entitled
to assume, or does not reasonably promptly assume and continue to pursue the
defense of, the Third Party Claim following notice of such election, (iii) a
Parent Indemnified Person is the Indemnified Person and the anticipated Losses
in respect of such Third Party Claim would, or would reasonably be expected
to, exceed the then-remaining balance of the applicable cap on liability set
forth in _Section 9.2.4_ of this Agreement (reduced by the aggregate amount of
all pending claims against it), (iv) the Third Party Claim involves any
violation of any Legal Requirement or is brought by a Governmental Authority,
(v) the Third Party Claim seeks injunctive or other nonmonetary relief against
the Indemnified Person or (vi) the Third Party Claim relates to potential
criminal liability, the Indemnified Person may defend, and may consent to the
entry of any judgment or enter into any compromise or settlement with respect
to, the Third Party Claim at the expense of the Indemnifying Party; _provided_
, _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party will not be bound by the entry of
any such judgment consented to, or any such compromise or settlement effected,
without its prior written consent (which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), and the Indemnifying Party will cooperate
in good faith in all reasonable respects with the conduct of such defense by
the Indemnified Person and shall be permitted to participate in such defense
at its sole cost and expense.

 



 

(d) _Other Claims_. In the event that any party to this Agreement
proposes to make any claim for indemnification pursuant to this _Article 9_
and such claim does not involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Person
making the claim shall deliver on or prior to the last date such claim may be
made pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, in addition to an
indemnification claim notice, a certificate signed by the Indemnified Person
or an officer of the Indemnified Person (the " _Claim Certificate_ ") to the
Indemnifying Party, which Claim Certificate shall (a) describe in reasonable
detail all relevant facts giving rise or relating to the claim; (b) specify
the Section or Sections of this Agreement under which such claim is made; and
(c) specify in reasonable detail each individual item of Loss, including the
amount thereof if reasonably ascertainable, if known, the date such Losses
were incurred, properly accrued or are anticipated to be incurred and the
misrepresentation or breach to which such Losses are related.

 



 

 



   



 

(e) _Policies_. Notwithstanding the provisions set forth in clauses (b)
and (c) of this Section _9.2.6_ above, with respect to all claims for Losses
made pursuant to _Section 9.2.1_ to the extent the procedures in this _Section
9.2.6_ are inconsistent with the procedures in the Policies with regard to
matters such as settlement or defense of claims, the procedures in the
Policies shall control but this does not relieve the Indemnified Party from
its obligations to give notice to the Indemnifying Party under _Section
9.2.6(a)_ or _9.2.6(d)_ ; _provided_ , that the Holders and the Holders'
Representative shall not be obligated to indemnify any Parent Indemnified
Person with respect to any settlement or other compromise of a Third Party
Claim that is effected by an Insurer or Parent Indemnified Person without the
prior written consent of the Holders' Representative (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



 

9.2.7. _Remedies Exclusive_. The parties covenant and agree that from and
after the Closing the remedies provided for in this _Article 9_ and under the
Indemnity Escrow Agreement shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy for
all Losses that any Indemnified Person may suffer or incur arising from, or
directly or indirectly relating to, the Acquired Companies, this Agreement or
the Contemplated Transactions, and the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waive
any other rights or remedies (whether at law or in equity and whether based on
contract, tort, statute or otherwise) that they may otherwise have had, now
have or may in the future have against any of the other parties hereto or any
of the respective direct or indirect Affiliates, officers, managers,
directors, employees, advisors, stockholders, members, consultants, investment
bankers, brokers, controlling persons, partners, managers or other
representatives or agents thereof (each of whom shall be an express third
party beneficiary hereof) arising from, or directly or indirectly relating to,
the Acquired Companies, this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions and
covenant not to sue or otherwise assert any claim (or assist any other Person
in suing or otherwise asserting any claim) encompassed by the foregoing
covenant, agreement and waiver; _provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to
_Section 9.3_ , the foregoing shall not apply to claims of common law fraud
based on the representations and warranties set forth in _Sections 3_ and _4_
, as applicable, and _provided_ , _further_ , that the foregoing shall not
apply to the parties' rights to seek specific performance as contemplated by
_Section 10.12_ or a breach of contract action with respect to covenants to be
performed after the Closing pursuant to this Agreement. Any Person who is sued
or otherwise has a claim asserted against him, her or it in violation of this
_Section_ _9.2.7_ may enforce the terms of this _Section 9.2.7_ directly as an
express third-party beneficiary hereof.

 



 

 



   



 

9.2.8. _Tax Treatment_. The parties will treat any payment received
pursuant to this _Article 9_ as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax
and financial reporting purposes to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Legal Requirements.

 



 

9.3. _Acknowledgment_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and
agrees that (i) none of the Holders, the Holders' Representative, the Acquired
Companies or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives has made or
shall be deemed to have made, and neither Parent nor Merger Sub has relied on,
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, express or implied, with
respect to the Holders, the Holders' Representative, the Acquired Companies,
the Business, the subject matter of this Agreement or the Contemplated
Transactions, or the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding the
Holders, the Holders' Representative, the Acquired Companies, the Business,
the subject matter of this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions
furnished or made available to Parent, Merger Sub and their respective
Representatives, other than the respective representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements of the Company that are expressly set forth in this
Agreement and (ii) none of the Holders, the Holders' Representative, any of
the Acquired Companies or any of their respective Affiliates or
Representatives shall have or be subject to any liability to Parent, Merger
Sub or any other Person resulting from or in connection with the dissemination
to Parent, Merger Sub, Parent's Representatives or any other Person or the use
by Parent, Merger Sub, Parent's Representatives or any other Person of any
such information, including any information, documents or material made
available to Parent, Merger Sub or Parent's Representatives in any "data
room", management presentation or in any other form in connection with or
expectation of the entry into this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions.

 



 

9.4. _Third Party Remedies_. If any Indemnified Person is at any time
entitled (whether by reason of a contractual right, a right to take or bring a
legal action, availability of insurance or otherwise) to recover from another
Person (other than the Indemnifying Party or its Affiliates) any amount in
respect of any matter giving rise to a Loss (whether before or after an
Indemnifying Party has made a payment to the Indemnified Person hereunder and
in respect thereof), the Indemnifying Party shall provide such reasonable
support (not involving the incurrence of liabilities or payment of money that
is not reimbursed by the Indemnified Person) as the Indemnified Person may
reasonably request in connection therewith.

 



 

9.5. _No Right of Contribution_. None of the Holders shall have any claim
or right to contribution or indemnity from the Surviving Corporation, any of
the Acquired Companies or any of the other Parent Indemnified Parties
(including under any provisions of any Organizational Documents, as amended,
of the Surviving Corporation or any of the Acquired Companies or any
indemnification or similar agreement) with respect to any Losses or claims for
indemnification pursuant to this _Article 9_ or other amounts required to be
paid by any of the Holders pursuant to this Agreement.

written, relating to the subject matter of this Agreement or the Escrow

would, under applicable Legal Requirements, be invalid or unenforceable in any

hereunder, and all claims arising in whole or in part out of, related to,
based upon, or in connection herewith or the subject matter hereof or the
Contemplated Transactions (whether sounding in contract, tort, statute or
otherwise) will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with
the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or
conflict of law provision or rule that would cause the application of the laws
of any other jurisdiction. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
each party hereto hereby irrevocably agrees (i) that any dispute, claim or
controversy of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether
in contract or in tort or otherwise, involving any Lenders or any of their
respective Affiliates arising out of or relating to the transactions

to bring or permit any of its Affiliates to bring or support any other Person
in bringing any such dispute, claim or controversy of any kind or description
in any other court, (iii) to waive any right to trial by jury in respect of
any such dispute, claim or controversy of any kind or description, (iv) that a

suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law and (v) that any
such dispute, claim or controversy of any kind or description shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New
York, without regard to the conflicts of law rules of such State that would
result in the application of the laws of any other State.

above, each party to this Agreement, by its execution hereof, hereby (a)
irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of
Chancery (or, if but only if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept
jurisdiction, the Superior Court of the State of Delaware) for the purpose of
any and all actions, suits or proceedings arising in whole or in part out of,
related to, based upon or in connection with this Agreement or the subject
matter hereof or the Contemplated Transactions (whether sounding in contract,
tort, statute or otherwise), (b) waives to the extent not prohibited by
applicable law, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense or
otherwise, in any such action, suit or proceeding any claim that it is not

action, suit or proceeding brought in one of the above-named courts should be
dismissed on grounds of improper venue or _forum non conveniens_ , should be
transferred or removed to any court other than one of the above-named courts,
or should be stayed by reason of the pendency of some other action, suit or
proceeding in any other court other than one of the above-named courts, or
that this Agreement or the subject matter hereof may not be enforced in or by
such court and (c) agrees not to commence or prosecute any such action, suit
or proceeding other than before one of the above-named courts nor to make any
motion or take any other action seeking or intending to cause the transfer or

jurisdiction, improper venue, inconvenient forum or otherwise. Each party
hereby irrevocably (x) consents to service of process in any such action, suit
or proceeding in any manner permitted by the laws of the State of Delaware;

COVENANTS THAT IT SHALL NOT ASSERT (WHETHER AS PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT OR
OTHERWISE) ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY FORUM IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION,
SUIT OR PROCEEDING ARISING IN WHOLE OR IN PART OUT OF, RELATED TO, BASED UPON,

INCLUDING AGAINST ANY LENDER IN CONNECTION WITH THE DEBT FINANCING. ANY PARTY
HERETO MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS _SECTION _ _10.10_
WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF EACH SUCH PARTY TO THE
WAIVER OF ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

 



 

10.11. _Reliance_. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that it has
been informed by each other party that the provisions of _Sections 10.9_ and

above would constitute a material breach of this Agreement.

 



 

10.12. _Specific Enforcement_.

any action, suit or proceeding instituted in any court as specified in
_Section 10.9_ having jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter, in
addition to any other remedy to which such party may be entitled, at law or in
equity. Each party further covenants and agrees that, in the event of any
action, suit or proceeding for specific performance in respect of such breach
or violation, it shall not assert that a remedy at law would be adequate.

 



 

 



   



 

(b) Notwithstanding the right of the Company to obtain an injunction or
injunctions, or other appropriate form of specific performance or equitable
relief described in _Section 10.12(a)_ above, no such right may be enforced to
cause the Merger to be consummated, unless:

 



 

10.12.1. all conditions set forth in _Article 5_ were satisfied (except
for delivery of certificates and other deliverables contemplated to be
delivered at the Closing and which shall have been capable of being delivered
on the date the Closing should have occurred pursuant to _Section 2.2_ ), at
the time when the Closing would have occurred but for the failure of Parent

10.12.2. Parent and Merger Sub are required to complete the Closing
pursuant to _Section 2.2_ ;

 



 

10.12.3. the Debt Financing has been funded or the lenders party to the

Financing will be funded at the Closing;

 



 

10.12.4. the Company has irrevocably confirmed in a written notice
delivered to Parent that if specific performance under this _Section 10.12_ is

10.12.5. Parent and Merger Sub have not consummated the Merger.

 



 

10.13. _Holders ' Representative_.

 



 

10.13.1. As an integral component of the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the Merger, the Holders' Representative is hereby irrevocably
appointed, authorized and empowered as the representative of the Holders and
their respective successors and assigns and as the attorney-in-fact, with full
power of substitution and re-substitution, and exclusive agent for and on
behalf of each such Holder for purposes of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement and is empowered to take such actions contemplated to be taken by
the Holders' Representative under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and
such other actions on behalf of such Holders as it may deem necessary or

Transactions, including (i) taking all actions and making all filings on
behalf of such Holders with any Governmental Authority or other Person
necessary to effect the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, (ii)
making all determinations, decisions and judgments, making all filings,
entering into all Contracts, to prosecute, defend, settle or otherwise
compromise all Actions and claims and to take all other actions, in each case
on behalf of all or any subset of the Holders as required by or in connection
with this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions,
and providing any consents or waivers with respect to any of the foregoing,
(iii) taking any and all other actions on behalf of all or any subset of the

Representative may from time to time deem necessary or desirable to resolve or
settle claims, disagreements, disputes or Actions under or relating to this
Agreement or any Escrow Agreement or otherwise relating to the Contemplated
Transactions, (iv) to receive process on behalf of any or all of the Holders
and their respective successors and assigns in any claim or Action in any way
relating to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Contemplated
Transactions and to file any proofs of debt, claims and petitions as the
Holders' Representative may deem necessary, appropriate or desirable in
connection therewith and to file and prosecute appeals from any decision,
judgment or award rendered in any such Action, (v) enforcing any rights or
remedies of any of the Holders under this Agreement or in connection with the
Contemplated Transactions, (vi) negotiating and executing any waivers or
amendments of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement and (vii) taking all
other actions that are either necessary or appropriate in its judgment for the
accomplishment of the foregoing or contemplated by the terms of this Agreement
or the Escrow Agreement. The Holders' Representative hereby accepts such
appointment.

 



 

 



   



 

10.13.2. A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Holders'
Representative hereunder will constitute a decision, act, consent or
instruction of all Holders and will be final, binding and conclusive upon each
of such Holders, and the Escrow Agent and Parent may rely upon any such
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Holders' Representative as being
the decision, act, consent or instruction of each and every such Holder.

 



 

10.13.3. The Holders' Representative will have the right to recover, at
its sole discretion, from the Holders' Representative Fund, prior to any
distribution to the Holders, (i) the Holders' Representative's out-of-pocket
expenses (including fees and charges of counsel, accountants or other agents)
incurred in serving in that capacity and (ii) any amounts to which it is
entitled pursuant to the indemnification provision in _Section 10.13.5_ (each
item in clauses (i) and (ii) of this _Section 10.13.3_ referred to as a "
_Holders ' Representative Expenses_"). In the event the amount of the Holders'
Representative Fund available to satisfy Holders' Representative Expenses (the
" _Remaining_ ___Fund_ ___Property_ ") is insufficient to satisfy all Holders'
Representative Expenses, then each Holder will be obligated to pay its Pro
Rata Share of the Holders' Representative Expenses in excess of the Remaining
Fund Property.

 



 

10.13.4. The Holders' Representative will incur no liability with respect
to any action taken or suffered by any party in reliance upon any notice,
direction, instruction, consent, statement or other document believed by the
Holders' Representative to be genuine and to have been signed by the proper
person (and the Holders' Representative will have no responsibility to
determine the authenticity thereof), nor for any other action or inaction. In
all questions arising under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, the
Holders' Representative may rely on the advice of outside counsel, and the
Holders' Representative will not be liable to any Holder for anything done,
omitted or suffered in good faith by the Holders' Representative based on such
advice.

 



 

 



   



 

10.13.5. The Holders will severally (each based on and limited to its Pro
Rata Share) but not jointly indemnify the Holders' Representative and hold the
Holders' Representative harmless against any loss, liability or expense
incurred, on the part of the Holders' Representative and arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of the Holders'
Representative's duties hereunder, including the fees and expenses of any
legal counsel or other agents retained by the Holders' Representative.

 



 

10.13.6. In the event that the Holders' Representative becomes unable or
unwilling to continue in its capacity as Holders' Representative, or if the
Holders' Representative resigns as a Holders' Representative, a majority-in-
interest of the Holders may, by written consent, appoint a new representative
as the Holders' Representative. Notice and a copy of the written consent
appointing such new representative and bearing the signatures of a majority-
in-interest of the Holders must be delivered to Parent and, if applicable, the
Escrow Agent. Such appointment will be effective upon the later of the date
indicated in the consent or the date such consent is received by Parent and,
if applicable, the Escrow Agent. For the purposes of this _Section 10.13_ , a
"majority-in-interest of the Holders" means Holders representing in the
aggregate a Pro Rata Share of greater than 50%.

 



 

10.13.7. From time to time, as necessary (in the good faith judgment of
the Holders' Representative), the Holder's Representative shall update the
Pro-Rata Schedule by delivery of written notice to the Parent. Following the
Closing, any payments to be made to the Stockholders shall be made to such
Stockholders by the Surviving Corporation, or Escrow Agent, as applicable, in
accordance with this Agreement, the Transmittal Documents and the Pro-Rata
Schedule. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for payment of any wrong amount to
the Stockholders following the Closing to the extent such amount was
calculated consistently by the Surviving Corporation using the percentages set
forth in the Pro-Rata Schedule.

 



 

10.13.8. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in in this
Agreement or any Escrow Agreement, (i) no Holder shall have any right to, or
any interest or claim relating to the Escrow Funds or the Holders'
Representative Fund unless and until it has been finally determined in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement that such funds or other property are to be distributed to such
Holder in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement, as applicable.

 



 

10.14. _No Waiver_. No failure or delay on the part of any party hereto
in the exercise of any right hereunder will impair such right or be construed
to be a waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement herein, nor will any single or partial
exercise of any such right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
of any other right. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be
deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any other provision hereof (whether or
not similar), or shall constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise
expressly provided. No waiver of any right or remedy hereunder shall be valid
unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the party against whom such
waiver is intended to be effective.

 



 

 



   



 

10.15. _Negotiation of Agreement_. The parties have participated jointly
in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity
or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be
construed as if drafted jointly by the parties and no presumption or burden of
proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the
authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

10.16. _Disclosure Schedules_. The inclusion of any information in the
Disclosure Schedules will not be deemed an admission or acknowledgment that
such information is required to be listed in the Disclosure Schedules or that
such items are material. The Disclosure Schedules are arranged in sections
corresponding to the sections contained in this Agreement merely for
convenience, and the disclosure of an item in one section of the Disclosure
Schedules as an exception to a particular covenant, agreement, representation
or warranty will be deemed adequately disclosed as an exception with respect
to all other covenants, agreements, representations and warranties to the
extent that the relevance of such item to such other covenants,
representations, agreements or warranties is reasonably apparent,
notwithstanding the presence or absence of a specific cross-reference thereto.

 



 

10.17. _Headings_. The headings contained in this Agreement are inserted
only for reference as a matter of convenience and in no way define, limit or
describe the scope or intent of this Agreement, and will not affect in any way
the construction, meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

 



 

10.18. _Counterparts; Signature_. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original for all purposes and
all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument. Signatures
to this Agreement may be delivered by facsimile or pdf by any party and such
signature will be deemed binding for all purposes hereof without delivery of
an original signature being thereafter required.
