claims, litigation, administrative investigations, audits or other
formal proceedings by the IRS, Department of Labor or any government entity
or controversy with respect to any Benefit Plans, other than ordinary and

subjected or could subject the Company to any liability or penalty
under Section 502 of ERISA or to any tax under Chapter 43 of the Code.

coverage to the extent required under Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of
ERISA.

 

  (h) All contributions (including salary reduction contributions),
premiums and other payments that are due to be made have been timely made
to or with respect to each Benefit Plan or, to the extent not due, have been
appropriately accrued on the books of the Company.

Adverse Effect or which have been obtained.

regarding the Business or the Company that has been furnished or
made available to Buyer and its representatives, except as expressly set

Seller hereby agrees with Buyer that Seller will not, and that Seller will
cause its representatives and Affiliates not to, at any time on or after the
Closing Date, directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of
Buyer, disclose or use, any confidential or proprietary information involving

information subject to the foregoing provisions of this sentence will not
include any information generally available to, or known by, the public (other
than as a result of disclosure in violation hereof); provided, further, that
the provisions of this Section 5.2(f) will not prohibit any retention of
copies of records or disclosure (a) required by any applicable Law so long as
reasonable prior notice is given of such disclosure

     

 and a reasonable opportunity is afforded to contest such disclosure or (b)
made in connection with the enforcement of any right or remedy relating to
this Agreement or the Transactions. Seller agrees that Seller will
be responsible for any breach or violation of the provisions of this Section
5.2(f) by any of its representatives or Affiliates.

other party with copies of all filings made by such party, and all
correspondence between such party (and its advisors) with any Governmental
Antitrust Authority and any other information supplied by such party and such
partys Affiliates to a Governmental Antitrust Authority in connection with
this Agreement and the Transactions. Each party shall, subject to applicable
Law, permit counsel for the other party to review in advance any proposed
written and, if practicable, oral, communication to any Governmental
Antitrust Authority. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions herein
provided, in case at any time after the Closing Date any further action is
necessary or desirable to secure the approvals from any and all Governmental
Antitrust Authorities necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement,
the proper officers and/or directors of the parties shall use their best
efforts to take or cause to be taken all such further action.

to be taken the following actions: (i) provide as promptly as practicable
information and documents requested by any Governmental Antitrust Authority
necessary, proper or advisable to permit consummation of the Transactions,
(ii) a proffer by Buyer of its willingness to (X) sell or otherwise dispose

third party) and (Z) amend, assign or terminate such existing licenses or
other agreements (other than a termination that would result in a breach of a
license or such other agreement with a third party) and to enter into such new
licenses or other agreements (and, in each case, to enter into agreements
with the relevant Governmental Antitrust Authority giving effect thereto) in
each case with respect to the foregoing clauses (X), (Y) or (Z) if such action
is necessary or reasonably advisable or as may be required by any Governmental
Antitrust Authority, provided that any such action contemplated by this
clause (ii) shall not be required to be effective prior to the Closing and
(iii) take promptly, in the event that any permanent or preliminary injunction

consummation of any such transactions, any and all steps (including the
appeal thereof, the posting of a bond or the taking of the steps contemplated
by clause (ii) of this subsection (c)) necessary to vacate, modify or suspend
such injunction or order so as to permit such consummation on a schedule as
close as possible to that contemplated by this Agreement. The Seller and Buyer
agree to offer the other party, if possible, a reasonable opportunity to
participate in all telephonic conferences and all meetings with a Governmental
Antitrust Authority.

 

  (e) The filing fees under the Hart-Scott Act or any Other Competition
Laws, as well as the fees and disbursements of any legal counsel or
other advisor jointly retained by the parties in connection with any such
filings, shall be borne by Buyer.

 

  Section 5.4. _Public Announcements_. Neither party will issue any press
release or make any other public disclosures concerning the Transactions or
the contents of this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other
party. Notwithstanding the above, nothing in this Section 5.4 will preclude
any party from making any disclosures required by Law or necessary and proper
in conjunction with the filing of any tax return or other document required to
be filed with any Governmental Entity; provided, that the party required to
make the

     

 release or statement shall allow the other party reasonable time to review
and comment on such release or statement in advance of such issuance.

 

  Section 5.5. _Continuing Access to Records and Personnel_. Buyer shall
retain the books, records, documents, instruments, accounts, correspondence,
writings, evidences of title and other papers relating to the Company in
Buyers possession (the " _Books and Records_ ") for the period of time set
forth in and otherwise in accordance with Buyers records retention policies
on the Closing Date or for such longer period as may be required by Law or any
applicable court order. After the applicable period, before Buyer or
the Company shall dispose of any Books and Records, Buyer shall give at least
45 calendar days prior written notice to such effect to Seller, and Seller
shall be given the opportunity, at its expense, to remove or duplicate and
retain all or any part of such Books and Records as Seller may select. Buyer
will allow Seller reasonable access to such Books and Records, and to
personnel having knowledge of the whereabouts and/or contents of such Books
and Records, for legitimate business reasons, such as the preparation of tax
returns or the defense of litigation. Buyer shall be entitled to recover its
actual out-of-pocket costs (including, without limitation, copying costs)
incurred in providing such records and/or personnel to Seller.

 

  Section 5.6. _Employee Matters_.

 

  (a) Without limiting any additional rights under any Benefit Plan, for
a period of not less than one year following the Closing Date, Buyer shall,
or shall cause the Company to, provide each Company Employee with compensation
and employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to
those provided to each such Company Employee immediately prior to the Closing
Date, in each case, disregarding equity-based compensation (including but not
limited to profits units) , and benefits, whether by continuing the Benefit
Plans or by allowing the Company Employees to participate in Buyers benefit
plans. In addition to the foregoing obligations, Buyer shall, for a period of
not less than one year following the Closing Date, maintain (or cause the
Company to maintain) a severance pay practice, program or arrangement for the
benefit of each Company Employee (other than profits units) that is
substantially comparable to such practice, program or arrangement in effect
immediately prior to the Closing Date with respect to such Company Employee.

 

  (b) Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company to, give Company Employees
full credit for all purposes, including, without limitation, eligibility to
participate and vesting (except benefit accruals), under such employee benefit
plans or arrangements maintained by Buyer in which such Company Employees
participate for such Company Employees pre-Closing Date service to the
extent recognized by the Company and its Benefit Plans immediately prior to
the Closing Date.

 

  (c) To the extent permitted by the terms of the Benefit Plans, Buyer
shall, or shall cause the Company to, make all commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) waive all limitations as to pre-existing
conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to the Company Employees under any welfare
benefit plans in which such Company Employees may be eligible to participate
after the Closing Date and (ii) provide each Company Employee with credit for
any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Closing Date (in the same
plan year as that in which the Closing Date falls) in satisfying any

     

 applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any welfare plans
that such Company Employees are eligible to participate in after the Closing
Date.

 

  (d) Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as an amendment to any
Benefit Plan.

 

  Section 5.7. _Tax Matters_.

 

  (a) Buyer shall have the right to control the conduct of any audit,
examination, investigation or administrative, court or other proceeding, that
could, if pursued successfully, result in or give rise to a claim for
indemnification for any Tax (a " _Tax Claim_ ") against the Company or any
Subsidiary for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period (as defined
below). The Seller shall be entitled to participate in any such proceeding at
its sole cost and expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, after the Closing
the Buyer shall not settle any such Tax Claim without the prior written
consent of Seller, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. If the Company or
Seller receive any written communication with respect to a Tax Claim, then
such party shall make commercially reasonable efforts to promptly notify
the other parties hereto in writing of the existence of such Tax Claim.

 

  (b) Seller, Buyer and the Company shall reasonably cooperate and
consult in good faith with each other (i) during the course of the
preparation of federal, state, county, provincial, municipal, local or
foreign Tax Returns of the Company for periods ending on or before or
including the Closing Date (including any Straddle Period), and (ii) in
connection with any adjustment, claim or question asserted or raised by any
taxing authority with respect to the Company and in respect of any period
ending on or before or including the Closing Date (including any Straddle
Period). Any information obtained by any Person in connection with any Tax
matters to which this Agreement applies shall be kept confidential, except as
may be otherwise necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or
claims for refund or in conducting an audit or other proceeding in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement or as otherwise required by law.

 

  (c) To the extent permitted by applicable law, Buyer will, and will
cause the Company to, elect with the appropriate taxing authority to
close the taxable periods of the Company as of and including the Closing
Date. In any case where applicable law does not require or permit a taxable
period of the Company to be closed as of and including the Closing Date (a "
_Pre-Closing Tax Period_ "), any Tax pertaining to a Straddle Period shall be
determined in accordance with the applicable provisions of _Section
8.1(a)(iv)_ hereof.

 

  (d) Seller shall cause the Company to prepare any and all Tax Returns
which are required to be filed for, by, on behalf of or with respect to the
Company on or before the Closing Date. Buyer will prepare, or cause to be
prepared, and file, or cause to be filed, all other Tax Returns for the
Company provided, that with respect to Tax Returns for any tax periods ending
on or prior to the Closing Date (i) such Tax Returns shall be filed in a
manner consistent with past practice provided that it is consistent with
applicable law and (ii) such income Tax Returns shall be submitted to Seller
not later than thirty (30) days prior to the due date for filing such income
Tax Returns (or, if such due date is within forty five (45) days following the
Closing Date, as promptly as practicable following the Closing Date) for
review and comment by

     

 Seller. In finalizing any and all income Tax Returns under this Section
5.7(d), Buyer agrees to consider in good faith any and all reasonable comments
received from Seller.

Section 5.7 and any other provision of this Agreement, the provisions of this
Section 5.7 shall control.

 

  Section 5.8. _WARN Notices_. Any workforce reductions carried out
following the Closing Date by Buyer or Ohmstede or their respective
Subsidiaries shall be done in accordance with all applicable Laws governing
the employment relationship and termination thereof including, without
limitation, the U.S. Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act and
regulations promulgated thereunder, and any comparable state or local Law.

 

  Section 5.9. _Termination of Affiliate Arrangements; Seller Release_.

 

  (a) Except as contemplated by this Agreement or as set forth in Section
5.9 of the Disclosure Schedule, on or prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall have repaid or otherwise settled all of its outstanding Indebtedness
(including interest thereon) and satisfied all of its other liabilities (other
than payables for goods sold and services rendered which shall be paid in the
Ordinary Course of Business) owed to Seller or its Affiliates (other than the
Company) and Seller and its Affiliates shall have repaid or otherwise settled
all of their outstanding Indebtedness (including interest thereon) and
satisfied all of their other liabilities (other than payables for goods sold
and services rendered which shall be paid in the Ordinary Course of Business)
owed to the Company. All agreements between the Company and Seller or its
Affiliates shall be terminated as of the Closing Date, and all obligations
and liabilities thereunder shall have been satisfied.

 

  (b) Effective as of the Closing, Seller hereby releases, remises and
forever discharges any and all rights and claims that Seller, as applicable,
has had, now has or might now have against the Company.

 

  Section 5.10. _No Solicitation; Other Offers_. From the date hereof
until the termination hereof, Seller will not, and will cause the Company and
the officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants, consultants or other agents or advisors of Seller and the Company
not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage the
submission of any proposal or offer from any Person relating to the
acquisition of any capital stock or other voting securities of the Company
(including any acquisition structured as an merger, consolidation,
amalgamation or share exchange), (ii) solicit, initiate, or encourage the
submission of any proposal or offer from any Person relating to the
acquisition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, or (iii)
participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person regarding,
furnish any information with respect to, assist or participate in, or
facilitate in any other manner any effort or attempt by any Person to do or
seek, any of the foregoing. Seller and the Company will notify Buyer
immediately if any Person makes any proposal, offer, inquiry or contact with
respect to any of the foregoing (whether solicited or unsolicited).

 

  Section 5.11. _Notice of Developments_. From the date of this Agreement
until the Closing Date, Seller and the Company will give Buyer prompt written
notice upon becoming

     

 aware of any material development affecting the assets, liabilities,
business, financial condition, operations of the Company, or any event or
circumstance that has resulted or would reasonably be expected to result, in a
breach of, or inaccuracy in, any of the representations and warranties set
forth in ARTICLE III; provided, however, that no such disclosure will be
deemed to prevent or cure any such breach of, or inaccuracy in, amend or
supplement any Schedule to, or otherwise disclose any exception to, any of
the representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement.

 

  Section 5.12. _Nonsolicitation of Employees_. For a period of three
years from and after the Closing Date, neither Seller nor any of its
Affiliates will recruit, offer employment, employ, engage as a consultant,
lure or entice away, or in any other manner persuade or attempt to persuade,
any Person who is an employee of the Company to leave the employ of the
Company. If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares
that any term or provision of this Section 5.12 is invalid or unenforceable,
the parties hereto agree that the court making the determination of invalidity
or unenforceability will have the power to reduce the scope, duration, or
area of the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to
replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or
provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing
the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this
Agreement will be enforceable as so modified after the expiration of the time
within which the judgment may be appealed.

 

  Section 5.13. _Tax Benefit Deposit_. On the earlier of (i) five days
after the due date for filing of the Companys 2006 federal and state income
Tax Returns reflecting a Bonus Deduction or (ii) the Closing Date, Seller
shall cause the Company to deposit into escrow funds determined in accordance
with Section 1.4 of the Prior Stock Purchase Agreement. Upon the receipt of
any refund (including any credit or offset) associated with the Companys 2006
federal and state income tax Returns, Buyer shall cause the Company to
immediately pay over such refund (or the amount of such credit or offset) to
Seller. Upon receipt of any refunds (including any credit or offset) for the
2004 and 2005 taxable years of the Company attributable to the carryback of
any net operating losses generated as a result of the Bonus Deductions, Buyer
will cause the Company to deposit such refunds (or the amount of such credit
or offset) into escrow in accordance with Section 1.4 of the Prior Stock
Purchase Agreement.

 

  Section 5.14. _Further Assurances_. From and after the Closing Date,
upon the request of either Seller or Buyer, each of the parties hereto will
do, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such further acts, assurances, deeds,
assignments, transfers, conveyances and other instruments and papers as may be
reasonably required or appropriate to carry out the Transactions. Seller will
not take any action that is designed or intended to have the effect of
discouraging any lessor, licensor, supplier, distributor or customer of the
Company or other Person with whom the Company has a relationship
from maintaining the same relationship with the Company after the Closing as
it maintained prior to the Closing.

 

  Section 5.15. _Code Section 280G Shareholder Approval_. Prior to
Closing, Ohmstede shall conduct a separate vote of its shareholders and
perform such other acts as are within its power to satisfy all of the
requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the regulations
thereunder for exemption of any compensation or other payment payable under
any contract, agreement, plan or arrangement covering any present or former
employee or director of, or consultant or other service provider with respect
to, Ohmstede and/or its Subsidiaries that

     

 would give rise to any "excess parachute payment," as that term is defined
in Section 280G(b) of the Code, such that after giving effect to such vote and
all related waivers and other agreements no "parachute payments" (within the
meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code and the applicable rulings and final
regulations thereunder) will be paid or provided to any such person by the
Company.

 ARTICLE VIII. 
  _INDEMNIFICATION_

 

  Section 8.1. _Indemnification by Seller_.

 

  (a) _Indemnification_. Subject to the limitations set forth in this
ARTICLE VIII, Seller will indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and each of its
Affiliates (including, following the Closing, the Company) and the
representatives and Affiliates of each of the foregoing Persons (each, a "
_Buyer Indemnified Person_ ") from, against and in respect of any and all
actions, liabilities, Orders, Liens, losses, damages, bonds, dues,
assessments, fines, penalties, Taxes, fees, costs (including costs of
investigation, defense and enforcement of this Agreement), expenses or
amounts paid in settlement (in each case, including reasonable attorneys and
experts fees and expenses), whether or not involving a Third Party Claim
(collectively, " _Losses_ "), incurred or suffered by Buyer Indemnified
Persons or any of them as a result of, arising out of or directly or
indirectly relating to:

       | (i) any  breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation
or warranty made by Seller  in this Agreement or in any schedule or
certificate delivered by Seller  pursuant hereto (in each case, as such
representation or warranty would  read if all qualifications as to
materiality, including each reference  to the defined term "Company Material
Adverse Effect", were deleted  therefrom); or  
---|--- 
     |   
     | (ii) any  breach or violation of any covenant or agreement
of Seller (including under  this ARTICLE VIII) in or pursuant to this
Agreement; or   
     |   
  \t \t \t|  

 (iii) any  fraud of Seller or the Company or violation of criminal law; or

 \t  
  
 \t \t \t|  

 (iv) any  (A) Taxes of the Company or any Subsidiary with respect to any Tax periods  ending on or prior to the Closing Date and, with respect to any Tax period  that begins prior to the Closing Date and ends after the Closing Date (a " _Straddle  Period_ "), the portion of such Tax period  ending on the Closing Date, except to the extent an accrual for each such  Tax (excluding any accrual for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing  differences between book and Tax income) is provided on the audited balance  sheet of the Annual Financial Statements, (B) all Taxes of any member of  an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group of which the Company  or any Subsidiary is or was a member prior to the Closing Date, including  pursuant to Treasury regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar  state, local or foreign Law and (C) any and all Taxes of any other Person  (other than the Company or any Subsidiary) imposed on the Company or Subsidiary  as a transferee or successor, by contract, pursuant to any Law or otherwise  for any Tax period ending on or prior to the Closing Date. For purposes of  the foregoing, whenever it is necessary to determine the liability for Taxes  of the Company or a Subsidiary for a Straddle Period, (A) the determination  of the Taxes of the Company or Subsidiary for the portion of the Straddle  Period ending on and including, and the portion of the Straddle Period beginning  after, the Closing Date will be determined by assuming that the Straddle  Period consisted of two taxable years or periods, one which ended at the  close of the Closing Date and the other which began at the beginning of the  day following the Closing Date, and, items of income, gain, deduction, loss  or credit for

 \t  
          |   
---|--- 
      | the Straddle Periods will be allocated between such  two taxable
years or periods on a closing of the books basis by assuming  that the books
of the Company or the Subsidiary were closed at the close  of the Closing
Date, provided, however, that exemptions, allowances or  deductions that are
calculated on an annual basis (such as deductions  for depreciation and real
estate taxes) will be apportioned between such  two taxable years or periods
on a daily basis, or (B) in the case of  Taxes imposed on a periodic basis
with respect to the assets of the Company  or Subsidiary or otherwise
measured by the level of any item, deemed  to be the amount of such Taxes for
the entire period, multiplied by a  fraction the numerator of which is the
number of calendar days in the  period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the  number of calendar days in the entire period.
Notwithstanding the foregoing,  Seller shall not indemnify, defend or hold
harmless a Buyer Indemnified  Person for any liability for Taxes (i)
attributable to any action taken  (which would otherwise give rise to a Tax
indemnity payment) after the  Closing by Buyer, any of its Affiliates
(including the Company or its  Subsidiaries), or any transferee of Buyer or
any of its Affiliates (other  than any such action expressly required or
otherwise expressly contemplated  by this Agreement or with the written
consent of Seller) or (ii) attributable  to the disallowance of any Bonus
Deductions as described in Section 1.4  of the Prior Stock Purchase Agreement
or any deductions associated with  the exercise of options by Douglas R.
Harrington, Jr. to purchase 7,500  shares of common stock of HNT Holdings
Inc. pursuant to the Stock Option  Agreement dated as of August 9, 2006;   
      |   
      | (v) the  Seller Transaction Expenses; or  
      |   
      | (vi) any  obligation of the Company under the Prior Stock
Purchase Agreement.   
  

  (b) _Monetary Limitations_. Seller will have no obligation to indemnify
Buyer Indemnified Persons pursuant to Section 8.1(a)(i) in respect of Losses
arising from the breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty
described therein unless (i) with respect to any claim (or series of related
claims) unless such claim (or series of related claims) involves Losses in
excess of $5,000 (the " _Threshold_ ") (it being understood that if Losses
under a claim equal or exceed the Threshold, the Buyer Indemnified Parties
shall be indemnified for such Losses including the initial $5,000) and (ii)
until the aggregate amount of all such Losses incurred or suffered by Buyer
Indemnified Persons exceeds $4,570,000 (the " _Deductible_ ") (at which point
Seller will indemnify Buyer Indemnified Persons for all such Losses in excess
of, but not including, the Deductible) (it being understood that any claims
not meeting the Threshold shall not be counted toward the Deductible).
Sellers aggregate liability in respect of claims for indemnification pursuant
to Section 8.1(a)(i) and (iv) shall not exceed $30,000,000 (the " _Cap_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing limitations will not apply to
claims for indemnification pursuant to Section 8.1(a)(i) in respect of
breaches of, or inaccuracies in, representations and warranties set forth in
Section 3.1 (Due Organization), Section 3.2 (Authorization and Validity of
Agreement), Section 3.5 (Capitalization; Shares; Subsidiaries) or Section
3.21 (Finders; Brokers); _provided_ , _further_ , that claims for
indemnification pursuant to Section 8.1(a)(i) in respect of breaches of, or
inaccuracies in, representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.13 (Tax
Matters) will be subject to the Cap but will not be subject to the Threshold
and the Deductible. Claims for indemnification pursuant to any other
provision of Section 8.1(a) are not

     

 subject to the monetary limitations set forth in this Section 8.1(b);
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event will Sellers aggregate liability
in respect of claims for indemnification pursuant to Section 8.1(a) exceed the
amount of the Purchase Price.

 

  Section 8.2. _Indemnification by Buyer_.

 

  (a) _Indemnification_. Subject to the limitations set forth in this
ARTICLE VIII, Buyer will indemnify and hold harmless Seller and Sellers

respect of any and all Losses incurred or suffered by Seller Indemnified
Persons or any of them as a result of, arising out of or relating to, directly
or indirectly: 

 



       | (i) any  breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation
or warranty made by Buyer  in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered
pursuant hereto (in  each case, as such representation or warranty would read
if all qualifications  as to materiality were deleted therefrom); or  
---|--- 
      |   
      | (ii) any  breach or violation of any covenant or agreement
of Buyer (including  under this ARTICLE VIII) or any covenant or agreement of

Buyer will have no obligation to indemnify Seller Indemnified Persons pursuant  to Section 8.2(a)(i) in respect of Losses arising from the breach of, or  inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty described therein unless (i)  with respect to any claim (or series of related claims) unless such claim  (or series of related claims) involves Losses in excess of the Threshold  (it being understood that if Losses under a claim equal or exceed the Threshold,  the Seller Indemnified Parties shall be indemnified for such Losses including  the initial $5,000) and (ii) until the aggregate amount of all such Losses incurred or suffered by Seller Indemnified Persons exceeds the Deductible (at which point Buyer will indemnify Seller Indemnified Persons for all such Losses in excess of, but not including, the Deductible) (it being understood that any claims not meeting the Threshold shall not be counted toward the Deductible). Buyers aggregate liability in respect of claims for indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(i) will not exceed the Cap; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing limitations will not apply to (a) claims for indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(i) in respect of breaches of, or inaccuracies in, representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.1(Due Organization), Section 4.2 (Authorization and Validity of Agreement), or Section 4.9 (Finders; Brokers) or (b) claims based upon fraud or intentional misrepresentation.

describing such breach or inaccuracy in reasonable detail in light of the
circumstances then known to the Indemnified Party, is provided to the
Indemnifying Party:

        | (i) at  any time, in the case of any breach of, or

 Section 8.4. _Indemnification Procedures_.

 

  (a) _Notice of Claim_. If any third party notifies a party that may be
entitled to indemnification pursuant to this ARTICLE VIII (an " _Indemnified
Party_ ") with respect to any matter (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") which may
give rise to an indemnified claim against an indemnifying party (an "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") under this ARTICLE VIII, then the Indemnified Party
will promptly give written notice to the Indemnifying Party; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in notifying
the Indemnifying Party will relieve the Indemnifying Party from any
obligation under this ARTICLE VIII, except to the extent such delay actually
and materially prejudices the Indemnifying Party.

 

  (b) _Assumption of Defense, etc_. The Indemnifying Party will be
entitled to participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim that is the
subject of a notice given by the Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 8.4(a)
. In addition, the Indemnifying Party will have the right to defend the
Indemnified Party against the Third Party Claim with counsel of its choice
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party so long as (a) the
Indemnifying Party gives written notice to the Indemnified Party within thirty
(30) days after the Indemnified Party has given notice of the Third Party
Claim that the Indemnifying Party will indemnify the Indemnified Party from
and against the entirety of any and all Losses the Indemnified Party may
suffer resulting from, arising out of, relating to, in the nature of, or
caused by the Third Party Claim, (b) the Indemnifying Party provides the
Indemnified Party with evidence reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party
that the Indemnifying Party will have adequate financial resources to defend
against the Third Party Claim and fulfill its indemnification obligations
hereunder, (c) the Third Party Claim involves only money damages and does not
seek an injunction or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party,
(d) the Indemnified Party has

     

 not been advised by counsel that an actual or potential conflict exists
between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party in connection with
the defense of the Third Party Claim, (e) the Third Party Claim does not
relate to or otherwise arise in connection with Taxes or any criminal or
regulatory enforcement action, (f) settlement of, an adverse judgment with
respect to or the Indemnifying Partys conduct of the defense of the Third
Party Claim is not, in the good faith judgment of the Indemnified Party,
likely to be adverse to the Indemnified Partys reputation or continuing
business interests (including its relationships with current or potential
customers, suppliers or other parties material to the conduct of its
business) and (g) the Indemnifying Party conducts the defense of the Third
Party Claim actively and diligently. If the Third Party Claim is being
defended by the Indemnifying Party in accordance with the foregoing sentence,
the Indemnified Party may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and
expense and participate in (but not control) the defense of the Third Party
Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party will pay the fees
and expenses of separate co-counsel retained by the Indemnified Party that are
incurred prior to Indemnifying Partys assumption of control of the defense
of the Third Party Claim.

 

  (c) _Limitations on Indemnifying Party_. The Indemnifying Party will
not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any compromise or
settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party unless such judgment, compromise or
settlement (a) provides for the payment by the Indemnifying Party of money as
sole relief for the claimant, (b) results in the full and general release of
Buyer Indemnified Persons or Seller Indemnified Persons, as applicable, from
all liabilities arising or relating to, or in connection with, the Third Party
Claim and (c) involves no finding or admission of any violation of Laws or
the rights of any Person and no effect on any other claims that may be made
against the Indemnified Party.

 

  (d) _Indemnified Party s Control_. If the Indemnifying Party does not
deliver the notice contemplated by clause (a), or the evidence contemplated
by clause (b), of Section 8.4(b) within 30 days after the Indemnified Party
has given notice of the Third Party Claim, or otherwise at any time fails to
conduct the defense of the Third Party Claim actively and diligently, the
Indemnified Party may defend and may consent to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any compromise or settlement with respect to, the Third Party Claim
in any manner it may deem appropriate (and the Indemnified Party need
not consult with, or obtain any consent from, the Indemnifying Party in
connection therewith). If such notice and evidence is given on a timely basis
and the Indemnifying Party conducts the defense of the Third Party Claim
actively and diligently but any of the other conditions in Section 8.4(b) is
or becomes unsatisfied, the Indemnified Party may defend, and may consent to
the entry of any judgment or enter into any compromise or settlement with
respect to, the Third Party Claim;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnifying Party will not be bound by the entry of any such judgment
consented to, or any such compromise or settlement effected, without its
prior written consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed). In the event that the Indemnified Party conducts the defense of the
Third Party Claim pursuant to this Section 8.4(d), the Indemnifying Party
will (a) advance the Indemnified Party promptly and periodically for the costs
of defending against the Third Party Claim (including reasonable attorneys
fees and expenses) and (b) remain responsible for any and all other Losses
that the Indemnified Party may incur or suffer resulting from, arising out of,
relating to, in the nature of or caused by the Third Party Claim to the
fullest extent provided in this ARTICLE VIII.

     

  (e) Buyer and Seller, each in its capacity as an Indemnifying Party,
hereby consents to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any court in which any
Third Party Claim may be brought against any Indemnified Party for purposes of
any claim which such Indemnified Party may have against such Indemnifying
Party pursuant to this Agreement in connection with such Third Party Claim,
and in furtherance thereof, the provisions of Section 9.8 are incorporated
herein by reference _mutatis mutandis_.

 

  (f) In calculating amounts payable to an Indemnified Party, the amount
of any indemnified Losses shall be determined without duplication of
any other Loss for which an indemnification claim has been made under any
other representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement and shall be computed
net of (i) payments recovered by the Indemnified Party under any insurance
policy with respect to such Losses, and (ii) any prior or subsequent recovery
by the Indemnified Party from any Person with respect to such Losses.

 

  (g) Each Indemnified Party shall make commercially reasonably efforts
to mitigate any Losses that an Indemnified Party asserts under this  _ARTICLE
VIII_ by pursuing recovery under any available insurance policies or similar
arrangements.

 

  Section 8.5. _No Circular Recovery_. Seller hereby agrees that it will
not make any claim for indemnification against Buyer, the Company or any of
their respective Affiliates by reason of the fact that Seller was a
controlling person, director, manager, officer, employee or Representative of
the Company or was serving as such for another Person (whether such claim is
for Losses of any kind or otherwise and whether such claim is pursuant to any
statute, Organizational Document, Contractual Obligation or otherwise) at the
request of Buyer, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates
with respect to any claim brought by a Buyer Indemnified Person against
Seller relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions. With respect to
any claim brought by a Buyer Indemnified Person against Seller relating to
this Agreement or any of the Transactions, Seller expressly waives any right
of subrogation, contribution, advancement, indemnification or other claim
against the Company with respect to any amounts owed by Seller pursuant to
this ARTICLE VIII.

 

  Section 8.6. _Indemnity Escrow_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, any claim for indemnification to which Buyer
Indemnified Persons are entitled under this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.1(a)(i) and (iv) will be satisfied solely from the Escrow Funds, and in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement and this Agreement, and
Buyer Indemnified Persons will not be entitled to any payment from any source
other than the Escrow Funds for any such indemnification claim. For as long as
there are funds in the account maintained under the Escrow Agreement, any and
all amounts payable by Seller, as Indemnifying Party to a Buyer Indemnified
Person with respect to any other claims made under Section 8.1(a) will be paid
in cash first out of such account established pursuant to the Escrow Agreement
and thereafter by Seller in accordance with payment instructions provided by
Buyer. Seller and Buyer will jointly direct the Escrow Agent to disburse to
Seller (i) $17 million of the Escrow Funds on the date that is 18 months from
the Closing Date and (ii) the remaining balance of the Escrow Fund on the
Escrow Termination Date, _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event a Buyer
Indemnified Person has made an Indemnity Claim under this ARTICLE VIII or
other demand for payment prior to the date of any distribution (a " _Pending
Claim_ "), then any disbursement of the balance or remaining balance at such
time shall be less an amount sufficient

     

 to satisfy all such Pending Claims made since that date of any prior
distribution (or the Closing Date in the case of the first distribution) until
each such Pending Claim is fully and finally resolved, in each case to
such account or accounts as may be specified by Seller in writing to the
Escrow Agent prior to such date.

 

  Section 8.7. Sole Remedy. After the Closing, the provisions of this
ARTICLE VIII shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of the
parties against each other with respect to any Losses they may suffer arising
from the breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty under
this Agreement or with respect to Taxes.
