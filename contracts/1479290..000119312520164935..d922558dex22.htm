between any of the parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement: (a)
each of the parties irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits to
the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware (or, only if such court declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware);
and (b) if any such action is commenced in a state court, then, subject to
applicable Law, no party shall object to the removal of such action to any
federal court located in Delaware. Each of the parties waives any defense of
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action so brought and waives any
bond, surety or other security that might be required of any other party with
respect thereto. Each party hereto hereby waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, any right to trial by jury of any claim, demand, action, or
cause of action (i) arising under this Agreement or the Proxy or (ii) in any
way connected with or related or incidental to the dealings of the parties
hereto in respect of this Agreement or any of the transactions related hereto,
in each case, whether now existing or hereafter arising, and whether in
contract, tort, equity, or otherwise. Each party hereto hereby further agrees
and consents that any such claim, demand, action, or cause of action shall be
decided by court trial without a jury and that the parties hereto may file a
copy of this Agreement with any court as written evidence of the consent of
the parties hereto to the waiver of their right to trial by jury.

order, shall be entitled to receive a reasonable sum for its out-of-pocket
attorneys fees and all other reasonable costs and expenses incurred in such
action or suit (in addition to any other relief to which the prevailing party
may be entitled).

 

6.16 Waiver. No failure on the part of any party hereto (or any third party
beneficiary hereof) to exercise any power, right, privilege or remedy under
this Agreement, and no delay on the part of any such Person in exercising any
power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, shall operate as a
waiver of such power, right, privilege or remedy; and no single or partial
exercise of any such power, right, privilege or remedy shall preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or of any other power, right, privilege or
remedy. No party hereto (and no third party beneficiary hereof) shall be
deemed to have waived any claim available to such Person arising out of this
Agreement, or any power, right, privilege or remedy of such Person under this
Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim, power, right, privilege or remedy
is expressly set forth in a written instrument duly executed and delivered on
behalf of such Person; and any such waiver shall not be applicable or have any
effect except as provided therein.

Stockholder set forth in this Agreement shall be construed as independent of
any other Contract between Stockholder, on the one hand, and the Company or
Parent, on the other. The existence of any claim or cause of action
by Stockholder against the Company or Parent shall not constitute a defense
to the enforcement of any of such covenants or obligations under this
Agreement against Stockholder. Nothing in this Agreement shall limit any of
the rights or remedies of Parent or the Company under the Merger Agreement,
or any of the rights or remedies of Parent or the Company, or any of the
obligations of Stockholder, under any agreement between Stockholder and Parent
or any certificate or instrument executed by Stockholder in favor of Parent;

FORM OF IRREVOCABLE PROXY

   

IRREVOCABLE PROXY

 

The undersigned stockholder (the "Stockholder") of HINT, INC., a Delaware
corporation (the "Company"), hereby irrevocably (to the fullest extent
permitted by law) appoints and constitutes Herat Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware
corporation and REVANCE THERAPEUTICS, INC., a Delaware corporation
("Parent"), and each of them, the attorneys and proxies of the Stockholder
(each, a "Proxyholder"), with full power of substitution and resubstitution,
to the full extent of the Stockholders rights with respect to: (a) the
outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock owned of record by the Stockholder
as of the date of this proxy, which shares are specified on the final page of
this proxy; and (b) any and all other issued and outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company as to which the Stockholder becomes the record
owner on or after the date hereof. (The shares of the capital stock of the
Company referred to in clauses "(a)" and "(b)" of the immediately preceding
sentence are collectively referred to as the "Shares.") Subject to that
certain Amended and Restated Voting Agreement, dated December 14, 2018 (the "
_Prior Voting Agreement_ "), by and among the Company and the individuals
named therein, upon the execution of this proxy, all prior proxies given by
the Stockholder with respect to any of the Shares are hereby revoked, and the
Stockholder agrees that no subsequent proxies will be given with respect to
any of the Shares. This Proxy is subject to the terms of Section 7.8 of the
Prior Voting Agreement, and if there is any conflict between this Agreement
and the Prior Voting Agreement that would result in a breach or violation of
the Prior Voting Agreement by the Stockholder, the Prior Voting Agreement
shall control.

This proxy is irrevocable, is coupled with an interest and is granted in
connection with, and as security for, the Voting Agreement, dated as of the
date hereof, between Parent and the Stockholder (the "Voting Agreement"), and
is granted in consideration of the Company and Parent entering into the
Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated as of the date hereof,
among Parent, Heart Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, and
the Company (the "Merger Agreement"). This proxy will terminate on the
Expiration Date (as defined in the Voting Agreement). Unless otherwise
specified, capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in this proxy have
the meanings assigned to such terms in the Voting Agreement.

The Proxyholder is hereby empowered, and may exercise this proxy, without
notice to the Stockholder, to vote and cause to be present, the Shares at any
time until the Expiration Date at any meeting of the stockholders of the
Company (however called) and at every adjournment or postponement thereof, and
in connection with any action by written consent of stockholders of the
Company:

(a) in favor of: (i) adopting the Merger Agreement and approving the
Merger and the other Contemplated Transactions; (ii) the Company Stockholder
Matters, (iii) each of the other actions contemplated by the Merger Agreement;
and (iv) any action required in furtherance of any of the foregoing
(including the waiver of any notices relating to the Merger Agreement, the
Merger, or the Contemplated Transactions, under the Companys certificate of
incorporation, bylaws or under the Delaware General Corporation Law);

 

(b) against any action or agreement that would result in a material breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of the Company in the
Merger Agreement; and

(c) against any Takeover Proposal or any other action that would
reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with, delay, postpone, discourage
or adversely affect the Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions.

 

The Stockholder may vote the Shares on all other matters not referred to in
this proxy, and the attorneys and proxies named above may not exercise this
proxy with respect to such other matters.

   

This proxy shall be binding upon the heirs, estate, executors, personal
representatives, successors and assigns of the Stockholder (including any
transferee of any of the Shares).

Any term or provision of this proxy that is invalid or unenforceable in any
situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability
of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the validity or enforceability
of the offending term or provision in any other situation or in any other
jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction
declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid or unenforceable, the
Stockholder agrees that the court making such determination shall have the
power to limit such term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases,
or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or
provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing
the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this
proxy shall be enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does not
exercise the power granted to it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto
agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a valid
and enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to the extent possible,
the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable
term or provision.
