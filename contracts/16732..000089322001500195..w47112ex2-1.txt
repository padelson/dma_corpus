Group and the Purchaser\'s Group for all purposes  (including Tax).  6. THE
COMPANY  (A) The Sellers undertake to procure that, to the extent
permissible under  applicable law, at Completion the Company is free of

rights over any Company  Property prior to Completion.  7. STOCKS
ADJUSTMENT  (A) Each of the parties shall comply with the requirements
relating to that  party set out in Schedule 5 in relation to the Completion

prevent:   (i) any matter reasonably undertaken in response to events beyond
the  control of any member of the Sellers\' Group and the Company, with  the
intention of minimising any adverse effect of such events  where it is not
reasonably practicable in the circumstances for  the Sellers to have obtained
the consent of the Purchaser before  undertaking such matter PROVIDED THAT

circumstances promptly after  doing so;   (ii) the completion or

the Purchaser (or the Designated Purchaser) and have been paid in  connection
with the Business Assets.  (E) The Purchaser shall, as soon as reasonably

Group) hold them and any distributions, property and rights deriving from 
them in trust for the relevant Designated Purchaser and deal with the  Shares
and any distributions, property and rights deriving from them as  the
Purchaser (on behalf of the relevant Designated Purchaser) directs.  In
particular, the Sellers shall exercise all voting rights carried by  such
Shares as the  26  26    Purchaser (on behalf of the relevant Designated
Purchaser) directs and  shall execute an instrument of proxy or other
document which enables the  Purchaser (on behalf of the relevant Designated
Purchaser) or its  representative to attend and vote at any meeting of the
Company.  (G) As soon as possible after Completion and with respect to any
UK Business  Assets which are plant and machinery for the purposes of Part II
of the  Capital Allowances Act 1990 and which are also fixtures (as that term
is  defined in section 51(2) of that Act) and which the Sellers or any
member  of the Sellers\' Group have been claiming allowances as fixtures,
the  Sellers shall procure that the relevant member of the Sellers\' Group 
shall, and the Purchaser shall procure that the relevant Designated 
Purchaser shall, jointly elect by notice pursuant to section 59B(2) of  that
Act to determine in accordance with section 59B and 59C of that Act  how much
of the consideration payable under this Agreement should  reasonably fall to
be treated as expenditure on the provision of such  fixtures.  (H) In
respect of all the registered Intellectual Property which is owned by  the
Company or which has been transferred to the Purchaser\'s Group under  the
Intellectual Property Assignments, the Sellers shall as soon as  reasonably
practicable, and shall in any event use their reasonable  endeavours to do so
within 3 months of Completion, deliver to the  Purchaser:   (i) subject to
paragraph (ii) below, the originals of all registration  certificates and
renewal certificates and (where no registration  has yet been obtained) the
applicable receipts; or   (ii) where no originals exists for the documents

months from Completion, that all renewal fees which a member  of the

for payment, and (ii) that a copy of all correspondence  received by a member
of the Sellers\' Group regarding the maintenance of  such registrations and
the prosecution of such applications is, in each  case, provided to the

not assigned to the Purchaser or  to another member of the Purchaser\'s Group
by operation of this Agreement  or under any of the Intellectual Property
Assignments any Business IPR,  the Sellers undertake to procure that the
relevant Business Seller  assigns such Business IPR to the Purchaser or to
another member of the  Purchaser\'s Group nominated by the Purchaser.  (K)
The Seller shall procure that at Completion relevant members of the 
Sellers\' Group grant to the Purchaser (or, at the Purchaser\'s election, 
another member of the Purchaser\'s Group) a perpetual, non-exclusive 
royalty-free, irrevocable, assignable licence (with the right to  sub-
license) to use any Intellectual Property (other than the Excluded  IPR, the
Raguletto Marks, any trade mark (registered or unregistered) and  patent or
any registered design (or application for a registered design))  which was
used (but not exclusively used) in the Business in the twelve  months prior
to Completion.  11. THIRD PARTY CONSENTS FOR THE SALE OF BUSINESS
ASSETS  (A) Subject to sub-clause (C), where any consent, approval or
agreement of  any third party is required to the transfer of any of the
Business Assets  or where any governmental or regulatory procedure,
application or other  requirement must be complied with to enable such
transfer lawfully to  take place (other than, in either case, in relation to
the transfer of  any Contract or the performance of any Contract by any
Designated  Purchaser) and such consent, approval or agreement has not been
obtained  or that procedure, application or other requirement has not been
complied  with (as the case may be) at or before Completion, then the
following  provisions shall apply:   (i) the sale of the relevant Business
Assets shall not take effect,  notwithstanding Completion, until that
consent, approval or  agreement has been obtained or that procedure,
application or  other requirement has been complied with (as the case may
be);  and   (ii) the Sellers and the Purchaser shall use their respective 
reasonable endeavours after Completion to obtain the consent,  approval or
agreement or to ensure that the relevant procedure,  application or other
requirement is complied with (as the case  may be) as soon as
possible.  (B) After Completion, and until such time as any consent,
approval or  agreement referred to in sub-clause (A) is obtained, the
Business  28  28    Sellers shall be deemed to hold the benefit of the
relevant Business  Asset referred to in sub-clause (A) on trust for the
relevant Designated  Purchaser and shall pay to the Purchaser or the relevant
Designated  Purchaser promptly upon receipt any sums received by it in
relation to  such Business Asset.  (C) This Clause shall not apply to the
Business Properties.  12. CONTRACTS  (A) Subject to sub-clause (C), where
any consent, approval or agreement of  any third party is required to enable
a Designated Purchaser to perform  any Contract after Completion or to enable
any Business Seller to  transfer the benefit or burden of any Contract to a
Designated Purchaser,  then the following provisions shall apply:   (i)
this Agreement shall not constitute an assignment or an attempted  assignment
of the relevant Contract if or to the extent that such  an assignment or
attempted assignment would constitute a breach  of such Contract;   (ii)
after Completion each Business Seller and the relevant Designated  Purchaser
shall use their respective reasonable endeavours to  obtain the consent,
approval or agreement of the other party to  whatever assignment, transfer or
novation is necessary to enable  the relevant Designated Purchaser to perform
any such Contract  after Completion or, as the case may be, to transfer the
benefit  and burden of any such Contract to the relevant Designated 
Purchaser; and   (iii) after Completion, until the consent, approval or
agreement  referred to in sub-clause (A) is obtained, the relevant
Designated  Purchaser shall, unless the relevant Contract prohibits it, 
perform all the obligations of such Business Seller under such  Contract as
agent for or sub-contractor to such Business Seller  and indemnify each
member of the Sellers\' Group in respect of such  performance or, if the
relevant Contract prohibits the relevant  Designated Purchaser from so acting
as agent and sub-contractor or  the relevant Designated Purchaser cannot be
permitted to act as  agent and sub-contractor because of confidentiality
obligations,  such Business Seller shall, at the cost of the relevant
Designated  Purchaser and to the extent that such Business Seller is able,
do  all such acts and things as the relevant Designated Purchaser may 
reasonably require to enable due performance of the Contract and  to provide
for the relevant Designated Purchaser the benefits,  subject to the burdens,
of the  29  29    Contract, and the relevant Designated Purchaser shall
indemnify  each member of the Sellers\' Group in respect of all such acts
and  things. For this purpose, it shall not be reasonable to require  any
Business Seller to make any payment unless the relevant  Designated Purchaser
has first paid such Business Seller  sufficient cleared funds to make such
payment.  (B) Subject to sub-clause (C), after Completion, and until such
time as the  consent, approval or agreement referred to in sub-clause (A) is
obtained,  the relevant Business Seller shall be deemed to hold the benefit
of the  relevant Contract referred to in sub-clause (A) (except for any
Contract  relating to Intellectual Property or know-how where any third
party  consent is necessary) on trust for the relevant Designated
Purchaser.  (C) No effect shall, however, be given to sub-clauses (A) and
(B) if there is  a material risk that the relevant Contract would be treated
as repudiated  by the third party or if the Sellers or the relevant Business
Seller  would be in breach of its obligations to any third party under any
such  Contract if effect were given thereto.  (D) If any consent, approval
or agreement referred to in sub-clause (A) is  not received within 12 months
of Completion (or such longer period as the  Purchaser may specify) the
relevant Contract shall, if the Purchaser  elects by written notice to the
Sellers, be treated as having been  excluded from the sale and purchase under
this Agreement so that the  parties\' obligations in respect of that Contract
shall end immediately  after such election is made. Upon such election by the
Purchaser, the  parties shall discuss in good faith the amount, if any, which
it is fair  and reasonable that the Sellers should repay to the Purchaser as
a  consequence of such exclusion of the relevant Contract.  (E) Subject to
the other provisions of this Clause and to Clause 13, from the  Completion
Date the relevant Designated Purchaser shall carry out,  perform and complete
all the obligations and liabilities to be performed  under the Contracts,
save that the Business Sellers shall be responsible  for carrying out,
performing and completing all the obligations and  liabilities which fell due
to be performed before Completion.  13. ASSUMED LIABILITIES, PAYABLES AND
RETAINED LIABILITIES  (A) Subject to sub-clause (G), the Purchaser (on
behalf of the relevant  Designated Purchasers) hereby agrees with the Sellers
(for themselves and  as trustees for each other member of the Sellers\'
Group) that it will (or  will procure that a member of the Purchaser\'s Group
will)  30  30    duly and properly perform, assume and pay and discharge
when due, and  indemnify each member of the Sellers\' Group against, all
Assumed  Liabilities.  (B) In this Agreement "ASSUMED LIABILITIES"
means:   (i) all liabilities expressly assumed by the Purchaser pursuant to
the  other provisions of this Agreement (including, without limitation, 
pursuant to sub-clause 12(E));   (ii) all liabilities incurred from
immediately after Completion and  thereafter in respect of the Business;
and   (iii) all liabilities arising in connection with the condition of,

Completion),   PROVIDED THAT Assumed Liabilities shall not include (i)

(E) and  (F); (ii) liabilities in respect of the Business Properties or any 
Immovable Property owned, occupied or used in or for the Business at 
Completion; (iii) liabilities in relation to Environmental Matters  (whether
arising before or after Completion); and (iv) liabilities in  relation to
employment matters and pensions (which are dealt with in  Clause 17 and
Schedule 10).  (C) The Sellers (on behalf of the relevant Business Sellers)
hereby agree  with each member of the Purchaser\'s Group that they will duly
and  properly perform, assume and pay and discharge when due, and indemnify 
each member of the Purchaser\'s Group against all Payables and all 
liabilities incurred on or prior to Completion in respect of the Business 
other than (i) the Assumed Liabilities; (ii) liabilities of or in  relation
to Tax (which are governed by sub-clauses (D), (E) and (F);  (iii)
liabilities in respect of the Business Properties or any Immovable  Property
owned, occupied or used in or for the Business at Completion;  (iv)
liabilities in relation to employment matters and pensions (which  are dealt
with in Clause 17 and Schedule 10); and (v) liabilities in  relation to
Environmental Matters (whether arising before or after  Completion).  (D)
(i) The Sellers shall file (or procure to be filed) with each  relevant Tax
Authority all Tax returns in respect of or relating  to the Business, any of
the Business Assets or the use of any of  the Business Assets which are
required to be filed in  31  31    respect of any period of account for
Taxation purposes ending on  or before Completion;   (ii) the Purchaser
shall file (or procure to be filed) with each  relevant Tax Authority all Tax
returns in respect of or relating  to the Business, any of the Business
Assets or the use of any of  the Business Assets which are required to be
filed in respect of  any period of account for Taxation purposes ending
after  Completion;   (iii) in relation to any Tax return in respect of or
relating to the  Business, any of the Business Assets or the use of any of
the  Business Assets which is required to be filed in respect of any  Joint
Period, such Tax return shall be submitted to the Sellers in  draft form at
least 40 Business Days prior to the first to occur  of (a) the date such Tax
return is filed and (b) the due date for  the submission of such Tax return
to the appropriate Tax  Authority. If the Sellers object to any item in such
return, the  Sellers shall, within 10 Business Days after receipt of such 
return, notify the Purchaser in writing of their objection and the  Sellers
and the Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith to resolve  such objection.
If the Purchaser and the Sellers are unable to  reach such agreement within
five Business Days after receipt by  the Purchaser of notice of the Sellers\'
objections, the dispute  shall be referred for determination to an Expert who
shall act as  an expert and not an arbitrator and whose findings shall, in
the  absence of manifest error, be final and binding and deemed to have 
been accepted and approved by the Sellers and the Purchaser. The  fees and
costs of the Expert incurred under this Clause shall be  paid as to one-half
by the Sellers and as to one-half by the  Purchaser (unless otherwise
directed by the Expert (who shall have  the authority to make such direction
if he deems it equitable);   (iv) to the extent that any Taxes are paid by
the Purchaser (or if it  procures that the Business Assets are acquired by
another person,  that person) in respect of or relating to any of the
Business  Assets or the use of any of the Business Assets in any Joint 
Period, the Sellers (on behalf of the relevant Business Sellers)  shall pay
to the Purchaser (if it procures that the Business  Assets are acquired by
another person, on behalf of that person)  an amount equal to such proportion
of the Taxes as relates to the  portion of the Joint Period ending on
Completion or any acts,  events or occurrences occurring (or deemed to occur)
in the Joint  Period on or before Completion;  32  32    (v) to the
extent that any Taxes are paid by any Business Seller in  respect of or
relating to any of the Business Assets or the use of  any of the Business
Assets in any Joint Period (including, for the  avoidance of doubt, the
business tax imposed by Section 1447 et  seq. of the French Tax Code and the
property tax imposed by  Section 1380 et seq or 1393 et seq. of the French
Tax Code which  will be assessed for the year 2001), the Purchaser (if it

to any  person (including, without limitation, the Company) in respect of
any  obligation or liability of the Company and the Purchaser\'s assumption
of,  and the substitution of the Purchaser as the primary obligor in
respect  of, each such assurance, indemnity or guarantee, in each case on a 
non-recourse basis to the members of  36  36    the Sellers\' Group. If

the Purchaser hereby agrees with each  of the Sellers (on behalf of
themselves and each other member of the  Sellers\' Group) that it will assume
and pay and discharge when due, and  indemnify each member of the Sellers\'

clause (A)).  (C) Without prejudice to the generality of sub-clause (A) and
to the  indemnification provisions of sub-clause (B) (which, save as

EMPLOYEES  (A) Subject to Clause 17(K) and to Schedule 11, if the contract
of employment  of any Business Employee terminates or is found or alleged not
to have  effect after Completion as if originally made with the Purchaser
or  another member of the Purchaser\'s Group as a consequence of the sale
and  purchase of the Business Assets and other matters contemplated under
this  Agreement other than by virtue of mandatory provisions of applicable 
legislation relating to the transfer of undertakings, the Purchaser (on 
behalf of the relevant member of the Purchaser\'s Group) agrees that:   (i)
in consultation with the Sellers, it will, within five Business  Days of
being so requested (as long as the request is made no  later than 10 Business
Days after the Sellers become aware of  such finding or allegation), make to
that Business Employee an  offer in writing to employ him under a new
contract of employment  subject to, and to take effect upon, the termination
referred to  below; and   (ii) the offer to be made will be on such terms
and conditions as are  consistent with the Purchaser\'s undertakings in sub-
clauses (F)  and (G).   Upon that offer being made (or at any time after
the expiry of the five  (5) Business Days if the offer is not made as
requested), the relevant  member of the Sellers\' Group shall, where legally
possible, terminate  the employment of the Business Employee concerned (save
where already  terminated). The Purchaser (on behalf of the relevant
Designated  Purchaser) shall indemnify each member of the Sellers\' Group on
an after  Tax basis against all liabilities arising from the employment of
that  Business Employee after Completion until such termination (up to a 
maximum period of 6 months) where the services of the employee concerned  are
performed for a member of the Purchaser\'s Group during such period.  The
Sellers shall (on behalf of the relevant member of the Sellers\'  Group)
indemnify each member of the Purchaser\'s Group against all  liabilities
arising from the termination of the employment of that  Business
Employee.  (B) Subject to Clause 17(K), if the contract of employment of any
person who  is immediately prior to Completion employed by a member of the 
38  38    Sellers\' Group (other than a Business Employee, any employee
who becomes  employed by the Purchaser or another member of the Purchaser\'s
Group as a  result of a Co-Packing Agreement or any employee who consents to
become  employed by the Purchaser or another member of the Purchaser\'s Group
in  accordance with Clause 17(P)) is found or alleged to have effect after 
Completion as if originally made with the Purchaser or another member of  the
Purchaser\'s Group as a consequence of the sale and purchase of the  Business
Assets and other matters contemplated under this Agreement, the  Sellers (on
behalf of the relevant member of the Sellers\' Group) agree  that:   (i) in
consultation with the Purchaser, they will, within five  Business Days of
being so requested (as long as the request is  made no later than 10 Business
Days after the Purchaser (or such  member of the Purchaser\'s Group) becomes
aware of such finding or  allegation and, in any event, within the period of
six months  after Completion), procure that a member of the Sellers\' Group 
makes to that employee an offer in writing to employ him under a  new
contract of employment subject to, and to take effect upon,  the termination
referred to below; and   (ii) the offer to be made will be on the same terms
and conditions as  were provided to that employee immediately before
Completion.   Upon that offer being made (or at any time after the expiry of
the five  Business Days if the offer is not made as requested), the
relevant  member of the Purchaser\'s Group shall, where legally possible,
terminate  the employment of the employee concerned. The Purchaser (on behalf
of  the relevant Designated Purchaser) shall indemnify each member of the 
Sellers\' Group on an after Tax basis against all liabilities arising  from
the employment of that employee after Completion until such  termination (up
to a maximum period of 6 months) where the services of  the employee
concerned are performed for a member of the Purchaser\'s  Group during such
period. The Sellers (on behalf of the relevant member  of the Sellers\'
Group) shall indemnify each member of the Purchaser\'s  Group against all
liabilities arising from the employment of that  employee after Completion
until such termination (up to a maximum period  of six months) where the
services of the employee concerned are not  performed for a member of the
Purchaser\'s Group during such period and,  whether or not the services of
the employee concerned are available to a  member of the Purchaser\'s Group
during such period, against all  liabilities arising from the termination of
employment of that employee.  39  39   (C) The Purchaser has provided or
will provide (as the case may be) the  Sellers with all the information
reasonably required to enable them to  comply with any obligations to inform,
consult or notify any person about  the matters contemplated by this
Agreement in so far as it relates to any  Employee to the extent required by
local law and within the relevant time  limits imposed by local law. Where
applicable, the Sellers shall use  their reasonable endeavours to request
relevant information from the  Purchaser.  (D) The Purchaser (on behalf of
the relevant Designated Purchaser) agrees  with the Sellers and each other
member of the Sellers\' Group that it will  indemnify the Sellers and each
other member of the Sellers\' Group on an  after Tax basis against any claim
relating to the terms and conditions of  employment or benefits offered to or
provided to the Business Employees  or Company Employees in connection with
their employment after Completion  (including, without limitation, claims
relating to the terms and  conditions of such employment or benefits and
termination of such  employment or benefits but excluding any matter for
which the Purchaser  is liable under paragraph 10 of Part 1 of Schedule 10)
and against any  breach by the Purchaser of this Clause or Schedule 11. The
Sellers shall  procure that each member of the Sellers\' Group and the
Company shall  discharge all its obligations in respect of the Employees
(including, but  not limited to, wages and salaries, overtime, bonus or
commission (earned  but unpaid), accrued holiday pay, income tax, social
security  contributions, retirement benefit contributions and insurance
premiums)  in respect of the period up to close of business on the Completion
Date.  The Sellers agree with the Purchaser for itself and on behalf of the 
relevant Designated Purchasers and/or the Company that it will indemnify  the
Purchaser, any Designated Purchaser or the Company on an after Tax  basis
against any claim arising out of or relating to the relevant member  of the
Sellers\' Group or the Company\'s failure to discharge such 
obligations.  (E) The provisions of sub-clauses (F) and (G) and Schedule
11:   (i) are to apply to the Employees only for so long as the Employees 
continue in the employment of any member of the Purchaser\'s Group  or any
person to whom the whole or any part of the Business or  Purchaser\'s Group
is transferred; and   (ii) are to apply to any Potential Employee who
becomes employed by a  member of the Purchaser\'s Group on or after
Completion as if that  Potential Employee were an Employee.  (F) (i) If the
employment of any Employee is terminated within three years  of the
Completion Date the Purchaser shall procure that  40  40    there shall
be applied in respect of such Employee policies and  benefits (whether
contractual or otherwise and giving due credit  to the Employees for any
additional service or earnings from the  Completion Date onwards) in such a
manner as to be no less  favourable than those applicable in respect of the
particular  Employee at the date of this Agreement provided that details of 
such policies and benefits are set out in the Disclosure Letter or  the Data
Room.   (ii) The Purchaser shall procure that, in respect of benefits which
are  provided on the death or disability of an Employee or his spouse, 
child or dependant within the period of three years following the  Completion
Date (other than such benefits which are Benefits  provided under a Sellers\'
Group Plan), equivalent benefits must be  provided on such events which are
payable in circumstances and  under conditions which are not materially less
favourable to the  beneficiary concerned as those which would have applied
had the  death or disability occurred whilst the beneficiary was a 
beneficiary of the arrangement in question under the provisions of  that
arrangement in force immediately prior to the Completion Date  provided that
details of such policies and benefits are set out in  the Disclosure Letter
or the Data Room.  (G) Without prejudice to sub-clause (F), the Purchaser
shall procure that for  a period of three years following the Completion Date
Employees who are  employed shall be employed on terms and conditions
(whether contractual  or otherwise and including, without limitation, any
related to length of  service but specifically excluding any Benefits under a
Sellers\' Group  Plan and excluding any share schemes or share option
schemes) which are  no less favourable taken as a whole in respect of each
Employee than  those which apply in respect of each Employee at Completion
provided that  details of such policies and benefits are set out in the
Disclosure  Letter or the Data Room. This undertaking does not constitute a
guarantee  that the Employees will continue to be employed following
Completion. In  relation to share schemes and share option schemes, the
Purchaser shall  procure that for a period of three years from Completion the
Employees  who are employed shall be employed on terms and conditions
(including the  rules of any applicable scheme and any qualifying conditions)
related to  share schemes and share option schemes which are no less
favourable in  respect of each Employee than those applicable to other
employees of  equivalent seniority of companies in the Purchaser\'s Group
from time to  time, subject always to the rules of the applicable scheme and
any  qualifying conditions.  41  41   (H) The Purchaser\'s agreement to
the provisions of sub-clauses (F) and (G) is  given by the Purchaser on the
express understanding that, if the  Purchaser is in breach of any such
provisions, the Sellers may, at their  absolute discretion, and without
limitation, seek to procure compliance  with such provisions by the Purchaser
by applying to the court for  damages and/or specific performance.  (I)
Without prejudice to the parties\' obligations under sub-clauses (A) to  (G),
each of the parties shall comply with the requirements relating to  that
party set out in Schedule 11.  (J) For the avoidance of doubt, the
provisions of this Clause 17 are without  prejudice to:   (i) the operation
of any rule of law in relation to, or contractual  term of, the terms and
conditions of employment of the Employees;  and   (ii) any provision of
Schedule 10.  (K) If any Business Employee or Company Employee requires a
work permit or  employment pass or other approval (in this Clause "PERMITS")
for his  employment to continue after Completion, the Purchaser undertakes
to  procure that any necessary applications are promptly made and to use
its  best efforts to secure the necessary Permits and the provisions of
Clause  33 shall apply in relation to the continued employment of Employees
and  (if they are Business Employees or otherwise as necessary) their
transfer  to another employer after Completion.  (L) The Sellers shall
procure that the relevant member of the Sellers\' Group  shall use its
reasonable endeavours to procure that each Seconded  Employee continues to be
employed by a member of the Sellers\' Group and  shall, for the period of 6
months following Completion, which period, in  the case of A. Moreira only,
may be extended by up to a further 6 months  with the agreement of the
employee concerned and the relevant member of  the Purchaser\'s Group, be
seconded to work in the European Culinary  Brands Business, in the case of
J.M. Van Lint only, for 50% of each  working week. The following additional
provisions shall apply with  respect to the Seconded Employees:   (i) Each
Seconded Employee shall be paid, and employment benefits  shall be provided
to such Seconded Employee, by a member of the  Sellers\' Group and the
Purchaser (on behalf of the relevant  Designated Purchaser) shall pay to the
Sellers (on behalf of the  relevant member of the Sellers\' Group) (in
advance) at the  42  42    start of each calendar month the direct and
indirect cost of  salary and other employment benefits for that Seconded
Employee  for such calendar month including relevant taxes, social security 
costs and any notional or unfunded costs or accruals in relation  to post-
Completion service (for example in relation to Benefits)  on such basis as
the Sellers may reasonably determine and agree  with the Purchaser. To the
extent such agreement is not reached,  paragraph 9 of Part 1 of Schedule 10
shall apply.   (ii) The relevant member of the Sellers\' Group may from time
to time  increase the salary benefits of such Seconded Employee PROVIDED 
THAT any such increases are in line with increases for similar  employees of
the Sellers\' Group.   (iii) The Purchaser shall procure that the working
environment of each  Seconded Employee and the work carried out by each
Seconded  Employee is similar to his working environment and work before 
Completion.   (iv) The Purchaser (on behalf of the relevant member of the
Purchaser\'s  Group) shall indemnify the Sellers (on behalf of the relevant 
member of the Sellers\' Group) against any claim by, or relating  to, a
Seconded Employee except to the extent that such claim  arises as a result of
acts or omissions of the Sellers.   The provisions of Clause 25(A) shall be
deemed to apply to each of J.M.  Van Lint and A. Moreira as if each such
person were a Senior Sellers\'  Group Employee but the Purchaser shall not be
precluded from offering  employment to S.R.H. Duin with effect from the end
of the period of 6  months after Completion.  (M) Except where Clause 17(Q)
applies, the Purchaser shall procure that, upon  and from the termination of
any Co-packing Agreement (whether absolutely  or in respect of one or more
Products (as defined therein) to which that  Co-packing Agreement relates)
under which any of the Co-packers (as  defined therein) is a member of the
Purchaser\'s Group (other than any  member of the Purchaser\'s Group
operating the assets referred to in  paragraph 1 of Attachment 10), the
relevant Co-packer (as defined  therein) shall, where such termination has
the effect of transferring the  employment of any employee of that Co-packer
(or its holding company,  subsidiary or subsidiary of its holding company) to
any member of the  Sellers\' Group (the "SELLER RECIPIENT"), indemnify the
Seller Recipient  against any liability which results from the termination by
the Seller  Recipient of the employment of any such  43  43    employee
on or immediately after such transfer takes place or the Seller  Recipient
becoming aware that such transfer has taken place.  (N) The Sellers shall
procure that, upon and from the termination of any  Co-packing Agreement
(whether absolutely or in respect of one or more  Products (as defined
therein) to which that Co-packing Agreement relates)  under which any of the
Co-packers (as defined therein) is a member of the  Sellers\' Group, the
relevant Co-packer (as defined therein) shall, where  such termination has
the effect of transferring the employment of any  employee of that Co-packer
(or its holding company, subsidiary or  subsidiary of its holding company) to
any member of the Purchaser\'s Group  (the "PURCHASER RECIPIENT"), indemnify
the Purchaser Recipient against  any liability which results from the
termination by the Purchaser  Recipient of the employment of any such
employee on or immediately after  such transfer takes place or the Purchaser
Recipient becoming aware that  such transfer has taken place.  (O) The
Sellers shall indemnify the Purchaser for itself and on behalf of the 
relevant Designated Purchaser and/or the relevant Company against any 
liabilities incurred by any member of the Purchaser\'s Group arising out  of
or relating to any act or omission by any member of the Seller\'s Group  or
any Company prior to the Completion Date in respect of any of its 
obligations or duties to or in relation to the employment of any of the 
Employees or any former employees of any members of the Sellers\' Group or 
the Company, prior to Completion, provided that this Clause 17(O) shall  not
apply in relation to any liabilities in respect of the provision of 
Benefits.  (P) (i) Promptly after the date of this Agreement, the Sellers
shall  procure that meetings shall be arranged between representatives of 
the Purchaser\'s Group and the Potential UK Employees, the  Potential Nordic
Employees and the Potential German Employees.  Meetings in relation to the
Potential UK Employees and the  Potential German Employees shall be on a one
to one basis.  Meetings in relation to the Potential Nordic Employees shall
be on  a group basis provided that thereafter meetings with any Potential 
Nordic Employee who has expressed an interest in becoming employed  by a
member of the Purchaser\'s Group shall be on an individual  basis provided
further that individual meetings may not be held  with more Potential Nordic
Employees than the total number of  unfilled vacancies for Potential Nordic
Employees under paragraph  (iii) below from time to time.   (ii) The
Sellers shall procure that such information as in its  possession and control
in relation to the Potential Employees as  may be reasonably requested by the
Purchaser shall, subject  44  44    to the consent of any such Potential
Employee, be made available  to the Purchaser.   (iii) Notwithstanding the
provisions of Clause 25(A) (to the extent  applicable), in the period prior
to the Completion Date, the  Purchaser is permitted to make offers of
employment effective from  the Completion Date to:   (a) up to 15 Potential
UK Employees;   (b) any or all of the Potential German Employees;   (c) up
to 5 Potential Nordic Employees who work in the category  Sweden - out of

respect of the same category of Potential Employee. The  Sellers shall
procure that any Potential Employee who accepts an  offer of employment in
accordance with this (iii) shall be  released from employment by the
Seller\'s Group with effect from  Completion or such earlier date as may be
agreed by the Sellers  and the Purchaser.   (iv) The provisions of Clause
25(A) shall be deemed to apply to any  Potential Employee other than any who
is made an offer of  employment made under (iii) above as if any such person
were a  Senior Sellers\' Group Employee.   (v) If, at any time before the
expiry of the period of 3 months after  Completion, any of the 38 UK
Employees set out in the Employee  List as "100% Dedicated - Crawley" ceases
to be employed by the  Sellers\' Group (prior to Completion) or the
Purchaser\'s Group (on  or after Completion) (a "CEASING UK EMPLOYEE"), the
provisions of  (iii) above shall apply in respect of such number, up to a

comprised in the Business IPR; Raguletto Marks (but in respect of each 
Raguletto Mark, only after the relevant Raguletto Sale Date); and any  trade
Mark which is or is likely to be confusingly similar to any such  trade mark,
(including applying to register an internet domain name  containing such a
trade mark in such territory) or challenge any trade  mark registration for,
or oppose any application for registration made by  any member of the
Purchaser\'s Group in relation to such a trade mark (or  procure, authorise,
enable or assist any third party to do so).  (C) Each Seller undertakes that
it shall, and shall procure that each member  of the Sellers\' Group shall,
for the period until each Raguletto Mark is  assigned to the Purchaser or the
relevant Designated Purchaser (as the  case may be) pursuant to Clause
3(B):   (i) use that Raguletto Mark only on or in connection with the
products  on or in connection with which that Raguletto Mark is used at 
Completion; and   (ii) maintain standards of quality for all goods on which
such  Raguletto Mark is used, which standards shall be no less than the 
standards of quality that have been maintained by the relevant  member of the
Sellers\' Group in connection with its use of that  Raguletto Mark on those
goods prior to Completion.  59  59    25. RESTRICTIONS ON
PURCHASER  (A) The Purchaser undertakes to each of the Sellers that it shall
not, and  shall procure that each member of the Purchaser\'s Group shall not
(for so  long as it remains such a member), within two years of the
Completion  Date solicit or endeavour to entice away from the employment of
any  member of the Sellers\' Group any Senior Sellers\' Group Employee
other  than:   (i) any Senior Sellers\' Group Employee whose employment
with the  relevant member of the Sellers\' Group has then ceased or who has 
given (or received) notice terminating such employment;   (ii) any Senior
Sellers\' Group Employee who responds to any public  recruitment
advertisement placed by or on behalf of any member of  the Purchaser\'s
Group; and   (iii) in accordance with Clause 17(P).   and shall not
intentionally assist any person to do any of the foregoing  things.  (B)
The Purchaser undertakes to each of the Sellers that it shall not, and  shall
procure that each other member of the Purchaser\'s Group shall not  (for so
long as it remains such a member) within six months after the  Completion
Date develop, manufacture, market or distribute any Restricted  Products,
provided that such restriction on the Purchaser\'s Group shall  not apply to
the extent that the Purchaser can adduce reasonable evidence  that the
technology or know-how incorporated in the relevant Restricted  Product
was:   (i) at Completion already in the public domain or comes into the 
public domain through no fault of any member of the Purchaser\'s  Group or
its agents;   (ii) independently discovered or invented prior to Completion
by a  member of the Purchaser\'s Group; or   (iii) lawfully received by any
member of the Purchaser\'s Group from some  source other than directly or
indirectly from a member of the  Seller\'s Group, and so far as the Purchaser
is aware such source  did not owe a duty of confidentiality to a member of
the Sellers\'  Group in respect thereof that would prohibit disclosure to
that  member of the Purchaser\'s Group.  60  60    26. PROVISION
RELATING TO RESTRICTIONS   Each undertaking contained in Clauses 24 and 25
shall be construed as a  separate undertaking and if one or more of the
undertakings is held to  be against the public interest or unlawful or in any
way an unreasonable  restraint of trade, the remaining undertakings shall
continue to bind  the Sellers and/or the Purchaser as the case may be.  
27. BOOKS AND RECORDS  (A) The Business Sellers shall on Completion transfer
ownership of and  deliver to the Purchaser originals of all the Books and
Records relating  exclusively to the Business or the Business Assets

permitted to retain in accordance with Clause 16 and Schedule 12;   (ii) all
Books and Records of the Business Sellers which contain  legally privileged
information which is confidential to the  Sellers which shall be retained by
the Sellers; and   (iii) any Books and Records (other than Books and Records
relating  exclusively to the Company) relating to Taxation.  (B) For a
period of eight years from Completion (or such longer period as may  be
required by local law) the Purchaser shall maintain and make available  the
Books and Records (other than Books and Records relating exclusively  to the
European Culinary Brands Business) which are delivered to the  Purchaser
under this Agreement for inspection and copying by  representatives of any
Business Seller and its professional advisers  during Working Hours on
reasonable advance notice and such undertaking as  to confidentiality as the
Purchaser may reasonably require being given,  save that such period shall be
15 years (or such longer period as may be  required by local law) in relation
to Books and Records which contain any  information relating to the
occupational health of any Employees.  (C) Subject to any provision
contained in Schedule 12, for a period of eight  years from Completion (or
such longer period as may be required by local  law), the Sellers shall
maintain and make available to the Purchaser any  Books and Records (i)
relating (but not exclusively relating) to the  European Culinary Brands
Business, (ii) any Books and Records of the type  described in Clause
27(A)(i) or (ii) and (iii) any materials containing  Shared Know-how licensed
pursuant to  61  61    Clause 20(D), if practicable, the relevant parts
thereof) which contain  information which is required by the Purchaser for
the purpose of the  Business or any Tax or other return in connection with
the Business for  inspection and copying by representatives of the Purchaser
during Working  Hours on reasonable advance notice and such undertaking as
to  confidentiality as either Seller may reasonably require being
given.  (D) (i) The Sellers shall procure that each Business Seller shall,
where  reasonably requested to do so by the Purchaser and subject to the 
reimbursement by the Purchaser of the Business Seller\'s reasonable  out-of-
pocket expenses, assist the Purchaser with the preparation  of data
reasonably required for compliance with any reporting  requirements of any
stock exchange or securities or other  regulatory authority under any
applicable law, rule or regulation  and shall provide such reasonable
assistance as soon as reasonably  practicable and, in any event, within 30
Business Days of the  relevant request.   (ii) The Purchaser shall and
shall procure that any relevant member of  the Purchaser\'s Group shall,
where reasonably requested by the  Sellers or any Business Seller and subject
to the reimbursement by  the Sellers of the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
of the  Purchaser or relevant member of the Purchaser\'s Group, assist the 
Sellers or, where relevant, Business Sellers with the preparation  of any
data reasonably required for the preparation of any  information request from
any Tax Authority regarding the Taxation  affairs of any of the Sellers
and/or any of the Business Sellers  in respect of the European Culinary
Brands Business.   (iii) The Sellers shall and shall procure that any
relevant member of  the Sellers\' Group shall, where reasonably requested by
the  Purchaser or any Designated Purchaser and subject to the  reimbursement
by the Purchaser of the reasonable out-of-pocket  expenses of the Sellers or
the relevant member of the Sellers\'  Group, assist the Purchaser or, where
relevant, the Designated  Purchasers with the preparation of any data
reasonably required  for the preparation of any information request from any
Tax  Authority regarding the Taxation affairs of the Purchaser and/or  any
of the Designated Purchasers in respect of the European  Culinary Brands
Business.   28. PAYMENTS  (A) Except to the extent otherwise set out in
this Agreement, any payment to  be made by any party (whether paid on its own
behalf or on behalf  62  62    of the Share Seller or, as the case may
be, a Business Seller or, as the  case may be, a Designated Purchaser) under
this Agreement shall be made  in full without any set-off, restriction or
condition (whether for or on  account of any counterclaim or otherwise) and
without, and free and clear  of, any deduction or withholding whatsoever
(save only as required by  law). If any deductions or withholdings are
required by law to be made  from any sums payable under this Agreement
(except for payments of  interest), the party who is obliged (whether on its
own behalf or on  behalf of the Share Seller or, as the case may be, a
Business Seller or,  as the case may be, a Designated Purchaser) to make the
payment shall  also be obliged to pay to the party to whom payment is to be
made  (whether to be received on its own behalf or on behalf of the Share 
Seller or, as the case may be, a Business Seller or, as the case may be,  a
Designated Purchaser) such sum as will, after such deduction or  withholding
has been made, leave the party to whom payment is to be made  and, where
received or to be received by that party on behalf of the  Share Seller or,
as the case may be, a Business Seller or, as the case  may be, a Designated
Purchaser, leave the Share Seller or, as the case  may be, Business Seller
or, as the case may be, Designated Purchaser with  the same amount as it
would have been entitled to receive in the absence  of any such requirement
to make such deduction or withholding.  (B) If any Tax Authority brings into
charge to Tax (or into any computation  of income, profit or gain for the
purposes of any charge to Tax) any sum  payable by any party (whether on its
own behalf or on behalf of the Share  Seller or, as the case may be, a
Business Seller or, as the case may be,  a Designated Purchaser) under this
Agreement (excluding the consideration  payable pursuant to Clause 5 and any
adjustment to such consideration  pursuant to Clauses 4 and 7 and paragraphs
3 of Part 1 or Part 2 of  Schedule 10 and except for payments of interest)
then such party shall  pay (whether on its own behalf or on behalf of the
Share Seller or, as  the case may be, a Business Seller or, as the case may
be, a Designated  Purchaser) such additional amount to the party to whom the
payment is  made (whether on its own behalf or on behalf of the Share Seller
or, as  the case may be, a Business Seller or, as the case may be, a
Designated  Purchaser) as shall be required to ensure that such party to whom
payment  is made and the Share Seller or, as the case may be, Business Seller
or,  as the case may be, Designated Purchaser is placed in the same after
Tax  position (taking into account any Tax credit or other Tax benefit 
received or receivable by such party or the Share Seller or, as the case  may
be, Business Seller or, as the case may be, Designated Purchaser in  relation
to the sum payable or the event giving rise to the sum payable)  as if the
matter giving rise to the payment had not arisen.  63  63   (C) If any
amount payable under this Agreement is payable to a payee who is  not an
original party to this Agreement or, where received by the payee  on behalf
of the Share Seller or, as the case may be, a Business Seller  or, as the
case may be, a Designated Purchaser, the Share Seller is not  the original
Share Seller or, as the case may be, the Business Seller is  not the original
Business Seller or, as the case may be, the Designated  Purchaser is not the
original Designated Purchaser, the payer shall not  be required by this
Clause 28 (or any other provision of this Agreement  including, without
prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, Clause  32) to pay any greater
amount than it would have been required to pay had  the sum been payable to
the original party to this Agreement or, as the  case may be, the original
Share Seller or, as the case may be, the  original Business Seller or, as the
case may be, the original Designated  Purchaser.  (D) This sub-clause
applies if one party (the "PAYER") makes a payment under  Clause 28(A) above
(a "TAX PAYMENT") in favour of a person entitled to a  payment under this
Agreement (the "RECIPIENT"). In this case, each of the  following
applies:   (i) The Recipient agrees to notify the Payer if the Recipient
obtains  a refund of Tax or obtains and uses a credit against Tax on its 
overall net income (a "TAX CREDIT") which the Recipient is able to  identify
as attributable to that Tax Payment or the deduction or  withholding to which
it relates.   (ii) The Recipient agrees to reimburse to the Payer the
amount  determined by the Recipient to be the proportion of the refund of 
Tax or Tax Credit that, if it is paid back to the Payer, will  leave the
Recipient (after that reimbursement) in no better or  worse position in
respect of its Tax liabilities than it would  have been in if no Tax Payment
had been required. There will only  be an obligation under this paragraph to
the extent the Recipient  can make the reimbursement without there being, in
the opinion of  the Recipient, any adverse consequences to the Recipient
(other  than the reimbursement itself).   (iii) The Recipient is under no
obligation by virtue of this sub-clause  to disclose any information
regarding its Tax affairs and  computations. This sub-clause does not affect
the right of the  Recipient to arrange its Tax affairs as it thinks fit.  
29. EFFECT OF COMPLETION   Save as otherwise provided herein, any provision
of this Agreement or of  any other document referred to herein which is
capable of being  64  64    performed after but which has not been
performed at or before Completion  and all Warranties contained in or entered
into pursuant to this  Agreement shall (subject to Schedule 4) remain in full
force and effect  notwithstanding Completion.  30. JOINT AND SEVERAL
LIABILITY AND CAPACITY OF THE SELLERS AND THE PURCHASER  (A) The obligations
of the Sellers under this Agreement are joint and  several.  (B) If any
liability of one of the Sellers is, or becomes, illegal, invalid  or
unenforceable in any respect, that shall not affect or impair the 
liabilities of the other of the Sellers under this Agreement.  (C) Save as
expressly provided in this Agreement, any obligation of the  Sellers under
this Agreement to take any action shall be satisfied by any  member of the
Sellers\' Group taking such action. Any right of the Sellers  under this
Agreement may be exercised by either of them.  (D) The undertakings given by
the Purchaser to, and agreements made by the  Purchaser with, the Sellers in
this Agreement are given and made to and  with the Sellers for themselves and
as trustees for the Share Seller or  the relevant Business Seller.  (E) The
undertakings given by the Sellers to, and agreements made by the  Sellers
with, the Purchaser in this Agreement are given and made to and  with the
Purchaser for itself and as trustee for the relevant Designated 
Purchaser.  31. REMEDIES, WAIVERS AND INDEMNIFICATION  (A) No delay or
omission on the part of any party to this Agreement in  exercising any right,
power or remedy provided by law or under this  Agreement or any other
documents referred to in it shall impair such  right, power or remedy or
operate as a waiver thereof or preclude its  exercise at any subsequent
time.  (B) The single or partial exercise of any right, power or remedy
provided  under this Agreement or any document referred to in it shall not
preclude  any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right,  power or remedy.  (C) The rights and remedies of each party under
or pursuant to this Agreement  are cumulative, may be exercised as often as
such party  65  65    considers appropriate and are in addition to its
rights and remedies  under general law.  (D) Upon any person (the
"INDEMNIFIED PERSON") becoming aware of any  assessment, claim, action or
demand of a third party (a "THIRD PARTY  CLAIM") against it which gives rise
to any claim for indemnification  under this Agreement (other than the Tax
Covenant), the Indemnified  Person shall:   (i) as soon as practicable
notify the person from whom indemnification  is sought (the "INDEMNIFYING
PARTY") by written notice as soon as  it appears to the Indemnified Person
that any Third Party Claim  received by or coming to the notice of the
Indemnified Person may  result in a claim for indemnification;   (ii)
subject to the Indemnifying Party indemnifying the Indemnified  Person
against any liability, cost, damage or expense which may be  incurred
thereby, take such action and give such information and  access to personnel,
premises, chattels, documents and records to  the Indemnifying Party and
their professional advisers as the  Indemnifying Party may reasonably request
and the Indemnifying  Party shall be entitled to require any relevant company
(being a  member of the Purchaser\'s Group where the Indemnified Person is
a  member of the Purchasers\' Group or a member of the Sellers\' Group 
where the Indemnified Person is a member of the Sellers\' Group) to  take
such action as is, in the reasonable opinion of the  Indemnified Person and
subject to the Indemnifying Party agreeing  to be bound by an obligation of
confidentiality, give such  reasonable information and assistance in order to
avoid, dispute,  resist, mitigate, settle, compromise, defend or appeal any
claim  in respect thereof or adjudication with respect thereto;   (iii)
Subject to the Indemnifying Party indemnifying the Indemnified  Person
against any liability, cost, damage or expense which may be  incurred
thereby, at the request of the Indemnifying Party, allow  the Indemnifying
Party to take the sole conduct of such actions as  the Indemnifying Party may
reasonably deem appropriate in  connection with any such assessment or claim
in the name of the  Indemnified Person or any such relevant company referred
to above  and in that connection the Indemnified Person shall give or cause 
to be given to the Indemnifying Party all such assistance as it  may
reasonably require in avoiding, disputing, resisting,  settling,
compromising, defending or appealing any such claim and  shall instruct such
legal or other professional advisors as the  Indemnifying Party may nominate
to act on behalf of the  Indemnified Person or any relevant  66  66   
company, as appropriate, but to act in accordance with the  Indemnifying
Party\'s instructions PROVIDED THAT the Indemnified  Person shall not be
required to commence any legal proceedings  where either:   (a) the
Indemnified Person has validly assigned all of  its rights in relation to the
relevant claim to the  Indemnifying Party in a manner which entitles the 
Indemnifying Party to the same benefits in respect  of such rights as the
Indemnified Person had; or   (b) where sub-paragraph (C)(iii)(a) does not
apply, the  Indemnifying Party has not notified the relevant  party against
whom such proceedings are brought  that such proceedings are being brought at
the  instruction of the Indemnifying Party;   (iv) be entitled to
participate in the defence of any Third Party  Claim and to employ separate
counsel to represent it at its own  expense PROVIDED THAT the Indemnifying
Party shall control the  defence of the Third Party Claim;   (v) make no
admission of liability, agreement, settlement or  compromise with any third
party in relation to any such claim or  adjudication without the prior
written consent of the  Indemnifying Party (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld  or delayed); and   (vi) take all reasonable action
to mitigate any loss suffered by it in  respect of which a claim could be
made for indemnification.  (E) The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled at
any stage and in its absolute  discretion to settle any such Third Party
Claim after giving reasonable  advance written notice to the Indemnified
Person.  (F) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not
be  entitled to assume the defence of any Third Party Claim (and shall be 
liable for the reasonable costs and expenses (including legal expenses) 
incurred by the Indemnified Person in defending such Third Party Claim)  if
the Third Party Claim seeks any relief other than damages (including  any
orders, injunctions or other equitable relief) against the  Indemnified
Person which the Indemnified Person reasonably determines  cannot be
separated from any related claim for damages. If such claim for  other relief
can be separated from the claim for damages, the  Indemnifying Party shall be
entitled to assume the defence of the claim  for damages.  67  67   (G)
If any Indemnified Person has a claim for indemnification against any 
Indemnifying Party under this Agreement (other than the Tax Covenant)  which
does not involve a Third Party Claim being brought or alleged  against such
Indemnified Person, the Indemnified Person may give notice  of such claim to
the Indemnifying Party. The failure by any Indemnified  Person so to notify
the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the  Indemnifying Party from any
liability which it may have to such  Indemnified Person. If the Indemnifying
Party does not notify the  Indemnified Person within 30 Business Days
following its receipt of such  notice that the Indemnifying Party disputes
its liability to the  Indemnified Person under this Agreement (other than the
Tax Covenant)  such claim specified by the Indemnified Person in such notice
shall be  conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party under
this  Agreement (other than the Tax Covenant) and the Indemnifying Party
shall  pay the amount of such liability to the Indemnified Person on demand
or,  in the case of any notice in which the amount of the claim (or any 
portion thereof) is estimated, on such later date when the amount of such 
claim (or such portion thereof) becomes finally determined. If the 
Indemnifying Party has disputed its liability with respect to such claim 
within the time period specified in this sub-clause, the Indemnifying  Party
and the Indemnified Person shall proceed in good faith to negotiate  a
resolution of such dispute.  32. NO ASSIGNMENT  (A) The rights of the
Purchaser or any Designated Purchaser under this  Agreement (including the
Warranties) and the Purchaser\'s Completion  Documents may be assigned or
transferred to another member or members of  the Purchaser\'s Group PROVIDED
THAT the Purchaser shall procure that no  such member or members of the
Purchaser\'s Group shall cease to be a  member of the Purchaser\'s Group
unless such rights have been assigned  back to the Purchaser or another
member of the Purchaser\'s Group.  (B) Subject to sub-clause (A), the rights
and obligations of the parties  under this Agreement shall not be
assignable.  33. FURTHER ASSURANCE  (A) In addition to the obligations set
out in Clause 9(E), without prejudice  to any restriction or limitation on
the extent of any party\'s obligations  under this Agreement and except in
relation to Business IPR, each of the  parties shall from time to time, so
far as each is reasonably able, do or  procure the doing of all such acts
and/or execute or procure the  execution of all such documents in a form
reasonably satisfactory to the  party concerned as they may  68  68   
reasonably consider necessary to transfer the Business Assets and/or the 
Shares to the Purchaser or otherwise to give any party the full benefit  of
this Agreement.  (B) The Sellers undertake that after Completion and at the
request of the  Purchaser they will execute or procure the execution of all
such  documents as may reasonably be necessary to give effect to this
Agreement  with regard to the matters relating to the Business IPR (including
by  processing the execution of any document referred to in Clause
33(B)(iii)  provided however that the Purchaser undertakes with the Sellers
that it  will be responsible for preparing all such documents and PROVIDED
THAT  the responsibility for the costs and expenses incurred by the parties
in  connection therewith shall be shared between the parties as follows:  
(i) subject to sub-clause (iii), the Purchaser shall be responsible  for all
external costs reasonably and properly incurred by the  Sellers;   (ii)
subject to sub-clause (iii), the Purchaser shall be responsible  for all
other costs and expenses in respect of such vesting  including (but not
limited to) the costs of effecting and  recording the Intellectual Property
Assignments at the relevant  patent and trade mark offices; and   (iii) the
Sellers shall be responsible for all costs incurred by the  Sellers and all
external costs reasonably and properly incurred by  any member of the
Purchaser\'s Group in connection with the  preparation and execution of any
documents required by the  relevant patent or trade mark offices as a result
of the legal  owner of the relevant Intellectual Property at Completion being
a  different person to the beneficial owner of that Intellectual 
Property.  (C) The Sellers undertake that, within 40 days of Completion,
they will  procure the delivery to the Purchaser (on behalf of the relevant 
Designated Purchaser) of a clean tax certificate in relation to the  Belgian
Business Assets in accordance with article 442 bis of the Belgian  Income Tax
Code.  34. ENTIRE AGREEMENT  (A) This Agreement, the Disclosure Letter,
the Tax Covenant and any other  documents entered into pursuant to this
Agreement (the "TRANSACTION  DOCUMENTS") constitute the whole and only
agreement between the parties  relating to the sale and purchase of the
Business Assets and the Shares  and, except to the extent expressly repeated
in any of the  69  69    Transaction Documents, any prior drafts,
agreements, undertakings,  representations, warranties and arrangements of
any nature whatsoever,  whether or not in writing, relating thereto are

with the Sellers (on behalf of  themselves and each other member of the
Sellers\' Group) that:   (i) it does not rely on and has not been induced to
enter into any of  the Transaction Documents on the basis of any Assurance
(express  or implied) made or given by or on behalf of any member of the 
Sellers\' Group or any of their respective directors, officers,  employees or
advisers other than those expressly set out in the  Transaction Documents or,
to the extent that it has been, it has  (in the absence of fraud) no rights
or remedies in relation  thereto and shall make no claim in relation thereto
or against  such parties;   (ii) no member of the Sellers\' Group, or any
of their respective  directors, officers, employees or advisers, has given or
made any  Assurance other than those expressly set out in the Transaction 
Documents or, to the extent that they have, the Purchaser hereby  (for itself
and on behalf of each other member of the Purchaser\'s  Group)
unconditionally and irrevocably waives (in the absence of  fraud) any claim
which it might otherwise have had in relation  thereto; and   (iii) any
warranty or other rights which may be implied by law in any  jurisdiction in
relation to the sale of the Business Assets or  the Shares in such
jurisdiction shall be excluded or, if  incapable of exclusion, irrevocably
waived.  (C) This Agreement may only be varied by a document signed by each
of the  parties and expressed to be a variation to this Agreement. For this 
purpose, a variation to this Agreement shall include any addition,  deletion,
supplement or replacement, howsoever effected.  (D) To the extent that any
provision of any agreement or other document  entered into for the purposes
of transferring Business Assets or Shares  located in a particular
jurisdiction or country is inconsistent with any  provision of this
Agreement, the provision of this Agreement shall  prevail.  70  70   35.

non-compliance would lead to a loss or liability in excess of 
E100,000.  55. DISSAY CLOSURE COSTS   The Company has no outstanding
financial or cost commitments or  other liabilities as a result of the
integration of the production  lines from the plant at Dissay into the
factory at Utrecht and, so  far as the Sellers are aware, there are no
circumstances which might  give rise to any such financial or cost
commitments or any other  liability of the Company in connection with the
integration of the  production lines from the plant at Dissay into the
factory at  Utrecht.   146  146    SCHEDULE 4   (LIMITATIONS ON
LIABILITY)  1. LIMITATION ON QUANTUM AND GENERAL  (A) Neither the
Purchaser nor any Designated Purchaser shall be entitled  in any event to
damages or other payment in respect of any claim or  claims under any of the
Warranties in respect of any individual  claim (or, in the case of claims
under Warranties 24(A) to (H), one  or more claims arising from the same
factual circumstances which in  aggregate are):   (i) for less than
E100,000; or   (ii) unless and until the aggregate amount of all individual
claims  (taking no account of any claims for less than E100,000)  exceeds
1.5 per cent. of the Debt Free Price, in which event  the Sellers shall be
liable for the whole amount of such  claims and not merely the excess.  (B)
The total aggregate liability of the Sellers and the Business  Sellers and
the Share Seller under the Warranties, the Tax Covenant  and any warranties
implied by law to the extent not effectively  excluded by this Agreement
shall not in any event exceed two-thirds  of the Final Cash
Consideration.  (C) Neither the Purchaser nor any Designated Purchaser shall
be entitled  to claim for any consequential loss (including loss of profit)
or  punitive damages in respect of a breach of the Warranties.  (D) The
provisions of this Schedule shall operate to limit the liability  of the
Sellers and the Share Seller under the Tax Covenant in so far  as any
provision in this Schedule is expressed to be applicable  thereto and the
provisions of the Tax Covenant shall further operate  to limit the liability
of the Sellers and the Share Seller in  respect of any claim
thereunder.  (E) Each provision of this Schedule shall be read and construed
without  prejudice to each of the other provisions of this Schedule.  2.
TIME LIMITS FOR BRINGING CLAIMS   No claim shall be brought against the
Sellers or the Business  Sellers or the Share Seller in respect of any of the
Warranties or  the Tax Covenant unless the Purchaser shall have given to
the  Sellers written notice of such claim specifying (in reasonable  detail)
the matter which gives rise to the claim, the nature of the  claim and the
amount  147  147   claimed in respect thereof (detailing, so far as
reasonably practicable  and without prejudice to the claim of the Purchaser
the Purchaser\'s  calculation of the loss thereby alleged to have been
suffered by it or the  relevant member of the Purchaser\'s Group):   (i)
subject to sub-paragraphs (ii) and (iii), on or before the  date falling 18
months after the Completion Date; or   (ii) in respect of any claims under
the Tax Warranties or the Tax  Covenant (other than claims of the type
described in  sub-paragraph (iii)), on or before the seventh anniversary of 
the Completion Date; or   (iii) in respect of any claims under the Tax
Warranties relating to  any part of the European Culinary Brands Business in
France or  otherwise subject to French Taxation made following a 
reassessment to Tax by any French Tax Authority, on or before  the end of
2004 save that, in the case of stamp and  registration duties the liability
to which arises as a result  of French law, the relevant date shall be the
eleventh  anniversary of the date of this Agreement,   PROVIDED THAT the
liability of the Sellers and the Business Sellers  and the Share Seller in
respect of such claim shall absolutely  terminate (if such claim has not been
previously satisfied, settled  or withdrawn) if legal proceedings in respect
of such claim shall  not have been commenced within nine months of the date
referred to  in paragraph (i), (ii) or (iii) above and for this purpose 
proceedings shall not be deemed to have been commenced unless they  shall
have been properly issued and validly served upon the Sellers  or the
relevant Business Sellers or the Share Seller (as the case  may be).  3.
CONDUCT OF LITIGATION  (A) Upon the Purchaser or any member of the
Purchaser\'s Group becoming  aware of any claim, action or demand against it
which is likely to  give rise to any claim in respect of any of the
Warranties, the  Purchaser shall:   (i) as soon as reasonably practicable
notify the Sellers, save  that, subject and without prejudice to paragraph 2,
any  failure to give such notice shall not preclude the Purchaser  from
making the relevant claim;   (ii) without prejudice to its right to make a
claim against the  Sellers under the Warranties, consult as fully as is 
reasonably  148  148   practicable with the Sellers as regards the conduct
of any  proceedings arising out of such claim;   (iii) if such claim,
action or demand is for or in respect of an  amount in excess of 2 per cent.
of the Debt Free Price,  without prejudice to the right of the Purchaser on
its own  behalf and on behalf of any Designated Purchaser to make a  claim
against the Sellers or any Business Seller or the Share  Seller for breach of
any of the Warranties, subject to the  Sellers indemnifying the Purchaser and
any member of the  Purchaser\'s Group against any loss, liability and
expenses,  cost, damage or expense which may be incurred thereby  (including
the costs and expenses charged by its legal and  other professional
advisers), take such action and give such  information and access to
personnel, premises, documents and  records to the Sellers and their legal
advisers and  accountants as the Sellers may reasonably request and
(subject  to indemnification of the Purchaser and members of the 
Purchaser\'s Group as described above) the Sellers shall be  entitled to
require any member of the Purchaser\'s Group to  take such action as is, in
the reasonable opinion of the  Purchaser, reasonable and, subject to the
Sellers agreeing to  be bound by an obligation of confidentiality, give
such  information and assistance as the Sellers may reasonably  request in
order to avoid, dispute, resist, mitigate, settle,  compromise, defend or
appeal any claim in respect thereof or  adjudication with respect thereto
(subject to the Purchaser  being entitled to employ its own legal and other
professional  advisers);   (iv) in the case of a claim, action or demand of
the type referred  to in sub-paragraph (iii), be entitled to participate in
the  defence of the relevant claim, action or demand and to employ  separate
counsel to represent it at its own expense PROVIDED  THAT the person who has
elected to grant an indemnity under  sub-paragraph (iii) shall control the
defence of the relevant  claim, action or demand;   (v) in the case of a
claim, action or demand of the type referred  to in sub-paragraph (iii), make
no admission of liability,  agreement, settlement or compromise with any
third party in  relation to any such claim or adjudication without the
prior  written consent of the Sellers (such consent not to be  unreasonably
withheld); and   (vi) without prejudice to its right to make a claim against
the  Sellers or the Business Sellers or the Share Seller under the 
Warranties, take all reasonable action to mitigate any loss  149  149  
suffered by it or any member of the Purchaser\'s Group in  respect of which a
claim could be made under the Warranties  PROVIDED THAT no member of the
Purchaser\'s Group shall be  required to utilise any Relief arising in
respect of a period  commencing after Completion or any event occurring
after  Completion or to arrange its Tax affairs in any particular  manner by
this sub-paragraph (vi),   PROVIDED THAT if a claim arises under the Tax
Warranties and the  same matter also gives rise to a claim under the Tax
Covenant,  clause 8 of the Tax Covenant shall apply to the conduct of any 
proceedings rather than the provisions of paragraphs 3(A)(ii) to  (vi)
above.   (B) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sellers shall not be
entitled to  assume the defence of any claim, action or demand of a third
party  (and shall be liable for the reasonable expenses (including legal 
and other professional expenses) incurred by the Purchaser or  relevant
member or members of the Purchaser\'s Group in defending  such claim, action
or demand) if such claim, action or demand seeks  any relief other than
damages (including any order, injunction or  other equitable relief) against
the Purchaser or relevant member or  members of the Purchaser\'s Group which
the Purchaser reasonably  determines cannot be separated from any related
claim for damages.  If such claim for other relief can be separated from the
claim for  damages, the Sellers shall be entitled to assume the defence of
the  claim for damages.   (C) The Sellers shall be entitled at any stage
and at their absolute  discretion to settle any such third party assessment
or claim.  4. NO LIABILITY IF LOSS IS OTHERWISE COMPENSATED FOR  (A) No
liability shall attach to the Sellers, the Business Sellers, the  Share
Seller or any of them by reason of any breach of any of the  Warranties to
the extent that the same loss has been recovered by  the Purchaser or any
other member of the Purchaser\'s Group under any  other Warranty or term of
this Agreement or any other document  referred to herein or under the Tax
Covenant and accordingly the  Purchaser and any Designated Purchaser may only
recover once in  respect of the same loss.  (B) The Sellers, the Business
Sellers and the Share Seller shall not be  liable for breach of any of the
Warranties to the extent that the  loss in respect of the claim has been or
is made good or is  otherwise compensated for without cost to the Purchaser
or any other  member of the Purchaser\'s Group.  150  150   (C) For the
avoidance of doubt, in calculating the liability of the  Sellers, the
Business Sellers and the Share Seller for any breach of  the Warranties there
shall be taken into account the amount by which  any Taxation for which the
Purchaser, any person which the Purchaser  procures to purchase the Business
Assets or the Company is now or in  the future accountable or liable to be
assessed is reduced or  extinguished as a result of the matter giving rise to
such liability.  5. RECOVERY FROM INSURERS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES  (A)
Where the Purchaser or any member of the Purchaser\'s Group is at any  time
entitled to recover from some other person, the Purchaser  shall, and shall
procure that the member of the Purchaser\'s Group  concerned shall, take all
reasonable steps to enforce such recovery  PROVIDED THAT the Purchaser or the
relevant member of the  Purchaser\'s Group shall not be required to have
recovered any sum  from any third party prior to bringing a claim against the
Sellers  or any Business Seller and the Sellers or any Business Seller
making  any payment which is due in respect of any such claim.  (B) If any
member of the Sellers\' Group pays at any time to the  Purchaser or any
member of the Purchaser\'s Group an amount pursuant  to a claim which has
been admitted by the Sellers or any Business  Seller or the Share Seller or
proven by a final judgment in a court  of competent jurisdiction in respect
of the Warranties and the  Purchaser or relevant member of the Purchaser\'s
Group subsequently  recovers from some other person (including, without
limitation,  under any policy of insurance) any sum which is referable to
any  matter giving rise to such claim, the Purchaser shall, and shall 
procure that the relevant member of the Purchaser\'s Group shall,  repay to
the relevant member of the Sellers\' Group the lesser of (i)  the amount paid
by the relevant member(s) of the Sellers\' Group (or  the relevant one of
them) to the Purchaser or other member of the  Purchaser\'s Group and (ii)
the sum (including interest (if any) less  any Tax chargeable in respect of
the sum recovered or the interest)  recovered from such other person, taking
account of all costs,  charges, expenses and Taxation incurred thereon by the
Purchaser or  any other member of the Purchaser\'s Group recovering that
sum.  6. ACTS OF PURCHASER  (A) No claim shall lie against the Sellers,
the Business Sellers, the  Share Seller or any of them under or in relation
to the Warranties  to the extent that such claim is attributable to:   (i)
any voluntary act, omission, transaction or arrangement  carried out at the
request of or with the consent (in either  case, in  151  151   
writing) of the Purchaser or of a member of the Purchaser\'s Group  other
than the Company before, at or after Completion or of the  Company after
Completion or under the terms of this Agreement or any  other agreement
contemplated by it (other than a liability to Tax  arising as a result of the
entering into and/or the Completion of  this Agreement); and   (ii) any
voluntary act, omission, transaction or arrangement  carried out by the
Purchaser or by a member of the Purchaser\'s  Group on or after Completion
unless such act, omission,  transaction or arrangement was carried out or
made by the  Purchaser or any other member of the Purchaser\' Group in the 
ordinary course of carrying on the European Culinary Brands  Business after
Completion or pursuant to any legally binding  commitment entered into by the
Company on or prior to  Completion.  (B) The Sellers, the Business Sellers
and the Share Seller shall not be  liable for any breach of any Warranty
which would not have arisen  but for any reorganisation or change in
ownership of any member of  the Purchaser\'s Group or of any assets of any
such member after, but  not at, Completion or change in any accounting basis
on which any  member of the Purchaser\'s Group values its assets or any
accounting  basis, method, policy or practice of any member of the
Purchaser\'s  Group which is different from that adopted or used in the 
preparation of the Financial Information or the Accounts after  Completion
other than, where the member of the Purchaser\'s Group is  the Company, a
change which is certified by the auditors for the  time being of the Company
to be necessary because the basis, method,  policy or practice of accounting
of the Company at the date of  Completion is not in accordance with any
published accounting  practices or principles then current.  7. THE
COMPLETION STOCKS STATEMENT   No matter shall be the subject of a claim
under the Warranties to  the extent that facts or circumstances which would,
but for this  paragraph 7, allow such a claim to be made, have been taken
into  account (by way of a provision, allowance, reserve or otherwise) in 
the valuation of the Stocks or any of them in the Completion Stocks 
Statement.  8. RETROSPECTIVE LEGISLATION   No liability shall arise in
respect of any breach of any of the  Warranties to the extent that liability
for such breach occurs or is  increased as a result of any change in or
introduction of any  legislation announced, or if not announced in advance of
being made,  152  152     made, after the date of this Agreement with
retrospective effect or  as a result of the withdrawal of any extra-statutory
concession or  other formal agreement or arrangement currently granted by or
made  with any governmental authority or Tax Authority or as a result of 
any change after the date of this Agreement of any generally  accepted
interpretation or application of any legislation or in the  enforcement
policy or published practice of the relevant authorities.  9.
TAXATION  (A) Without prejudice to the generality of paragraph 8, the
Sellers and  the Business Sellers and the Share Seller shall not be liable in
any  event in respect of any breach of the Warranties if such breach or 
claim would not have occurred or arisen but for any change in the  basis of,
method of calculation of, or increase in the rate or rates  of Taxation or
changes in the published practice of any Tax  Authority announced (or if not
so announced in advance, being made)  after the date of this Agreement but
with retrospective effect  (judged as when so announced or made) or the
withdrawal of any  extra-statutory concession currently granted by any Tax
Authority.  (B) The Sellers and the Business Sellers and the Share Seller
shall not  be liable for any claim to the extent that it arises wholly or 
partly out of or is increased by virtue of a voluntary disclaimer by  the
Company after Completion of any claim for Relief made by it  prior to
Completion (other than any such disclaimer made at the  written request of or
with the written consent of the Sellers).  (C) The Sellers and the Business
Sellers and the Share Seller shall not  be liable in respect of any claims in
respect of any breach of the  Tax Warranties relating to the Shares (a "TAX
CLAIM") if and to the  extent that, without prejudice to the generality of
sub-paragraph  (B), such Tax Claim arises or is increased by virtue of a
voluntary  disclaimer by the Company after Completion of any claim for
Relief  made by the Company prior to Completion (other than any such 
disclaimer made at the written request or with the written consent  of the
Sellers).  (D) The Sellers and the Business Sellers and the Share Seller
shall not  be liable in respect of any breach of the Warranties if such 
liability would have been excluded under the provisions of clause 3  of the
Tax Covenant had such liability been treated as a Tax  Liability (as defined
in the Tax Covenant) for the purposes of the  Tax Covenant.  153 
153  10. DISCLOSURE   Neither the Purchaser nor the Designated Purchaser
shall be entitled  to claim that any fact, matter or circumstance causes any
of the  Warranties to be breached if fairly disclosed in the Disclosure 
Letter, in any document referred to in the Disclosure Letter, in any 
document delivered with the Disclosure Letter or in any document in  the Data
Room.  11. APPORTIONMENTS OF CONSIDERATION   For the avoidance of doubt,
it is understood and agreed that neither  the Sellers nor any Business Seller
nor the Share Seller shall be  liable for the accuracy of the valuations of
assets and liabilities  in Schedule 8.  12. CLAIM TO BE REDUCTION OF FINAL
CASH CONSIDERATION   Any payment made by the Sellers or any other person in
respect of  any claim under the Warranties or the Tax Covenant shall be made
(to  the greatest extent possible) by way of repayment of the Final Cash 
Consideration payable by the Purchaser (on behalf of the relevant  Designated
Purchaser) under this Agreement to the Sellers (on behalf  of the Share
Seller or Business Sellers) and allocable to the  greatest extent possible to
the relevant Business Asset or Shares to  which the claim relates.  13.
NON-EU INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND KNOW-HOW   Without prejudice to any other
provision of this Schedule, neither  the Purchaser nor any Designated
Purchaser shall be entitled to  bring any claim for breach of any Warranty
against the Sellers, the  Business Sellers or the Share Seller or any of them
in respect of  matters relating directly to any Qualified IP Warranty Rights
other  than to the extent that the Sellers are aware of the facts or 
circumstances which would, but for this paragraph 13, allow the  Purchaser or
any Designated Purchaser to do so.   154  154     SCHEDULE 5  
(COMPLETION STATEMENT IN RESPECT OF STOCKS)   PART A - PREPARATION OF
COMPLETION STOCKS STATEMENT  1. The Completion Stocks Statement shall:  
(i) be based on the books and records of the relevant Business  Sellers and
Company;   (ii) consist of statements the Company or each relevant part of
the  Business conducted by a Business Seller in the format of  Attachment 7
comprising a statement of the Completion Stocks  Amount as at midnight
(applicable local time) on the  Completion Date in the currencies in which
that part of the  Completion Stocks Amount attributable to the Company or
that  Business Seller is reported as at the date of this Agreement  in the
books of the relevant Company or Business Seller;   (iii) subject to sub-
paragraphs (i) and (ii), be prepared on the  basis and in accordance with the
principles, policies,  procedures, methods and practices of accounting set
out in the  Unilever Accounting Policy Manual; and   (iv) subject to sub-
paragraphs (ii) and (iii), be prepared in  accordance with generally accepted
accounting policies as  adopted in the United Kingdom.  2. In the
preparation of the Completion Stocks Statement, the  Completion Stocks Amount
shall be expressed in the currencies in  which the said Completion Stocks
Amount is reported as at the date  of this Agreement in the books of the
Company or Business Sellers.  In determining the Completion Stocks Amount,
the aggregate amounts  for each of the Company or Business Sellers expressed
in currencies  other than Euros shall be converted into Euros at the Exchange
Rate.  3. The Sellers shall deliver, or procure the delivery to the
Purchaser  by the date falling 60 Business Days after the Completion Date, of
a  draft Completion Stocks Statement (the "DRAFT COMPLETION STOCKS 
STATEMENT").  4. For the purposes of preparing the Draft Completion Stocks
Statement,  after Completion the Purchaser shall, and shall procure that
each  other member of the Purchaser\'s Group shall, give the Sellers and 
the Sellers\' Accountants reasonable access at reasonable times to  all books
and records in their respective possession or control  relating to the
European Culinary Brands Business on or prior to the   155  155  
Completion Date and generally shall provide the Sellers with such  other
information and assistance as the Sellers may reasonably  request (including
the reasonable assistance of financial personnel  who were employed in the
European Culinary Brands Business at any  time before Completion) for the
purposes of preparing the Draft  Completion Stocks Statement. Management of
the European Culinary  Brands Business shall act in good faith in connection
with all  matters involving the Completion Stocks Statement. The fees,
costs  and expenses of the Sellers\' Accountants shall be paid by the 
Sellers.  5. The Purchaser shall have a period of 30 Business Days (the
"REVIEW  PERIOD") after the date of delivery to it by or on behalf of the 
Sellers of the Draft Completion Stocks Statement to review, in  conjunction
with the Purchaser\'s Accountants, the Draft Completion  Stocks Statement and
to present to the Sellers in writing any  objections (stating in reasonable
detail, including specific  amounts, the matters in dispute) it may have to
the Draft Completion  Stocks Statement. The only grounds upon which the
Purchaser shall  be entitled to object to the Draft Completion Stocks
Statement are  mathematical errors in the computation of the Completion
Stocks  Amount or that it has not been prepared in accordance with this 
Schedule and no objection shall be raised which would not, if  successful,
lead to an amendment to the Completion Stocks Amount in  accordance with
paragraph 8. Any such objections must be  accompanied by a recalculation of
each amount in the Draft  Completion Stocks Statement based upon such
objections and shall be  accompanied by reasonable evidence supporting each
objection.  6. For the purposes of enabling the Purchaser and the
Purchaser\'s  Accountants to present any such written objections as are
referred  to in paragraph 5, the Sellers shall, following the presentation
of  the Draft Completion Stocks Statement, give the Purchaser and the 
Purchaser\'s Accountants reasonable access at reasonable times to all  books
and records in their possession or control after the  Completion Date
relating to the European Culinary Brands Business  and generally shall
provide the Purchaser with such other  information (including working papers)
as the Purchaser may  reasonably request PROVIDED THAT the Purchaser and the
Purchaser\'s  Accountants shall not be entitled to any such access or
information  which goes beyond that reasonably necessary to determine whether
the  Draft Completion Stocks Statement has been prepared in accordance  with
the provisions of this Schedule. The fees, costs and expenses  of the
Purchaser\'s Accountants shall be paid by the Purchaser.  7. If and to the
extent that no such written objections as are referred  to in paragraph 5 are
properly presented to the Sellers by the end  of  156  156   the Review
Period then the Draft Completion Stocks Statement  shall, as between the
Purchaser and the Sellers, be deemed to have  been accepted and approved by
the Purchaser and the Sellers and the  Draft Completion Stocks Statement
shall be final and binding on the  Purchaser and the Sellers and shall
constitute the "COMPLETION  STOCKS STATEMENT", or the relevant part of the
Completion Stocks  Statement, for all purposes of this Agreement.  8. If
and to the extent that any such written objections as are referred to  in
paragraph 5 are properly presented to the Sellers by the end of  the Review
Period then the Sellers and the Purchaser shall attempt to  resolve the
matters in dispute between them in good faith negotiations. To  facilitate
the Sellers\' review of any such written objections, the  Purchaser shall
provide the Sellers and the Sellers\' Accountants with such  information
(including working papers) as the Sellers may reasonably  require for the
purpose of the review. If there are any such matters in  dispute between the
Purchaser and the Sellers which have not been resolved  in good faith
negotiations within a period of 30 Business Days after the  end of the Review
Period, then the specific matters in dispute shall be  referred for
determination to an Expert who shall be instructed to notify  the Sellers and
the Purchaser of his determination within 20 Business Days  of such referral.
If the Purchaser and the Sellers resolve all matters in  dispute in relation
to the Draft Completion Stocks Statement, then the  Draft Completion Stocks
Statement shall, as between the Purchaser and the  Sellers, be deemed to have
been accepted and approved by the Purchaser and  the Sellers and the Draft
Completion Stocks Statement shall be final and  binding on the Purchaser and
the Sellers and shall constitute the  "COMPLETION STOCKS STATEMENT", or the
relevant part of the Completion  Stocks Statement, for all purposes of this
Agreement.  9. The Sellers shall, and shall procure that each other member
of the  Sellers\' Group shall, and the Purchaser shall and shall procure
that  each other member of the Purchaser\'s Group shall, give the Expert 
reasonable access at reasonable times to all books and records in  their
respective possession or control relating to the European  Culinary Brands
Business and generally shall provide the Expert with  such other information
and assistance as the Expert may reasonably  require. In making his
determination, the Expert shall act as  expert and not as arbitrator and
shall provide a reasoned opinion  for his determination and the Draft
Completion Stocks Statement as  amended by the Expert shall, as between the
Sellers and the  Purchaser and in the absence of manifest error by the
Expert, be  deemed to have been accepted and approved by the Sellers and
the  Purchaser, shall be final and binding on the Sellers and the  Purchaser
and shall constitute the "COMPLETION STOCKS STATEMENT" for  all purposes of
this  157  157   Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any amendment
by the Expert of  any amount set out in the Completion Stocks Statement shall
be within the  range for such amount indicated by the Draft Completion Stocks
Statement  and any amendment to the Draft Completion Stocks Statement made
pursuant  to paragraph 8. The fees and costs of the Expert shall be paid as
to 50  per cent. by the Purchaser and 50 per cent. by the Sellers. The
Expert  may, if he decides it is necessary or desirable to do so in his
absolute  discretion, refer any interpretational matter which relates to any
dispute  to a Leading Counsel approved by the Sellers and the Purchaser and
the  terms of appointment of the Expert shall allow him to make such
reference.  10. Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraphs of this Schedule,
where the  value of the Stock in any relevant country as shown in the 
Completion Stocks Statement as finally determined or agreed in  accordance
with this Schedule differs by E100,000 or less from the  value of that Stock
as set out in the original Draft Completion  Stocks Statement delivered
pursuant to paragraph 3 then the value  set out against the relevant country
in the original Draft  Completion Stocks Statement delivered pursuant to
paragraph 3 shall  be used for the purpose of determining the Completion
Stocks Amount.     PART B - CONSTITUENTS OF THE TARGET STOCKS AMOUNT

the following matters:   (i) all local land charges;   (ii) all notices
served and orders, demands, proposals or  requirements made by any local or
other competent authority;   (iii) all exceptions and reservations of
whatever nature, all rights  of way, water, light, air or other rights,
easements,  quasi-easements, wayleaves (whether constituted in the title 
deeds or otherwise) and third party rights of possession or  occupation;  
(iv) in the case of a Business Property which is leasehold, the  covenants,

Business Property is sold subject to any Letting Documents but  otherwise
with vacant possession.  3. TITLE   Without prejudice to the terms of
Schedule 3 or to the terms of the  Disclosure Letter, the Purchaser shall be
deemed to be purchasing with  full knowledge of the contents of all deeds and
other documents of  title relating to the Business Properties and shall raise
no  requisition or object in relation to any such title save in respect of 
any matters revealed by pre-Completion searches.  166  166     4.
PROPERTY CONSENTS  (A) This paragraph and paragraph 5 apply to those
Business Properties in  relation to which a Property Consent is required for
the transfer or  assignment to the Purchaser and remains to be obtained as at
the  Completion Date (including any Business Property held in whole or in 
part under a lease containing an absolute prohibition on assignment).  (B)
The relevant Business Seller shall use its reasonable endeavours at its  own
expense to obtain the Property Consents. The Purchaser shall  provide to any
landlord lawfully requiring the same a direct covenant  by the Purchaser with
the landlord to observe and perform the terms of  the relevant lease together
with a sufficient reasonable guarantee or  other reasonable security for such
obligation on such terms and in such  form as the relevant landlord is
lawfully entitled to require.  (C) The Purchaser shall supply all references
and other evidence and  information reasonably and lawfully required by any
landlord or any  other third party in order to obtain the Property
Consents.  (D) The relevant Business Seller shall pay the professional fees
of any  landlord and its advisers incurred in connection with all
applications  for the Property Consents.  (E) If any Property Consent shall
not have been obtained by nine months  after Completion the relevant Business
Seller shall in relation to each  Business Property so affected:   (i) at
its own expense make and diligently pursue an application  to a Court of
competent jurisdiction for a declaration that  the Property Consent is being
withheld unreasonably (where the  relevant landlord is not entitled to
withhold consent in such  a manner) and if necessary pursue an appeal on a
decision that  consent is not being withheld unreasonably unless either the 
Business Seller and the Purchaser agree that such an  application or appeal
as applicable has no realistic prospect  of success or the Business Seller
obtains advice from leading  counsel to the same effect; and   (ii) at its
own expense apply to the relevant landlord for a  Property Approval to an
underlease to the Purchaser for a term  equal to the residue of the term of
the relevant lease (less  three days) and otherwise on the same terms of such
lease.  167  167     5. DELAYED LEGAL COMPLETION  (A) If a Property
Consent has not been obtained by Completion in relation  to a Business
Property then the date for legal completion of the sale  and purchase of the
relevant Business Property shall be postponed to  the tenth Business Day
after the earlier of:   (i) the date on which the Property Consent is
obtained;   (ii) the expiration of the period for the lodging of an appeal 
against a decision of a Court of competent jurisdiction that  the Property
Consent is being unreasonably withheld without  such appeal being lodged;  
(iii) the Purchaser (if it so elects) giving notice that it wishes  to
complete the Property Transfer notwithstanding the  non-issue of the Property
Consent; and   (iv) in respect of the Business Properties to which paragraph
5(E)  does not apply the day two years after the Completion Date.  (B)
Pending legal completion and with effect from Completion the relevant 
Business Seller will procure that in relation to any relevant Business 
Property:   (i) the Purchaser is permitted (with all persons authorised by
it)  to have the unrestricted use and occupation of either the  whole of the
Business Property or such parts of the Business  Property as are not subject
to any Leases;   (ii) no contract is entered into disposing of any interest
in or  granting any right over or varying or surrendering the lease  of the
Business Property;   (iii) if the relevant Business Property is leasehold,
and subject to  being put in funds by the Purchaser, the rents, service 
charges, outgoings and other sums reserved by the relevant  lease are
paid;   (iv) no steps are taken in relation to any rent review pursuant to 
the lease of a Business Property without the consent of the  Purchaser (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld);  168  168      (v) a copy of
any notice received in respect of the Business  Property is promptly produced
to the Purchaser and the  Business Seller takes at the request and cost of
the Purchaser  all such appropriate action in response to such notice as
the  Purchaser shall properly require; and   (vi) the Purchaser is
accounted to forthwith for any income  received from the Business
Property.  (C) Pending legal completion and with effect from Completion in
relation to  any relevant Business Property the Purchaser will:   (i)
within five Business Days of written demand, put the relevant  Business
Seller in funds so as to enable it to pay when due  all rents, service
charges and other outgoings payable in  respect of the relevant Business
Property;   (ii) by way of indemnity only, observe and perform the
covenants  and conditions contained in the title deeds and documents 
relating to the relevant Business Property including the  Lease; and  
(iii) indemnify the relevant Business Seller against the acts or  omissions
of the employees, servants, agents, licensees and  invitees of the Purchaser
in or about the relevant Business  Property.  (D) The Purchaser
acknowledges that:   (i) as against any person from whom a Property Consent
is to be  obtained in accordance with this Agreement it has no right to 
possession or occupation of the relevant Business Property;  and   (ii) in
the event of a court order being obtained by any such  person it will vacate
the relevant Business Property on  demand.  (E) In respect of any leasehold
Business Property for which the landlord  has an unqualified discretion to
refuse consent to an assignment  novation and underletting if the landlord
shall refuse such consent and  shall formally require the Purchaser to vacate
the relevant Business  Property the Purchaser shall vacate the relevant
property and the  Seller shall retain such Business Property.  169 
169     6. UNDERLEASE  (A) This clause shall apply to any Business
Property (an "UNCONSENTED  PROPERTY") in relation to which a Property Consent
is required where:   (i) the parties agree that Property Consent has been
reasonably  withheld; or   (ii) the Property Consent has been refused and
the landlord has no  obligation to act reasonably in deciding whether or not
to  grant a Property Consent; or   (iii) the relevant Business Seller
having complied with its  obligations under sub-paragraph 4(E)(i) the Court
has refused  to grant a declaration; or   (iv) the Property Consent has not
been issued by the date nine  months after the date of this Agreement unless
an application  has been made to the Court for a declaration that the
Property  Consent has been unreasonably withheld and such application  has
not been determined.  (B) The relevant Business Seller agrees to grant (or
procure to be granted)  and the Purchaser agrees to take up an underlease of
each Unconsented  Property (the "UNDERLEASE").  (C) The relevant Business
Seller shall apply for and use its reasonable  endeavours to obtain Property
Underlease Approval and the Purchaser  shall support such application in like
manner as the applications  pursuant to paragraph 4 above. The relevant
Business Seller will make  an application to a Court of competent
jurisdiction for a declaration  that the Property Underlease Approval is
being withheld unreasonably  upon request by the Purchaser (acting
reasonably) (even though nine  months has not elapsed since the Completion
Date) and at the  Purchaser\'s expense. This paragraph 6(C) shall not apply
where the  landlord has no obligation to act reasonably in deciding whether
or not  to grant a Property Underlease Approval.  (D) Such underlease shall
be completed on the tenth Business Day after the  earlier of:   (i) the
Property Underlease Approval being obtained; and   (ii) the expiry of the
period for the lodging of an appeal against  a decision made by a Court of
competent  170  170     jurisdiction that the Property Underlease
Approval has been  unreasonably withheld without such appeal being
lodged.  (E) The underleases of each Unconsented Property will be for terms
equal to  the unexpired term of the relevant Lease less three days and will
be  otherwise on the same terms as the relevant Lease with provision for 
the rent to be the same as the rent agreed or determined from time to  time
under the Lease, a covenant by the underlessee to observe and  perform the
terms of the Lease other than those relating to the payment  of rent and a
covenant by the underlessor to pay the rent reserved by  the Lease.  (F)
Where the Property Consent is obtained or a declaration is obtained  that
such Property Consent has been unreasonably withheld after  completion of
such underlease this Agreement shall continue to take  effect for the purpose
of assigning or transferring the Lease to the  Purchaser subject to and with
the benefit of the Underlease.  (G) The Business Seller shall be liable for
all title registration costs  including stamp duty associated with the
Underlease when the Property  Consent has been refused in the circumstances
described in paragraph  6(A)(ii).  7. DEPOSITS   Unless it is unlawful to
do so, on legal completion the relevant  Business Seller will transfer (or
procure to be transferred) to the  Purchaser the benefit of all sums held as
security for payment of rents  and licence fees or the performance of the
covenants or obligations  under the Letting Documents.  8. THE PROPERTY
TRANSFER AND UNDERLEASE  (A) Subject to paragraph 5, legal completion of the
transfer of the  Business Properties shall take place on completion.  (B)
Subject to paragraph 8(C), on legal completion the relevant Business  Seller
will deliver a duly signed or executed Property Transfer of the  Business
Property to the Purchaser.  (C) If the Business Seller has applied to the
relevant landlord for its  consent to an underlease in accordance with
paragraph 6 and the  Business Seller has obtained such consent (but has not
obtained a  consent for a transfer or an assignment), on legal completion
the  relevant Business Seller will deliver a duly  171  171    
executed underlease of the relevant Business Property to the Purchaser  and
the Purchaser will accept the underlease and deliver a duly  executed
counterpart to the Business Seller.  (D) The relevant Business Seller will
not by reason of any covenants  implied by law or statute or otherwise
expressed in any Property  Transfer of a Business Property which is leasehold
be deemed to  covenant expressly or impliedly that the obligations contained
in any  lease of the Business Property relating to its state and condition
have  been complied with and the Property Transfer will contain a
declaration  to that effect.  (E) The Business Seller shall produce drafts
of the Property Transfers of  the Business Properties for approval by the
Purchaser within 10  Business Days after the date of this Agreement. The
Property Transfers  shall be in a form generally acceptable in the relevant
jurisdiction  and shall be agreed between the relevant Business Seller and
the  Purchaser who shall each act reasonably and in good faith.  (F) The
Purchaser shall notify the Business Seller in writing of any  amendments
which it reasonably requires to the form of the Property  Transfer (including
provisions for assignment of ancillary documents)  in order to ensure that
such Property Transfer enables the Purchaser or  such person as it may direct
to continue to use the relevant Business  Property in substantially the same
manner (including as to terms and  cost) as they are used for the purposes of
the Business at the date of  this Agreement.  9. OTHER JURISDICTIONS  
The parties acknowledge and undertake to each other that:  (A)
notwithstanding that certain of the arrangements provided for or  envisaged
by Part A of this Schedule 9 including without limitation the  form of the
Property Transfer may not be capable of being directly or  appropriately
applied in jurisdictions other than England and Wales  ("OTHER
JURISDICTIONs") under the laws, established law practices and  procedures of
those jurisdictions ("FOREIGN LAWS"), the commercial  principles underlying
the provisions and intentions of Part A shall be  applied as closely as
possible in the Other Jurisdictions to produce as  nearly as possible the
same commercial results; and  (B) to the extent that the arrangements
provided for or envisaged by Part A  of this Schedule 9 (including, without
limitation, the form of the  Property Transfer) cannot readily or
appropriately    172  172     and with reasonable practicality be
wholly applied in Other  Jurisdictions under Foreign Laws, they will apply
subject to such  alteration and amendment as may be necessary or desirable in
order to  achieve in reasonably practical terms the same commercial results
(or  as nearly as possible the same commercial results, taking into account 
the relevant Foreign laws) as would be achieved in England and Wales on  the
application of those arrangements.  (C) to the extent necessary in order to
achieve in Other Jurisdictions the  commercial results intended by this Part
A, Clause 33 shall apply.   PART B - COUNTRY-SPECIFIC PROPERTY
PROVISIONS  10. FRANCE  (A) In relation to the Business Property located
in France, the relevant  Property Transfer shall be drawn up and carried out
by a French notary.  (B) The Purchaser is aware that the District of Dunkirk
may exercise its  pre-emption right in respect of the Business Property
located in  France.  (C) Without prejudice to the generality of Clause
38(B), the Purchaser  shall procure that all title registration costs
(including, but not  limited to, registration duties) with respect to the
Business Property  located in France and the transfer thereof are paid to the
relevant  French Tax Authorities.  11. SWEDEN  (A) The relevant Business
Seller shall transfer to the relevant Designated  Purchaser all of the
Business Properties in Sweden free and clear of  all pre-emption rights which
may be exercisable by a municipality or  other body.  (B) In the event the
Business Property is registered, in whole or in part,  for voluntary
deductions of incoming value added tax the relevant  Business Seller may be
obliged to refund deducted value added tax on to  the tax authority, as a
consequence of this transfer. In such case, the  Purchaser shall, in addition
to the Specific Purchase Price, make  payment to the relevant Business Seller
on the Completion Date of an  amount corresponding to the sum to be refunded
by the relevant Business  Seller.  173  173     (C) The Purchaser
shall be liable for all title registration costs,  including stamp duty,
associated with the purchase.  (D) Upon payment of the Purchase Price by the
Purchaser on the Completion  Date, the relevant Business Seller shall
acknowledge receipt thereof by  a purchase deed, for registration purposes
(Sw. Kopebrev).  12. UNITED KINGDOM   At completion of the transfers of
the Business Properties at Ashford,  United Kingdom, the Purchaser shall
procure that the relevant  Designated Purchaser enters into a deed of
covenant in the form  required pursuant to clause 5.2(b) of the Transfer
dated 7th July, 1997  made between Batchelors Peas Limited and Quest
International  (Fragrances, Flavours, Food Ingredients) UK Limited.  174

188       PART 1   FULLY FINANCING  1. TRANSFERRED RELEVANT BENEFITS
TO BE FULLY FINANCED  1.1 Subject to PARAGRAPH 13 and PARAGRAPH 16.3(a), the
Sellers shall use  their reasonable endeavours to procure that the funded
Transferred  Relevant Benefits are Fully Financed promptly after the Value of
such  funded Transferred Relevant Benefits has been determined in
accordance  with this Schedule and all necessary consents and approvals have
been  obtained.  1.2 PARAGRAPH 3 applies, subject to PARAGRAPH 13:   (a)
in respect of funded Transferred Relevant Benefits, to the  extent the
Transferred Relevant Benefits are not Fully  Financed; and   (b) in respect
of unfunded Transferred Relevant Benefits.  1.3 "FULLY FINANCED" in respect
of any funded Transferred Relevant Benefit  means that the Value of any
Transferred Assets in respect of that  funded Transferred Relevant Benefit is
equal to the Value of that  funded Transferred Relevant Benefit as at the
Completion Date.  1.4 1.4.1 Neither the Sellers nor the Purchaser intend
that any transfer  of surplus assets (being, in the case of Transferred
Relevant  Benefits, Transferred Assets in excess of the Value of the 
Transferred Relevant Benefits transferred to that Purchaser\'s  Group Plan,
each valued as at the Completion Date) will be  made from a Sellers\' Group
Plan to a Purchaser\'s Group Plan  and each of the Sellers and the Purchaser
will use their  respective reasonable endeavours to effect that
intention.   1.4.2 Without prejudice to the generality of PARAGRAPH 1.4.1,
any  surplus distributed or allocated by the Swedish Staff Pension  Society
(SPP) to or for the benefit of any member of the  Sellers\' Group in respect
of ITP benefits shall be retained by  that member of the Sellers\' Group and
shall not be transferred  or allocated to a Purchaser\'s Group Plan or member
of the  Purchaser\'s Group.  1.5 PARAGRAPH 1.6 shall apply notwithstanding
any other provision of this  Schedule.  189  189     1.6 1.6.1 If a
Benefit under a Relevant Sellers\' Group Plan becomes  payable to or in
respect of a Pensionable Employee as a result  of the termination of his
employment on or with effect from  Completion, or prior to Completion where
immediately after  such termination he becomes employed by another member of
the  Group, that Benefit shall not be treated as a Transferred  Relevant
Benefit for the purposes of this document.   1.6.2 If a Transferred Relevant
Benefit is reduced as a result of a  benefit becoming payable to or in
respect of a Pensionable  Employee as a result of the termination of his
employment on  or with effect from Completion, or prior to Completion where 
immediately after such termination he becomes employed by  another member of
the Group, that reduction shall be treated  as if it had occurred as at
Completion, and so reduce the  Value of the Transferred Relevant Benefit as
at Completion,  and the Sellers and Purchaser agree that the provisions of 
this document shall be applied in such a way as to give effect  to that
principle, making appropriate allowance for the change  in the time value of
money where calculations are performed as  at different dates.  1.7 To the
extent the Sellers and the Purchaser are unable to agree on the  application
of PARAGRAPH 1.6, PARAGRAPH 9 shall apply.  2. ACTUARIAL VALUATION  2.1
This PARAGRAPH 2 applies where the Value of a Transferred Relevant  Benefit
or a Transferred Asset is to be determined.  2.2 Subject to PARAGRAPH 2.3,
the actuarial method and assumptions to be  used for determining the Value of
a Transferred Relevant Benefit are:   (a) those set out in the Actuarial
Annex, if applicable;   (b) if (a) does not apply, those used in the last
actuarial  valuation of the applicable Plan which was completed, and the 
report in respect of which was signed by the Plan\'s actuary,  prior to the
date of this Agreement and, in the case of a  Benefit provided under a funded
Plan, also used for funding  the Benefit; or   (c) if neither (a) nor (b)
applies, such reasonable actuarial  method and assumptions as may be agreed
between the Sellers  190  190     and the Purchaser or, in default of
agreement, as determined  under PARAGRAPH 9.  2.3 2.3.1 For the avoidance
of doubt:   (a) in determining the Value of a Transferred Relevant
Benefit,  only the actuarial method and assumptions referred to in 
PARAGRAPH 2.2(a), (b) or (c) shall apply. For example, where  an actuarial
method and assumptions in respect of a Relevant  Sellers\' Group Plan are set
out in the Actuarial Annex,  PARAGRAPHS 2.2(b) and 2.2(c) shall be
disregarded in relation  to that Relevant Sellers\' Group Plan;   (b)
without prejudice to the generality of (a) above, no allowance  shall be made
under PARAGRAPH 2.2 (unless agreed by the  Sellers in their absolute
discretion) for any established  practice referred to in PARAGRAPH 4.2.1 or
for the provision  of lump sum death benefits except in each case to the
extent  provided for (whether expressly or otherwise) in the actuarial 
method and assumptions set out in the Actuarial Annex or  completed actuarial
valuation.   2.3.2 If the valuation method referred to in PARAGRAPH 2.2
would  otherwise value the accrual of Transferred Relevant Benefits  by
reference to service after the Completion Date, it shall  instead be based on
service up to the Completion Date and any  contributions in respect of post-
Completion Date service shall  be disregarded.   2.3.3 In valuing the
Transferred Relevant Benefits it shall be  assumed there is no obligation to
equalise benefits (to the  extent not already equalised under the Relevant
Sellers\' Group  Plan in question) under Article 141 including, without 
limitation, accrued rights to guaranteed minimum pensions in  the UK.  2.4
2.4.1 Unless the Sellers and the Purchaser otherwise agree, the  actuarial
valuations will be undertaken by the Sellers\'  Actuary and agreed by the
Purchaser\'s Actuary or, in default  of agreement, determined in accordance
with PARAGRAPH 9.   2.4.2 The Sellers and the Purchaser shall each:   (a)
use all reasonable endeavours to procure that any  information which may
reasonably be required by the  Sellers\' Actuary or the Purchaser\'s Actuary
for the  purpose of undertaking and agreeing such valuation  191 
191     shall, to the extent that it is within the power or  control of
the Sellers or the Purchaser, as the case  may be, be supplied to such
actuary and that any such  information so supplied shall be true, complete
and  accurate in all material respects; and   (b) use all reasonable
endeavours to procure that their  or its actuary acts promptly and that such
valuations  are completed promptly.  3. SHORTFALL  3.1 This PARAGRAPH 3
applies, subject to PARAGRAPH 13, where there is a  Gross Shortfall. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Sellers shall have no  obligation under this
PARAGRAPH 3 in respect of any Transferred  Relevant Benefits in relation to
which the Purchaser has not complied  with its obligations under PARAGRAPH
13.  3.2 If, in respect of any Transferred Relevant Benefit, A is less than
B,  the amount of that shortfall is the "GROSS SHORTFALL".  3.3 A
represents the Value of the Transferred Assets in respect of that 
Transferred Relevant Benefit.   B represents the Value of the Transferred
Relevant Benefit.   NOTE: EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF A RELEVANT SELLERS\' SERA
PLAN, THE VALUE OF  THE TRANSFERRED ASSETS IN RESPECT OF A TRANSFERRED
RELEVANT BENEFIT  FROM AN UNFUNDED RELEVANT SELLERS\' GROUP PLAN IS
NIL.   3.4 3.4.1 If a Shortfall is determined in relation to any
Transferred  Relevant Benefit the Sellers shall, subject to PARAGRAPH 3.5, 
promptly pay to the Purchaser (by way of adjustment to the  Final Cash
Consideration) an amount in Euros equal to the  aggregate of:   (a) that
Shortfall divided by the Market Adjustment  Factor; plus   (b) an amount
calculated as if it were interest at the  Agreed Rate (accrued daily and
compounded monthly) on  an amount equal to the amount in (a) for the period 
from and including the Completion Date to and  excluding the date of actual
payment.  192  192      3.4.2 Where the Transferred Relevant Benefit is
transferring to a  funded Purchaser\'s Group Plan, the Purchaser shall pay
any  amount received under PARAGRAPH 3.4.1 into that Plan.   3.4.3 Any such
payment into the Purchaser\'s Group Plan shall be  made:   (a) promptly on
receipt by the Purchaser of the amount  paid under PARAGRAPH 3.4.1; or  
(b) to the extent necessary so as to ensure the maximum  degree of tax relief
reasonably available is  obtainable for the payment, in instalments over a 
period expiring on or before the third anniversary of  the Completion
Date.   3.4.4 If the payment to the Purchaser\'s Group Plan is made in 
instalments, the Purchaser shall increase the amount to be  paid in by an
amount calculated as if it were interest at the  Agreed Rate (accrued daily
and compounded monthly) on an  amount equal to the unpaid instalment for the
period from and  including the date of payment under PARAGRAPH 3.4.1 to and 
excluding the date of payment to the Purchaser\'s Group Plan.  3.5 3.5.1 (a)
In relation to any Transferred Relevant Benefits in a  particular country, no
Shortfall shall be payable  under this PARAGRAPH 3 until the Shortfalls have
been  established in relation to all of the Transferred  Relevant Benefits
in that country.   (b) PARAGRAPH 3.5.1(a) shall not apply in respect of
the  Transferred Relevant Benefits under a Sellers\' Group  Plan to which
PARAGRAPH 7 applies.   (c) The country in respect of which a Transferred 
Relevant Benefit arises shall be determined by  reference to the country
listed in the Actuarial  Annex against the Relevant Sellers\' Group Plan in 
question. In relation to the Netherlands, any  Shortfall calculated by
reference to PARAGRAPH 16  shall be disregarded for the purposes of this 
PARAGRAPH 3.5.   3.5.2 An account shall then be taken of the Shortfalls
arising under  this PARAGRAPH 3 to which PARAGRAPH 3.5.1(a) applies in 
respect of the Transferred Relevant Benefits in the country in  question as
at such date as may be agreed  193  193     between the Sellers and the
Purchaser for that country, or in  default of agreement, as at the last day
of the calendar month  following the calendar month in which the last of
such  Shortfalls has been determined (the "CALCULATION DATE" for  that
country). For this purpose, the reference to the date of  actual payment in
PARAGRAPH 3.4.1 shall be construed as a  reference to the Calculation
Date.   3.5.3 No Shortfall shall be payable in relation to a country
unless  the aggregate net amount of any Shortfalls in that country  exceeds
E25,000.  3.7 Where a transfer of assets is made from a Sellers\' Group Plan
to a  Purchaser\'s Group Plan by instalments, the preceding provisions of
this  PARAGRAPH 3 shall be applied with such changes as the parties may
agree  to be fair to preserve the time value of the transferred assets as
at  the Completion Date or, in default of agreement, as may be determined 
under PARAGRAPH 9.  3.8   3.8.1 In this PARAGRAPH 3.8:   A represents
the amount of monthly contribution a Pensionable  Employee could have been
required to contribute to a Sellers\'  Group Plan under the provisions of
that Plan in force  immediately prior to the Completion Date but for any
surplus  or deficit in that Plan; and   B represents the amount (if any) of
monthly compulsory  contribution he pays to the Sellers\' Group Plan in
question at  the Completion Date.   3.8.2 where A exceeds B in relation to
a Pensionable Employee under  any Sellers\' Group Plan, the value as at
Completion of (A-B)  for the period of 1 year from the Completion Date shall
be  deemed to be a Transferred Relevant Benefit for the purposes  of
PARAGRAPH 3.  3.9 The aggregate Value of the Transferred Relevant Benefits
of all  Transferred Employees under a Relevant Sellers\' Group Plan shall not
be  less than the aggregate of the value of the statutory minimum transfer 
value as at Completion applicable to all Transferred Employees under  that
Relevant Sellers\' Group Plan.  194  194       PROVISION OF
BENEFITS  4. BENEFITS TO BE PROVIDED BY THE PURCHASER  4.1 4.1.1 In
relation to each Pensionable Employee and each Potential  Employee (as
defined in Clause 17) who becomes an employee of  the Purchaser\'s Group on
or after Completion ("FURTHER  EMPLOYEES"), the Purchaser will continue to
provide or procure  to be provided equivalent Benefits in respect of
service:   (a) prior to the Completion Date; and   (b) for the period of 3
years on and after the Completion  Date,   to the Benefits of that
Pensionable Employee immediately prior  to the Completion Date under a
Disclosed Sellers\' Group Plan  or, in the case of a Further Employee, under
a Sellers\' Group  Plan whether or not a Disclosed Sellers\' Group Plan and 
payable, subject to PARAGRAPH 4.2, as of right.   4.1.2 Subject to PARAGRAPH
4.7, the obligation under PARAGRAPH  4.1.1(a) shall not apply to Benefits of
a Pensionable Employee  which remain to be provided by a Sellers\' Group Plan
or a  member of the Sellers\' Group.  4.2 4.2.1 Where there is an
established practice as to the exercise of  discretions in relation to
Benefits which, in the case of a  material established practice under a
Principal Fund (as  defined in paragraph 45 of Schedule 3) is referred to in
the  Disclosure Letter, the Purchaser shall make an announcement  which is
in form and substance to the reasonable satisfaction  of the Sellers that it
will, subject to PARAGRAPH 4.2.2,  continue that practice in relation to the
Benefits at  PARAGRAPH 4.1.1(a) and (b).   4.2.2 The Purchaser shall,
subject to applicable law, have the same  rights of variation and
discontinuance of that practice as the  relevant member of the Sellers\'
Group has immediately prior to  the Completion Date.  4.3 Subject to
PARAGRAPH 4.2 of PART 2, the Purchaser shall procure that,  in the
satisfaction of its obligation under PARAGRAPH 4.1.1(b),  compulsory
contributions shall not be payable by a Pensionable  Employee, except to the
extent otherwise expressly  195  195     agreed in writing by that
Pensionable Employee, at a rate greater than  the rate (if any) at which:  
(a) he pays compulsory contributions at the Completion Date, for a  period of
1 year from the Completion Date; and   (b) he could have been required to
contribute to the Sellers\'  Group Plan in question under the provisions of
that Plan in  force immediately prior to the Completion Date but for any 
surplus or deficit in that Plan, for the remainder of the  period referred to
in PARAGRAPH 4.1.1(b) after the expiry of  the period in (a) above.  4.4
The Purchaser shall procure that admission of a Pensionable Employee to  the
applicable Purchaser\'s Group Plan is not conditional on his  consenting to
the transfer of his Benefits in any Sellers\' Group Plan  in respect of his
past service.  4.5 If the Purchaser or a member of the Purchaser\'s Group
disposes of a  member of the Purchaser\'s Group or all or any part of the
business  thereof, the Purchaser shall procure that the buyer concerned
honours  the obligations under PARAGRAPH 4.1 to 4.4 in respect of each 
Pensionable Employee concerned in such a disposal.  4.6 For the purpose of
PARAGRAPHS 4.1 to 4.5:   (a) "EQUIVALENT" means with an equivalent or
greater Value  provided that if, in any case, the Sellers and the Purchaser 
consider that the application of PARAGRAPH 2 would not be  appropriate for
the purposes of determining such Value for the  purposes of this PARAGRAPH 4,
PARAGRAPH 2.2(c) shall apply to  determine the actuarial method and
assumptions to be used for  determining equivalent Value whether or not
PARAGRAPHS 2.2(a)  or (b) apply;   (b) equivalent Benefits in respect of
the service of each  Pensionable Employee for the period referred to in
PARAGRAPH  4.1 must vest on the same or shorter timescale and at least in 
the same circumstances as if the Employee concerned had  continued to be an
active member of the Sellers\' Group Plan in  question;   (c)(i) equivalent
Benefits in respect of service prior to and on and  after the Completion Date
must, in addition to satisfying (a)  above, also be of a type and form
approved by the Sellers,  such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. For  this purpose, it is agreed that  196  196     it will
normally be reasonable for the Sellers not to approve  money purchase
benefits in place of Benefits which are of a  defined benefit type, subject
to the remaining provisions of  this PARAGRAPH 4.6(c);   (ii) without
prejudice to the Purchaser\'s obligations under  PARAGRAPHS 4.6(b) and (e),
if, immediately prior to the  Completion Date, no employee of the
Purchaser\'s Group in  Belgium is entitled to Benefits of a defined benefit
type in  respect of any period of his employment, the Sellers shall  approve
money purchase benefits in place of Benefits which are  of a defined benefit
type in relation to each Pensionable  Employee in Belgium provided that:  
(aa) in relation to each month of service on and after the  Completion Date,
the employer contribution rate for  equivalent money purchase benefits must
not be less  than the aggregate of:   - the Sellers\' Accounting Cost in

benefits replace; plus   - in relation to the period of 1 year from the 
Completion Date, (A-B), where:   A represents the amount of monthly

monthly  contribution he could have been  required to contribute to the 
Sellers\' Group plan in question  under the provisions of that Plan  in
force immediately  197  197     prior to the Completion Date but for
any  surplus or deficit in that Plan; and   D represents the amount (if
any) of monthly  compulsory contribution he pays to the  Purchaser\'s Group
Plan from time to time  during that period;   (bb) in relation to service
prior to the Completion Date,  the transfer of his Benefits under a Sellers\'
Group  Plan to a Purchaser\'s Group Plan shall be subject to  the consent of
the Pensionable Employee concerned;   (cc) in relation to service prior to
the Completion Date,  the Sellers and the Purchaser shall use their 
respective reasonable endeavours to agree a treatment  of the Benefits in
respect of each such Pensionable  Employee that will afford effective
preservation of  defined benefit rights without loss of value to that 
Pensionable Employee;   (dd) to the extent the Benefits to be provided in
respect  of any Pensionable Employee in Belgium are not agreed  in
accordance with (cc) above, (ee) below shall  apply;   (ee) in relation to
service prior to the Completion Date,  equivalent Benefits in respect of each
such  Pensionable Employee as at the Completion Date shall  not be less than
the Sellers\' Accounting Value as at  the Completion Date of the Benefits
applicable in  relation to that Pensionable Employee (the "ASSESSED  VALUE")
which shall be provided by the Purchaser  procuring that an amount equal to
the amount by which  the Assessed Value exceeds the Value of that 
Transferred Employee\'s Transferred Relevant Benefit  is credited to that
Transferred Employee\'s money  purchase account under the relevant
Purchaser\'s Group  Plan with effect from the Completion Date (with an 
appropriate adjustment to reflect the time value of  money in respect of the
period from the Completion  Date to the date on which the credit is
made);   (iii) without prejudice to the Purchaser\'s obligations under 
paragraphs 4.6(b) and (e), if, immediately prior to the  Completion Date, no
employee of the Purchaser\'s Group in  Ireland is entitled to Benefits of a
defined benefit type in  respect of any period of his employment, the Sellers
shall  approve money purchase benefits in place of  198  198    
Benefits which are of a defined benefit type in relation to  each Pensionable
Employee in Ireland provided that:   (aa) in relation to each month of
service on and after the  Completion Date, the employer contribution rate
for  equivalent money purchase benefits must not be less  than the aggregate
of:   - the Sellers\' Accounting Cost in respect of  the Benefits of a
defined benefit type which  the money purchase benefits replace; plus   -
in relation to the period of 1 year from the  Completion Date, (A-B),
where:   A represents the amount of monthly  contribution he could have
been  required to contribute to the  Sellers\' Group plan in question 
under the provisions of that Plan  in force immediately prior to the 
Completion Date but for any surplus  or deficit in that Plan; and   B
represents the amount (if any) of  monthly compulsory contribution he  pays
to the Sellers\' Group plan in  question at the Completion Date; or   -

PARAGRAPH 4.1.1(b)  after the expiry of the period of 1 year  from the
Completion Date, (C-D), where:   C represents the amount of monthly 
contribution he could have been  required to contribute to the  Sellers\'
Group plan in question  under the provisions of that Plan  in force

Purchaser\'s Group Plan shall be subject to  the consent of the Pensionable
Employee concerned;  199  199      (cc) in relation to service prior to
the Completion Date,  the Sellers and the Purchaser shall use their 
respective reasonable endeavours to agree a treatment  of the Benefits in
respect of each such Pensionable  Employee that will afford effective
preservation of  defined benefit rights without loss of value to that 
Pensionable Employee;   (dd) to the extent the Benefits to be provided in
respect  of any Pensionable Employee in Ireland are not agreed  in
accordance with (cc) above, (ee) below shall  apply;   (ee) in relation to
service prior to the Completion Date,  equivalent Benefits in respect of each
such  Pensionable Employee shall be determined in  accordance with PARAGRAPH
4.6(a);   (iv) For the purpose of this PARAGRAPH 4.6(c), "EQUIVALENT"
shall  relate to Benefits exclusive of administration costs and the  Sellers
and the Purchaser agree to operate the provisions of  this PARAGRAPH 4.6(c)
in accordance with that principle.   (v) For the purpose of this PARAGRAPH
4.6:   "SELLERS\' ACCOUNTING COST" means the cost, expressed  as a
percentage of pensionable pay, calculated in  accordance with the latest
actuarial method and  assumptions used for Sellers\' Group accounting 
purposes prior to Completion, in respect of the  period of 12 months
immediately prior to Completion  divided by 12 on the assumption that the
Sellers\'  Group Plan concerned is neither in surplus nor in  deficit or

provided that  the provisions of PARAGRAPH 9 shall not apply in the  event
that there is no such agreement; and   "SELLERS\' ACCOUNTING VALUE" means
the present capital  value as at the Completion Date calculated in 
accordance with the latest actuarial method and  assumptions used for
Sellers\' Group accounting  purposes prior to Completion or calculated on

Benefits from a Relevant Sellers\'  SERA Plan will be made in accordance with
PARAGRAPH 13 and the  Purchaser must procure that the Purchaser\'s Group Plan

service after the Completion Date which are equivalent to  Benefits under a
Relevant Sellers\' SERA Plan is, to the extent  permitted by law, funded;  
(e) where Benefits are provided under a Disclosed Sellers\' Group  Plan on
the death or disability of a Pensionable Employee or  his spouse, child or
dependant, equivalent Benefits must be  provided on such events which are

had the death or disability occurred whilst the beneficiary  was a
beneficiary of the Disclosed Sellers\' Group Plan in  question under the
provisions of that Plan in force  immediately prior to the Completion
Date;   (f) any announcement to be issued by the Sellers or a member of 
the Purchaser\'s Group in relation to Benefits the subject of  this PARAGRAPH

Purchaser, shall  provide to the other a copy of the intended announcement
and  shall not issue it without prior consultation with the other.  4.7
4.7.1 This PARAGRAPH 4.7 applies, and PARAGRAPH 4.1.2 does not  apply:  
(a) if, in respect of any Relevant Sellers\' Group Plan,  the Purchaser does
not comply with the provisions of  PARAGRAPH 13.2(d); and   (b) in respect
of the SUPS in Sweden and Polaris (Section  A) in Finland.   4.7.2 Subject

is made from a Relevant Sellers\' Group  Plan in respect of a Pensionable
Employee, PARAGRAPH 4.7.2  shall be modified in such manner as the Sellers
and the  Purchaser agree to be fair and reasonable in respect of that 
Pensionable Employee, or in default of agreement as determined  under
PARAGRAPH 9.   4.7.4 Where PARAGRAPH 7 applies in relation to the Relevant
Sellers\'  Group Plan concerned, for the purposes of this PARAGRAPH 4.7  the
reference in PARAGRAPH 4.1(a) to the Completion Date shall  be replaced by a
reference to the day immediately after the  termination of pensionable
service of the Pensionable Employee  concerned in that Relevant Sellers\'
Group Plan.  4.8 The Purchaser\'s agreement to the provisions of this
PARAGRAPH 4 is  given by the Purchaser on the express understanding that, if
the  Purchaser is in breach of any of such provisions, the Sellers may, at 
their absolute discretion, and without limitation, seek to procure 
compliance with such provisions by the Purchaser by applying to the  court
for damages and/or specific performance.  5. BENEFITS TO BE PROVIDED BY THE
SELLERS   The Sellers confirm that they or the appropriate  Sellers\' Group
Plan will retain all liabilities to  provide Benefits for or in respect of
any person who  is not an Employee as at the Completion Date (save to  the
extent that the Purchaser is obliged, in  accordance with the remainder of
this Schedule, to  provide or procure the provision of Benefits for or  in
respect of any person who is not an Employee but  which Benefits arise in
respect of a Pensionable  Employee).  6. EXPATRIATE EMPLOYEES   The
general principles to be applied in relation to  those Pensionable Employees
who are employed in the  European Culinary Brands Business as at the 
Completion Date in a country which is not their home  country ("EXPATRIATES")
are that:  202  202      (a) the Purchaser shall provide or procure the
provision of  Benefits to Expatriates in accordance with the terms promised 
to those Expatriates by the Sellers;   (b) the Sellers and the Purchaser
shall, in relation to each such  Expatriate, agree the most appropriate and
cost effective way  for those Benefits to be provided having regard to
applicable  laws and tax regimes;   (c) to the extent Benefits in respect
of Expatriates are  transferred to the Purchaser\'s Group or a Purchaser\'s
Group  Plan, the provisions of PARAGRAPHS 1, 2, 3 and 10 shall apply  to
such transferred Benefits as if they were Transferred  Relevant Benefits. 
203  203       INTERIM ARRANGEMENTS  7. CONTINUED PARTICIPATION IN
SELLERS\' GROUP PLANS  7.1 The Sellers shall use their reasonable endeavours
to procure that,  subject to the approval or consent of any regulatory body
or third  party which may be necessary, Pensionable Employees accruing
Benefits  immediately prior to Completion under:   (a) the UPF (as defined
in PART 2 of this document);   (b) 1999 SERA (as defined in PART 2 of this
document);   (c) the Unilever Superannuation (Ireland) Fund; or   (d) such
other Sellers\' Group Plans as the Sellers and the  Purchaser may agree in
writing,   are permitted to continue such accrual, and that the Purchaser,
or the  relevant Purchaser\'s Group company, is admitted to participation,
in  the appropriate Sellers\' Group Plan for:   - except in the case of the
UPF, such temporary period after the  Completion Date as may be agreed
between the Purchaser and the  Sellers, such period not to exceed six months;
and   - in the case of the UPF, for the period of 12 months after the 
Completion Date, or such lesser period as may be agreed  between the
Purchaser and the Sellers..   This PARAGRAPH 7 applies in relation to the
continuing accrual of  Benefits by a Pensionable Employee pursuant to such
permission.  7.2 The Purchaser shall procure that it or, if applicable, the
member of  the Purchaser\'s Group which participates in the Sellers\' Group
Plan,  pays to the Sellers\' Group Plan:   (a) contributions in respect of
the Regular Pension Cost of that  continued accrual until its termination
which shall be paid on  the same date or dates as they would otherwise
normally have  been paid but for Completion (and but for any surplus or 
deficit); and   (b) in respect of any contributions which are paid after the
due  date referred to in (a) above, an amount calculated as if it  were
interest on those contributions at the Agreed Local  Interest Rate (accrued
daily and compounded monthly)  204  204     for the period from and
including the due date to and  excluding the date of actual payment.  7.3
The "REGULAR PENSION COST" in respect of the accrual of a Pensionable 
Employee\'s Benefit during a period is the regular cost of that Benefit 
determined by reference to the actuarial method and assumptions  referred to
in PARAGRAPH 2 (but excluding paragraph 2.3.2) before any  reduction to take
account of any surplus and before any increase to  take account of any
deficit. For the avoidance of doubt, such regular  cost shall include an
amount in respect of the insurance or self  insurance of risk benefits and
administration expenses.  7.4 The Sellers may waive any obligation of the
Purchaser under PARAGRAPH  7.2.  7.5 The Sellers shall use their reasonable
endeavours to procure that, if a  Transferred Employee has Transferred
Relevant Benefits in respect of a  Sellers\' Group Plan in respect of which
this PARAGRAPH 7 applies, the  Sellers\' Group Plan shall transfer to the
relevant funded Purchaser\'s  Group Plan an amount equal to:   (a)
contributions in respect of that Transferred Employee which  have been paid
under PARAGRAPH 7.2; less   (b) a reasonable deduction to reflect the cost
of insuring or  self-insuring any risk benefits after the Completion Date
and  a reasonable deduction in respect of administration expenses  after the
Completion Date in each case, unless specified in  the Actuarial Annex, as
agreed between the Sellers and the  Purchaser (or in default of agreement as
determined under  PARAGRAPH 9),   such net contributions being adjusted in
accordance with the Agreed  Local Adjustment Rate from and including the
respective actual date of  payment of the same to and excluding the date of
actual payment of the  transfer amount, or the date on which the Shortfall is
determined in  relation to the Sellers\' Group Plan in question (the
"RELEVANT DATE").  7.6 To the extent the net contributions referred to in
PARAGRAPH 7.5 are  not transferred to the relevant funded Purchaser\'s Group
Plan, the  provisions of PARAGRAPH 3 shall apply mutatis mutandis, except
that any  Gross Shortfall shall be determined as at the Relevant Date,
rather  than the Completion Date, and PARAGRAPH 3 shall be interpreted 
accordingly for the purpose of this PARAGRAPH 7.6.  205  205     8. NO
INCREASE IN REGULAR PENSION COST OR LIABILITIES  8.1 With effect from the
Completion Date, neither the Purchaser nor any  member of the Purchaser\'s
Group will, without the prior written consent  of the Sellers, take any
action or exercise or permit the exercise of  any right, power or discretion
which would have the consequence of  increasing the cost to a member of the
Sellers\' Group or to any  Sellers\' Group Plan in respect of the Benefits of
any Pensionable  Employee (or former employee or any one claiming through or
by  reference to any Pensionable Employee or former employee) whether as a 
result of creating new liabilities or increasing existing liabilities  in a
Sellers\' Group Plan or otherwise, save that the annual pensionable  salary
of any Pensionable Employee may be increased by up to the  percentage (pro-
rated to reflect the length of the period referred to  in PARAGRAPH 7.1)
assumed for annual pensionable salary increases in  the actuarial assumptions
referred to in PARAGRAPH 2 (the "MAXIMUM  ANNUAL RATE") (such percentage
being reduced by the percentage amount  of any increase awarded since the
last annual pensionable salary  increase awarded prior to the Completion
Date) or such greater  percentage agreed in writing by the Sellers and the
Purchaser.  8.2 The Sellers shall use all reasonable endeavours to ensure
that during  and in respect of the period referred to in PARAGRAPH 7.1:  
(i) no Sellers\' Group Plan referred to in PARAGRAPH 7.1 shall be  terminated
or lose any tax favoured status which it may have  prior to Completion;  
(ii) no amendments to any such Plan shall be made which will  diminish or
otherwise affect the benefits of the Pensionable  Employees;   (iii) no
amendments to any such Plan shall be made which would  increase the
obligations of the Purchaser (or relevant member  of the Purchaser\'s Group,
as the case may be);   without the prior written agreement of the
Purchaser.  8.3 The Purchaser\'s agreement referred to in PARAGRAPH 8.2
shall not be  unreasonably withheld or delayed and if withheld or delayed in
relation  to any Sellers\' Group Plan the Sellers shall be entitled to
specify by  not less than two months\' written notice to the Purchaser that
the  period referred to in PARAGRAPH 7.1 in respect of that Sellers\' Group 
Plan shall terminate on such date as shall be specified in said notice.  
206  206    DISPUTES  9. DISPUTES  9.1 Any dispute between the Sellers
and the Purchaser or between the  Sellers\' Actuary and the Purchaser\'s
Actuary concerning the  determination or valuation or agreement of any matter
to be  specifically determined, valued or agreed under this Schedule shall,
in  the absence of agreement between them, be referred to an independent 
actuary agreed by the Sellers and the Purchaser or, failing such  agreement,
appointed by the President for the time being of the  Institute of Actuaries
in England at the request of the party first  applying. In any such case, the
independent actuary shall be a person  who possesses appropriate expertise in
relation to the jurisdiction in  respect of which the matter has
arisen.  9.2 Such independent actuary shall act as an expert and not as an 
arbitrator. His decision shall be final and binding on the parties and  his
expenses shall be borne as the independent actuary may direct.     207

this PARAGRAPH 10.1:   (a) "RELEVANT CLAIM" means a claim brought by or on
behalf of a  Relevant Person which relates to Benefits attributable to any 
period of employment prior to the Completion Date or, if  later, if PARAGRAPH
7 applies, the date pensionable service in  a Sellers\' Group Plan ends,
under a Disclosed Sellers\' Group  Plan in respect of which a transfer of
Relevant Benefits has  been made to the Purchaser\'s Group or a Purchaser\'s
Group  Plan, save that no claim in respect of Relevant Benefits on  the
grounds that a Relevant Person was denied access to a  Sellers\' Group Plan
prior to the Completion Date shall  constitute a Relevant Claim.   (b)
"RELEVANT PERSON" means any person who is a Pensionable  Employee (or any
person whose benefits arise on the death of  such a Pensionable Employee) or
a former employee and those  whose benefits arise on the death of such former

Purchaser\'s Group or a Purchaser\'s Group  Plan.   (c) "LIABILITY" means
any liability, loss, damage, cost, claim or  reasonable expense arising out
of or in connection with any  Relevant Claim.   10.1.2 The Purchaser
covenants with the Sellers to pay to the Sellers  forthwith upon demand an
amount equal to any Liability which  is incurred or sustained by the Sellers,
any member of the  Sellers\' Group or a Sellers\' Group Plan arising out of
or in  connection with any Relevant Claim brought by a Relevant  Person.  
10.1.3 Insofar as any Liability relates to the value of any Relevant 
Benefits, the amount of such Liability shall be calculated  using such
reasonable actuarial method and assumptions as may  be agreed between the
Sellers and Purchaser or, in default of  agreement, as may be determined in
accordance with PARAGRAPH  9.   10.1.4 Where any Liability is determined in
a currency other than  Euros it shall be converted into Euros at the
Agreed   208  208     Payment Date Exchange Rate at the date of payment
by the  Purchaser.   10.1.5 The time value of the amount payable under
PARAGRAPH 10.1.2  shall be maintained by increasing it by an amount
calculated  as if it were interest at the Agreed Local Interest Rate 
(accrued daily and compounded monthly) on the amount under  PARAGRAPH 10.1.2
for the period from the date as at which the  amount of the Liability has
been quantified to the date of  payment of the amount in question to the
Sellers.   10.1.6 (a) Subject to PARAGRAPH 10.1.6(c), any Relevant Claim 
against the Sellers shall constitute a claim giving  rise to a claim for
indemnification for the purposes  of CLAUSE 31 of this Agreement, which shall
take  effect accordingly.   (b) If a Relevant Claim is made against the
trustees or  administrators of a Sellers\' Group Plan, the Sellers  shall,
to the extent that they may lawfully do so,  direct (and will otherwise use
reasonable endeavours  to persuade) such trustees or administrators to 
comply with the terms of CLAUSE 31 of this Agreement.    10.2 10.2.1 For
the purposes of this PARAGRAPH 10.2:   (a) "RELEVANT CLAIM" means a claim
brought by or on behalf of a  Relevant Person which relates to Benefits

Relevant Benefits has not been made to the Purchaser\'s  Group or a
Purchaser\'s Group Plan.   (b) "RELEVANT PERSON" means any person who is a
Pensionable  Employee (or any person whose benefits arise on the death of

Purchaser forthwith upon demand an amount equal to any  Liability which is
incurred or sustained by the Purchaser or  any member of the Purchaser\'s
Group arising out of or in  connection with any Relevant Claim brought by a
Relevant  Person.   10.2.3 Insofar as any Liability relates to the value of
any Relevant  Benefits, the amount of such Liability shall be calculated 
using such reasonable actuarial method and assumptions as may  be agreed
between the Sellers and Purchaser or, in default of  agreement, as may be
determined in accordance with PARAGRAPH  9.   10.3   10.3.1 This
PARAGRAPH 10.3 applies if and to the extent  that, as a result of the
Purchaser or relevant member  of the Purchaser\'s Group ceasing to employ
persons in  the description or category of employment to which  the UPF or
the Unilever Superannuation (Ireland) Fund  (the "US(I)F") relates as a
result of the sale of the  European Culinary Brands Business, a debt becomes
due  from the Purchaser or relevant member of the  Purchaser\'s Group to the
UPF under section 75 of the  Pensions Act 1995 or to the US(I)F under a
provision  of Irish legislation with equivalent effect and the  UPF or the
US(I)F as the case may be notifies the  Purchaser or relevant member of the
Purchaser\'s Group  that it requires payment of that debt.   10.3.2 Where
this PARAGRAPH 10.3 applies, the Sellers  undertake to indemnify the
Purchaser and each member  of the Purchaser\'s Group against the amount of
such  debt.   10.4 The Sellers will indemnify the Purchaser and each member
of  the Purchaser\'s Group against any liability to provide  Relevant
Benefits on the grounds that an employee of the  European Culinary Brands
Business who becomes employed by the  Purchaser\'s Group with effect from
Completion was denied  access to a Sellers\' Group Plan prior to the
Completion Date  to the extent such claim relates to the period prior to
the  Completion Date.   10.5 10.5.1 This PARAGRAPH 10.5 applies in relation
to PARAGRAPHS  10.2, 10.3 and 10.4.   10.5.2 Where any liability is
determined in a currency other  than Euros it shall be converted into Euros
at the  Agreed  210  210     Payment Date Exchange Rate at the date of
payment by the  Sellers.   10.5.3 The time value of the amount payable
shall be maintained by  increasing it by an amount calculated as if it were
interest  at the Agreed Local Interest Rate (accrued daily and  compounded
monthly) on the amount for the period from the date  as at which the amount
of the liability has been quantified to  the date of payment of the amount in
question to the  Purchaser.   10.5.4 Any claim against the Purchaser shall
constitute a claim  giving rise to a claim for indemnification for the
purposes of  CLAUSE 31 of this Agreement, which shall take effect 
accordingly.   10.5.5 The provisions of paragraphs 4 to 9 inclusive and
paragraph 12  of Schedule 4 to the Agreement shall apply with respect to
any  claim as though references therein to claims for breach of  Warranty
were references to claims under PARAGRAPHS 10.2, 10.3  and/or 10.4, as the
case may be.   10.5.6 No claim shall be brought against the Sellers or
either of  them under PARAGRAPH 10.4 unless the Purchaser shall have  given
to the Sellers written notice of such claim giving  reasonable detail thereof
on or before the tenth anniversary  of the Completion Date, provided that the
liability of the  Sellers in respect of such claim shall absolutely
terminate  (if such claim has not been previously satisfied, settled or 
withdrawn) if legal proceedings in respect of such claim shall  not have been
commenced within six months of the tenth  anniversary of the Completion Date
and for this purpose  proceedings shall not be deemed to have been commenced
unless  they shall have been properly issued and validly served upon  the
Sellers.   OTHER ISSUES  11. TRANSFERS OF ASSETS FROM A FUNDED SELLERS\'
GROUP PLAN  11.1 The Purchaser undertakes to take no action and to give no
assistance  (and to procure that no member of the Purchaser\'s Group does
so)  whether directly or indirectly to any person in any manner which would 
or might result in a Sellers\' Group Plan from which a transfer of  assets is
made to a Purchaser\'s Group Plan having to transfer more than  the amount
which is such that the Relevant Benefits which transfer to  the Purchaser\'s
Group  211  211     Plan are Fully Financed, adjusted in accordance with
the remaining  provisions of this PART 1.  11.2 If any assets are
transferred from a Sellers\' Group Plan to a  Purchaser\'s Group Plan after
the transfer of assets taken into account  in determining whether the
Relevant Benefits which transfer from that  Sellers\' Group Plan to that
Purchaser\'s Group Plan are Fully Financed,  and if that further transfer of
assets arises in respect of the  transfer of the same Relevant Benefits, the
Purchaser shall promptly  pay to the Sellers an amount in Euros equal to:  
(a) the value of the further assets transferred multiplied by the  Tax
Adjustment Factor; plus   (b) an amount calculated as if it were interest at
the Agreed Rate  (accrued daily and compounded monthly) on an amount equal
to  (a) above for the period from and including the date of  transfer to and
excluding the date of payment.   No payment shall be due from the Purchaser
under this PARAGRAPH 11.2  unless the Sellers have used all reasonable
endeavours to procure that  no transfer of assets as described in this
PARAGRAPH 11.2 takes place.  11.3 For the purposes of PARAGRAPH 11.2:  
(a) the value of the assets shall be calculated on a basis  consistent with
the foregoing provisions of this document and  shall be agreed between the
Sellers and the Purchaser and, in  default of agreement, determined under
PARAGRAPH 9; and   (b) if the value of the further assets transferred is
determined  in a currency other than Euros it shall be converted into  Euros
at the Agreed Payment Date Exchange Rate at the date of  the further transfer
of assets.  12. POSITION WHERE RELEVANT BENEFITS ARE SPLIT  12.1 Where the
Relevant Benefits of a Pensionable Employee are in part  transferred to a
Purchaser\'s Group Plan or a member of the Purchaser\'s  Group and in part
retained by a member of the Sellers\' Group or a  Sellers\' Group Plan, this
PART 1 shall apply separately to the Relevant  Benefits which transfer and to
the Relevant Benefits which do not  transfer. This is to the intent that it
is only the Relevant Benefits  which transfer which are to be Fully Financed
and so to be dealt with  under PARAGRAPHS 1,  212  212     2 and 3 and
that, in calculating whether they are Fully Financed, a  deduction will be
made, calculated in accordance with PARAGRAPH 2, from  the entire Relevant
Benefits of the Transferred Employee in respect of  those Benefits which do
not transfer.  12.2 Where PARAGRAPH 12.1 applies, the remaining provisions
of this PART 1  shall be modified accordingly.  13. TRANSFER OF RELEVANT
BENEFITS  13.1 Where any transfer of Relevant Benefits or assets in respect
of those  Relevant Benefits requires the approval or consent of any
regulatory  body or any third party (including the Pensionable Employees),
the  Sellers and the Purchaser shall use their respective reasonable 
endeavours to obtain such approvals and consents.  13.2 In relation to the
transfer to a Purchaser\'s Group Plan of Relevant  Benefits provided under a
funded Sellers\' Group Plan or a Relevant  Sellers\' SERA Plan:   (a) the
Sellers shall use their reasonable endeavours to procure that:   (i) a
transfer of assets is made from that funded  Sellers\' Group Plan; or  
(ii) in the case of a Relevant Sellers\' SERA Plan, to the  extent permitted
by law and the provisions of the  Relevant Sellers\' SERA Plan in question,
from, at the  Sellers\' option:   - a funded Sellers\' Group Plan;   - by
a transfer from the Sellers to a  Purchaser\'s Group Plan; and/or   - by a
transfer from the Sellers to the  Purchaser which the Purchaser shall, on 
receipt of any such amount, promptly pay  into such Plan;   (b) the
Purchaser shall use its reasonable endeavours to procure  that the
Purchaser\'s Group Plan:   (i) has all necessary powers, approvals and
consents to  accept that transfer; and  213  213      (ii) accepts
that transfer;   (c) the Sellers and the Purchaser shall use their
respective  reasonable endeavours to procure that the transfer takes place 
promptly after the valuation in PARAGRAPH 2 has been  completed. The date of
transfer shall be agreed by the Sellers  and the Purchaser (or, in default of
agreement, determined  under PARAGRAPH 9); and   (d) no transfer shall take
place unless:   (i) the Purchaser produces evidence as to the adequacy of 
the funding of the Purchaser\'s Group Plan which is to  the reasonable
satisfaction of the Sellers, and the  Purchaser must procure that the funding
of the  Purchaser\'s Group Plan is to the reasonable  satisfaction of the
Sellers; or   (ii) the Purchaser agrees to amend the provisions of the 
Purchaser\'s Group Plan in such a way, which is to the  reasonable
satisfaction of the Sellers, that  ring-fences the liabilities and assets in
relation to  the Transferred Employees from all other liabilities  and
assets of the Purchaser\'s Group Plan both on an  ongoing basis and on a
termination or winding-up of  the Purchaser\'s Group Plan.   The
Purchaser\'s obligation under this PARAGRAPH 13.2(d) shall  include an
obligation to amend the relevant Purchaser\'s Group  Plan or, to the extent
that is not within the control of the  Purchaser\'s Group, to establish or
make available an  alternative Purchaser\'s Group Plan.   For the purpose
of this PARAGRAPH 13.2(d), the funding of a  Purchaser\'s Group Plan shall be
deemed to be to the reasonable  satisfaction of the Sellers:   - if, on the
basis of such reasonable actuarial method  and assumptions as are proposed by
the Sellers\'  Actuary and agreed by the Purchaser\'s Actuary, the  assets
of the Purchaser\'s Group Plan are at least  equal to its liabilities as at
the date in question.  In default of agreement between the Sellers\'
Actuary  and the Purchaser\'s Actuary the provisions of  PARAGRAPH 9 shall
apply; or  214  214      - the Purchaser\'s Actuary certifies to the
Sellers that  the Purchaser\'s Group Plan has no liabilities as at  the date
in question.  13.3 If:   (a) the proposed transfer does not receive the
approvals or  consents referred to in PARAGRAPH 13.1; or   (b) the
Purchaser\'s Group Plan does not have the necessary powers  or does not
accept the transfer as referred to in PARAGRAPH  13.2(b),   the Purchaser
will, without prejudice to its obligations under  PARAGRAPH 13.2, use its
reasonable endeavours to make such arrangements  (which may include amendment
of the relevant Purchaser\'s Group Plan or  the establishment or making
available of an alternative Purchaser\'s  Group Plan) to enable the proposed
transfer to take place.  13.4 13.4.1 Subject to PARAGRAPH 13.4.2, the
transfer of assets from a  funded Relevant Sellers\' Group Plan to a
Purchaser\'s Group  Plan shall be made by the transfer of a reasonable
cross  section of the assets of the Relevant Sellers\' Group Plan in 
question (as agreed by the Relevant Sellers\' Group Plan and  the
Purchaser\'s Group Plan).   13.4.2 For the avoidance of doubt, neither the
Sellers nor any  Relevant Sellers\' Group Plan shall be under any obligation
to  agree to transfer any assets other than cash in respect of the  Fully
Financing of Relevant Benefits to be transferred from  the Relevant Sellers\'
Group Plan.  14. VOLUNTARY FUND  14.1 In this PARAGRAPH 14 the expression
"VOLUNTARY FUND" means a fund  comprising those voluntary contributions, or
the investment or moneys  representing them and any income derived from them,
in respect of which  the entitlements of the members who have paid them are
not related to  earnings (however defined) but are based on the respective
parts of  such Voluntary Fund which are attributable to them.  14.2
Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this document, if within  any
Sellers\' Group Plan there is a Voluntary Fund, the Voluntary Fund  and the
benefits payable from it and the contributions payable to it  and any
transfer payment made from  215  215     it shall be disregarded for all
the preceding provisions of  this PART 1.  14.3 14.3.1 Where the company
being sold participates in a Relevant  Sellers\' Group Plan, the Sellers
shall use their reasonable  endeavours to procure that the part of the
Voluntary Fund  attributable to the Transferred Employees in question in 
accordance with the provisions of the Relevant Sellers\' Group  Plan is
transferred to the Purchaser\'s Group Plan at the same  time as the transfer
amount in respect of the Relevant  Benefits of those Transferred Employees in
the Relevant  Sellers\' Group Plan is transferred to the Purchaser\'s Group 
Plan.   14.3.2 The provisions of PARAGRAPH 14.3.1 shall apply, with any 
necessary changes, on the sale of a business where the  Relevant Benefits of
the Transferred Employees in question are  provided under a Relevant
Sellers\' Group Plan.  15. EMPLOYEES WHO BECOME EMPLOYEES OF THE SELLERS\'
GROUP AFTER THE  COMPLETION DATE  15.1 This PARAGRAPH 15 applies in respect
of any Pensionable Employee who:   (a) returns to the employment of the
Sellers\' Group within one  year after the Completion Date; or   (b) prior
to the Completion Date, is given the right to elect to  return to the
employment of the Sellers\' Group within a period  after the Completion Date
and who exercises that right.  15.2 The provisions of PARAGRAPHS 1, 2 AND 3
shall apply on the basis set  out in this PARAGRAPH 15, with such
modifications as the Sellers and  the Purchaser shall agree to be necessary,
in respect of the transfer  of the Benefits of the Pensionable Employee under
a Purchaser\'s Group  Plan which provides Benefits corresponding to the
Relevant Sellers\'  Group Plan in respect of which that Pensionable Employee
had Relevant  Benefits prior to the Completion Date ("RETURNED TRANSFERRED 
BENEFITS").  15.3 The Value of the Returned Transferred Benefits shall be
determined as  at the date of termination of employment of the Pensionable
Employee by  the Purchaser\'s Group by reference to pensionable service to
and  pensionable salary at that date.  216  216   15.4 The Value of the
Returned Transferred Benefits shall be reduced to the  extent the Benefits
under the corresponding Relevant Sellers\' Group  Plan referred to in
PARAGRAPH 15.2 have not been Fully Financed in  accordance with PARAGRAPH 2,
adjusted to reflect the gross amount of  any Shortfall paid under PARAGRAPH
3.  16. CHANGES TO PROGRESS PENSION FUND  16.1 The Sellers recognise that
certain changes are to be made to the  Benefits under the Progress Pension
Fund in the Netherlands (the  "PROGRESS FUND"). The principles underlying
these changes have been  announced to employees but the changes have not yet
been agreed in  detail and will not be implemented until after Completion. A
copy of  the announcement is comprised in the Data Room.  16.2 For the
purposes of this PARAGRAPH 16:    ~~   "ADDITIONAL PROGRESS BENEFITS"
means the improvements  to Benefits under the  Progress Fund which are 
made in accordance with  the announcement referred  to in PARAGRAPH
16.1;   "IMPLEMENTATION DATE" means the date as  from which the
Additional  Progress Benefits become  effective or such earlier  date as
the Sellers shall  notify to the Purchaser.   16.3 The Sellers and the
Purchaser shall apply the principles of this  Schedule in respect of the
Additional Progress Benefits to the effect  that:   (a) in respect of those
Pensionable Employees whose Relevant  Benefits have been transferred from the
Progress Fund to the  Purchaser\'s Group Plan, the Additional Progress
Benefits, to  the extent they relate to service completed prior to the 
Completion Date, shall be treated as Transferred Relevant  Benefits and the
provisions of PARAGRAPH 3 shall apply (and  those of PARAGRAPH 1.1 shall not
apply) in respect of such  Transferred Relevant Benefits;   (b) for this
purpose, the Value of the Additional Progress  Benefits treated as
Transferred Relevant Benefits shall  217  217     be determined in
accordance with PARAGRAPH 2 promptly after  the Implementation Date;   (c)
PARAGRAPH 4 shall apply as if the Additional Progress Benefits  had become
effective from the Completion Date, but this  PARAGRAPH 16.3(c) shall not
take effect until the  Implementation Date.  17. UNILEVER (IRELAND)
SUPERANNUATION FUND  17.1 The Sellers recognise that the claim referred to
at paragraph 48  (Ireland) of the Disclosure Letter may result in an
amendment to the  benefits provided under the Unilever (Ireland)
Superannuation Fund (the  "US(I)F") in relation to certain of the Pensionable
Employees; such an  amendment (if any) to the extent it results directly from
such a claim  is referred to in this PARAGRAPH 17 as the "US(I)F
EQUALISATION  AMENDMENT".  17.2 The Value of the Transferred Relevant
Benefit in relation to the US(I)F  will take into account the US(I)F
Equalisation Amendment in relation to  Transferred Employees to whom the
US(I)F Equalisation Amendment relates  if the US(I)F Equalisation Amendment
is made prior to the date on which  Transferred Assets are transferred from
the US(I)F to a Purchaser\'s  Group Plan.  17.3 If the US(I)F Equalisation
Amendment is made on or after the date on  which Transferred Assets are
transferred from the US(I)F to a  Purchaser\'s Group Plan, the Sellers and
the Purchaser shall apply the  principles of this Schedule in respect of the
additional Benefits  effected by the US(I)F Equalisation Amendment in respect
of the  Transferred Employees concerned to the effect that such additional 
Benefits, to the extent they relate to service completed prior to the 
Completion Date, shall be treated as Transferred Relevant Benefits and  the
provisions of PARAGRAPHS 1.1 and 3 shall apply in respect of such 
Transferred Relevant Benefits.  17.4 If, at any time, neither PARAGRAPH 17.2
or 17.3 apply, PARAGRAPH 10.2  shall apply as if the definitions of Relevant
Claim and Relevant Person  were deleted and replaced by the following:  
"RELEVANT CLAIM" means a claim brought by or on behalf of a Relevant  Person
which relates to Benefits attributable to any period of  employment prior to
the Completion Date under the US(I)F in relation to  the subject matter of
the claim referred to at paragraph 48 (Ireland)  of the Disclosure Letter;
and  218  218      "RELEVANT PERSON" means any person who is a
Pensionable Employee under  the US(I)F (or any person whose benefits arise on
the death of such a  Pensionable Employee).  219  219    PART 2 -
UK  PART 1 of this document applies to the Unilever Pension Fund and 1999
SERA subject to the modifications set out in this PART 2. To the extent there
is any inconsistency between PART 1 and this PART 2 in relation to the UPF or
1999 SERA, this PART 2 shall prevail.   FULLY FINANCING  1. TRANSFERRED
RELEVANT BENEFITS TO BE FULLY FINANCED  2. ACTUARIAL VALUATION  3.
SHORTFALL  3.1 If a Shortfall is determined in relation to any Transferred
Relevant  Benefit the Sellers shall, subject to PARAGRAPH 3.6 of PART 1,
promptly  pay to the Purchaser (by way of adjustment to the Final Cash 
Consideration) an amount in Euros equal to the aggregate of:   (a) that
Shortfall:   - adjusted in respect of the period from the  Completion Date
to 31st October, 2000 by  interest at the rate of 7.5 per cent. per  annum
to give its value at 31st October,  2000;   - divided by the Market
Adjustment Factor;   - adjusted in respect of the period from 31st 
October, 2000 to the Completion Date by  reference to the Agreed Local
Adjustment  Rate to give its value at the Completion  Date; plus   (b) an
amount calculated as if it were interest at the  Agreed Rate (accrued daily
and compounded monthly) on  an amount equal to the amount in (a) for the
period  from and including the Completion Date to and  excluding the date of
actual payment.  220  220     PROVISION OF BENEFITS  4. BENEFITS TO BE
PROVIDED BY THE PURCHASER  4.1 4.1.1 This PARAGRAPH 4.1 applies in respect
of Pensionable Employees  who have Benefits under the UPF.   4.1.2 The
Purchaser shall procure that the Purchaser\'s Group Plan  under which
Benefits are to be provided under PARAGRAPH 4 of  PART 1 to those Pensionable
Employees who have Benefits under  the UPF shall be contracted-out on the
basis specified in  Section 9(2B) of the Pension Schemes Act 1993 (as
amended) and  approved under Chapter I of Part XIV of the Income and 
Corporation Taxes Act 1988 by the Board of Inland Revenue.   4.1.3 In
determining whether Benefits under the Purchaser\'s Group  Plan are
"EQUIVALENT" to Benefits under the UPF, Benefits in  the UPF shall be deemed
to include, and Benefits to be  provided or procured to be provided by the
Purchaser shall for  the purposes of this Schedule be deemed to include:  
(a) a right to receive benefits unreduced from age 60   NOTE: Pre 1st
October, 1987 female members of the UPF have  this benefit as of right under
the UPF rules. Pre 1st  October, 1987 male members have this benefit as of 
right in respect of post 16th May, 1990 pensionable  service. For other
members (and for pre 17th May, 1990  pensionable service for pre 1st October,
1987 male  members) due allowance for unreduced benefits from age  60 is
made in cash equivalent calculations and see  also the allowance made in the
Actuarial Annex; and   (b) where a Pensionable Employee elects, at any
time  before the Scheme Change Date, under Rule C3 of the  UPF to purchase a
service credit and the period over  which contributions are payable in
respect of the  cost of that credit has not expired before the Scheme 
Change Date, a right, for so long as he remains in  pensionable service by
reference to the Purchaser\'s  Group Plan, to purchase over the period
commencing on  the Scheme Change Date the balance of the service  credit
which he would have been entitled to purchase  had he remained in pensionable
service by reference  to the UPF on the same terms and conditions as apply 
under the provisions of the UPF in force immediately  221  221     prior
to the Completion Date. Notwithstanding  PARAGRAPH 4.1.1(a) of PART 1, once
such an election  has been made, the obligation of the Purchaser under  this
(b) shall continue to apply until the expiry of  the period over which
contributions are payable in  respect of the cost of the service
credit.  4.2 PARAGRAPH 4.3 of PART 1 and PARAGRAPH 7.2 shall not apply to
any  employee contributions due in respect of the purchase of a service 
credit under the UPF, as referred to in PARAGRAPH 4.1.3(b).  4.3 Any
transfer of Relevant Benefits from 1999 SERA will be made in  accordance with
PARAGRAPH 13 of PART 1 and the Purchaser must procure  that the Purchaser\'s
Group Plan which provides Benefits in respect of  such a transfer and in
respect of service after the Completion Date  which are equivalent to
Benefits under 1999 SERA is, to the extent such  Benefits are capable of tax
approval, funded.  5. BENEFITS TO BE PROVIDED BY THE SELLERS  6.
EXPATRIATE EMPLOYEES   INTERIM ARRANGEMENTS  7. CONTINUED PARTICIPATION IN
SELLERS\' GROUP PLANS  7.1 Subject to obtaining all necessary consents and
approvals, the Sellers  will use all reasonable endeavours to procure that
the Purchaser or  relevant member of the Purchaser\'s Group is permitted to
participate in  the UPF and 1999 SERA during the Holding Period in respect
of:   (a) Employees who are members of the UPF and 1999 SERA on the 
Completion Date; and   (b) Employees who are or become eligible during the
Holding Period  to become members of the UPF and who become members of it

243  243    PROJECT COLORADO - VENDORS\' GROUP PLANS AND ACTUARIAL ANNEX
- PART 2    1. UK  Under the terms of paragraph 2.2 of Part 1 of
Schedule 10, we set out below the actuarial method and assumptions to be used
for determining the Value of a Transferred Relevant Benefit under the
UPF.  The Value of a Transferred Relevant Benefit referred to above will be
determined on the UPF benefit pattern as at the Completion Date. Pensionable
service will be taken to the Completion Date and will include service credits
for Pensionable Employees who have elected under Rule C3 of the UPF to
purchase such service credits. Where contributions are still being made in
respect of the purchase of service credits, pensionable service will include
only that proportion of the service credit that the Pensionable Employee
would have been entitled to had he left pensionable service on Completion
Date. Allowance will be made for salary increases projected from the
Completion Date up to Normal Retirement Age or earlier leaving active
service, having regard to the effective date of each member\'s most recent
review of salary prior to the Completion Date.  For members subject to the
permitted maximum introduced by the Finance Act 1989, benefits will be
restricted by reference to the appropriate projected cap figure. The
projected level of the cap will be based on the figure for the 2000/2001 tax
year (L91,800), increased as described in Schedule A.  For the avoidance of
doubt, in calculating the Value of a Transferred Relevant Benefit, it will be
assumed that there is no obligation to equalise benefits for post 16 May 1990
GMPs.  The Value of a Transferred Relevant Benefit will be determined on the
valuation assumptions summarised in Schedule A.  In the case of spouses\'
pensions payable on death in service and serious ill health retirement
pensions, the Value of a Transferred Relevant Benefit will be taken to be in
respect of that portion of the benefit which relates to pensionable service
to Completion Date (including the appropriate proportion of service credits),

248    (exact)   249  249     2. NETHERLANDS  The actuarial
method and assumptions in respect of Stichting Unilever Pensioenfonds
"Progress" ("PROGRESS") are as follows:   These pensions shall be calculated
in compliance with article 13 of the  rules of Progress as comprised in the
Data Room at 9.8.8.1 (the  "PROGRESS RULES"), with the Completion Date being
regarded as the date  of termination of participation referred to in section
2 of said  article 13.   In addition the accrued benefits under articles 21
and 22 of the  Progress Rules assuming that the payment of premium as
referred to in  section 7 of said articles has been terminated on the
Completion Date,  will be transferred on the same basis.   DISCOUNT RATE:
4%.   MORTALITY:   Males: mortality table GBM 1990-1995 ages set back by
one year;   Females: mortality table GBV 1990-1995 ages set back by one
year.   MATRIMONIAL ASSUMPTIONS:   A partner frequency of 100% is assumed
for active members, which  decreases by the assumed mortality rates of the
partner after age 65.   It is assumed that the male partner is three years
older than the  female partner.   It is assumed that the potential
orphan\'s pensions are covered by an  annual premium at 16 per thousand.  
OPTIONAL PENSIONS:   Pensionable Employees who qualify for early retirement
under article 7  of the Progress Rules are assumed to retire at age 60.  
The actuarial effects of other options on pensions are disregarded.  
AGES:   Ages will be rounded to nearest full months.  250  250     
FOREIGN STATE PENSIONS:   Where applicable foreign state pensions will be
subtracted from the  accrued benefits under the Progress Rules.  
EXPENSES:   Net present values will be increased by a 2% loading for
future  administrative expenses.   SALARY INCREASES   For the avoidance
of doubt, there is no allowance for future salary  increases.   AGREED
LOCAL ADJUSTMENT RATE: interest based on the relevant "U -  rendement" as
published by the Dutch federation of life insurance  companies. The relevant
"U-rendement" for this purpose is fixed for a  calendar year and is the rate
in force at January 1 of the calendar  year, and shall be determined by the
Sellers\' Actuary and agreed by the  Purchaser\'s Actuary or, in default of
agreement, determined under  PARAGRAPH 9 of PART 1 of Schedule 10.  251 
251     3. BELGIUM  The actuarial method and assumptions in respect of
the Pensioenfonds "Union"/Fonds de Pension "Union" are as follows:  
METHOD: as described in the plan rules in the Data Room:   - Pensioenfonds
"Union"/Fonds de Pension  "Union" - Article 13.   ASSUMPTIONS:  
Retirement age : 65   Discount rate : 4%   Mortality tables : mr for men
and fr for women   Note : for participants having reached age 50 at  the
Completion Date, the special early  retirement provisions of article 14 
(Pensioenfonds "Union"/Fonds de Pension  "Union") of the plan rules are
recognized.   Article 14 provides that, for participants  who leave the
plan as from age 50, no  reduction is applied to the deferred accrued 
pension between 60 and 65. Between age 55 and  60 a linear reduction of 5%
p.a. is applied.  In addition, prior to age 55, an actuarial  reduction is
applied as from age 55.   Salary increases : For the avoidance of doubt,
there is no  allowance for future salary increases.   AGREED LOCAL
ADJUSTMENT RATE: the EURIBOR 6 months rate, which shall  be determined by the
Sellers\' Actuary  and agreed by the Purchaser\'s Actuary  or, in default of
agreement,  determined under PARAGRAPH 9 of PART 1  of Schedule 10.  252 
252     4. IRELAND  Under the terms of PARAGRAPH 2.2 of PART 1 of
Schedule 10, we set out below the actuarial method and assumptions to be used
for determining the Value of a Transferred Relevant Benefit.  The
Transferred Relevant Benefit will be the accrued pension or
contingent spouses\'/children\'s pension determined by reference to the rules
of the Unilever Superannuation (Ireland) Pension Fund (the "US(I)F").
Pensionable Service will be taken to the Completion Date. Allowance will be
made for salary increases projected from the Completion Date up to Normal
Retirement Age or earlier leaving active service, having regard to the
effective date of each member\'s most recent review of salary prior to the
Completion Date.  The Value of a Transferred Relevant Benefit will be
determined using the valuation assumptions summarised in Schedule A.  In
the case of spouses\' pensions payable on death in service and serious ill-
health retirement pensions, the Value of the Transferred Relevant
Benefit will be taken to be in respect of that portion of the benefit which
relates to pensionable service to Completion Date, with no allowance for
pensionable service after Completion Date.  In the case of lump sums
payable on death in service, the Value of a Transferred Relevant Benefit will
be taken to be nil.  The Market Adjustment Factor shall be 1.0.  The
Agreed Local Adjustment Rate is the return, income and capital (positive
or negative), recorded on the investments of the US(I)F during the
period determined by the Sellers\' Actuary and agreed by the Purchaser\'s
Actuary or, in default of agreement, determined under PARAGRAPH 9 of PART 1

will not result in terms less favourable  to the relevant employees than

or any other member of  the Sellers\' Group will not be adversely affected
by  any such changes.  2. The Sellers shall use their reasonable endeavours
to ensure that the  position of the Purchaser or any other member of the
Purchaser\'s Group  will not be adversely affected by any of the changes
referred to at  1.(ii) above.  264  264    SCHEDULE 12  (VAT)  1. The
Sellers and the Purchaser shall use all reasonable endeavours to  procure
that the supply of those Business Assets under this Agreement  which would
otherwise be chargeable to VAT (but for the sale being  treated, for the
purposes of applicable VAT legislation, as a transfer  of all or part of the
assets of a business as a going concern as  hereinafter mentioned) and which
the Sellers and the Purchaser consider  should qualify as a transfer of all
or part of the assets of a business  as a going concern for the purposes of
applicable VAT legislation is so  treated by the relevant Tax Authority,
except that the Sellers shall  not be required by virtue of this sub-clause
to make any appeal to any  court against any determination of the relevant
Tax Authority that that  sale does not fall to be so treated.  2. The
Purchaser declares that it (or, if it procures that the Business  Assets
referred to in paragraph 1 are acquired by another person, that  other
person) is or will as a result of such acquisition become a  taxable person
for the purposes of VAT and the Purchaser undertakes to  procure that the
Purchaser or such person is either duly registered for  VAT purposes in the
relevant jurisdiction or jurisdictions or a member  of a group of companies
for VAT purposes of which the representative  member is duly registered for
those purposes in the relevant  jurisdiction or jurisdictions, in either case
by Completion, and the  Purchaser declares that the Purchaser or such person
shall upon and  immediately after Completion use the Business Assets referred
to in  paragraph 1 to carry on the same kind of business (whether or not as 
part of any existing business of the Purchaser or such other person) as  that
carried on by the relevant Business Seller or Business Sellers in  relation
to the Business Assets referred to in paragraph 1 owned by  such Business
Seller or Business Sellers before Completion.   The Sellers represent and
warrant to the Purchaser and any relevant  Designated Purchaser that each of
the Business Sellers is registered  for the purposes of VAT.  3. The
Sellers shall be entitled if the relevant VAT legislation so  permits to
retain all those records of the Business which under any  relevant VAT
legislation are required to be preserved after Completion  and shall request
the relevant Tax Authority so to direct in accordance  with applicable VAT
legislation. The Purchaser shall render all  reasonable assistance to the
Sellers in connection with such a request.  If the relevant Tax Authority
declines so to direct, the Sellers shall  deliver to the relevant Designated
Purchaser such  265  265     records and paragraph 4 below shall apply
to those records as if  references therein to "the Sellers" were replaced
with "the Purchaser"  and references therein to "the Purchaser" were replaced
with "the  Sellers".  4. The Sellers shall for such period as may be
required by applicable law  preserve in good order and for such period as
shall be required by law  all the records of the Business that it is entitled
to retain pursuant  to paragraph 3 and, upon being given reasonable notice by
the Purchaser  or its agents, the Sellers shall make those records available
(without  charge) and give reasonable access to the Purchaser or its agents
for  inspection or copying (at the Purchaser\'s expense).  5. If,
notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, the relevant Tax  Authority
shall determine that VAT is chargeable in respect of the  supply of all or
any of the Business Assets referred to in paragraph 1  under this Agreement,
the Sellers shall notify the Purchaser of that  determination within five
Business Days of its being so advised by the  relevant Tax Authority and the
Purchaser (on behalf of the relevant  Designated Purchaser) shall pay to the
Sellers (on behalf of the  relevant Business Seller or Business Sellers) by
way of additional  consideration a sum equal to the amount of VAT (together,
where the  declarations made by the Purchaser in paragraph 2 above are
incorrect  or the Purchaser has failed to comply with its undertakings in 
paragraph 2 above, with any interest and/or penalties relating thereto) 
determined by the relevant Tax Authority to be so chargeable on  Completion
or, if later, within five Business Days of the Sellers\'  notifying the
Purchaser of that determination (against delivery by the  Sellers on behalf
of the relevant Business Seller or Business Sellers  of an appropriate tax
invoice for VAT purposes).  6. Subject to paragraph 11 below, at Completion,
the Purchaser (on behalf  of the relevant Designated Purchaser) shall pay to
the Sellers (on  behalf of the relevant Business Seller or Business Sellers)
by way of  additional consideration for the Business Assets a sum equal to
the  amount of any VAT chargeable on the supply of the Business Assets
which  are not referred to in paragraph 1 against delivery by the Sellers
(on  behalf of the relevant Business Seller or Business Sellers) of an 
appropriate tax invoice for VAT purposes. If the Purchaser (on behalf  of the
relevant Designated Purchaser) pays to the Sellers (on behalf of  the
relevant Business Seller or Business Sellers) any sum as described  above and
the relevant Tax Authority subsequently confirms that no VAT  is chargeable
on the supply of any Business Assets to which that sum  (or any part of that
sum) related and repays to the Sellers or another  member of the Sellers\'
Group any VAT accounted for in respect of such  Business Assets, the Sellers
(on  266  266     behalf of the relevant Business Seller or Business
Sellers)  shall pay to the Purchaser (on behalf of the relevant  Designated
Purchaser):   (a) such part of that sum paid by the Purchaser pursuant to
this  paragraph 6 as relates to the supply of such Business Assets;  and  
(b) any interest or other amounts received from the relevant Tax  Authority
and referable to the amount previously taken to be  VAT charged in respect of
the supply of such Business Assets.  7. The Sellers will procure that the
Company which, prior to Completion,  is treated (for the purposes of Dutch
VAT legislation) as constituting,  together with one or more other persons, a
single taxable person in the  Netherlands (the "VAT GROUP") will be excluded
from the VAT Group with  effect from Completion.  8. Where any part of the
European Culinary Brands Business is being  carried on by the Company, the
Sellers shall arrange for all VAT  returns for the VAT Group for any period
prior to Completion to be  prepared and submitted to the relevant Tax
Authority and the Purchaser  shall procure that the Company provides to the
Sellers or their agents  all information as may be required for the
preparation of such returns.  9. The Purchaser shall procure that the
Company shall promptly upon the  written request of any Seller or its agent
provide such information  (including copies of documents, where relevant)
requested by any  Business Seller to enable it to make full replies to any
enquiries  raised by any relevant Tax Authority in respect of VAT returns
made up  to Completion.  10. The Sellers shall indemnify on an after Tax
basis the Purchaser (and if  the Purchaser procures that the Business Assets
referred to in  paragraph 1 are acquired by another person, that other
person) against  any liabilities in respect of any VAT suffered in the
Netherlands in  respect of the Business Assets by reference to transactions,
actions or  omissions occurring (or deemed to occur) on or before Completion
or in  respect of any period ending on or before Completion except to the 
extent that the Purchaser or such person is indemnified in respect of  such
VAT under another provision of this Agreement.  11. Notwithstanding
paragraph 6 above:   (a) at Completion, the Purchaser (on behalf of Erasco
GmbH) shall  be entitled to assign to the Sellers (on behalf of Union 
Deutsche Lebensmittelwerke GmbH ("UDL") a right to a German  VAT refund of
Euro 10,671,680 to which Erasco GmbH or the  representative member of the
German VAT group of which Erasco  GmbH is a member is entitled instead of
paying an amount equal  to the German VAT of Euro 10,671,680 arising on the
sale by  UDL of its business goodwill and brands and the tax invoices  for
German VAT purposes that are required to be delivered at  Completion in
respect of the assets to be sold by UDL pursuant  to this Agreement shall
reflect such assignment. In order to  carry out this assignment, the
Purchaser shall deliver to the  Sellers an assignment agreement executed by
Erasco GmbH or, as  the case may be, the representative member of the German
VAT  group of which Erasco GmbH is a member, assigning to UDL (or  the
representative member of the German VAT group of which UDL  is a member) a
right to a refund of German VAT in the amount  set out above. The Sellers
shall procure that UDL (or the  representative member of the German VAT group
of which UDL is  a member) shall at, or as soon as reasonably practicable
(and  in any event prior to 18th May, 2001) after, Completion sign  such
assignment agreement and return the original of such  assignment agreement to
Erasco GmbH or, as the case may be,  the representative member of the German
VAT group of which  Erasco GmbH is a member; and   (b) provided that the
Sellers have complied with their obligations  under paragraph (a) above, the
Purchaser will procure that, on  or before 10th June, 2001, the
representative member of the  German VAT group of which Erasco GmbH is a
member will file  its German VAT return in respect of May, 2001 and that, on
or  before 15th June, 2001, the representative member of the  German VAT
group of which Erasco GmbH is a member will confirm  to UDL or the
representative member of the German VAT group of  which UDL is a member that
the aggregate entitlement of the  German VAT group of which Erasco GmbH is a
member to a refund  of German VAT as set out in that return is at least
Euro  10,671,680. If it transpires that, as at 10th June, 2001, the  amount
which UDL (or the representative member of the German  VAT group of which UDL
is a member) is entitled to receive by  way of German VAT refund pursuant to
the assignment referred  to in paragraph 11(a) above is less than Euro
10,671,680, the  Purchaser (on behalf of Erasco GmbH) shall pay to the
Sellers  (on behalf of UDL) an amount equal to the shortfall against 
delivery by the Sellers (on behalf of UDL) of an appropriate  tax invoice for
German VAT purposes and a release in writing  by UDL (or the representative
member of the German VAT group  of which UDL is a member) of the VAT
assignment referred to in  paragraph 11(a) above to the extent of the
shortfall.  12. At Completion, the Purchaser (on behalf of Campbell
Generale  Condimentaire) shall pay to the Sellers (on behalf of Bestfoods
France  Societe Industrielle S.A.) the sum of Euro 55,034.84 and to the
Sellers  (on behalf of Generale Condimentaire S.A.S.) the sum of Euro
444,082.80  in each case in respect of French VAT required to be repaid by
those  Business Sellers as a result of their sale of certain Business 
Properties pursuant to this Agreement and the Sellers (on behalf of  each of
Bestfoods France Societe Industrielle S.A. and Generale  Condimentaire
S.A.S.) will provide to the Purchaser (on behalf of  Campbell Generale
Condimentaire) appropriate tax invoices for French  VAT purposes in respect
of those payments.         267  267    SCHEDULE 13  IT

assistance of the Purchaser,  procure the creation of a stand-alone

any element of the Stand  Alone Organisation with a greater level of
functionality, performance  or capacity than the levels enjoyed by that part
of the Business in  Sweden, Denmark and Finland on the date of this
Agreement.  (C) For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood that the
current Swedish  and Finnish IT Systems used by the Business will not be
integrated with  each other but will be transferred to the Business Property
in  Kristianstad as two separate IT Systems which will have been separated 
from the existing systems of the Swedish and Finnish businesses  PROVIDED
THAT nothing shall oblige the Sellers to provide such systems  with a greater
level of functionality, performance or capacity than the  levels of the
existing systems.  (D) The Sellers shall consult the Purchaser on key
decisions in relation to  the creation of the Stand Alone Organisation
including the selection  and purchase of hardware and infrastructure.  (E)
If the Stand Alone Organisation is not operating to the same capacity, 
performance and functionality as the equivalent of the Stand Alone 
Organisation as operated within the relevant part of the Business on  the
date of this Agreement by the Completion Date, then the project to  create a
Stand Alone Organisation will continue and  268  268      transitional
services will be provided in Sweden, Denmark and Finland  as set out in the
Transitional Services Agreement.    2. NETHERLANDS AND FRENCH FACTORY IT

systems to the equivalent capacity,  performance and functionality as
currently used by Generale  Condimentaire S.A.S. to run the factory at Grande
Synthe,  France   and responsibility for the management of such computer
systems will be  transferred to the Purchaser when the Purchaser and the
Sellers  mutually agree that the stand-alone computer systems are running 
adequately on a stand-alone basis PROVIDED THAT nothing shall oblige  the
Sellers to provide any such systems which have a greater level of 
functionality, performance or capacity than the levels such systems  have at

Systems of the Sellers\'  Group, the Sellers shall transfer, or shall procure
the transfer of,  all of the IT Systems included in such stand alone computer
systems  (excluding networks) to a Designated Purchaser.  269
