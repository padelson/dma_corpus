the Accountants any materials relating to the  determination and to discuss
the determination with the Accountants,  _provided_   that  copies of all

discussions may only occur in the presence of the other party; and  (y)  the
determination by the Accountants of the disputed items in the Closing 
Statement as shall be set forth in a notice delivered to both parties by the 
Accountants, shall be binding and conclusive on the parties. The fees of the 
Accountants for such determination shall be borne by Purchaser, on the one 
hand,  and the Securityholders, on the other hand, in inverse proportion to
the manner  in which such Person prevails on the items resolved by the

dispute and shall be computed by the  Accountants at the time the
determination of the Accountants is  rendered.

who  effectively shall have withdrawn or otherwise lost his, her or its
rights to  appraisal of such share of Common Stock under such Section 262 of
the DGCL  shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have

is in good standing, in each jurisdiction in  which the character or location
of the property owned, leased or operated by  it  or the nature of its

reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on its  respective
businesses, financial condition or results of  operations.

Merger Sub and,  assuming the due execution of this Agreement by the other
parties hereto,  constitutes a valid and binding obligation of each of

termination, cancellation or  acceleration under, or require the consent of
any third party to, any material  contract to which it is a party; and

 

 

**(e)** will  not  result in the imposition or creation of any Lien upon or
with respect to any  of  its assets or properties.

 

 

excluding  from the foregoing clauses (b) through (e) consents, approvals,
notices and  filings the absence of which, and violations, breaches,
defaults, rights of  acceleration, cancellation or termination, and Liens,
the existence of which  would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to  (i) have a material adverse effect on the ability
of Purchaser or Merger  Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement
or (ii) otherwise  prevent, hinder or delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated  by  this Agreement.

 

 

**4.4** **_Financial  Ability_** **. ** Purchaser  has received a

Consideration and all fees and expenses of  Purchaser in connection with the

provided to the Company. A true and correct,  fully-executed copy of the Debt
Commitment Letter is attached as _Exhibit C_  hereto.  As of the date

contemplated  by this Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof. As of
the date hereof,  each of the Debt Commitment Letter and the Equity
Commitment Letter is valid  and  in full force and effect and has not been

account with the present intention of holding such shares for  purposes of
investment, and Purchaser is not acquiring such shares with a view  to or for
the public distribution thereof, in whole or in part, or as an  underwriter
or conduit to subsequent purchasers in violation of federal or  state 
securities laws. Purchaser does not have any reason to anticipate any change 
in  circumstances, or other particular occasion or event, which would cause 
Purchaser to attempt to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of such shares 
in  violation of federal or state securities laws.

 

 

**4.6** **_Brokers '  Commissions_** **.**   Except as  set forth on
_Schedule __4.6_ ,  none of  Purchaser or its Affiliates have, directly or
indirectly, entered into any  agreement with any Person that would obligate

**(a)** Promptly  after Purchaser's request, the Company shall commence a
tender offer and Consent  Solicitation (the " _Notes  Offer_ ")  for all 
of the outstanding Senior Notes on customary terms as are reasonably
acceptable  to the Company and the Purchaser. The Company shall prepare all
necessary and  appropriate documentation in connection with the Notes Offer,
including the  offer to purchase, any related letters of transmittal and
other related  documents (collectively, the " _Offer  Documents_ ")  and 
such documents shall be reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser. Purchaser
and  the Company shall cooperate with each other in the preparation of the
Offer  Documents. All mailings to the holders of the Senior Notes in
connection with  the Notes Offer shall be subject to the prior review and
comment by each of  the  Company and Purchaser and shall be reasonably
acceptable to each of them. The  closing of the Notes Offer shall be
conditioned on the conditions set forth  in  Section 5.7(d).  The 
Company, Purchaser and Merger Sub shall cooperate in connection with the
Notes  Offer in order to cause the consent date under the Consent
Solicitation to  occur  as directed by Purchaser prior to or concurrently
with the Closing and the  initial settlement of the Notes Offer to occur
concurrently with the Closing.  The Company shall waive any of the conditions
to the Notes Offer (other than  that the Merger shall have occurred or that
the Purchaser and Company shall  be  satisfied that it shall occur
substantially concurrently with the closing of  the  Notes Offer, the
Requested Consents shall have been received, and that there  shall be no
order or injunction prohibiting consummation of the Notes Offer)  as  may be
reasonably requested by Purchaser and so long as such waivers would  not 
cause the Notes Offer to violate the Exchange Act, the Trust Indenture Act, 
or  any other Law and shall not, without the consent of Purchaser, waive
any  condition to the Notes Offer or make any changes to the terms and
conditions  of  the Notes Offer other than as reasonably agreed between
Purchaser and the  Company. If, at any time prior to the completion of the
Notes Offer, any  information is discovered by the Company or Purchaser that
should be set forth  in an amendment or supplement to the Offer Documents, so
that the Offer  Documents shall not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit  to  state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order  to  make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they  are  made, not misleading, the party
that discovers such information shall promptly  notify the other party, and
an appropriate amendment or supplement describing  such information shall be
disseminated by the Company to the holders of the  Senior Notes.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  Section 5.7(a),  the 
Company shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-l under the Exchange 
Act  and any other applicable Law to the extent such Laws are applicable in 
connection with the Notes Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any 
applicable Law conflict with this Section 5.7(a),  the  Company shall comply
with the applicable Law and shall not be deemed to have  breached its
obligations hereunder by such compliance.

 

 

**(b)** Promptly  upon the receipt of the Requested Consents with respect to
the Indenture for  the  Senior Notes, the Company shall enter into a
supplemental indenture reflecting  the amendments to such Indenture approved
by such Requested Consents and will  use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the Indenture trustee to promptly  enter  into such supplemental indenture;
_provided_ ,  that the  amendments contained in such supplemental indenture
shall become operative  upon  the acceptance of the Notes Offer and payment
for the Senior Notes tendered  pursuant thereto. If the Requested Consents
are not obtained in connection  with  the Notes Offer, the Company will, if
requested by the Purchaser in writing,  permit Purchaser to effect, and
provide reasonable assistance to Purchaser  in  connection with, a covenant
defeasance of the Senior Notes under the Indenture  as of the Closing (to the
extent permitted under the Indenture).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

39  

 

 

 

 

 

 

**(c)** If  requested by Purchaser, the Company shall enter into one or more
dealer manager,  information agent and/or depositary agreements with such
Persons as Purchaser  shall reasonably request in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the  Company.

 

 

**(d)** The  Company's and the Surviving Company's obligation to accept for
payment and pay  for the Senior Notes tendered pursuant to the Notes Offer or
make any payment  for the Requested Consents shall be subject to conditions
(as mutually agreed  by  Purchaser and the Company), including that (i) the
Merger shall have occurred  (or Purchaser and the Company shall be satisfied
that it will occur  substantially concurrently with such acceptance and
payment), (ii) the Requested  Consents shall have been received, (iii) there
shall be no order or injunction  prohibiting consummation of the Notes Offer
and (iv) such other conditions  as  are customary for transactions similar
to the Notes Offer.

**COVENANTS  OF PURCHASER**

 

 

**6.1** **_Access  to Information_**.  After  the Closing, Purchaser and

by such party) and shall cause their Advisors to  furnish all information
reasonably requested by the Securityholders or their  Advisors in connection
with financial reporting and Tax matters (including  financial and Tax audits

**(a)** Purchaser  agrees that for a period of six (6) years after the
Closing, it shall not permit  the Surviving Company to amend, repeal or
modify any provision in its  Organizational Documents in a manner that would
adversely affect the rights  and/or exculpation or indemnification of present
or former directors and  officers, it being the intent of the parties that
the directors and officers  of  the Surviving Company prior to the Closing
shall continue thereafter to be  entitled to such exculpation and
indemnification to the fullest extent permitted  under applicable Legal
Requirements and Purchaser agrees to cause the Surviving  Company to perform
in a timely manner and to otherwise honor such obligations  in  all
respects.

directors' liability insurance policy (a copy of which has heretofore been 
delivered to Purchaser), with respect to actions and omissions occurring
prior  to the Closing, on terms which are at least as favorable as the terms
of such  insurance in effect for the Company on the date hereof and from an
insurer  or  insurers having claims paying ratings no lower than the
Company's current  insurer.

 

 

**(c)** If  the  Surviving Company or any of its successors or assigns shall
(i) consolidate  with or merge into any other corporation or other entity and
shall not be the  surviving entity of the consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfer all or  substantially all of its properties and assets to any
individual, corporation  or  other entity, then and in each such case,
proper provisions shall be made so  that such successors and assigns shall
assume all of the obligations set forth  in this Section 6.2.

 

 

**6.3** **_Employees_** **.**

 

 

**(a)** Purchaser  agrees that the employees of the Company (including
employees on vacation,  leave  of absence, short or long-term disability) as
of immediately prior to the  Closing will remain employees of the Surviving
Company as of immediately  following the Closing, at the salary levels (or
higher) that were in effect  immediately prior to the Closing; _provided_ ,

**(a)** Purchaser  acknowledges and agrees that it has made its own inquiry
and investigation  into,  and, based thereon, has formed an independent

**ARTICLE  7**

 

**COVENANTS  AND** **AGREEMENTS**

 

 

**7.1** _**Consents;  Governmental** **Approvals**_ **.**

 

 

**(a)** Each  of  the parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause  to be taken, all action, and to do or cause to be
done, and to assist and  cooperate with the other parties hereto in doing,
all things reasonably  necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, including without  limitation, (i) the obtaining of all Required
Governmental Approvals and  the making of all required registrations and
filings with, Governmental  Authorities, (ii) the obtaining of any consents
from a party to a Material  Contract set forth on _Schedule __3.5_ ,  and
each  consent specified on _Schedule __3.5_   or  _Schedule __4.3_   and 
(iii) the defending of Proceedings challenging this Agreement or the 
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including, without 
limitation, by seeking to have any temporary restraining order or
preliminary  injunction entered by any Governmental Authority vacated or
reversed;  _provided_ ,  that the  obligation to use "reasonable best
efforts" in connection with obtaining any  consent from a party to a Material
Contract set forth on _Schedule __3.5_   shall not  require the Person
subject to the obligation to pay any additional consideration  or otherwise
incur any additional liability to any Person.  Each of  Purchaser and Merger
Sub agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to  consummate the
transactions contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter on or  prior to May
31, 2007.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

42  

 

 

 

 

 

 

**(b)** Without  limiting the generality of Section 7.1(a)  hereof,  the
parties shall, no later than five (5) Business Days after the date hereof, 
prepare and file with the United States Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_
")  and the  United States Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ")  the 
notification and report form required under the HSR Act for the transactions 
contemplated hereby and seek to obtain early termination of the waiting
period  thereunder. Each of the parties shall promptly file any supplemental
or  additional information which may reasonably be requested by the FTC and
the  DOJ  and any other Governmental Authority in connection with such
filings and shall  comply in all material respects with all applicable Legal
Requirements relating  thereto.

 

 

**(c)** Each  party  shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve
objections, if any, which  may  be asserted with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement  under the HSR Act, the Sherman Antitrust Act,
as amended, the Clayton Act,  as  amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act,
as amended, and any other applicable  Legal Requirement designed to prohibit,
restrict or regulate actions for the  purpose or effect of monopolization or
restraint of trade (collectively " _Antitrust  Laws_ ").  In the  event
any Proceeding is threatened or instituted challenging the transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement as violative of Antitrust Laws, each party
shall  use its reasonable best efforts to avoid the filing of, or to resist
or resolve,  such Proceeding. Each party shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to  take such action as may be required by: (i) the DOJ
and/or the FTC in order  to resolve such objections as either of them may
have to the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement under the Antitrust
Laws or (ii) any other  Governmental Authority, in any suit brought by any
Governmental Authority or  any  other Person challenging the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as  violative of the Antitrust Laws, in order
to avoid the entry of any Order  (whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent) which has the effect of preventing  the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to  have  vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned any such Order. Except as may be  prohibited by any
Governmental Authority or by any Legal Requirement, Purchaser,  on the one
hand, and the Company on the other, will, pursuant to a joint defense 
agreement in customary form reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and the
Company,  consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith
the views  of  one another, in connection with any analysis, appearance,
presentation,  memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal made or
submitted in connection  with any Proceeding under or relating to the HSR
Act. In addition, except as  may  be prohibited by any Governmental
Authority or by any Legal Requirement, in  connection with any Proceeding
under or relating to the HSR Act, each of  Purchaser, on the one hand, and
the Company, on the other, will permit  authorized representatives of the
other party to be present at each meeting  or  conference relating to any
such Proceeding and to have access to and be  consulted in connection with
any document, opinion or proposal made or submitted  to any Governmental
Authority in connection with any such Proceeding. Nothing  in  this Section
7.2  shall  require Purchaser to divest, sell, dispose of, hold separate or
otherwise take  actions that limit its freedom of action with respect to its
ability to retain  its business or assets.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

43  

 

 

 

 

 

 

**(d)** The  parties shall notify the other parties of any correspondence or
contact with  the  DOJ, the FTC or any other Governmental Authority and
shall furnish to the other  parties all such information in its possession as
may be necessary for the  completion of any required reports or
notifications.

 

 

**7.2** **_Notification_** **. ** Between  the date of this Agreement and
the Closing Date, each party hereto will promptly  notify the other parties
hereto in writing if the notifying party acquires  knowledge of any fact or
condition which such party reasonably believes is  not  known by the other
parties, that causes or constitutes a material breach of  such  notifying
party's representations and warranties as of the date of this  Agreement.
During the same period, each party hereto will promptly notify the  other
parties hereto of the occurrence of any material breach of any covenant  of 
such notifying party or of the occurrence of any event that may make the 
satisfaction of the conditions in Article  8  impossible or unlikely to be
satisfied by June 29, 2007, which such party  reasonably believes is not
known by the other parties. The parties hereby  acknowledge and agree that
Purchaser's rights under this Agreement shall not be  affected if Purchaser
(or any director, executive officer, agent or advisor  of  Purchaser) had
knowledge at any time on or prior to the Closing Date of facts,  events or
conditions constituting or resulting in breach of the Company's 
representation or warranty or covenants.

 

 

**7.3** **_Public  Announcements; Confidentiality_** **.**

 

 

**(a)** From  and  after the date of this Agreement, except to the extent
required by applicable  Legal Requirements or, as to the Company, as required
by the Indenture, neither  Purchaser nor the Company shall, directly or
indirectly, issue any press release  or public announcement of any kind
concerning the transactions contemplated  by  this Agreement without the
prior written consent of the other parties hereto;  and, in the event any
such public announcement, release or disclosure is  required by applicable
Legal Requirements or, as to the Company, as required  by  the Indenture,
Purchaser and the Company will consult prior to the making  thereof and use
their reasonable best efforts to agree upon a mutually  satisfactory text.

 

 

**(b)** Between  the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, (i)
Purchaser shall not,  and shall not permit its Advisors to, communicate with
customers or suppliers  of  the Company or any other Person with whom the

respect to the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement or with respect
to the business or operations  of  the Company, without the prior written
consent of the Company (such consent  not  to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed); and (ii) Purchaser shall not  (except with respect to the HSR Act)
communicate with any Governmental Authority  with respect to the Company or
the Securityholders or the other transactions  contemplated hereby without
the prior written consent of the Company (such  consent shall not be

**(c)** Unless  consented to by each of the parties hereto, the parties
hereto shall keep this  Agreement strictly confidential and may not make any
disclosure of this  Agreement or the terms and conditions contained herein to
any Person except  (i) as may be required under applicable Legal
Requirements, (ii) as to  the Company, as required by the Indenture, (iii) to
the extent that such  information is or becomes generally available to the
public other than as a  result of disclosure by such party, (iv) to such
Person's financing sources  and as may be reasonably agreed by the Company
and Purchaser in connection  with  the arrangement of debt financing or
otherwise in connection with the  transactions contemplated hereby or (v) to
any Affiliate, director,  officer, or Advisor of such party. In the event a
party is required under an  applicable Legal Requirement to make a disclosure
prohibited by this  Section 7.3(c),  such  party shall provide the other
parties hereto with prompt prior written notice  of  such requirement so
that such other parties may seek a protective order or  other  appropriate
remedy, and the party required to make the disclosure shall  cooperate in all
reasonable respects in obtaining the same. Subject to the  foregoing, the
party required to make such disclosure may furnish that portion  (and only
that portion) of such information that, based on the advice of its  counsel,
such party is required to disclose; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  such
party must use reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurance that 
confidential treatment will be accorded to any information so  disclosed.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

44  

 

 

 

 

 

 

**7.4** **_Cooperation  on Tax Matters_**.  The  Representative shall
cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested  by Purchaser
and/or the Company, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns  and any
audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such 
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon request) the provision of 
records and information that are reasonably relevant to any such audit, 
litigation or other proceeding and making themselves available on a mutually 
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any 
material provided hereunder.

 

 

**7.5** **_Financial  Information; Cooperation with Financings_**.

 

 

**(a)** The  Company shall deliver to Purchaser (for further delivery to
Purchaser's lenders  under the Debt Commitment Letter) interim unaudited
financial statements of  the  Company for (i) each monthly period ending
after the Balance Sheet Date and  for  the year-to-date period ending as of
the last day of such monthly period no  later than thirty (30) days after the
end of such monthly period and (ii) each  quarterly period ending after the
Balance Sheet Date and for the year-to-date  period ending as of the last day
of such quarterly period no later than  forty-five (45) days after the end of
such quarterly period (it being understood  that such quarterly financial

**(b)** The  Company shall direct its officers, employees, accountants and
other Advisors  to  assist and reasonably cooperate with Purchaser to
consummate the financing  under  the Debt Commitment Letter, including (i)
participating in customary "syndication efforts", "road shows" and rating
