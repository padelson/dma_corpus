as of December 31, 2015 or (B) more than 10% of the net income of the MPLX
Entities, taken as a whole, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.

Section 3.04 MPLX SEC Documents. Since January 1, 2015, all the Partnership's
forms, registration statements, reports, schedules and statements required to
be filed by it under the Exchange Act have been filed with the Commission on a
timely basis. The MPLX SEC Documents, at the time filed (or in the case of
registration statements, solely on the dates of effectiveness), except to the
extent corrected by a subsequent MPLX SEC Document, (a) did not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made in the case of any such
documents other than a registration statement, not misleading and (b) complied
as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act and the Securities Act, as the case may be.

Section 3.05 Financial Statements.

(a) The historical financial statements (including the related notes and
supporting schedule) contained or incorporated by reference in the MPLX SEC
Documents, (a) comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable
accounting requirements under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act (except
that certain supporting schedules are omitted), (b) present fairly in all
material respects the financial position, results of operations and cash flows
of the entities purported to be shown thereby on the basis stated therein at
the respective dates or for the respective periods and (c) have been prepared
in accordance with GAAP consistently applied throughout the periods involved,
in each case except to the extent disclosed therein. The other financial
information of the Partnership Entities, including non-GAAP financial
measures, if any, contained or incorporated by reference in the MPLX SEC
Documents has been derived from the accounting records of the Partnership
Entities, and fairly presents in all material respects the information
purported to be shown thereby. Nothing has come to the attention of the
Partnership that has caused it to believe that the statistical and market-
related data included in the MPLX SEC Documents is not based on or derived
from sources that are reliable and accurate in all material respects as of the
date on which the applicable MPLX SEC Documents were filed.

(b) Since the date of the most recent balance sheet of the Partnership audited
by the Partnership's auditor, (i) the interactive data in eXtensible Business
Reporting Language included or incorporated by reference in the MPLX SEC
Documents fairly presents the information called for in all material respects
and has been prepared in accordance with the Commission's rules and guidelines
applicable thereto in all material respects and (ii) based on an



annual evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures, the Partnership is
not aware of (A) any significant deficiency or material weakness in the design
or operation of internal controls over financial reporting that are likely to
adversely affect its ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial data or (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in the internal
controls over financial reporting of the Partnership.

Section 3.06 Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.

Partnership and its consolidated subsidiaries and delivered its report with
respect to the audited consolidated financial statements financial statements
contained or incorporated by reference in the MPLX SEC Documents, is an

and the General Partner within the meaning of the Securities Act and the
applicable rules and regulations thereunder adopted by the Commission and the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).

connection with any disagreement with the Partnership on any matter of
accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing
scope or procedures.

described in the MPLX SEC Documents, there has not been any Material Adverse
Effect.

Section 3.08 No Registration Required. Assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of each Purchaser contained in Article IV, the
issuance and sale of the Purchased Units pursuant to this Agreement is exempt
from registration requirements of the Securities Act, and neither the

behalf has taken or will take any action hereafter that would cause the loss
of such exemption.

Section 3.09 No Preemptive Rights; Registration Rights Priority. Except as
described in the Partnership Agreement or has been otherwise waived or
satisfied, there are no preemptive rights or other rights to subscribe for or
to purchase, nor any restriction upon the voting or transfer of, any equity
securities of the Partnership. Except for such rights that have been waived or
as expressly set forth in the Registration Rights Agreement, neither the
offering or sale of the Purchased Units as contemplated by this Agreement
gives rise to any rights for or relating to the registration of any Purchased
Units or other securities of the Partnership. Except as described in the
Partnership Agreement, the Partnership has not granted registration rights to
any Person other than the Purchasers that would provide such Person priority
over the Purchasers' rights with respect to any Piggyback Registration.

Entities to perform its obligations under the Transaction Documents.

Section 3.12 No Conflicts. The issuance and sale by the Partnership of the
Purchased Units, the application of the proceeds thereof, the execution,

power and authority under the Partnership Agreement and the Delaware LP Act to
issue, sell and deliver the Purchased Units, in accordance with and upon the

delivered at the Closing, will be, validly executed and delivered by the
Partnership or the General Partner, as the case may be, and, to the Knowledge
of the MPLX Parties, the other parties thereto. Each of the Transaction
Documents constitutes, or will constitute, the legal, valid and binding
obligations of the Partnership or the General Partner, as the case may be,
and, to the Knowledge of the MPLX Parties, each of the parties thereto, in
each case enforceable in accordance with its terms; provided that, with
respect to each such agreement, the enforceability thereof may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium or similar Laws from time to time in effect affecting creditors'
rights and remedies generally and by general principles of equity (regardless
of whether such principles are considered in a proceeding in equity or at
law).

Section 3.18 Certain Fees. Except for fees to be paid by the Partnership to
the Purchasers or their designee pursuant to this Agreement, no fees or
commissions are or will be payable by the Partnership to brokers, finders or
investment bankers with respect to the sale of any of the Purchased Units or

Partnership agrees that it will indemnify and hold harmless the Purchasers
from and against any and all claims, demands, or liabilities for broker's,
finder's, placement, or other similar fees or commissions incurred by the
Partnership or alleged to have been incurred by the Partnership in connection
with the sale of the Purchased Units or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 3.19 Labor and Employment Matters. No labor dispute with the employees
of any of the Partnership Entities exists, or, to the Knowledge of the
Partnership, is imminent, that would have a Material Adverse Effect. To the
Knowledge of the MPLX Parties and except as would not, individually or in the

businesses of the Partnership Entities as such Partnership Entities reasonably
deem adequate; such insurance insures against losses and risks to an extent
which is reasonably adequate, in accordance with customary industry practice,
to protect the Partnership Entities and their respective businesses in a
commercially reasonable manner. All such insurance is fully in force on the
date hereof, except for such insurance for which the failure to be outstanding
and duly in force would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

Section 3.21 Internal Controls. Except as described in the MPLX SEC Documents,
the Partnership Entities, taken as a whole, maintain a system of internal
accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that (a)
transactions are executed in accordance with management's general or specific

maintain and evaluate "disclosure controls and procedures" (as such term is
defined in Rule 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act) and "internal
control over financial reporting" (as such term is





defined in Rule 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act); such disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material information
relating to the Partnership is made known to the General Partner's Chief
Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, and such disclosure
controls and procedures are effective to perform the functions for which they
were established. The Partnership has carried out evaluations of and
appropriate officers of the General Partner have certified in the appropriate
MPLX SEC Documents management's conclusions regarding the effectiveness of its
disclosure controls and procedures of the Partnership as of December 31, 2015.
Since the date of the Partnership's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2015, there have been no significant changes in the
Partnership's internal control over financial reporting or in other factors
that could significantly affect internal controls, including any corrective
actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.

Section 3.23 Sarbanes-Oxley. The Partnership and, to the Partnership's
Knowledge, the General Partner's directors or officers, in their capacities as
such, are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable
provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations
promulgated in connection therewith.

Section 3.24 Listing and Maintenance Requirements. The Common Units are listed
on the NYSE, and the Partnership has not received any notice of delisting. The
issuance and sale of the Purchased Units and issuance of Common Units upon
conversion of the Purchased Units do not contravene NYSE rules and

investigation or remediation of any disposal or release of any Hazardous
Materials or for violations under Environmental Laws, and (d) no Partnership
Entity is subject to any pending or, to the Knowledge of the MPLX Parties,
threatened actions, suits, demands, orders or proceedings against any

Environmental Laws or to timely apply for or receive, or to comply with,
permits, licenses, authorizations or other approvals required under

Except as described in the MPLX SEC Documents, no Partnership Entity has
entered into any settlement agreement relating to any alleged violation of any
Environmental Law or any actual or alleged release or threatened release or
cleanup at any location of any Hazardous Materials, except for any such

Partnership Entity is currently named as a "potentially responsible party"
under the Comprehensive Environmental



Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Article III, this Section 3.25 contains the
only representations and warranties of the Partnership with respect to
compliance with, or liability under, Environmental Laws, the application for

similar Laws from time to time in effect affecting creditors' rights and
remedies generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether
such principles are considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

Section 4.03 No Breach. The execution, delivery and performance of the
Transaction Documents to which such Purchaser is a party by such Purchaser and
the consummation by such Purchaser of the transactions contemplated thereby
will not (a) conflict with or result in a breach or violation of any of the

Section 4.04 Certain Fees. No fees or commissions are or will be payable by
such Purchaser to brokers, finders or investment bankers with respect to the
purchase of any of the Purchased Units or the consummation of the transactions

and hold harmless the Partnership from and against any and all claims,
demands, or liabilities for broker's, finder's, placement, or other similar
fees or commissions incurred by such Purchaser or alleged to have been
incurred by such Purchaser in connection with the purchase of the Purchased
Units or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 4.05 Unregistered Securities.



(a) Accredited Investor Status; Sophisticated Purchaser. Such Purchaser is an
"accredited investor" within the meaning of Rule 501 under the Securities Act
and is able to bear the risk of its investment in the Purchased Units and the
Conversion Units. Such Purchaser has such knowledge and experience in
financial and business matters that it is capable of evaluating the merits and
risks of the purchase of the Purchased Units and the Conversion Units.

(b) Information. Such Purchaser and its Representatives have been furnished
with all materials relating to the business, finances and operations of the
Partnership that have been requested and materials relating to the offer and
sale of the Purchased Units and Conversion Units that have been requested by
such Purchaser. Such Purchaser and its Representatives have been afforded the
opportunity to ask questions of the Partnership. Neither such inquiries nor
any other due diligence investigations conducted at any time by such
Purchasers and its Representatives shall modify, amend or affect such
Purchasers' right (i) to rely on the Partnership's representations and
warranties contained in Article III above or (ii) to indemnification or any
other remedy based on, or with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of, or
compliance with, the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in
any Transaction Document. Such Purchaser understands that its purchase of the
Purchased Units involves a high degree of risk. Such Purchaser has sought such
accounting, legal and tax advice as it has considered necessary to make an
informed investment decision with respect to its acquisition of the Purchased
Units.

(c) Residency. Such Purchaser shall cooperate reasonably with the Partnership
to provide any information necessary for any applicable securities filings.

(d) Legends. Such Purchaser understands that, until such time as the Purchased
Units have been sold pursuant to an effective registration statement under the
Securities Act, or the Purchased Units are eligible for resale pursuant to
Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act without any restriction as to
the number of securities as of a particular date that can then be immediately
sold, the Purchased Units will bear a restrictive legend as provided in the
Partnership Agreement. Each Purchaser understands that, until such time as the
Conversion Units have been sold pursuant to an effective registration
statement under the Securities Act, or the Conversion Units are eligible for
resale pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act without any
restriction as to the number of securities as of a particular date that can
then be immediately sold, the Conversion Units will bear a restrictive legend
as provided in the Partnership Agreement.

(e) Purchase Representation. Such Purchaser is purchasing the Purchased Units
for its own account and not with a view to distribution in violation of any
securities Laws. Such Purchaser has been advised and understands that neither
the Purchased Units nor the Conversion Units have been registered under the
Securities Act or under the "blue sky" Laws of any jurisdiction and may be
resold only if registered pursuant to the provisions of the Securities Act (or
if eligible, pursuant to the provisions of Rule 144 promulgated under the
Securities Act or pursuant to another available exemption from the
registration requirements of the Securities Act). Such Purchaser has been
advised and understands that the Partnership, in issuing the Purchased Units,
is relying upon, among other things, the representations and warranties of
such Purchaser contained in this Article IV in concluding that such issuance
is a "private offering" and is exempt from the registration provisions of the
Securities Act.



(f) Rule 144. Such Purchaser understands that there is no public trading
market for the Purchased Units, that none is expected to develop and that the
Purchased Units must be held indefinitely unless and until the Purchased Units
or the Conversion Units (or both) are registered under the Securities Act or
an exemption from registration is available. Each Purchaser has been advised
of and is aware of the provisions of Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities
Act.

(g) Reliance by the Partnership. Such Purchaser understands that the Purchased
Units are being offered and sold in reliance on a transactional exemption from
the registration requirements of federal and state securities Laws and that
the Partnership is relying upon the truth and accuracy of the representations,
warranties, agreements, acknowledgments and understandings of such Purchaser
set forth herein in order to determine the applicability of such exemptions
and the suitability of such Purchaser to acquire the Purchased Units and the
Conversion Units issuable upon conversion thereof.

Section 4.06 Sufficient Funds. Such Purchaser will have available to it at the
Closing sufficient funds to enable such Purchaser to pay in full at the
Closing the entire amount of such Purchaser's Funding Obligation in
immediately available cash funds.

Section 4.07 No Prohibited Trading. During the fifteen (15) day period prior
to the date hereof, no Purchaser has (a) offered, sold, contracted to sell,
sold any option or contract to purchase, purchased any option or contract to
sell, granted any option, right or warrant to purchase, lent, or otherwise
transferred or disposed of, directly or indirectly, any of the Purchased Units
or (b) directly or indirectly engaged in any short sales or other derivative
or hedging transactions with respect to the Purchased Units, including by
means of any swap or other transaction or arrangement that transfers or that
is designed to, or that might reasonably be expected to, result in the
transfer to another, in whole or in part, of any of the economic consequences
of ownership of any Purchased Units, regardless of whether any transaction
described in this Section 4.07 is to be settled by delivery of Series A
Preferred Units, Common Units or other securities, in cash or otherwise.

ARTICLE V.

COVENANTS

Section 5.01 Conduct of Business. During the period commencing on the date of
this Agreement and ending on the Closing Date, each of the Partnership
Entities will use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct its business in
the ordinary course of business, preserve intact its existence and business
organization, Permits, goodwill and present business relationships with all
material customers, suppliers, licensors, distributors and others having
significant business relationships with the Partnership Entities (or any of
them), to the extent the Partnership believes in its sole discretion that such
relationships are and continue to be beneficial to the Partnership Entities
and their businesses.

Section 5.02 Listing of Units. Prior to the Closing, the Partnership will use
its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain approval for listing of the
Conversion Units, subject to notice of issuance, on the NYSE.





Section 5.03 Cooperation; Further Assurances. Each of the Partnership and the
Purchasers shall use its respective commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
all approvals and consents required by or necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents. Each of the Partnership and the Purchasers agrees to execute and
deliver all such documents or instruments, to take all commercially reasonable
action and to do all other commercially reasonable things it determines to be
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws and regulations or as
otherwise reasonably requested by the other to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 5.04 Lock-up Agreement. Without the prior written consent of the
Partnership, except as specifically provided in this Agreement or as otherwise
provided in the Partnership Agreement, each Purchaser and its Affiliates shall
not, (a) during the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the
first anniversary of the Closing Date, offer, sell, contract to sell, sell any
option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant
any option, right or warrant to purchase, lend, or otherwise transfer or
dispose of, directly or indirectly, any of the Purchased Units, (b) during the
period commencing on the date hereof and ending on the second anniversary of
the Closing Date, directly or indirectly engage in any short sales or other
derivative or hedging transactions with respect to the Purchased Units, (c)
transfer any Purchased Units to any non-U.S. resident individual, non-U.S.
corporation or partnership, or any other non-U.S. entity, including any
foreign governmental entity, including by means of any swap or other
transaction or arrangement that transfers or that is designed to, or that
might reasonably be expected to, result in the transfer to another, in whole
or in part, of any of the economic consequences of ownership of any Purchased
Units, regardless of whether any transaction described in clauses (a) through
(c) above is to be settled by delivery of Series A Preferred Units, Common
Units or other securities, in cash or otherwise (provided, however, that the
foregoing shall not apply if, prior to any such transfer or arrangement, such
individual, corporation, partnership or other entity establishes to the
satisfaction of the Partnership, its entitlement to a complete exemption from
tax withholding, including under Code Sections 1441, 1442, 1445 and 1471
through 1474, and the Treasury regulations thereunder), or (d) effect any
transfer of Purchased Units or Conversion Units in a manner that violates the
terms of the Partnership Agreement; provided, however, that such Purchaser may
pledge all or any portion of its Purchased Units to any holders of obligations
owed by the Purchaser, including to the trustee for, or Representative of,
such holders; provided, further, that such Purchaser may transfer any
Purchased Units to (i) an Affiliate of such Purchaser or (ii) any other
Purchaser. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any transferee receiving any
Purchased Units pursuant to this Section 5.04 shall agree to the restrictions
set forth in this Section 5.04. For the avoidance of doubt, in no way does
this Section 5.04 prohibit changes in the composition of any Purchaser or its
partners or members so long as such changes in composition only relate to
changes in direct or indirect ownership of the Purchaser among such Purchaser,
its Affiliates and the limited partners of the private equity fund vehicles
that indirectly own such Purchaser. After the first anniversary of the Closing
Date, the Purchasers and their respective Affiliates or other Holders of
Purchased Units may only transfer Purchased Units in an aggregate amount not
less than $50 million based on the Unit Purchase Price, (or such lesser amount
if it (x) constitutes the remaining holdings of the Purchaser or Holder or (y)
has been approved by the General Partner, in its sole discretion), subject to
compliance with applicable securities laws and the Partnership Agreement;
provided that the provisions of this sentence shall not eliminate, modify or
reduce the obligations set forth in clauses (b), (c) or (d)



above. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in subclause (a) of this
Section 5.04, but subject to subclauses (b) and (c) of this Section 5.04,
during the period beginning on the date hereof and ending on the date that is
60 days after the Closing Date (the "Non-Affiliate Transfer Period"),
Stonepeak and its Affiliates may transfer or dispose of Purchased Units to one
or more non-Affiliates of Stonepeak, subject to the consent of the Partnership
as to the identity of the transferee (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided, however, that (A) any transfer
made pursuant to this sentence must consist of Purchased Units in an amount
not less than $25 million based on the Unit Purchase Price, (B) the aggregate
amount of Purchased Units and rights to purchase Purchased Units transferred
pursuant to this sentence and Section 8.10 shall not be greater than $100
million based on the Unit Purchase Price and (C) a maximum of two transfers
may be made pursuant to this sentence and Section 8.10.

Section 5.05 Tax Estimates. On or before April 1 of each year beginning in
2019, the Partnership shall provide each Purchaser that continues to own
Purchased Units a good faith estimate (and reasonable supporting calculations)
of whether there was sufficient Unrealized Gain attributable to the
Partnership property as of December 31 of the previous year such that, if any
of such Purchaser's Series A Preferred Units were converted to Common Units
and such Unrealized Gain was allocated to such Purchaser pursuant to Section
5.5(d)(iii) of the Second AandR LPA (taking proper account of allocations of
higher priority), such Purchaser's Capital Account in respect of its Common
Units would be equal to the Per Unit Capital Amount for an Initial Common Unit
without any need for corrective allocations under Section 6.2(h) of the Second
AandR LPA.

In addition, following receipt of a written request from any Purchaser that,
together with its Affiliates, acquired $100 million or more Purchased Units on
the Closing Date, so long as such Purchaser or any of its respective
Affiliates continues to own Purchased Units, the Partnership shall provide
such Purchaser with a good faith estimate (and reasonable supporting
calculations) of whether there is sufficient Unrealized Gain attributable to
the Partnership property on the date of such request such that, if any of such
Purchaser's Series A Preferred Units were converted to Common Units and such
Unrealized Gain was allocated to such Purchaser pursuant to Section
5.5(d)(iii) of the Second AandR LPA (taking proper account of allocations of
higher priority), such Purchaser's Capital Account in respect of its Common
Units would be equal to the Per Unit Capital Amount for an Initial Common Unit
without any need for corrective allocations under Section 6.2(h) of the Second
AandR LPA. Each such Purchaser, together with its Affiliates, shall be entitled
to make such a request not more than once per calendar year.

For purposes of this Section 5.05, all capitalized terms used but not defined
herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Second AandR LPA.

ARTICLE VI.

INDEMNIFICATION, COSTS AND EXPENSES

Section 6.01 Indemnification by the Partnership. The Partnership agrees to
indemnify each Purchaser and its Representatives (collectively, "Purchaser
Related Parties") from costs, losses, liabilities, damages or expenses of any
kind or nature whatsoever, and hold each of them harmless against, any and all
actions, suits, proceedings (including any investigations, litigation



or inquiries), demands and causes of action, and, in connection therewith,
promptly upon demand, pay or reimburse each of them for all costs, losses,
liabilities, damages or expenses of any kind or nature whatsoever (including
the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel and all other reasonable
expenses incurred in connection with investigating, defending or preparing to
defend any such matter that may be incurred by them or asserted against or
involve any of them), whether or not involving a Third-Party Claim, as a
result of, arising out of, or in any way related to (a) the failure of any of
the representations or warranties made by the Partnership contained herein to
be true and correct in all material respects as of the date made (except to
the extent any representation or warranty includes the word "material,"
Material Adverse Effect or words of similar import, with respect to which such
representation or warranty, or applicable portions thereof, must have been
true and correct) or (b) the breach of any covenants of the Partnership
contained herein; provided that, in the case of the immediately preceding
clause (a), such claim for indemnification is made prior to the expiration of
the survival period of such representation or warranty; and provided, further,
that for purposes of determining when an indemnification claim has been made,
the date upon which a Purchaser Related Party shall have given notice (stating
in reasonable detail the basis of the claim for indemnification) to the
Partnership shall constitute the date upon which such claim has been made; and
provided, further, that the aggregate liability of the Partnership to each
Purchaser pursuant to this Section 6.01 shall not be greater in amount than
such Purchaser's Funding Obligation, and the aggregate liability of the
Partnership to all Purchasers pursuant to this Section 6.01 shall not exceed
the Purchase Price. No Purchaser Related Party shall be entitled to recover
special, indirect, exemplary, lost profits, speculative or punitive damages
under this Section 6.01; provided, however, that such limitation shall not
prevent any Purchaser Related Party from recovering under this Section 6.01
for any such damages to the extent that such damages are in the form of
diminution in value or are payable to a third party in connection with any
Third-Party Claims.

Section 6.02 Indemnification by the Purchasers. Each Purchaser agrees,
severally and not jointly, to indemnify the Partnership, the General Partner
and their respective Representatives (collectively, "Partnership Related
Parties") from, costs, losses, liabilities, damages or expenses of any kind or
nature whatsoever, and hold each of them harmless against, any and all
actions, suits, proceedings (including any investigations, litigation or
inquiries), demands and causes of action, and, in connection therewith,
promptly upon demand, pay or reimburse each of them for all costs, losses,
liabilities, damages or expenses of any kind or nature whatsoever (including
the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel and all other reasonable
expenses incurred in connection with investigating, defending or preparing to
defend any such matter that may be incurred by them or asserted against or
involve any of them), whether or not involving a Third-Party Claim, as a
result of, arising out of, or in any way related to (a) the failure of any of
the representations or warranties made by such Purchaser contained herein to
be true and correct in all material respects as of the date made (except to
the extent any representation or warranty includes the word "material,"
Material Adverse Effect or words of similar import, with respect to which such
representation or warranty, or applicable portions thereof, must have been
true and correct) or (b) the breach of any of the covenants of such Purchaser
contained herein; provided that, in the case of the immediately preceding
clause (a), such claim for indemnification relating to a breach of any
representation or warranty is made prior to the expiration of the survival
period of such representation or warranty; and provided, further, that for
purposes of determining when an indemnification claim has been



made, the date upon which a Partnership Related Party shall have given notice
(stating in reasonable detail the basis of the claim for indemnification) to
such Purchaser shall constitute the date upon which such claim has been made;
and provided, further, that the aggregate liability of any Purchaser pursuant
to this Section 6.02 shall not be greater in amount than the sum of such
Purchaser's Funding Obligation plus any distributions paid to such Purchaser
with respect to the Purchased Units. No Partnership Related Party shall be
entitled to recover special, indirect, exemplary, incidental, lost profits,
speculative or punitive damages under this Section 6.02; provided, however,
that such limitation shall not prevent any Partnership Related Party from
recovering under this Section 6.02 for any such damages to the extent that
such damages are in the form of diminution in value or are payable to a third
party in connection with any Third-Party Claims.

Section 6.03 Indemnification Procedure.

(a) A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a Third-Party
Claim may be asserted by notice to the party from whom indemnification is
sought; provided, however, that failure to so notify the indemnifying party
shall not preclude the indemnified party from any indemnification which it may
claim in accordance with this Article VI, except as otherwise provided in
Section 6.01 and Section 6.02.

(b) Promptly after any Partnership Related Party or Purchaser Related Party
(hereinafter, the "Indemnified Party") has received notice of any
indemnifiable claim hereunder, or the commencement of any action, suit or
proceeding by a third person, which the Indemnified Party believes in good
faith is an indemnifiable claim under this Agreement (each a "Third-Party
Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall give the indemnitor hereunder (the
"Indemnifying Party") written notice of such Third-Party Claim or the
commencement of such action, suit or proceeding, but failure to so notify the
Indemnifying Party will not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability
it may have to such Indemnified Party hereunder except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure. Such notice shall
state the nature and the basis of such Third-Party Claim to the extent then
known. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend and settle, at
its own expense and by its own counsel who shall be reasonably acceptable to
the Indemnified Party, any such matter as long as the Indemnifying Party
pursues the same diligently and in good faith. If the Indemnifying Party
undertakes to defend or settle, it shall promptly, and in no event later than
ten (10) days, notify the Indemnified Party of its intention to do so, and the
Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel
in all commercially reasonable respects in the defense thereof and the
settlement thereof. Such cooperation shall include, but shall not be limited
to, furnishing the Indemnifying Party with any books, records and other
information reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party and in the
Indemnified Party's possession or control. Such cooperation of the Indemnified
Party shall be at the cost of the Indemnifying Party. After the Indemnifying
Party has notified the Indemnified Party of its intention to undertake to
defend or settle any such asserted liability, and for so long as the
Indemnifying Party diligently pursues such defense, the Indemnifying Party
shall not be liable for any additional legal expenses incurred by the
Indemnified Party in connection with any defense or settlement of such
asserted liability; provided, however, that the Indemnified Party shall be
entitled (i) at its expense, to participate in the defense of such asserted
liability and the negotiations of the settlement thereof and (ii) if (A) the
Indemnifying Party has, within ten (10) Business Days of when the Indemnified
Party provides written notice of a Third-Party Claim, failed (1) to assume the
defense or employ



counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party or (2) to notify the
Indemnified Party of such assumption or (B) if the defendants in any such
action include both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party and
counsel to the Indemnified Party shall have concluded that there may be
reasonable defenses available to the Indemnified Party that are different from
or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Party or if the
interests of the Indemnified Party reasonably may be deemed to conflict with
the interests of the Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party shall have
the right to select one separate counsel and to assume such legal defense and
otherwise to participate in the defense of such action, with the expenses and
fees of such separate counsel and other expenses related to such participation
to be reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party as incurred. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not settle any
indemnified claim without the consent of the Indemnified Party, unless the
settlement thereof imposes no liability or obligation on, and includes a
complete release from liability of, and does not include any admission of
wrongdoing or malfeasance by, the Indemnified Party.

Section 6.04 Tax Matters. All indemnification payments under this Article VI
shall be adjustments to the Purchaser's Funding Obligation except as otherwise
required by applicable Law.

ARTICLE VII.

TERMINATION

Section 7.01 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Closing:

(a) with respect to any particular Purchaser, by mutual written consent of the
Partnership and such Purchaser;

(b) with respect to any particular Purchaser, by written notice from either
the Partnership or such Purchaser if any Governmental Authority with lawful
jurisdiction shall have issued a final order, decree or ruling or taken any
other final action restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents and such order, decree,
ruling or other action is or shall have become final and nonappealable; or

(c) by written notice from the Partnership or a Purchaser, with respect to
itself but not any other Purchaser, if the Closing does not occur by 11:59
p.m. on May 31, 2016 Houston, Texas time; provided, however, that no party may
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.01(c) if such party is, at
the time of providing such written notice, in breach of any of its obligations
under this Agreement.

Section 7.02 Certain Effects of Termination. In the event that this Agreement
is terminated pursuant to Section 7.01:

(a) except as set forth in Section 7.02(b), this Agreement shall become null
and void and have no further force or effect, but the parties shall not be
released from any liability arising from or in connection with any breach
hereof occurring prior to such termination;

(b) regardless of any purported termination of this Agreement, the provisions
of Article VI and all indemnification rights and obligations of the
Partnership and the Purchasers



thereunder, this Section 7.02 and the provisions of Article VIII shall remain
operative and in full force and effect as between the Partnership and the
Purchasers; and

(c) subject to Section 8.06(a), the Confidentiality Agreements shall remain in
effect until each such Confidentiality Agreement expires in accordance with
its terms.

ARTICLE VIII.

MISCELLANEOUS

Section 8.01 Expenses. Except as follows, all costs and expenses, including
fees and disbursements of counsel, financial advisors and accountants,
incurred in connection with the Transaction Documents and the transactions
contemplated thereby shall be paid by the party incurring such costs and
expenses:

(a) Promptly following receipt of an invoice therefore containing reasonable
supporting detail, the Partnership shall reimburse Stonepeak for the
reasonable fees and expenses of Sidley Austin LLP, counsel to Stonepeak, of up
to $150,000 (with legal fees and expenses of Sidley Austin LLP in excess of
$150,000 to be paid pro rata by all the Purchasers in proportion to the
aggregate number of Purchased Units purchased by each); and

(b) Each Purchaser shall be entitled to, and shall, net against its respective
Funding Obligation at the Closing an amount equal to its pro rata share of
1.5% of the Total Funding Obligation with respect to the Closing (the
"Transaction Fee"). For United States federal income tax purposes, the
Transaction Fee and the reimbursements described in Section 8.01(a) are, and
will be treated by the parties as, adjustments to the Purchase Price paid by
the Purchasers for the Purchased Units.

Section 8.02 Interpretation. Article, Section, Schedule and Exhibit references
in this Agreement are references to the corresponding Article, Section,
Schedule or Exhibit to this Agreement, unless otherwise specified. All
Exhibits and Schedules to this Agreement are hereby incorporated and made a
part hereof as if set forth in full herein and are an integral part of this
Agreement. All references to instruments, documents, Contracts and agreements
are references to such instruments, documents, Contracts and agreements as the
same may be amended, supplemented and otherwise modified from time to time,
unless otherwise specified. The word "including" shall mean "including but not
limited to" and shall not be construed to limit any general statement that it
follows to the specific or similar items or matters immediately following it.
Whenever the Partnership has an obligation under the Transaction Documents,
the expense of complying with that obligation shall be an expense of the
Partnership unless otherwise specified. Any reference in this Agreement to "$"
shall mean U.S. dollars. Whenever any determination, consent or approval is to
be made or given by a Purchaser, such action shall be in such Purchaser's sole
discretion, unless otherwise specified in this Agreement. If any provision in
the Transaction Documents is held to be illegal, invalid, not binding or
unenforceable, (a) such provision shall be fully severable and the Transaction
Documents shall be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid, not
binding or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part of the
Transaction Documents, and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force
and effect, and (b) the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify
the Transaction Documents so as to effect the original intent of the parties
as closely as possible in an acceptable



manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as
originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible. When calculating the
period of time before which, within which or following which any act is to be
done or step taken pursuant to the Transaction Documents, the date that is the
reference date in calculating such period shall be excluded. If the last day
of such period is not a Business Day, the period in question shall end on the
next succeeding Business Day. Any words imparting the singular number only
shall include the plural and vice versa. The words such as "herein,"
"hereinafter," "hereof" and "hereunder" refer to this Agreement as a whole and
not merely to a subdivision in which such words appear unless the context
otherwise requires. The provision of a Table of Contents, the division of this
Agreement into Articles, Sections and other subdivisions and the insertion of
headings are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect or be
utilized in construing or interpreting this Agreement.

Section 8.03 Survival of Provisions. The representations and warranties set
forth in Section 3.01, Section 3.02, Section 3.13, Section 3.16, Section 3.18,
Section 4.01, Section 4.02, Section 4.04, and Sections 4.05(a), (b) and (e)
hereunder shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement
indefinitely, the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.27
shall survive until 60 days after the applicable statute of limitations
(taking into account any extensions thereof) and the other representations and
warranties set forth herein shall survive for a period of twelve (12) months
following the Closing Date, regardless of any investigation made by or on
behalf of the Partnership or the Purchasers. The covenants made in this
Agreement or any other Transaction Document shall survive the Closing and
remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of acceptance of any
of the Purchased Units and payment therefor and repayment, conversion or
repurchase thereof. Regardless of any purported general termination of this
Agreement, the provisions of Article VI and all indemnification rights and
obligations of the Partnership and the Purchasers thereunder, and this Article
VIII shall remain operative and in full force and effect as between the
Partnership and each Purchaser, unless the Partnership and the applicable
Purchaser execute a writing that expressly (with specific references to the
applicable Section or subsection of this Agreement) terminates such rights and
obligations as between the Partnership and such Purchaser.

Section 8.04 No Waiver: Modifications in Writing.

(a) Delay. No failure or delay on the part of any party in exercising any
right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall
any single or partial exercise of any such right, power or remedy preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
remedy. The remedies provided for herein are cumulative and are not exclusive
of any remedies that may be available to a party at law or in equity or
otherwise.

(b) Specific Waiver. Except as otherwise provided herein, no amendment,
waiver, consent, modification or termination of any provision of any
Transaction Document (except in the case of the Partnership Agreement for
amendments adopted pursuant to Article XIII thereof) shall be effective unless
signed by each of the parties thereto affected by such amendment, waiver,
consent, modification or termination. Any amendment, supplement or
modification of or to any provision of any Transaction Document, any waiver of
any provision of any Transaction Document and any consent to any departure by
the Partnership from the terms of any provision of any Transaction Document
shall be effective only in the specific instance and



for the specific purpose for which made or given. Except where notice is
specifically required by this Agreement, no notice to or demand on the
Partnership in any case shall entitle the Partnership to any other or further
notice or demand in similar or other circumstances. Any investigation by or on
behalf of any party shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver by the party
taking such action of compliance with any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement contained herein.

Section 8.05 Binding Effect. This Agreement shall be binding upon the
Partnership, each of the Purchasers and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, this
Agreement shall not be construed so as to confer any right or benefit upon any
Person other than the parties to this Agreement and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

Section 8.06 Non-Disclosure.

(a) Stonepeak may share Confidential Information with (i) any of the limited
partners of the private equity fund vehicles that indirectly own Stonepeak at
any time; provided, that any such limited partner will be deemed to be a
"Representative" of Stonepeak under its Confidentiality Agreement, and, (ii)
during the Non-Affiliate Transfer Period, Stonepeak may, with the prior
written consent of the Partnership (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), share Confidential Information (as defined
in Stonepeak's Confidentiality Agreement) with any bona fide potential
transferee of Purchased Units; provided, that such potential transferee
executes a letter agreement with Stonepeak agreeing (A) that it and its
representatives shall be deemed "Representatives" under Stonepeak's
Confidentiality Agreement and responsible for any breaches of such
Confidentiality Agreement as if originally party thereto and (B) that the
Partnership is an express third-party beneficiary of such letter. Except as
set forth in the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall not impact the terms
and provisions of any of the Confidentiality Agreements. Subject to the
foregoing, the Confidentiality Agreements shall continue to be in full force
and effect, pursuant to the terms and conditions thereof.

(b) Other than filings made by the Partnership with the Commission, the
Partnership and any of its Representatives may disclose in writing the
identity of, or any other information concerning, the Purchasers or any of
their respective Affiliates only after providing the Purchasers a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such written disclosure (with such
comments being incorporated or reflected, to the extent reasonable, in any
such written disclosure); provided, however, that nothing in this Section 8.06
shall delay any required filing or other disclosure with the NYSE or any
Governmental Authority or otherwise hinder the Partnership Entities' or their
Representatives' ability to timely comply with all Laws or rules and
regulations of the Commission, the NYSE or other Governmental Authority.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 8.06, the
Partnership and the General Partner agree that the Purchasers may (i)
publicize their ownership in the Partnership, as well as the identity of the
Partnership, the size of the investment and its pricing terms with respect to
the Series A Preferred Units on its internet site or in marketing materials,
press releases, published "tombstone" announcements or any other print or
electronic medium and (ii) display the Partnership's corporate logo in
conjunction with any such reference.





Section 8.07 Communications. All notices and demands provided for hereunder
shall be in writing and shall be given by registered or certified mail, return
receipt requested, telecopy, electronic mail, air courier guaranteeing
overnight delivery or personal delivery to the following addresses

(a) If to the Purchasers, to the addresses set forth on Schedule A.

(b) If to the Partnership:

or to such other address as the Partnership or the Purchasers may designate in
writing. All notices and communications shall be deemed to have been duly
given: at the time delivered by hand, if personally delivered; upon actual
receipt if sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, or
regular mail, if mailed; upon actual receipt of the facsimile, if sent via
facsimile; when sent, if sent by electronic mail prior to 5 pm Houston, Texas
time on a Business Day, or on the next succeeding Business Day, if not; and
upon actual receipt when delivered to an air courier guaranteeing overnight
delivery.

Section 8.08 Removal of Legend. In connection with a sale of Purchased Units
or Conversion Units by a Purchaser in reliance on Rule 144 promulgated under
the Securities Act, the applicable Purchaser or its broker shall deliver to
the Partnership a broker representation letter providing to the Partnership
any information the Partnership deems necessary to determine that



the sale of such Units is made in compliance with Rule 144 promulgated under
the Securities Act, including, as may be appropriate, a certification that the
Purchaser is not an Affiliate of the Partnership (as defined in Rule 144
promulgated under the Securities Act) and a certification as to the length of
time the such units have been held. Upon receipt of such representation
letter, the Partnership shall promptly remove the notation of a restrictive
legend in such Purchaser's book-entry account maintained by the Partnership,
including the legend referred to in Section 4.05, and the Partnership shall
bear all costs associated with the removal of such legend in the Partnership's
books. At such time as the Conversion Units have been sold pursuant to an
effective registration statement under the Securities Act or the Purchased
Units or the Conversion Units have been held by any Purchaser for more than
one year where such Purchaser is not, and has not been in the preceding three
months, an affiliate of the Partnership (as defined in Rule 144 promulgated
under the Securities Act), if the book-entry account of such Purchaser still
bears the notation of the restrictive legend referred to in Section 4.05, the
Partnership agrees, upon request of the Purchaser or its permitted assignee,
to take all steps necessary to promptly effect the removal of the legend
described in Section 4.05, and the Partnership shall bear all costs associated
with the removal of such legend in the Partnership's books, regardless of
whether the request is made in connection with a sale or otherwise, so long as
such Purchaser or its permitted assigns provide to the Partnership any
information the Partnership deems reasonably necessary to determine that the
legend is no longer required under the Securities Act or applicable state
Laws, including (if there is no such registration statement) a certification
that the holder is not an Affiliate of the Partnership (as defined in Rule 144
promulgated under the Securities Act) and to consent to the notation of an
appropriate restriction, as well as a covenant to inform the Partnership if it
should thereafter become an affiliate (as defined in Rule 144 promulgated
under the Securities Act), and a certification as to the length of time such
units have been held. The Partnership shall cooperate with each Purchaser to
effect the removal of the legend referred to in Section 4.05 at any time such
legend is no longer appropriate.

Section 8.09 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the other Transaction
Documents, the Confidentiality Agreements and the other agreements and
documents referred to herein are intended by the parties as a final expression
of their agreement and intended to be a complete and exclusive statement of
the agreement and understanding of the parties hereto in respect of the
subject matter contained herein and therein. There are no restrictions,
promises, warranties or undertakings, other than those set forth or referred
to in this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents or the Confidentiality
Agreements with respect to the rights granted by the Partnership or any of its
Affiliates or the Purchasers or any of their respective Affiliates. This
Agreement, the other Transaction Documents, the Confidentiality Agreements and
the other agreements and documents referred to herein or therein supersede all
prior agreements and understandings among the parties with respect to such
subject matter.

Section 8.10 Assignment. Prior to the Closing, Stonepeak and its Affiliates
may transfer or assign their rights to purchase Purchased Units under this
Agreement to one or more Persons, subject to the consent of the Partnership as
to the identity of the transferee (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided, however, that (a) any assignment
made pursuant to this Section 8.10 must consist of the right and related
obligations to purchase Purchased Units in an amount not less than $25 million
based on the Unit Purchase Price, (b) the aggregate amount of Purchased Units
and rights to purchase Purchased Units transferred pursuant to this



Section 8.10 and the last sentence of Section 5.04 shall not be greater than
$100 million based on the Unit Purchase Price, (c) any assignee of Stonepeak's
or its Affiliates' rights pursuant to this Section 8.10 must execute and
deliver to the Partnership at the Closing a Joinder Agreement in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit D (the "Joinder Agreement") and (d) a maximum of
two transfers may be made pursuant to this Section 8.10 and the last sentence
of Section 5.04. If, and only if, such assignee consummates the purchase at
the Closing, then concurrently with the Closing, the assignor shall be
released in full from its obligations under this Agreement with respect to the
assigned portion of the Purchased Units and the assignee shall be considered a
Purchaser hereunder with respect to such portion of the Purchased Units. Prior
to and until the Closing occurs, the assignor shall remain fully responsible
for its obligations under the Agreement, notwithstanding any execution of a
Joinder Agreement by the assignee. In the event of any such assignment,
Schedule A shall be amended to reflect the assignee as an additional or
alternate Purchaser and the corresponding number of Purchased Units to be
purchased by such assignee.

Section 8.11 Governing Law: Submission to Jurisdiction. This Agreement, and
all claims or causes of action (whether in contract or tort) that may be based
upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution
or performance of this Agreement (including any claim or cause of action based
upon, arising out of or related to any representation or warranty made in or
in connection with this Agreement), will be construed in accordance with and
governed by the Laws of the State of Delaware without regard to principles of
conflicts of laws. Any action against any party relating to the foregoing
shall be brought in any federal or state court of competent jurisdiction
located within the State of Delaware, and the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or state
court located within the State of Delaware over any such action. The parties
hereby irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
any objection which they may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of
any such dispute brought in such court or any defense of inconvenient forum
for the maintenance of such dispute. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a
judgment in any such dispute may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on
the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

Section 8.12 Waiver of Jury Trial. THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT EACH HEREBY
WAIVES, AND AGREES TO CAUSE ITS AFFILIATES TO WAIVE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR
CAUSE OF ACTION (a) ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR (b) IN ANY WAY CONNECTED
WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES HERETO IN RESPECT
OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED HERETO, IN EACH CASE
WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT,
EQUITY OR OTHERWISE. THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT EACH HEREBY AGREES AND
CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE
DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY AND THAT THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT
MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OF A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS
WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR
RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

Section 8.13 Exclusive Remedy.



(a) Each party hereto hereby acknowledges and agrees that the rights of each
party to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby are special, unique
and of extraordinary character and that, if any party violates or fails or
refuses to perform any covenant or agreement made by it herein, the non-
breaching party may be without an adequate remedy at law. If any party
violates or fails or refuses to perform any covenant or agreement made by such
party herein, the non-breaching party subject to the terms hereof and in
addition to any remedy at law for damages or other relief, may (at any time
prior to the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VII)
institute and prosecute an action in any court of competent jurisdiction to
enforce specific performance of such covenant or agreement or seek any other
equitable relief.

(b) The sole and exclusive remedy for any and all claims arising under, out
of, or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
shall be the rights of indemnification set forth in Article VI only, and no
Person will have any other entitlement, remedy or recourse, whether in
contract, tort or otherwise, it being agreed that all of such other remedies,
entitlements and recourse are expressly waived and released by the parties
hereto to the fullest extent permitted by Law. Notwithstanding anything in the
foregoing to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall limit or otherwise
restrict a fraud claim brought by any party hereto or the right to seek
specific performance pursuant to Section 8.13(a).

Section 8.14 No Recourse Against Others.

(a) All claims, obligations, liabilities or causes of action (whether in
contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or granted by statute) that may be
based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by reason of, be connected with
or relate in any manner to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement (including any representation or warranty made
in, in connection with, or as an inducement to, this Agreement), may be made
only against (and are expressly limited to) the Partnership and the
Purchasers. No Person other than the Partnership or the Purchasers, including
no member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate or Representative thereof, nor any
member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate or Representative of any of the
foregoing, shall have any liability (whether in contract or in tort, in law or
in equity, or granted by statute) for any claims, causes of action,
obligations or liabilities arising under, out of, in connection with or
related in any manner to this Agreement or based on, in respect of or by
reason of this Agreement or its negotiation, execution, performance or breach;
and, to the maximum extent permitted by Law, each of the Partnership and the
Purchasers hereby waives and releases all such liabilities, claims, causes of
action and obligations against any such third Person.

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, to the maximum extent permitted by Law,
(i) each of the Partnership and the Purchasers hereby waives and releases any
and all rights, claims, demands or causes of action that may otherwise be
available at law or in equity, or granted by statute, to avoid or disregard
the entity form of the other or otherwise impose liability of the other on any
third Person in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby, whether
granted by statute or based on theories of equity, agency, control,
instrumentality, alter ego, domination, sham, single business enterprise,
piercing the veil, unfairness, undercapitalization or otherwise; and (ii) each
of the Partnership and the Purchasers disclaims any reliance upon any third
Person with respect to the performance of this Agreement or any representation
or warranty made in, in connection with or as an inducement to this Agreement.



Section 8.15 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Nothing in this Agreement, express
or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person, other than the
Partnership, the Purchasers and, for purposes of Section 8.14 only, any
member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate or Representative of the Partnership
or the Purchasers, or any member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate or
Representative of any of the foregoing, any right, benefit or remedy of any
nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

Section 8.16 Execution in Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which counterparts, when so executed and delivered,
shall be deemed to be an original and all of which counterparts, taken
together, shall constitute but one and the same agreement.

Schedule B-1 

EXHIBIT A

FORM OF OPINION OF VINSON and ELKINS L.L.P.

Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meanings assigned to
such terms in the Series A Preferred Unit Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase
Agreement"). The Partnership shall furnish to the Purchasers at the Closing an
opinion of Vinson and Elkins L.L.P., counsel for the Partnership, addressed to
the Purchasers and dated the Closing Date in form satisfactory to the
Purchasers, stating that:

(i) Each of the Partnership, the General Partner and the subsidiaries of the
Partnership listed on Schedule I hereto (the "Material Subsidiaries") is
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation or formation, as applicable. Each of the Partnership, the
General Partner and the Material Subsidiaries has all requisite corporate,
limited liability company or partnership power and authority, as applicable,
under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or formation, as
applicable, necessary to own or lease its properties and to conduct its
business, in each case in all material respects as described in the MPLX SEC
Documents.

(ii) Except as have been waived or satisfied or as contained in the
Partnership Agreement, there are no preemptive rights or other rights to
subscribe for or to purchase, nor any restriction upon the voting or transfer
of, any Purchased Units or Conversion Units pursuant to the Organizational
Documents of the Partnership or any agreement filed as an exhibit to the
Partnership's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015
or any Current Report or Quarterly Report filed thereafter to which the
Partnership is a party or by which the Partnership may be bound.

(iii) The Purchased Units to be issued and sold to the Purchasers by the
Partnership pursuant to the Purchase Agreement and the limited partner
interests represented thereby have been duly authorized in accordance with the
Partnership Agreement and, when issued and delivered to the Purchasers against
payment therefor in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Agreement, will
be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable (except as such
nonassessability may be affected by matters described in Sections 17-303,
17-607 and 17-804 of the Delaware LP Act); and, other than the rights granted
to the General Partner under Sections 5.2 and 5.8 of the Partnership
Agreement, the issuance and sale of the Purchased Units are not subject to any
preemptive rights of any securityholder of the Partnership arising under the
Delaware LP Act as currently in effect or the Partnership's Organizational
Documents as currently in effect.

(iv) The Conversion Units have been duly authorized by the General Partner on
behalf of the Partnership pursuant to the Partnership Agreement and, when
issued upon conversion of the Purchased Units in accordance with the terms of
the Partnership Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable (except as such nonassessability may be affected by Sections
17-303, 17-607 and 17-804 of the Delaware LP Act); and, other than the rights
granted to the General Partner under Sections 5.2 and 5.8 of the Partnership
Agreement, the issuance of the Conversion Units are not subject to any
preemptive rights of any securityholder of the



Exhibit A-1 

Partnership arising under the Delaware LP Act as currently in effect or the
Partnership's Organizational Documents as currently in effect.

(v) No consent, approval, authorization, filing with or order of any federal
or Delaware court, Governmental Authority or body having jurisdiction over the
Partnership is required for the issuance and sale by the Partnership of the
Purchased Units, the execution, delivery and performance by the Partnership of
the Transaction Documents, or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Documents, except (i) as may be required in
connection with the Partnership's obligations under the Registration Rights
Agreement to register the resale of the Purchased Units or the Conversion
Units under the Securities Act, (ii) those that have been obtained, (iii) as
may be required under state securities or "Blue Sky" laws, as to which we do
not express any opinion, or (iv) such that the failure to obtain would not
have a Material Adverse Effect.

(vi) Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the
Purchasers and the Partnership contained in the Purchase Agreement, the offer,
issuance and sale of the Purchased Units by the Partnership to the Purchasers
solely in the manner contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, including the
issuance of the Conversion Units to such Purchasers upon conversion of the
Purchased Units in accordance with the Partnership Agreement (assuming such
conversion takes place as of the date hereof), are exempt from the
registration requirements of the Securities Act; provided, however, that no
opinion is expressed as to any subsequent sale or resale of the Purchased
Units or the Conversion Units.

(vii) The Partnership is not an "investment company" as such term is defined
in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

(viii) None of the offering, issuance or sale by the Partnership of the
Purchased Units or the execution, delivery and performance of the Transaction
Documents by the Partnership or the General Partner, as the case may be, or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby will result in a
breach or violation of (A) the Organizational Documents of the Partnership or
the General Partner, as the case may be, (B) any agreement filed as an exhibit
to the Partnership's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2015 or any Current Report or Quarterly Report filed thereafter or (C) the
Delaware LP Act or U.S. federal law, which in the case of clauses (B) or (C)
would be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; provided,
however, that we express no opinion pursuant to this paragraph (viii) with
respect to any securities or other anti-fraud law.

(ix) Each of Transaction Documents has been duly authorized and validly
executed and delivered by the Partnership or the General Partner, as the case
may be, and the Second AandR LPA constitutes a valid and binding obligation of
the General Partner, enforceable against such party in accordance with its
terms, except insofar as the enforceability thereof may be limited by (A)
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium or similar laws from time to time in effect affecting creditors'
rights and remedies generally and by general principles of equity (regardless
of whether such principles are considered in a proceeding in equity or at law)
and (B) public policy, applicable law relating to fiduciary duties and
indemnification and an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT OF 
LIMITED PARTNERSHIP OF MPLX LP

THIS SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP OF MPLX LP
dated as of [●], 2016, is entered into by and among MPLX GP LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company, as the General Partner, together with any other
Persons who are or become Partners in the Partnership or parties hereto as
provided herein.

WHEREAS, the General Partner and the other parties thereto entered into that
certain First Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of the
Partnership dated as of October 31, 2012 (the "2012 Agreement");

WHEREAS, the General Partner effected two amendments to the 2012 Agreement;
and

WHEREAS, the General Partner desires to amend and restate the 2012 Agreement
in its entirety to reflect such amendments, to provide for a new class of
convertible preferred securities and to provide for such other changes as the
General Partner has determined are necessary and appropriate.

NOW, THEREFORE, the General Partner does hereby amend and restate the 2012
Agreement, pursuant to its authority under Section 13.1 of the 2012 Agreement,
to provide, in its entirety, as follows:

ARTICLE I

DEFINITIONS

Section 1.1 Definitions. The following definitions shall be for all purposes,
unless otherwise clearly indicated to the contrary, applied to the terms used
in this Agreement.

"2012 Agreement" has the meaning set forth in the recitals to this Agreement.

"Acquiring Person" has the meaning set forth in the definition of "Elective
Fundamental Change."

"Acquisition" means any transaction in which any Group Member acquires
(through an asset acquisition, stock acquisition, merger or other form of
investment) control over all or a portion of the assets, properties or
business of another Person for the purpose of increasing, over the long-term,
the operating capacity or operating income of the Partnership Group from the
operating capacity or operating income of the Partnership Group existing
immediately prior to such transaction. For purposes of this definition, "long-
term" generally refers to a period of not less than twelve months.

"Additional Book Basis" means the portion of any remaining Carrying Value of
an Adjusted Property that is attributable to positive adjustments made to such
Carrying Value as a result of Book-Up Events. For purposes of determining the
extent that Carrying Value constitutes Additional Book Basis:



(a) Any negative adjustment made to the Carrying Value of an Adjusted Property
as a result of either a Book-Down Event or a Book-Up Event shall first be
deemed to offset or decrease that portion of the Carrying Value of such
Adjusted Property that is attributable to any prior positive adjustments made
thereto pursuant to a Book-Up Event or Book-Down Event; and

(b) If Carrying Value that constitutes Additional Book Basis is reduced as a
result of a Book-Down Event and the Carrying Value of other property is
increased as a result of such Book-Down Event, an allocable portion of any
such increase in Carrying Value shall be treated as Additional Book Basis;
provided, that the amount treated as Additional Book Basis pursuant hereto as
a result of such Book-Down Event shall not exceed the amount by which the
Aggregate Remaining Net Positive Adjustments after such Book-Down Event
exceeds the remaining Additional Book Basis attributable to all of the
Partnership's Adjusted Property after such Book-Down Event (determined without
regard to the application of this clause (b) to such Book-Down Event).

"Additional Book Basis Derivative Items" means any Book Basis Derivative Items
that are computed with reference to Additional Book Basis. To the extent that
the Additional Book Basis attributable to all of the Partnership's Adjusted
Property as of the beginning of any taxable period exceeds the Aggregate
Remaining Net Positive Adjustments as of the beginning of such period (the
"Excess Additional Book Basis"), the Additional Book Basis Derivative Items
for such period shall be reduced by the amount that bears the same ratio to
the amount of Additional Book Basis Derivative Items determined without regard
to this sentence as the Excess Additional Book Basis bears to the Additional
Book Basis as of the beginning of such period. With respect to a Disposed of
Adjusted Property, the Additional Book Basis Derivative Items shall be the
amount of Additional Book Basis taken into account in computing gain or loss
from the disposition of such Disposed of Adjusted Property.

"Adjusted Capital Account" means the Capital Account maintained for each
Partner as of the end of each taxable period of the Partnership, (a) increased
by any amounts that such Partner is obligated to restore under the standards
set by Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(c) (or is deemed
obligated to restore under Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704-2(g) and
1.704-2(i)(5)) and (b) decreased by (i) the amount of all losses and
deductions that, as of the end of such taxable period, are reasonably expected
to be allocated to such Partner in subsequent taxable periods under Sections
704(e)(2) and 706(d) of the Code and Treasury Regulation Section
1.751-1(b)(2)(ii), and (ii) the amount of all distributions that, as of the
end of such taxable period, are reasonably expected to be made to such Partner
in subsequent taxable periods in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
or otherwise to the extent they exceed offsetting increases to such Partner's
Capital Account that are reasonably expected to occur during (or prior to) the
taxable period in which such distributions are reasonably expected to be made
(other than increases as a result of a minimum gain chargeback pursuant to
Section 6.1(d)(i) or 6.1(d)(ii)). The foregoing definition of Adjusted Capital
Account is intended to comply with the provisions of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.
The "Adjusted Capital Account" of a Partner in respect of a General Partner
Interest, a Series A Preferred Unit, a Common Unit, a Class A Unit, a Class B
Unit, or any other specified interest in the Partnership shall be the amount
which such Adjusted Capital Account would be if



such General Partner Interest, a Series A Preferred Unit, a Common Unit, a
Class A Unit, Class B Unit or other interest in the Partnership were the only
interest in the Partnership held by such Partner from and after the date on
which such General Partner Interest, Series A Preferred Unit, Common Unit,
Class A Unit, Class B Unit or other interest in the Partnership was first
issued.

"Adjusted Class B Conversion Number" means, with respect to each Class B Unit
on any date of determination, the Conversion Number associated with such Class
B Unit, multiplied by a fraction equal to the sum of (i) 1,000,000,000,
divided by 1,050,000,000, plus (ii)(A)(I) one (1.00) minus (II) 1,000,000,000,
divided by 1,050,000,000, multiplied by (B)(I) 80% with respect to the time
period ending on but not including July 1, 2016, and (II) 100% with respect
all the time periods beginning on or after July 1, 2016.

"Adjusted Operating Surplus" means, with respect to any period, (a) Operating
Surplus generated with respect to such period less (b)(i) the amount of any
net increase in Working Capital Borrowings (or the Partnership's proportionate
share of any net increase in Working Capital Borrowings in the case of
Subsidiaries that are not wholly owned) with respect to such period and (ii)
the amount of any net decrease in cash reserves (or the Partnership's
proportionate share of any net decrease in cash reserves in the case of
Subsidiaries that are not wholly owned) for Operating Expenditures with
respect to such period not relating to an Operating Expenditure made with
respect to such period, and plus (c)(i) the amount of any net decrease in
Working Capital Borrowings (or the Partnership's proportionate share of any
net decrease in Working Capital Borrowings in the case of Subsidiaries that
are not wholly owned) with respect to such period, (ii) the amount of any net
decrease made in subsequent periods in cash reserves for Operating
Expenditures initially established with respect to such period to the extent
such decrease results in a reduction in Adjusted Operating Surplus in
subsequent periods pursuant to clause (b)(ii) above and (iii) the amount of
any net increase in cash reserves (or the Partnership's proportionate share of
any net increase in cash reserves in the case of Subsidiaries that are not
wholly owned) for Operating Expenditures with respect to such period required
by any debt instrument for the repayment of principal, interest or premium.
Adjusted Operating Surplus does not include that portion of Operating Surplus
included in clause (a)(i) of the definition of "Operating Surplus."

"Adjusted Property" means any property the Carrying Value of which has been
adjusted pursuant to Section 5.5(d).

"Affiliate" means, with respect to any Person, any other Person that directly
or indirectly through one or more intermediaries controls, is controlled by or
is under common control with, the Person in question. As used herein, the term
"control" means the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or
cause the direction of the management and policies of a Person, whether
through ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.

"Affiliate Retained Units" means Units held by the Organizational Limited
Partner or any Affiliate of the Organizational Limited Partner.

"Aggregate Quantity of IDR Reset Common Units" has the meaning given such term
in Section 5.11(a).



"Aggregate Remaining Net Positive Adjustments" means, as of the end of any
taxable period, the sum of the Remaining Net Positive Adjustments of all the
Partners.

"Agreed Allocation" means any allocation, other than a Required Allocation, of
an item of income, gain, loss or deduction pursuant to the provisions of
Section 6.1, including a Curative Allocation (if appropriate to the context in
which the term "Agreed Allocation" is used).

"Agreed Value" of any Contributed Property means the fair market value of such
property or asset at the time of contribution and in the case of an Adjusted
Property, the fair market value of such Adjusted Property on the date of the
revaluation event as described in Section 5.5(d), in both cases as determined
by the General Partner. The General Partner shall use such method as it
determines to be appropriate to allocate the aggregate Agreed Value of
Contributed Properties contributed to the Partnership in a single or
integrated transaction among each separate property on a basis proportional to
the fair market value of each Contributed Property.

"Agreement" means this Second Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited
Partnership of MPLX LP, as it may be amended, supplemented or restated from
time to time.

"Associate" means, when used to indicate a relationship with any Person, (a)
any corporation or organization of which such Person is a director, officer,
manager, general partner or managing member or is, directly or indirectly, the
owner of 20% or more of any class of voting stock or other voting interest,
(b) any trust or other estate in which such Person has at least a 20%
beneficial interest or as to which such Person serves as trustee or in a
similar fiduciary capacity, and (c) any relative or spouse of such Person, or
any relative of such spouse, who has the same principal residence as such
Person.

"Available Cash" means, with respect to any Quarter ending prior to the
Liquidation Date:

(a) the sum of:

(i) all cash and cash equivalents of the Partnership Group (or the
Partnership's proportionate share of cash and cash equivalents in the case of
Subsidiaries that are not wholly owned) on hand at the end of such Quarter;
and

(ii) if the General Partner so determines, all or any portion of additional
cash and cash equivalents of the Partnership Group (or the Partnership's
proportionate share of cash and cash equivalents in the case of Subsidiaries
that are not wholly owned) resulting from Working Capital Borrowings made
subsequent to the end of such Quarter; less

(b) the amount of any cash reserves established by the General Partner (or the
Partnership's proportionate share of cash reserves in the case of Subsidiaries
that are not wholly owned) to:



(i) provide for the proper conduct of the business of the Partnership Group
(including reserves for future capital expenditures and for anticipated future
credit needs of the Partnership Group) subsequent to such Quarter;

(ii) comply with applicable law or any loan agreement, security agreement,
mortgage, debt instrument or other agreement or obligation to which any Group
Member is a party or by which it is bound or its assets are subject; or

(iii) provide funds for distributions under Section 6.4 or Section 6.5 in
respect of any one or more of the next four Quarters;

provided, however, that the General Partner may not establish cash reserves
pursuant to subclause (iii) above if the effect of such reserves would be that
the Partnership is unable to distribute the Minimum Quarterly Distribution on
all Common Units, with respect to such Quarter; provided further, that
disbursements made by a Group Member or cash reserves established, increased
or reduced after the end of such Quarter but on or before the date of
determination of Available Cash with respect to such Quarter shall be deemed
to have been made, established, increased or reduced, for purposes of
determining Available Cash within such Quarter if the General Partner so
determines.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, "Available Cash" with respect to the Quarter in
which the Liquidation Date occurs and any subsequent Quarter shall equal zero.

"beneficial owner" has the meaning assigned to such term in Rule 13d-3 and
Rule 13d-5 under the Exchange Act, except that, in calculating the beneficial
ownership of any particular "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3)
of the Exchange Act), such "person" will be deemed to have beneficial
ownership of all securities that such "person" has the right to acquire by
conversion or exercise of other securities, whether such right is currently
exercisable or is exercisable only after the passage of time and the term
"beneficially owned" has a corresponding meaning.

"Board of Directors" means, with respect to the General Partner, its board of
directors or board of managers, if the General Partner is a corporation or
limited liability company, or the board of directors or board of managers of
the general partner of the General Partner, if the General Partner is a

the Carrying Value of such Contributed Property or Adjusted Property and the
adjusted basis thereof for federal income tax purposes as of such date. A
Partner's share of the Partnership's Book-Tax



Disparities in all of its Contributed Property and Adjusted Property will be
reflected by the difference between such Partner's Capital Account balance as
maintained pursuant to Section 5.5 and the hypothetical balance of such
Partner's Capital Account computed as if it had been maintained strictly in
accordance with federal income tax accounting principles.

"Book-Up Event" means an event that triggers a positive adjustment to the
Capital Accounts of the Partners pursuant to Section 5.5(d).

Preferred Unit, a Common Unit, a Class A Unit, a Class B Unit or any other
Partnership Interest shall be the amount which such Capital Account would be
if such Series A Preferred Unit, Common Unit, Class A Unit, Class B Unit or
other Partnership Interest was the only interest in the Partnership held by
such Partner from and after the date on which such Series A Preferred Unit,
Common Unit, Class A Unit, Class B Unit or other Partnership Interest was
first issued.

"Capital Contribution" means (a) any cash, cash equivalents or the Net Agreed
Value of Contributed Property that a Partner contributes to the Partnership or
that is contributed or deemed contributed to the Partnership on behalf of a

amount of any underwriting discounts or commissions) or (b) current
distributions that a Partner is entitled to receive but otherwise waives.

"Capital Improvement" means (a) the construction of new capital assets by a
Group Member, (b) the replacement, improvement or expansion of existing

interest, to fund such Group Member's pro rata share of the cost of the
construction of new, or the replacement, improvement or expansion of existing,
capital assets by such Person, in each case if and to the extent such
construction, replacement, improvement or expansion is made to increase, over
the long-term, the operating capacity or operating income of the Partnership
Group, in the case of clauses (a) and (b), or such Person, in the case of
clause (c), from the operating capacity or operating income of the Partnership

less than twelve months.

adjusted basis of such property for federal income tax purposes, all as of the
time of determination; provided that the Carrying Value of any property shall

changes, additions or other adjustments to the Carrying Value for dispositions
and acquisitions of Partnership properties, as deemed appropriate by the
General Partner.

"Cause" means a court of competent jurisdiction has entered a final, non-
appealable judgment finding the General Partner liable to the Partnership or

ORGANIZATION

Section 2.1 Formation. The General Partner and the Organizational Limited
Partner have previously formed the Partnership as a limited partnership
pursuant to the provisions of the Delaware Act and hereby amend and restate
the original Agreement of Limited Partnership of MPLX LP in its entirety. This
amendment and restatement shall become effective on the date of this
Agreement. Except as expressly provided to the contrary in this Agreement, the
rights, duties, liabilities and obligations of the Partners and the
administration, dissolution and termination of the Partnership shall be
governed by the Delaware Act. All Partnership Interests shall constitute
personal property of the owner thereof for all purposes.

Section 2.2 Name. The name of the Partnership shall be "MPLX LP". Subject to
applicable law, the Partnership's business may be conducted under any other
name or names as determined by the General Partner, including the name of the
General Partner. The words "Limited Partnership," "L.P.," "Ltd." or similar
words or letters shall be included in the Partnership's name where necessary
for the purpose of complying with the laws of any jurisdiction that so
requires. The General Partner may change the name of the Partnership at any
time and from time to time and shall notify the Limited Partners of such
change in the next regular communication to the Limited Partners.

Section 2.3 Registered Office; Registered Agent; Principal Office; Other
Offices. Unless and until changed by the General Partner, the registered
office of the Partnership in the State of Delaware shall be located at

Partnership in the State of Delaware at such registered office shall be The
Corporation Trust Company. The principal office of the Partnership shall be
located at 200 East Hardin Street, Findlay, Ohio 45840, or such other place as
the General Partner may from time to time designate by notice to the Limited
Partners. The Partnership may maintain offices at such other place or places
within or outside the State of Delaware as the General Partner determines to
be necessary or appropriate. The address of the General Partner shall be 200
East Hardin Street, Findlay, Ohio 45840, or such other place as the General
Partner may from time to time designate by notice to the Limited Partners.

Section 2.4 Purpose and Business. The purpose and nature of the business to be
conducted by the Partnership shall be to (a) engage directly in, or enter into
or form, hold and dispose of any corporation, partnership, joint venture,
limited liability company or other arrangement to engage indirectly in, any
business activity that is approved by the General Partner and that lawfully
may be conducted by a limited partnership organized pursuant to the Delaware
Act and, in connection therewith, to exercise all of the rights and powers
conferred upon the Partnership pursuant to the agreements relating to such
business activity, and (b) do anything



necessary or appropriate to the foregoing, including the making of capital
contributions or loans to a Group Member; provided, however, that the General
Partner shall not cause the Partnership to engage, directly or indirectly, in
any business activity that the General Partner determines would be reasonably
likely to cause the Partnership to be treated as an association taxable as a
corporation or otherwise taxable as an entity for federal income tax purposes.
To the fullest extent permitted by law, the General Partner shall have no duty
or obligation to propose or approve the conduct by the Partnership of any
business and may decline to do so free of any fiduciary duty or obligation
whatsoever to the Partnership or any Limited Partner and, in declining to so
propose or approve, shall not be required to act in good faith or pursuant to
any other standard imposed by this Agreement, any Group Member Agreement, any
other agreement contemplated hereby or under the Delaware Act or any other
law, rule or regulation or at equity and the General Partner in determining
whether to propose or approve the conduct by the Partnership of any business
shall be permitted to do so in its sole and absolute discretion.

Section 2.5 Powers. The Partnership shall be empowered to do any and all acts
and things necessary, appropriate, proper, advisable, incidental to or
convenient for the furtherance and accomplishment of the purposes and business
described in Section 2.4 and for the protection and benefit of the
Partnership.

Section 2.6 Term. The term of the Partnership commenced upon the filing of the
Certificate of Limited Partnership in accordance with the Delaware Act and

Partnership as a separate legal entity shall continue until the cancellation
of the Certificate of Limited Partnership as provided in the Delaware Act.

Section 2.7 Title to Partnership Assets. Title to Partnership assets, whether
real, personal or mixed and whether tangible or intangible, shall be deemed to
be owned by the Partnership as an entity, and no Partner, individually or
collectively, shall have any ownership interest in such Partnership assets or
any portion thereof. Title to any or all of the Partnership assets may be held
in the name of the Partnership, the General Partner, one or more of its
Affiliates or one or more nominees of the General Partner or its Affiliates,
as the General Partner may determine. The General Partner hereby declares and
warrants that any Partnership assets for which record title is held in the
name of the General Partner or one or more of its Affiliates or one or more
nominees of the General Partner or its Affiliates shall be held by the General
Partner or such Affiliate or nominee for the use and benefit of the
Partnership in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement; provided,
however, that the General Partner shall use reasonable efforts to cause record
title to such assets (other than those assets in respect of which the General
Partner determines that the expense and difficulty of conveyancing makes
transfer of record title to the Partnership impracticable) to be vested in the
Partnership or one or more of the Partnership's designated Affiliates as soon
as reasonably practicable; provided further, that, prior to the withdrawal or
removal of the General Partner or as soon thereafter as practicable, the
General Partner shall use reasonable efforts to effect the transfer of record
title to the Partnership and, prior to any such transfer, will provide for the
use of such assets in a manner satisfactory to any successor General Partner.
All Partnership assets shall be recorded as the property of the Partnership in
its books and records, irrespective of the name in which record title to such
Partnership assets is held.



ARTICLE III

liability under this Agreement except as expressly provided in this Agreement
or the Delaware Act.

Section 3.2 Management of Business. No Limited Partner, in its capacity as
such, shall participate in the operation, management or control (within the
meaning of the Delaware Act) of the Partnership's business, transact any
business in the Partnership's name or have the power to sign documents for or
otherwise bind the Partnership. No action taken by any Affiliate of the
General Partner or any officer, director, employee, manager, member, general
partner, agent or trustee of the General Partner or any of its Affiliates, or
any officer, director, employee, manager, member, general partner, agent or
trustee of a Group Member, in its capacity as such, shall be deemed to be
participating in the control of the business of the Partnership by a limited
partner of the Partnership (within the meaning of Section 17-303(a) of the
Delaware Act) nor shall any such action affect, impair or eliminate the
limitations on the liability of the Limited Partners under this Agreement.

Section 3.3 Rights of Limited Partners.

(a) Each Limited Partner shall have the right, for a purpose reasonably
related to such Limited Partner's interest as a Limited Partner in the
Partnership, upon reasonable written demand stating the purpose of such
demand, and at such Limited Partner's own expense:

(i) to obtain from the General Partner either (A) the Partnership's most
recent filings with the Commission on Form 10-K and any subsequent filings on
Form 10-Q and 8-K or (B) if the Partnership is no longer subject to the
reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the information specified in, and
meeting the requirements of, Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act
(provided that the foregoing materials shall be deemed to be available to a
Limited Partner in satisfaction of the requirements of this Section 3.3(a)(i)
if posted on or accessible through the Partnership's or the Commission's
website);

(ii) to obtain a current list of the name and last known business, residence
or mailing address of each Partner; and

(iii) to obtain a copy of this Agreement and the Certificate of Limited
Partnership and all amendments thereto.

(b) To the fullest extent permitted by law, the rights to information granted
the Limited Partners pursuant to Section 3.3(a) replace in their entirety any
rights to information provided for in Section 17-305(a) of the Delaware Act
and each of the Partners and each other Person or Group who acquires an
interest in the Partnership hereby agrees to the fullest extent permitted by
law that they do not have any rights as Partners or interest holders to
receive any information either pursuant to Sections 17-305(a) of the Delaware
Act or otherwise except for the information identified in Section 3.3(a).



(c) The General Partner may keep confidential from the Limited Partners, for
such period of time as the General Partner deems reasonable, (i) any
information that the General Partner reasonably believes to be in the nature
of trade secrets or (ii) other information the disclosure of which the General
Partner in good faith believes (A) is not in the best interests of the
Partnership Group, (B) could damage the Partnership Group or its business or
(C) that any Group Member is required by law or by agreement with any third
party to keep confidential (other than agreements with Affiliates of the
Partnership the primary purpose of which is to circumvent the obligations set
forth in this Section 3.3).

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or Section 17-305 of
the Delaware Act, each of the Record Holders, each other Person or Group who
acquires an interest in a Partnership Interest and each other Person bound by
this Agreement hereby agrees to the fullest extent permitted by law that they
do not have rights to receive information from the Partnership or any
Indemnitee for the purpose of determining whether to pursue litigation or
assist in pending litigation against the Partnership or any Indemnitee
relating to the affairs of the Partnership except pursuant to the applicable
rules of discovery relating to litigation commenced by such Person or Group.

ARTICLE IV

CERTIFICATES; RECORD HOLDERS; TRANSFER OF PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS; REDEMPTION OF
PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS

Section 4.1 Certificates. Record Holders of Partnership Interests and, where
appropriate, Derivative Partnership Interests, shall be recorded in the
Partnership Register and ownership of such interests shall be evidenced by a
physical certificate or book entry notation in the Partnership Register.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, unless the General
Partner shall determine otherwise in respect of some or all of any or all
classes of Partnership Interests, Partnership Interests shall not be evidenced
by physical certificates. Certificates, if any, shall be executed on behalf of
the Partnership by the Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial
Officer or any Senior Vice President or Vice President and the Secretary, any
Assistant Secretary, or other authorized officer of the General Partner, and
shall bear the legend set forth in Section 4.8(f). The signatures of such
officers upon a certificate may, to the extent permitted by law, be
facsimiles. In case any officer who has signed or whose signature has been
placed upon such certificate shall have ceased to be such officer before such
certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Partnership with the same
effect as if he or she were such officer at the date of its issuance. If a
Transfer Agent has been appointed for a class of Partnership Interests, no
Certificate for such class of Partnership Interests shall be valid for any
purpose until it has been countersigned by the Transfer Agent; provided,
however, that, if the General Partner elects to cause the Partnership to issue
Partnership Interests of such class in global form, the Certificate shall be
valid upon receipt of a certificate from the Transfer Agent certifying that
the Partnership Interests have been duly registered in accordance with the
directions of the Partnership. With respect to any Partnership Interests that
are represented by physical certificates, the General Partner may determine
that such Partnership Interests will no longer be represented by physical
certificates and may, upon written notice to the holders of such Partnership
Interests and subject to applicable law, take whatever actions it deems
necessary or



appropriate to cause such Partnership Interests to be registered in book entry
or global form and may cause such physical certificates to be cancelled or
deemed cancelled.

Section 4.2 Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Certificates.

(a) If any mutilated Certificate is surrendered to the Transfer Agent, the
appropriate officers of the General Partner on behalf of the Partnership shall
execute, and the Transfer Agent shall countersign and deliver in exchange
therefor, a new Certificate evidencing the same number and type of Partnership
Interests as the Certificate so surrendered.

(b) The appropriate officers of the General Partner on behalf of the
Partnership shall execute and deliver, and the Transfer Agent shall
countersign, a new Certificate in place of any Certificate previously issued,
if the Record Holder of the Certificate:

(i) makes proof by affidavit, in form and substance satisfactory to the
General Partner, that a previously issued Certificate has been lost, destroyed
or stolen;

(ii) requests the issuance of a new Certificate before the General Partner has
notice that the Certificate has been acquired by a purchaser for value in good
faith and without notice of an adverse claim;

(iii) if requested by the General Partner, delivers to the General Partner a
bond, in form and substance satisfactory to the General Partner, with surety
or sureties and with fixed or open penalty as the General Partner may direct
to indemnify the Partnership, the Partners, the General Partner and the
Transfer Agent against any claim that may be made on account of the alleged
loss, destruction or theft of the Certificate; and

(iv) satisfies any other reasonable requirements imposed by the General
Partner or the Transfer Agent.

If a Limited Partner fails to notify the General Partner within a reasonable
period of time after such Limited Partner has notice of the loss, destruction
or theft of a Certificate, and a transfer of the Limited Partner Interests
represented by the Certificate is registered before the Partnership, the
General Partner or the Transfer Agent receives such notification, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, the Limited Partner shall be precluded from
making any claim against the Partnership, the General Partner or the Transfer
Agent for such transfer or for a new Certificate.

(c) As a condition to the issuance of any new Certificate under this Section
4.2, the General Partner may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover
any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto
and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Transfer Agent)
reasonably connected therewith.

Section 4.3 Record Holders. The names and addresses of Unitholders as they
appear in the Partnership Register shall be the official list of Record
Holders of the Partnership Interests for all purposes. The Partnership and the
General Partner shall be entitled to recognize the Record Holder as the
Partner with respect to any Partnership Interest and, accordingly, shall not
be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to, or interest in, such
Partnership Interest on



the part of any other Person or Group, regardless of whether the Partnership
or the General Partner shall have actual or other notice thereof, except as
otherwise provided by law or any applicable rule, regulation, guideline or
requirement of any National Securities Exchange on which such Partnership
Interests are listed or admitted to trading. Without limiting the foregoing,
when a Person (such as a broker, dealer, bank, trust company or clearing
corporation or an agent of any of the foregoing) is acting as nominee, agent
or in some other representative capacity for another Person or Group in
acquiring and/or holding Partnership Interests, as between the Partnership on
the one hand, and such other Person on the other, such representative Person
shall be the Limited Partner with respect to such Partnership Interest upon
becoming the Record Holder in accordance with Section 10.1(b) and have the
rights and obligations of a Partner hereunder as, and to the extent, provided
herein, including Section 10.1(c).

Section 4.4 Transfer Generally.

(a) The term "transfer," when used in this Agreement with respect to a
Partnership Interest, shall be deemed to refer to a transaction (i) by which
the General Partner assigns all or any part of its General Partner Interest
(represented by General Partner Units) to another Person and includes a sale,
assignment, gift, pledge, encumbrance, hypothecation, mortgage, exchange or
any other disposition by law or otherwise or (ii) by which the holder of a
Limited Partner Interest assigns all or a part of such Limited Partner
Interest to another Person who is or becomes a Limited Partner as a result
thereof, and includes a sale, assignment, gift, exchange or any other
disposition by law or otherwise, excluding a pledge, encumbrance,
hypothecation or mortgage but including any transfer upon foreclosure of any
pledge, encumbrance, hypothecation or mortgage.

(b) No Partnership Interest shall be transferred, in whole or in part, except
in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this Article IV. Any
transfer or purported transfer of a Partnership Interest not made in
accordance with this Article IV shall be null and void, and the Partnership
shall have no obligation to effect any such transfer or purported transfer.

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent or limit
a disposition by any stockholder, member, partner or other owner of the
General Partner or any Limited Partner of any or all of such Person's shares
of stock, membership interests, partnership interests or other ownership
interests in the General Partner or such Limited Partner and the term
"transfer" shall not include any such disposition.

Section 4.5 Registration and Transfer of Limited Partner Interests.

(a) The General Partner shall maintain, or cause to be maintained by the
Transfer Agent in whole or in part, the Partnership Register on behalf of the
Partnership.

(b) The General Partner shall not recognize any transfer of Limited Partner
Interests evidenced by Certificates until the Certificates evidencing such
Limited Partner Interests are duly endorsed and surrendered for registration
of transfer. No charge shall be imposed by the General Partner for such
transfer; provided, however, that as a condition to the



issuance of any new Certificate under this Section 4.5, the General Partner
may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other
governmental charge that may be imposed with respect thereto. Upon surrender
of a Certificate for registration of transfer of any Limited Partner Interests
evidenced by a Certificate, and subject to the provisions of this Section
4.5(b), the appropriate officers of the General Partner on behalf of the
Partnership shall execute and deliver, and in the case of Certificates
evidencing Limited Partner Interests for which a Transfer Agent has been
appointed, the Transfer Agent shall countersign and deliver, in the name of
the holder or the designated transferee or transferees, as required pursuant
to the holder's instructions, one or more new Certificates evidencing the same
aggregate number and type of Limited Partner Interests as was evidenced by the
Certificate so surrendered. Upon the proper surrender of a Certificate, such
transfer shall be recorded in the Partnership Register.

(c) Upon the receipt of proper transfer instructions from the Record Holder of
uncertificated Partnership Interests, such transfer shall be recorded in the
Partnership Register.

(d) Except as provided in Section 4.9, by acceptance of any Limited Partner
Interests pursuant to a transfer in accordance with this Article IV, each
transferee of a Limited Partner Interest (including any nominee, or agent or
representative acquiring such Limited Partner Interests for the account of
another Person or Group) (i) shall be admitted to the Partnership as a Limited
Partner with respect to the Limited Partner Interests so transferred to such
Person when any such transfer or admission is reflected in the Partnership
Register and such Person becomes the Record Holder of the Limited Partner
Interests so transferred, (ii) shall become bound, and shall be deemed to have
agreed to be bound, by the terms of this Agreement, (iii) represents that the
transferee has the capacity, power and authority to enter into this Agreement,
(iv) makes the consents, acknowledgements and waivers contained in this
Agreement, all with or without execution of this Agreement by such Person and
(v) shall be deemed to certify that the transferee is not an Ineligible
Holder. The transfer of any Limited Partner Interests and the admission of any
new Limited Partner shall not constitute an amendment to this Agreement.

(e) Subject to (i) the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.5, (ii) Section
4.3, (iii) Section 4.8, (iv) with respect to any class or series of Limited
Partner Interests, the provisions of any statement of designations or an
amendment to this Agreement establishing such class or series, (v) any
contractual provisions binding on any Limited Partner and (vi) provisions of
applicable law including the Securities Act, Limited Partner Interests shall
be freely transferable.

(f) The General Partner and its Affiliates shall have the right at any time to
transfer their Common Units to one or more Persons.

Section 4.6 Transfer of the General Partner's General Partner Interest.

(a) Subject to Section 4.6(c) below, prior to December 31, 2022, the General
Partner shall not transfer all or any part of its General Partner Interest
(represented by General Partner Units) to a Person unless such transfer (i)
has been approved by the prior written consent or vote of the holders of at
least a majority of the Outstanding Common Units (excluding



Common Units owned by the General Partner and its Affiliates) and Series A
Preferred Units (as described in Section 5.14(b)(iii)(A)) voting together as a
single class, (ii) is of all, but not less than all, of its General Partner
Interest to (A) an Affiliate of the General Partner (other than an individual)
or (B) another Person (other than an individual) in connection with the merger
or consolidation of the General Partner with or into such other Person or the
transfer by the General Partner of all or substantially all of its assets to
such other Person or (iii) is pursuant to a bona fide foreclosure by the
lenders under any debt instrument with respect to which the General Partner is
an obligor or guarantor.

(b) Subject to Section 4.6(c) below, on or after December 31, 2022, the
General Partner may transfer all or any part of its General Partner Interest
without the approval of any Limited Partner or any other Person.

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no transfer by the
General Partner of all or any part of its General Partner Interest to another
Person shall be permitted unless (i) the transferee agrees to assume the
rights and duties of the General Partner under this Agreement and to be bound
by the provisions of this Agreement, (ii) the Partnership receives an Opinion
of Counsel that such transfer would not result in the loss of limited
liability of any Limited Partner under the Delaware Act or cause the
Partnership to be treated as an association taxable as a corporation or
otherwise to be taxed as an entity for federal income tax purposes (to the
extent not already so treated or taxed) and (iii) such transferee also agrees
to purchase all (or the appropriate portion thereof, if applicable) of the
partnership or membership interest owned by the General Partner as the general
partner or managing member, if any, of each other Group Member. In the case of
a transfer pursuant to and in compliance with this Section 4.6, the transferee
or successor (as the case may be) shall, subject to compliance with the terms
of Section 10.2, be admitted to the Partnership as the General Partner
effective immediately prior to the transfer of the General Partner Interest,
and the business of the Partnership shall continue without dissolution.

Section 4.7 Transfer of Incentive Distribution Rights. The General Partner or
any other holder of Incentive Distribution Rights may transfer any or all of
its Incentive Distribution Rights without the approval of any Limited Partner
or any other Person.

Section 4.8 Restrictions on Transfers.

(a) Except as provided in Section 4.8(e), notwithstanding the other provisions
of this Article IV, no transfer of any Partnership Interests shall be made if
such transfer would (i) violate the then applicable federal or state
securities laws or rules and regulations of the Commission, any state
securities commission or any other governmental authority with jurisdiction
over such transfer, (ii) terminate the existence or qualification of the
Partnership under the laws of the jurisdiction of its formation, or (iii)
cause the Partnership to be treated as an association taxable as a corporation
or otherwise to be taxed as an entity for federal income tax purposes (to the
extent not already so treated or taxed). The Partnership may issue stop
transfer instructions to any Transfer Agent in order to implement any
restriction on transfer contemplated by this Agreement.



(b) The General Partner may impose restrictions on the transfer of Partnership
Interests if it receives an Opinion of Counsel that such restrictions are
necessary to (i) avoid a significant risk of the Partnership's becoming
taxable as a corporation or otherwise becoming taxable as an entity for
federal income tax purposes (to the extent not already so treated or taxed) or
(ii) preserve the uniformity of the Limited Partner Interests (or any class or
classes thereof). The General Partner may impose such restrictions by amending
this Agreement; provided, however, that any amendment that would result in the
delisting or suspension of trading of any class of Limited Partner Interests
on the principal National Securities Exchange on which such class of Limited
Partner Interests is then listed or admitted to trading must be approved,
prior to such amendment being effected, by the holders of at least a majority
of the Outstanding Limited Partner Interests of such class.

(c) The transfer of an IDR Reset Common Unit that was issued in connection
with an IDR Reset Election pursuant to Section 5.11 shall be subject to the
restrictions imposed by Section 6.8(b) and 6.8(c).

(d) Reserved.

(e) Except for Section 4.9, nothing in this Agreement shall preclude the
settlement of any transactions involving Partnership Interests entered into
through the facilities of any National Securities Exchange on which such
Partnership Interests are listed or admitted to trading.

(f) Each certificate or book entry evidencing Partnership Interests shall bear
a conspicuous legend in substantially the following form:

THE HOLDER OF THIS SECURITY ACKNOWLEDGES FOR THE BENEFIT OF MPLX LP THAT THIS
SECURITY MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED IF SUCH TRANSFER (AS DEFINED IN THE
PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT) WOULD (A) VIOLATE THE THEN APPLICABLE FEDERAL OR STATE
SECURITIES LAWS OR RULES AND REGULATIONS OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
COMMISSION, ANY STATE SECURITIES COMMISSION OR ANY OTHER GOVERNMENTAL
AUTHORITY WITH JURISDICTION OVER SUCH TRANSFER, (B) TERMINATE THE EXISTENCE OR
QUALIFICATION OF MPLX LP UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, OR (C) CAUSE
MPLX LP TO BE TREATED AS AN ASSOCIATION TAXABLE AS A CORPORATION OR OTHERWISE
TO BE TAXED AS AN ENTITY FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES (TO THE EXTENT NOT
ALREADY SO TREATED OR TAXED). THE GENERAL PARTNER OF MPLX LP MAY IMPOSE
ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS ON THE TRANSFER OF THIS SECURITY IF IT RECEIVES AN
OPINION OF COUNSEL THAT SUCH RESTRICTIONS ARE NECESSARY TO AVOID A SIGNIFICANT
RISK OF MPLX LP BECOMING TAXABLE AS A CORPORATION OR OTHERWISE BECOMING
TAXABLE AS AN ENTITY FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES. THIS SECURITY MAY BE
SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS ON ITS



TRANSFER PROVIDED IN THE PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT. COPIES OF SUCH AGREEMENT MAY
BE OBTAINED AT NO COST BY WRITTEN REQUEST MADE BY THE HOLDER OF RECORD OF THIS
SECURITY TO THE SECRETARY OF THE GENERAL PARTNER AT THE PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE
OFFICES OF THE PARTNERSHIP. THE RESTRICTIONS SET FORTH ABOVE SHALL NOT
PRECLUDE THE SETTLEMENT OF ANY TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING THIS SECURITY ENTERED
INTO THROUGH THE FACILITIES OF ANY NATIONAL SECURITIES EXCHANGE ON WHICH THIS
SECURITY IS LISTED OR ADMITTED TO TRADING.

(g) The transfer of Class B Units shall be subject to the restrictions imposed
by Section 5.13(m).

(h) The transfer of Converted Common Units shall be subject to the
restrictions imposed by Section 6.10.

(i) The transfer of Series A Preferred Units shall be subject to the
restrictions imposed by Section 5.14(b)(viii).

Section 4.9 Eligibility Certificates; Ineligible Holders.

(a) The General Partner may upon demand or on a regular basis require Limited
Partners, and transferees of Limited Partner Interests in connection with a
transfer, to execute an Eligibility Certificate or provide other information
as is necessary for the General Partner to determine if any such Limited
Partners or transferees are Ineligible Holders.

(b) If any Limited Partner (or its beneficial owners) fails to furnish to the
General Partner within 30 days of its request an Eligibility Certificate and
other information related thereto, or if upon receipt of such Eligibility
Certificate or other requested information the General Partner determines that
a Limited Partner or a transferee of a Limited Partner is an Ineligible
Holder, the Limited Partner Interests owned by such Limited Partner shall be
subject to redemption in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.10 or the
General Partner may refuse to effect the transfer of the Limited Partner
Interests to such transferee. In addition, the General Partner shall be
substituted for any Limited Partner that is an Ineligible Holder as the
Limited Partner in respect of the Ineligible Holder's Limited Partner
Interests.

(c) The General Partner shall, in exercising voting rights in respect of
Limited Partner Interests held by it on behalf of Ineligible Holders,
distribute the votes in the same ratios as the votes of Limited Partners
(including the General Partner and its Affiliates) in respect of Limited
Partner Interests other than those of Ineligible Holders are cast, either for,
against or abstaining as to the matter.

(d) Upon dissolution of the Partnership, an Ineligible Holder shall have no
right to receive a distribution in kind pursuant to Section 12.4 but shall be
entitled to the cash equivalent thereof, and the Partnership shall provide
cash in exchange for an assignment of the Ineligible Holder's share of any
distribution in kind. Such payment and assignment shall be



treated for Partnership purposes as a purchase by the Partnership from the
Ineligible Holder of its Limited Partner Interest (representing the right to
receive its share of such distribution in kind).

(e) At any time after an Ineligible Holder can and does certify that it no
longer is an Ineligible Holder, it may, upon application to the General
Partner, request that with respect to any Limited Partner Interests of such
Ineligible Holder not redeemed pursuant to Section 4.10, such Ineligible
Holder upon approval of the General Partner, shall no longer constitute an
Ineligible Holder and the General Partner shall cease to be deemed to be the
Limited Partner in respect of such Limited Partner Interests.

(f) If at any time a transferee of a Partnership Interest fails to furnish an
Eligibility Certificate or any other information requested by the General
Partner pursuant to Section 4.9 within 30 days of such request, or if upon
receipt of such Eligibility Certificate or other information the General
Partner determines, with the advice of counsel, that such transferee is an
Ineligible Holder, the Partnership may, unless the transferee establishes to
the satisfaction of the General Partner that such transferee is not an
Ineligible Holder, prohibit and void the transfer, including by placing a stop
order with the Transfer Agent.

Section 4.10 Redemption of Partnership Interests of Ineligible Holders.

(a) If at any time a Limited Partner fails to furnish an Eligibility
Certificate or any other information requested within the period of time
specified in Section 4.9, or if upon receipt of such Eligibility Certificate
or other information the General Partner determines, with the advice of
counsel, that a Limited Partner is an Ineligible Holder, the Partnership may,
unless the Limited Partner establishes to the satisfaction of the General
Partner that such Limited Partner is not an Ineligible Holder or has
transferred his Limited Partner Interests to a Person who is not an Ineligible
Holder and who furnishes an Eligibility Certificate to the General Partner
prior to the date fixed for redemption as provided below, redeem the Limited
Partner Interest of such Limited Partner as follows:

(i) The General Partner shall, not later than the 30th day before the date
fixed for redemption, give notice of redemption to the Limited Partner, at
such Limited Partner's last address designated on the records of the
Partnership or the Transfer Agent, by registered or certified mail, postage
prepaid. The notice shall be deemed to have been given when so mailed. The
notice shall specify the Redeemable Interests, the date fixed for redemption,
the place of payment, that payment of the redemption price will be made upon
redemption of the Redeemable Interests (or, if later in the case of Redeemable
Interests evidenced by Certificates, upon surrender of the Certificate
evidencing the Redeemable Interests) and that on and after the date fixed for
redemption no further allocations or distributions to which such Limited
Partner would otherwise be entitled in respect of the Redeemable Interests
will accrue or be made.

(ii) The aggregate redemption price for Redeemable Interests shall be an
amount equal to the Current Market Price (the date of determination of which
shall be the date fixed for redemption) of Limited Partner Interests of the
class to be so redeemed multiplied by the number of Limited Partner Interests
of each such class included among the Redeemable



Interests. The redemption price shall be paid, as determined by the General
Partner, in cash or by delivery of a promissory note of the Partnership in the
principal amount of the redemption price, bearing interest at the rate of 5%
annually and payable in three equal annual installments of principal together
with accrued interest, commencing one year after the redemption date.

(iii) The Limited Partner or such Limited Partner's duly authorized
representative shall be entitled to receive the payment for the Redeemable
Interests at the place of payment specified in the notice of redemption on the
redemption date (or, if later in the case of Redeemable Interests evidenced by
Certificates, upon surrender by or on behalf of the Limited Partner or
Transferee at the place specified in the notice of redemption, of the
Certificate evidencing the Redeemable Interests, duly endorsed in blank or
accompanied by an assignment duly executed in blank).

(iv) After the redemption date, Redeemable Interests shall no longer
constitute issued and Outstanding Limited Partner Interests.

(b) The provisions of this Section 4.10 shall also be applicable to Limited
Partner Interests held by a Limited Partner as nominee, agent or
representative of a Person determined to be an Ineligible Holder.

(c) Nothing in this Section 4.10 shall prevent the recipient of a notice of
redemption from transferring his Limited Partner Interest before the
redemption date if such transfer is otherwise permitted under this Agreement
and the transferor provides notice of such transfer to the General Partner.
Upon receipt of notice of such a transfer, the General Partner shall withdraw
the notice of redemption, provided the transferee of such Limited Partner
Interest certifies to the satisfaction of the General Partner that such
transferee is not an Ineligible Holder. If the transferee fails to make such
certification within 30 days after the request and, in any event, before the
redemption date, such redemption shall be effected from the transferee on the
original redemption date.

ARTICLE V

CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS AND ISSUANCE OF PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS

Section 5.1 Organizational Contributions. In connection with the formation of
the Partnership under the Delaware Act, the General Partner made an initial
Capital Contribution to the Partnership in the amount of $20.00, for a 2%
General Partner Interest in the Partnership and has been admitted as the
General Partner of the Partnership, and the Organizational Limited Partner
made an initial Capital Contribution to the Partnership in the amount of
$980.00 for a 98% Limited Partner Interest in the Partnership and has been
admitted as a Limited Partner of the Partnership. As of the Closing Date,
pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, the interest of the Organizational
Limited Partner shall be partially redeemed in exchange for the return of the
initial Capital Contribution of the Organizational Limited Partner, and 98% of
any interest or other profit that may have resulted from the investment or
other use of such initial Capital Contributions shall be allocated and
distributed to the Organizational Limited Partner, and the balance thereof
shall be allocated and distributed to the General Partner. The Organizational



Limited Partner hereby continues as a limited partner of the Partnership with
respect to the portion of its interest that is not partially redeemed.

Section 5.2 Contributions by the General Partner.

(a) On the Closing Date and pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, the
General Partner contributed to the Partnership, as a Capital Contribution, the
OLLC Interest (as defined in the Contribution Agreement) in exchange for (i)
1,508,225 General Partner Units representing a continuation of its 2% General
Partner Interest, subject to all of the rights, privileges and duties of the
General Partner under this Agreement, and (ii) the Incentive Distribution
Rights.

(b) Upon the issuance of any additional Limited Partner Interests by the
Partnership (other than (i) the Common Units issued pursuant to the Initial
Public Offering, (ii) the Common Units issued pursuant to Section 5.3(a),
(iii) any Common Units issued pursuant to Section 5.11 and (iv) except as
otherwise set forth in this Section 5.2(b), any Common Units issued upon the
conversion of any Partnership Interests), the General Partner may, in order to
maintain the Percentage Interest with respect to its General Partner Interest,
make additional Capital Contributions in an amount equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (A) the quotient determined by dividing (x) the
Percentage Interest with respect to the General Partner Interests immediately
prior to the issuance of such additional Limited Partner Interests by the
Partnership by (y) 100% less the Percentage Interest with respect to the
General Partner Interest immediately prior to the issuance of such additional
Limited Partner Interests by the Partnership times (B) the gross amount
contributed to the Partnership by the Limited Partners (before deduction of
underwriters' discounts and commissions) in exchange for such additional
Limited Partner Interests. Any Capital Contribution pursuant to this Section
5.2(b) shall be evidenced by the issuance to the General Partner of a
proportionate number of additional General Partner Units. Notwithstanding the
foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, with regard to the conversion of the
Class B Units into Converted Common Units and Series A Preferred Units into
Common Units, this Section 5.2(b) and the General Partner's right to make
additional Capital Contributions shall be applicable upon the conversion of
any Class B Unit to a Converted Common Unit pursuant to Section 5.13 and
Series A Preferred Units into Common Units pursuant to Section 5.14, with the
amount to be contributed by the General Partner being the amount necessary for
the General Partner to have the same Percentage Interest after the conversion
by reference to the then fair market value of a Common Unit.

Section 5.3 Contributions by Limited Partner.

(a) On the Closing Date, pursuant to and as described in the Contribution
Agreement, MPLX Logistics Holdings contributed to the Partnership, as a
Capital Contribution, all of MPLX Logistics Holdings' limited liability
company interests in the Operating Company in exchange for (i) 19,651,515
Common Units, (ii) 36,951,515 Subordinated Units and (iii) a right to receive
$149,144,119.22 as a reimbursement for certain capital expenditures incurred
with respect to the assets of MPLX Logistics Holdings pursuant to Treasury
Regulation Section 1.707-4(d).



(b) On the Closing Date and pursuant to the IPO Underwriting Agreement, each
IPO Underwriter contributed cash to the Partnership in exchange for the
issuance by the Partnership of Common Units to each IPO Underwriter, all as
set forth in the IPO Underwriting Agreement.

(c) Upon the exercise of the Over-Allotment Option, (i) each IPO Underwriter
contributed cash to the Partnership on the Option Closing Date in exchange for
the issuance by the Partnership of Common Units to each IPO Underwriter, all
as set forth in the IPO Underwriting Agreement and (ii) the Partnership
redeemed an equivalent number of Common Units from the MPLX Logistics
Holdings, all as set forth in the Contribution Agreement.

(d) No Limited Partner Interests were issued or issuable as of or at the
Closing Date other than (i) the Common Units and Subordinated Units issued to
MPLX Logistics Holdings pursuant to subparagraph (a) of this Section 5.3, (ii)
the Common Units issued to the IPO Underwriters as described in subparagraphs
(b) and (c) of this Section 5.3 and (iii) the Incentive Distribution Rights
issued to the General Partner.

(e) No Limited Partner will be required to make any additional Capital
Contribution to the Partnership pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 5.4 Interest and Withdrawal. No interest shall be paid by the
Partnership on Capital Contributions. No Partner shall be entitled to the
withdrawal or return of its Capital Contribution, except to the extent, if
any, that distributions made pursuant to this Agreement or upon termination of
the Partnership may be considered as such by law and then only to the extent
provided for in this Agreement. Except to the extent expressly provided in
this Agreement, no Partner shall have priority over any other Partner either
as to the return of Capital Contributions or as to profits, losses or
distributions. Any such return shall be a compromise to which all Partners
agree within the meaning of Section 17-502(b) of the Delaware Act.

Section 5.5 Capital Accounts.

(a) The Partnership shall maintain for each Partner (or a beneficial owner of
Partnership Interests held by a nominee, agent or representative in any case
in which such nominee, agent or representative has furnished the identity of
such owner to the Partnership in accordance with Section 6031(c) of the Code
or any other method acceptable to the General Partner) owning a Partnership
Interest a separate Capital Account with respect to such Partnership Interest
in accordance with the rules of Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv).
The initial Capital Account balance attributable to the General Partner Units
issued to the General Partner pursuant to Section 5.2(a) shall equal the Net
Agreed Value of the Capital Contribution specified in Section 5.2(a), which
shall be deemed to equal the product of the number of General Partner Units
issued to the General Partner pursuant to Section 5.2(a) and the Initial Unit
Price for each Common Unit (and the initial Capital Account balance
attributable to each General Partner Unit shall equal the Initial Unit Price
for each Common Unit). The initial Capital Account balance attributable to the
Common Units and Subordinated Units issued to MPLX Logistics Holdings pursuant
to Section 5.3(a) shall equal the respective Net Agreed Value of the Capital
Contributions specified in Section 5.3(a), which shall be deemed to equal



the product of the number of Common Units and Subordinated Units issued to
MPLX Logistics Holdings pursuant to Section 5.3(a) and the Initial Unit Price
for each such Common Unit and Subordinated Unit (and the initial Capital
Account balance attributable to each such Common Unit and Subordinated Unit
shall equal its Initial Unit Price). The initial Capital Account balance
attributable to the Common Units issued to the IPO Underwriters pursuant to
Section 5.3(b) shall equal the product of the number of Common Units so issued
to the IPO Underwriters and the Initial Unit Price for each Common Unit (and
the initial Capital Account balance attributable to each such Common Unit
shall equal its Initial Unit Price). The initial Capital Account attributable
to the Incentive Distribution Rights shall be zero. Thereafter, the Capital
Account shall in respect of each such Partnership Interest be increased by (i)
the amount of all Capital Contributions made to the Partnership with respect
to such Partnership Interest and (ii) all items of Partnership income and gain
(including income and gain exempt from tax) computed in accordance with
Section 5.5(b) and allocated with respect to such Partnership Interest
pursuant to Section 6.1, and decreased by (x) the amount of cash or Net Agreed
Value of all actual and deemed distributions of cash or property made with
respect to such Partnership Interest and (y) all items of Partnership
deduction and loss computed in accordance with Section 5.5(b) and allocated
with respect to such Partnership Interest pursuant to Section 6.1. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Series A Preferred Units will be treated as a
partnership interest in the Partnership that is "convertible equity" within
the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.721-2(g)(3), and, therefore, each
holder of a Series A Preferred Unit will be treated as a partner in the
Partnership. The initial Capital Account balance in respect of each Series A
Preferred Unit shall be the Series A Issue Price, as such amount may be
adjusted in accordance with the Series A Purchase Agreement for any reduction
attributable to the Transaction Fee, as such term is defined in the Series A
Purchase Agreement and expenses reimbursable under the Series A Purchase
Agreement.

(b) For purposes of computing the amount of any item of income, gain, loss or
deduction that is to be allocated pursuant to Article VI and is to be
reflected in the Partners' Capital Accounts, the determination, recognition
and classification of any such item shall be the same as its determination,
recognition and classification for federal income tax purposes (including any
method of depreciation, cost recovery or amortization used for that purpose),
provided that:

(i) Solely for purposes of this Section 5.5, the Partnership shall be treated
as owning directly its proportionate share (as determined by the General
Partner based upon the provisions of the applicable Group Member Agreement or
governing, organizational or similar documents) of all property owned by (A)
any other Group Member that is classified as a partnership or disregarded
entity for federal income tax purposes and (B) any other partnership, limited
liability company, unincorporated business or other entity classified as a
partnership or disregarded entity for federal income tax purposes of which a
Group Member is, directly or indirectly, a partner, member or other equity
holder.

(ii) All fees and other expenses incurred by the Partnership to promote the
sale of (or to sell) a Partnership Interest that can neither be deducted nor
amortized under Section 709 of the Code, if any, shall, for purposes of
Capital Account maintenance, be treated as



an item of deduction at the time such fees and other expenses are incurred and
shall be allocated among the Partners pursuant to Section 6.1.

(iii) Except as otherwise provided in Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), the computation of all items of income, gain, loss and
deduction shall be made without regard to any election under Section 754 of
the Code that may be made by the Partnership. To the extent an adjustment to
the adjusted tax basis of any Partnership asset pursuant to Section 734(b) or
743(b) of the Code is required, pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), to be taken into account in determining Capital
Accounts, the amount of such adjustment in the Capital Accounts shall be
treated as an item of gain or loss.

(iv) Any income, gain or loss attributable to the taxable disposition of any
Partnership property shall be determined as if the adjusted basis of such
property as of such date of disposition were equal in amount to the
Partnership's Carrying Value with respect to such property as of such date.

(v) An item of income of the Partnership that is described in Section
705(a)(1)(B) of the Code (with respect to items of income that are exempt from
tax) shall be treated as an item of income for the purpose of this Section
5.5(b), and an item of expense of the Partnership that is described in Section
705(a)(2)(B) of the Code (with respect to expenditures that are not deductible
and not chargeable to capital accounts), shall be treated as an item of
deduction for the purpose of this Section 5.5(b).

(vi) In accordance with the requirements of Section 704(b) of the Code, any
deductions for depreciation, cost recovery or amortization attributable to any
Contributed Property shall be determined as if the adjusted basis of such
property on the date it was acquired by the Partnership were equal to the
Agreed Value of such property. Upon an adjustment pursuant to Section 5.5(d)
to the Carrying Value of any Partnership property subject to depreciation,
cost recovery or amortization, any further deductions for such depreciation,
cost recovery or amortization attributable to such property shall be
determined under the rules prescribed by Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-3(d)(2) as if the adjusted basis of such property were equal to the
Carrying Value of such property immediately following such adjustment.

(vii) To the extent required by Treasury Regulation Section 1.752-7, the Gross
Liability Value of each Liability of the Partnership described in Treasury
Regulation Section 1.752-7(b)(3)(i) shall be adjusted at such times as
provided in this Agreement for an adjustment to Carrying Values. The amount of
any such adjustment shall be treated for purposes hereof as an item of loss
(if the adjustment increases the Carrying Value of such Liability of the
Partnership) or an item of gain (if the adjustment decreases the Carrying
Value of such Liability of the Partnership).

(c) (i) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 5.5(c), a transferee of a
Partnership Interest shall succeed to a Pro Rata portion of the Capital
Account of the transferor relating to the Partnership Interest so transferred.

(ii) Reserved.



(iii) Subject to Section 6.8(b), immediately prior to the transfer of an
Affiliate Retained Unit by a holder thereof (other than a transfer to an
Affiliate unless the General Partner elects to have this subparagraph
5.5(c)(iii) apply), the Capital Account maintained for such Person with
respect to its Affiliate Retained Units will (A) first, be allocated to the
Affiliate Retained Units to be transferred in an amount equal to the product
of (x) the number of such Affiliate Retained Units to be transferred and (y)
the Per Unit Capital Amount for a Common Unit, and (B) second, any remaining
balance in such Capital Account will be retained by the transferor, regardless
of whether it has retained any Affiliate Retained Units. Following any such
allocation, the transferor's Capital Account, if any, maintained with respect
to the retained Affiliate Retained Units, if any, will have a balance equal to
the amount allocated under clause (B) hereinabove, and the transferee's
Capital Account established with respect to the transferred Affiliate Retained
Units will have a balance equal to the amount allocated under clause (A)
above.

(iv) Class B Unit and Converted Common Unit Capital Accounts.

(A) Upon conversion of the Class B-1 Units and Class B-2 Units into Converted
Common Units, the Capital Account maintained for the holder of such converted
Class B Units with respect to its Class B Units will (1) first, be allocated
to the Converted Common Units held by such holder in an amount equal to the
product of (x) the number of such Converted Common Units and (y) the then Per
Unit Capital Amount for an Initial Common Unit, and (2) second, any remaining
balance in such Capital Account will be retained with respect to such holder's
remaining Class B Units.

(B) Subject to Section 6.10, immediately prior to the transfer of a Converted
Common Unit by a holder thereof, the Capital Account maintained for such
Person with respect to its Class B Units or Converted Common Units will (1)
first, be allocated to the Converted Common Units to be transferred in an
amount equal to the product of (x) the number of such Converted Common Units
to be transferred and (y) the Per Unit Capital Amount for an Initial Common
Unit, and (2) second, any remaining balance in such Capital Account will be
retained by the transferor, regardless of whether it has retained any Class B
Units or Converted Common Units. Promptly following any such allocation, the
transferor's Capital Account, if any, maintained with respect to the retained
Class B Units or retained Converted Common Units, if any, will have a balance
equal to the amount allocated under clause (2) hereinabove, and the
transferee's Capital Account established with respect to the transferred
Converted Common Units will have a balance equal to the amount allocated under
clause (1) hereinabove.

(d) (i) In accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f),
on an issuance of additional Partnership Interests for cash or Contributed
Property, the issuance of Partnership Interests as consideration for the
provision of services, or the conversion of the General Partner's Combined
Interest to Common Units pursuant to Section 11.3(b), the Capital Account of
each Partner and the Carrying Value of each Partnership property immediately
prior to such issuance shall be adjusted upward or downward to reflect any
Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss attributable to such Partnership property,
and any such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss shall be treated, for purposes
of maintaining Capital Accounts, as if it had been recognized on an actual
sale of each such property for an amount equal to its fair market value



immediately prior to such issuance and had been allocated among the Partners
at such time pursuant to Section 6.1(c) and Section 6.1(d) in the same manner
as any item of gain or loss actually recognized following an event giving rise
to the dissolution of the Partnership would have been allocated; provided,
however, that in the event of an issuance of Partnership Interests for a de
minimis amount of cash or Contributed Property, or in the event of an issuance
of a de minimis amount of Partnership Interests as consideration for the
provision of services, the General Partner may determine that such adjustments
are unnecessary for the proper administration of the Partnership. In
determining such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss, the aggregate fair market
value of all Partnership property (including cash or cash equivalents)
immediately prior to the issuance of additional Partnership Interests shall be
determined by the General Partner using such method of valuation as it may
adopt. In making its determination of the fair market values of individual
properties, the General Partner may determine that it is appropriate to first
determine an aggregate value for the Partnership, derived from the current
trading price of the Common Units, and taking fully into account the fair
market value of the Partnership Interests of all Partners at such time and
make any adjustments necessary to reflect the difference, if any, between the
fair market value of any Series A Preferred Units for which the Series A
Conversion Date has not occurred and the aggregate Capital Accounts
attributable to such Series A Preferred Units to the extent of any Unrealized
Gain or Unrealized Loss that has not been reflected in the Partners' Capital
Accounts previously, consistent with the methodology of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(h)(2), and then allocate such aggregate value among
the individual properties of the Partnership (in such manner as it determines
appropriate).

(ii) In accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f),
immediately prior to any actual or deemed distribution to a Partner of any
Partnership property (other than a distribution of cash that is not in
redemption or retirement of a Partnership Interest), the Capital Accounts of
all Partners and the Carrying Value of all Partnership property shall be
adjusted upward or downward to reflect any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss
attributable to such Partnership property, and any such Unrealized Gain or
Unrealized Loss shall be treated, for purposes of maintaining Capital
Accounts, as if it had been recognized on an actual sale of each such property
immediately prior to such distribution for an amount equal to its fair market
value, and had been allocated among the Partners, at such time, pursuant to
Section 6.1(c) and Section 6.1(d) in the same manner as any item of gain or
loss actually recognized following an event giving rise to the dissolution of
the Partnership would have been allocated. In determining such Unrealized Gain
or Unrealized Loss the aggregate fair market value of all Partnership property
(including cash or cash equivalents) immediately prior to a distribution shall
(A) in the case of an actual distribution that is not made pursuant to Section
12.4 or in the case of a deemed distribution, be determined in the same manner
as that provided in Section 5.5(d)(i) or (B) in the case of a liquidating
distribution pursuant to Section 12.4, be determined by the Liquidator using
such method of valuation as it may adopt.

(iii) In accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(s),
immediately after the conversion of a Series A Preferred Unit into Common
Units in accordance with Section 5.14(b)(vi), the Capital Account of each
Partner and the Carrying Value of each Partnership property shall be adjusted
to reflect any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss attributable to such
Partnership property, as if such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss had been
recognized on an actual sale of each such property for an amount equal to its
fair market



value immediately after such conversion and (A) first, all Unrealized Gain (if
the Capital Account of each such Series A Conversion Unit is less than the Per
Unit Capital Account for a then Outstanding Initial Common Unit) or Unrealized
Loss (if the Capital Account of each such Series A Conversion Unit is greater
than the Per Unit Capital Account for a then Outstanding Initial Common Unit)
had been allocated to each Partner holding Series A Conversion Units received
upon such conversion, Pro Rata, until the Capital Account of each such Series
A Conversion Unit is equal to the Per Unit Capital Amount for a then
Outstanding Initial Common Unit; and (B) second, any remaining Unrealized Gain
or Unrealized Loss had been allocated to the Partners at such time pursuant to
Section 6.1(c) and Section 6.1(d). In determining such Unrealized Gain or
Unrealized Loss, the aggregate cash amount and fair market value of all
Partnership assets (including, without limitation, cash or cash equivalents)
immediately after the conversion of a Series A Preferred Unit shall be
determined by the General Partner using such reasonable method of valuation as
it may adopt; provided, however, that the General Partner, in arriving at such
valuation, must take fully into account the fair market value of the
Partnership Interests of all Partners at such time and must make such
adjustments to such valuation as required by Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(h)(2). The General Partner shall allocate such aggregate
value among the assets of the Partnership in such manner as it determines in
its discretion to be reasonable. If, after making the allocations of
Unrealized Gain and Unrealized Loss as set forth above in this Section
5.5(d)(iii), the Capital Account of each Partner with respect to each Series A
Conversion Unit received upon such conversion of the Series A Preferred Unit
is different from the Per Unit Capital Amount for a then Outstanding Initial
Common Unit, then Capital Account balances shall be reallocated between the
Partners holding Common Units (other than Series A Conversion Units) and
Partners holding Series A Conversion Units so as to cause the Capital Account
of each Partner holding a Series A Conversion Unit to equal, on a per Unit
basis with respect to each such Series A Conversion Unit, the Per Unit Capital
Amount for a then Outstanding Initial Common Unit.

Section 5.6 Issuances of Additional Partnership Interests.

(a) Subject to Section 5.14(b)(iv), the Partnership may issue additional
Partnership Interests (other than General Partner Interests (except for
General Partner Interests issued pursuant to Section 5.2(b))) and Derivative
Partnership Interests for any Partnership purpose at any time and from time to
time to such Persons for such consideration and on such terms and conditions
as the General Partner shall determine, all without the approval of any
Limited Partners.

(b) Each additional Partnership Interest authorized to be issued by the
Partnership pursuant to Section 5.6(a) may be issued in one or more classes,
or one or more series of any such classes, with such designations,
preferences, rights, powers and duties (which may be senior to existing
classes and series of Partnership Interests), as shall be fixed by the General
Partner, including (i) the right to share in Partnership profits and losses or
items thereof; (ii) the right to share in Partnership distributions; (iii) the
rights upon dissolution and liquidation of the Partnership; (iv) whether, and
the terms and conditions upon which, the Partnership may or shall be required
to redeem the Partnership Interest; (v) whether such Partnership Interest is
issued with the privilege of conversion or exchange and, if so, the terms and
conditions of such conversion or exchange; (vi) the terms and conditions upon
which each Partnership Interest will



be issued, evidenced by Certificates and assigned or transferred; (vii) the
method for determining the Percentage Interest as to such Partnership
Interest; and (viii) the right, if any, of each such Partnership Interest to
vote on Partnership matters, including matters relating to the relative
rights, preferences and privileges of such Partnership Interest.

(c) The General Partner shall take all actions that it determines to be
necessary or appropriate in connection with (i) each issuance of Partnership
Interests and Derivative Partnership Interests pursuant to this Section 5.6,
(ii) the conversion of the Combined Interest into Units pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement, (iii) the issuance of Common Units pursuant to Section
5.11, (iv) reflecting admission of such additional Limited Partners in the
Partnership Register as the Record Holders of such Limited Partner Interests
and (v) all additional issuances of Partnership Interests and Derivative
Partnership Interests. The General Partner shall determine the relative
rights, powers and duties of the holders of the Units or other Partnership
Interests or Derivative Partnership Interests being so issued. The General
Partner shall do all things necessary to comply with the Delaware Act and is
authorized and directed to do all things that it determines to be necessary or
appropriate in connection with any future issuance of Partnership Interests or
Derivative Partnership Interests or in connection with the conversion of the
Combined Interest into Units pursuant to the terms of this Agreement,
including compliance with any statute, rule, regulation or guideline of any
federal, state or other governmental agency or any National Securities
Exchange on which the Units or other Partnership Interests are listed or
admitted to trading.

(d) No fractional Units shall be issued by the Partnership.

Section 5.7 Reserved.

Section 5.8 Limited Preemptive Right. Except as provided in this Section 5.8
and in Section 5.2 and Section 5.11 or as otherwise provided in a separate
agreement by the Partnership, no Person shall have any preemptive,
preferential or other similar right with respect to the issuance of any
Partnership Interest, whether unissued, held in the treasury or hereafter
created. Other than with respect to the issuance of Partnership Interests in
connection with the Initial Public Offering, the General Partner shall have
the right, which it may from time to time assign in whole or in part to any of
its Affiliates, to purchase Partnership Interests from the Partnership
whenever, and on the same terms that, the Partnership issues Partnership
Interests to Persons other than the General Partner and its Affiliates, to the
extent necessary to maintain the Percentage Interests of the General Partner
and its Affiliates equal to that which existed immediately prior to the
issuance of such Partnership Interests.

Section 5.9 Splits and Combinations.

(a) Subject to Section 5.9(e), Section 5.13(i), Section 5.14(b)(vi)(E),
Section 6.6 and Section 6.9 (dealing with adjustments of distribution levels),
the Partnership may make a Pro Rata distribution of Partnership Interests to
all Record Holders or may effect a subdivision or combination of Partnership
Interests so long as, after any such event, each Partner shall have the same
Percentage Interest in the Partnership as before such event, and any amounts
calculated on a per Unit basis or stated as a number of Units (including the
number of Common



Units into which Class B Units and Series A Preferred Units may convert) are
proportionately adjusted.

(b) Whenever such a distribution, subdivision or combination of Partnership
Interests is declared, the General Partner shall select a Record Date as of
which the distribution, subdivision or combination shall be effective and
shall send notice thereof at least 20 days prior to such Record Date to each
Record Holder as of a date not less than 10 days prior to the date of such
notice (or such shorter periods as required by applicable law). The General
Partner also may cause a firm of independent public accountants selected by it
to calculate the number of Partnership Interests to be held by each Record
Holder after giving effect to such distribution, subdivision or combination.
The General Partner shall be entitled to rely on any certificate provided by
such firm as conclusive evidence of the accuracy of such calculation.

(c) If a Pro Rata distribution of Partnership Interests, or a subdivision or
combination of Partnership Interests, is made as contemplated in this Section
5.9, the number of General Partner Units constituting the Percentage Interest
of the General Partner (as determined immediately prior to the Record Date for
such distribution, subdivision or combination) shall be appropriately adjusted
as of the date of payment of such distribution, or the effective date of such
subdivision or combination, to maintain such Percentage Interest of the
General Partner.

(d) Promptly following any such distribution, subdivision or combination, the
Partnership may issue Certificates or uncertificated Partnership Interests to
the Record Holders of Partnership Interests as of the applicable Record Date
representing the new number of Partnership Interests held by such Record
Holders, or the General Partner may adopt such other procedures that it
determines to be necessary or appropriate to reflect such changes. If any such
combination results in a smaller total number of Partnership Interests
Outstanding, the Partnership shall require, as a condition to the delivery to
a Record Holder of Partnership Interests represented by Certificates, the
surrender of any Certificate held by such Record Holder immediately prior to
such Record Date.

(e) The Partnership shall not issue fractional Units or fractional General
Partner Units upon any distribution, subdivision or combination of Units. If a
distribution, subdivision or combination of Units would result in the issuance
of fractional Units and General Partner Units but for the provisions of
Section 5.6(d) and this Section 5.9(e), each fractional Unit and General
Partner Unit shall be rounded to the nearest whole Unit or General Partner
Unit (with fractional Units or General Partner Units equal to or greater than
a 0.5 Unit or General Partner Unit being rounded to the next higher Unit or
General Partner Unit).

Section 5.10 Fully Paid and Non-Assessable Nature of Limited Partner
Interests. All Limited Partner Interests issued pursuant to, and in accordance
with the requirements of, this Article V shall be fully paid and non-
assessable Limited Partner Interests in the Partnership, except as such non-
assessability may be affected by Sections 17-303, 17-607 or 17-804 of the
Delaware Act.



Section 5.11 Issuance of Common Units in Connection with Reset of Incentive
Distribution Rights.

(a) Subject to the provisions of this Section 5.11, the holder of the
Incentive Distribution Rights (or, if there is more than one holder of the
Incentive Distribution Rights, the holders of a majority in interest of the
Incentive Distribution Rights) shall have the right, at any time when the
Partnership has made a distribution pursuant to Section 6.4(a)(v) for each of
the four most recently completed Quarters and the amount of each such
distribution did not exceed Adjusted Operating Surplus for such Quarter, to
make an election (the "IDR Reset Election") to cause the Minimum Quarterly
Distribution and the Target Distributions to be reset in accordance with the
provisions of Section 5.11(e) and, in connection therewith, the holder or
holders of the Incentive Distribution Rights will become entitled to receive
their respective proportionate share of a number of Common Units (the "IDR
Reset Common Units") derived by dividing (i) the average amount of the
aggregate cash distributions made by the Partnership for the two full Quarters
immediately preceding the giving of the Reset Notice (as defined in Section
5.11(b)) in respect of the Incentive Distribution Rights by (ii) the average
of the cash distributions made by the Partnership in respect of each Common
Unit for the two full Quarters immediately preceding the giving of the Reset
Notice (the number of Common Units determined by such quotient is referred to
herein as the "Aggregate Quantity of IDR Reset Common Units"). If at the time
of any IDR Reset Election the General Partner and its Affiliates are not the
holders of a majority in interest of the Incentive Distribution Rights, then
the IDR Reset Election shall be subject to the prior written concurrence of
the General Partner that the conditions described in the immediately preceding
sentence have been satisfied. Upon the issuance of such IDR Reset Common
Units, the Partnership will issue to the General Partner that number of
additional General Partner Units equal to the product of (x) the quotient
obtained by dividing (A) the Percentage Interest of the General Partner
immediately prior to such issuance by (B) a percentage equal to 100% less such
Percentage Interest by (y) the number of such IDR Reset Common Units, and the
General Partner shall not be obligated to make any additional Capital
Contribution to the Partnership in exchange for such issuance. The making of
the IDR Reset Election in the manner specified in this Section 5.11 shall
cause the Minimum Quarterly Distribution and the Target Distributions to be
reset in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.11(e) and, in connection
therewith, the holder or holders of the Incentive Distribution Rights will
become entitled to receive IDR Reset Common Units and the General Partner will
become entitled to receive General Partner Units on the basis specified above,
without any further approval required by the General Partner or the
Unitholders other than as set forth in this Section 5.11(a), at the time
specified in Section 5.11(c) unless the IDR Reset Election is rescinded
pursuant to Section 5.11(d).

(b) To exercise the right specified in Section 5.11(a), the holder of the
Incentive Distribution Rights (or, if there is more than one holder of the
Incentive Distribution Rights, the holders of a majority in interest of the
Incentive Distribution Rights) shall deliver a written notice (the "Reset
Notice") to the Partnership. Within 10 Business Days after the receipt by the
Partnership of such Reset Notice, the Partnership shall deliver a written
notice to the holder or holders of the Incentive Distribution Rights of the
Partnership's determination of the Aggregate Quantity of IDR Reset Common
Units that each holder of Incentive Distribution Rights will be entitled to
receive.



(c) The holder or holders of the Incentive Distribution Rights will be
entitled to receive the Aggregate Quantity of IDR Reset Common Units and the
General Partner will be entitled to receive the related additional General
Partner Units on the fifteenth Business Day after receipt by the Partnership
of the Reset Notice; provided, however, that the issuance of IDR Reset Common
Units to the holder or holders of the Incentive Distribution Rights shall not
occur prior to the approval of the listing or admission for trading of such
IDR Reset Common Units by the principal National Securities Exchange upon
which the Common Units are then listed or admitted for trading if any such
approval is required pursuant to the rules and regulations of such National
Securities Exchange.

(d) If the principal National Securities Exchange upon which the Common Units
are then traded has not approved the listing or admission for trading of the
IDR Reset Common Units to be issued pursuant to this Section 5.11 on or before
the 30th calendar day following the Partnership's receipt of the Reset Notice
and such approval is required by the rules and regulations of such National
Securities Exchange, then the holder of the Incentive Distribution Rights (or,
if there is more than one holder of the Incentive Distribution Rights, the
holders of a majority in interest of the Incentive Distribution Rights) shall
have the right to either rescind the IDR Reset Election or elect to receive
other Partnership Interests having such terms as the General Partner may
approve, with the approval of the Conflicts Committee, that will provide (i)
the same economic value, in the aggregate, as the Aggregate Quantity of IDR
Reset Common Units would have had at the time of the Partnership's receipt of
the Reset Notice, as determined by the General Partner, and (ii) for the
subsequent conversion of such Partnership Interests into Common Units within
not more than 12 months following the Partnership's receipt of the Reset
Notice upon the satisfaction of one or more conditions that are reasonably
acceptable to the holder of the Incentive Distribution Rights (or, if there is
more than one holder of the Incentive Distribution Rights, the holders of a
majority in interest of the Incentive Distribution Rights).

(e) The Minimum Quarterly Distribution and the Target Distributions shall be
adjusted at the time of the issuance of IDR Reset Common Units or other
Partnership Interests pursuant to this Section 5.11 such that (i) the Minimum
Quarterly Distribution shall be reset to equal the average cash distribution
amount per Common Unit for the two Quarters immediately prior to the
Partnership's receipt of the Reset Notice (the "Reset MQD"), (ii) the First
Target Distribution shall be reset to equal 115% of the Reset MQD, (iii) the
Second Target Distribution shall be reset to equal 125% of the Reset MQD and
(iv) the Third Target Distribution shall be reset to equal 150% of the Reset
MQD.

(f) Upon the issuance of IDR Reset Common Units pursuant to Section 5.11(a),
the Capital Account maintained with respect to the Incentive Distribution
Rights will (i) first, be allocated to IDR Reset Common Units in an amount
equal to the product of (A) the Aggregate Quantity of IDR Reset Common Units
and (B) the Per Unit Capital Amount for an Initial Common Unit, and (ii)
second, as to any remaining balance in such Capital Account, will be retained
by the holder of the Incentive Distribution Rights. If there is not sufficient
capital associated with the Incentive Distribution Rights to allocate the full
Per Unit Capital Amount for an Initial Common Unit to the IDR Reset Common
Units in accordance with



clause (i) of this Section 5.11(f), the IDR Reset Common Units shall be
subject to Sections 6.1(d)(x)(B) and (C).

Section 5.12 Establishment of Class A Units.

(a) Designation. There is hereby created a class of Units designated as "Class
A Units" with the designations, preferences and relative, participating,
optional or other special rights, powers and duties as set forth in this
Section 5.12.

(b) Series. The Class A Units authorized pursuant to Section 5.12(a) are all
designated as a single series of Class A Units.

(c) Distributions. The Class A Units shall have the right to participate in
distributions with Common Units, Pro Rata, except that Class A Units will not
share in any Hydrocarbon Available Cash.

(d) Voting Rights. The Class A Units shall not be entitled to vote on, approve
or disapprove, or otherwise consent or not consent with respect to any matter
(including mergers, share exchanges and similar statutory authorizations)
except as otherwise required by any nonwaivable provision of law.

(e) Registrar and Transfer Agent. The Class A Units shall be recorded in the
Partnership Register and ownership of the Class A Units shall be evidenced by
book entry notation in the Partnership Register.

Section 5.13 Establishment of Class B Units.

(a) Designation. There is hereby created a class of Units designated as "Class
B Units" and consisting of a total of 7,981,756 Class B Units, with the
designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other
special rights, powers and duties as set forth in this Section 5.13.

(b) Series. Of the aggregate number of Class B Units authorized pursuant to
Section 5.13(a), 3,990,878 are designated as "Class B-1 Units" and 3,990,878
are designated as "Class B-2 Units."

(c) Distributions. Prior to its conversion into a Common Unit in accordance
with Section 5.13(f) or Section 5.13(g), and notwithstanding any provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, a Class B Unit shall not be entitled to
receive any distributions pursuant to this Agreement.

(d) Voting Rights. The Class B Units prior to conversion shall not be entitled
to (i) vote with the Common Units as a single class on any matters on which
holders of Common Units are entitled to vote (including the matters described
in Section 5.13(g)(iv)(B)) or (ii) vote as a separate class on any matters;
provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, but without limiting the General
Partner's authority to adopt amendments to this Agreement without the approval
of any Partners or Assignees as contemplated in Section 13.1, the Class B
Units shall



be entitled to vote as a separate class on any matter that disproportionately
and adversely affects the rights or preferences of the Class B Units in
relation to other classes of Partnership Interests, including matters subject
to Section 13.3(c) that meet the foregoing requirement, but in each case
subject to Section 14.3, and such separate class vote shall apply to matters
otherwise approved pursuant to Section 13.3(d) or Section 13.3(e) solely to
the extent they disproportionately and adversely affect the rights or
preferences of the Class B Units in relation to other classes of Partnership
Interests. The approval of a majority of the Class B Units shall be required
to approve any matter for which the holders of the Class B Units are so
entitled to vote as a separate class. For such matters Class B Units are
entitled to vote upon, each Class B Unit will be entitled to the number of
votes equal to the number of Common Units into which a Class B Unit is
convertible pursuant to Section 5.13(f) at the time of the record date for the
vote or written consent on the matter.

(e) Registrar and Transfer Agent/Certificates. The Class B Units shall be
recorded in the Partnership Register and the ownership of the Class B Units
(including the restrictions on transfer set forth in Exhibit B) shall be
evidenced by book entry notation in the Partnership Register.

(f) Conversion. Except as provided in this Section 5.13(f) and Section
5.13(g), the Class B Units are not convertible into Common Units. Each
Outstanding Class B-1 Unit and Class B-2 Unit shall automatically convert into
a number of Common Units equal to the Conversion Number on the applicable
Class B Conversion Date without any further action by the holders thereof. The
terms of a Class B Unit will be changed, automatically and without further
action, on the applicable Class B Conversion Date so that such Class B Unit is
converted into a number of Common Units equal to the Conversion Number on such
Class B Conversion Date and, immediately thereafter, such Class B Unit shall
not be Outstanding; provided, however, that each Converted Common Unit will
become Outstanding and will remain subject to the provisions of Section
6.1(d)(x) and Section 6.10.

(g) Fundamental Change.

(i) The Partnership may elect (a "Partnership Fundamental Change Election") to
convert all, but not less than all, of the Class B Units into Common Units
immediately prior to the consummation of an Elective Fundamental Change
subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 5.13(g). If the
Partnership desires to make a Partnership Fundamental Change Election it
shall, not less than 15 days prior to the date of the expected consummation of
an Elective Fundamental Change, send a written notice to each holder of Class
B Units: (A) describing the transaction or transactions that constitute such
Elective Fundamental Change; (B) stating the expected date of consummation of
such Elective Fundamental Change and the Partnership's computation of the
number of Common Units into which each Class B-1 Unit and Class B-2 Unit would
be converted pursuant to a Fundamental Change Conversion on such expected
consummation date; and (C) stating that the Partnership has made a Partnership
Fundamental Change Election with respect to such Elective Fundamental Change.
The Partnership may, by written notice to the holders of Class B Units, revoke
a Partnership Fundamental Change Election at any time prior to the 15th day
prior to the date of the consummation of the applicable Elective Fundamental
Change; provided, that the Partnership



thereafter (or simultaneously therewith) timely sends the notice to the
holders of Class B Units contemplated by Section 5.13(g)(ii).

(ii) If the Partnership does not elect to timely make a Partnership
Fundamental Change Election with respect to any Elective Fundamental Change or
revokes such an election in accordance with Section 5.13(g)(i), then the
Partnership shall, not less than 15 days prior to the date of the consummation
of an Elective Fundamental Change, send a written notice to each holder of
Class B Units: (A) describing the transaction or transactions that constitute
such Elective Fundamental Change; and (B) stating the expected date of
consummation of such Elective Fundamental Change and the Partnership's
computation of the number of Common Units into which each Class B-1 Unit and
Class B-2 Unit would be converted pursuant to a Fundamental Change Conversion
on such expected consummation date. No later than ten days following delivery
of the notice provided for in the previous sentence, the holders of Class B
Units may, in their sole discretion, deliver to the Partnership a written
notice executed by holders of a majority of the Class B Units, electing (a
"Class B Unitholder Fundamental Change Election") to convert all, but not less
than all, of the Class B Units into Common Units immediately prior to the
consummation of an Elective Fundamental Change subject to the terms and
conditions of this Section 5.13(g). Any notice from the holders of Class B
Units so electing a Class B Unitholder Fundamental Change Election (x) shall
be binding upon all holders of Class B Units and shall provide for the
conversion of all Class B Units even if less than all of the Class B Units
delivered the Class B Unitholder Fundamental Change Election, and (y) may be
conditioned on consummation of the applicable Elective Fundamental Change on
or prior to a date specified in such notice.

(iii) If (A) the Partnership timely makes and does not revoke a Partnership
Fundamental Change Election in accordance with Section 5.13(g)(i), (B) the
holders of the Class B Units timely make a Class B Unitholder Fundamental
Change Election in accordance with Section 5.13(g)(ii), or (C) the Partnership
is to be dissolved in accordance with this Agreement (the event described in
this clause (C), and any event constituting an Elective Fundamental Change,
each a "Fundamental Change"), then, immediately prior to the consummation of
the Fundamental Change, each Outstanding Class B-1 Unit and Class B-2 Unit
shall convert (a "Fundamental Change Conversion") into the number of Common
Units equal to the applicable Discounted Conversion Number as of the date of
the consummation of such Fundamental Change without any further action by the
holders thereof. The terms of each Class B Unit will be changed, automatically
and without further action, on the date of the consummation of such
Fundamental Change so that each Class B Unit is so converted into such number
of Common Units as of the date of the consummation of such Fundamental Change
and, immediately thereafter, such Class B Unit shall not be Outstanding;
provided, however, that each Converted Common Unit will become Outstanding and
will remain subject to the provisions of Section 6.1(d)(x).

(iv) For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent that a Fundamental Change
Conversion occurs in respect of any Fundamental Change pursuant to this
Section 5.13(g), the Converted Common Units issued as a result thereof shall
(A) be entitled to participate in such Fundamental Change on an as-converted
basis and to receive the consideration to which a Common Unit is entitled upon
the consummation of such Fundamental



Change and (B) not have any right to vote in respect of such Fundamental
Change or any related matter.

(h) Extraordinary Partnership Transactions. Except to the extent that any such
event is a Fundamental Change in respect of which a Fundamental Change
Conversion occurs pursuant to Section 5.13(g), prior to the consummation of
any merger, consolidation or other business combination in which the
Partnership will not be the surviving entity, the Partnership shall make
appropriate provision to ensure that the holders of Class B Units receive in
such transaction a security, issued by the Person surviving or resulting from
such transaction and containing provisions substantially equivalent to this
Section 5.13 as determined reasonably in good faith by the General Partner and
such other provisions of this Agreement as are applicable to the establishment
of the designations, preferences, rights, powers and duties of the Class B
Units (an "Equivalent Security"), including appropriate provision to ensure
that the holders of Class B Units would be entitled to receive upon subsequent
conversion of such Equivalent Security consideration equivalent to that which
each holder of a Class B Unit would have been entitled if such Class B Unit
had been converted into Common Units in connection with such Fundamental
Change, with appropriate provision being made to account for the Discounted
Conversion Numbers that would apply on any successive conversion of any such
Equivalent Security.

(i) Distributions, Combinations, Subdivisions and Reclassifications by the
Partnership. If, prior to the Final Class B Conversion Date, the Partnership:
(A) makes a distribution on its Common Units in Common Units; (B) subdivides
or splits its Common Units into a greater number of Common Units; (C) combines
or reclassifies its Common Units into a smaller number of Common Units; or (D)
issues by reclassification of its Common Units any Partnership Interests
(including any reclassification in connection with a merger, consolidation, or
business combination in which the Partnership is the surviving entity), then
the Conversion Number, each Discounted Conversion Number in effect at the time
of the Record Date for such distribution or the effective date of such
subdivision, split, combination or reclassification and all Discounted
Conversion Numbers that may be applicable from time to time after such date,
shall be proportionally adjusted based on the number of Common Units (or any
Partnership Interests into which such Common Units would have been merged,
consolidated or combined pursuant to clause (D) above) that a holder of one
Class B Unit would have been entitled to receive had such Class B Unit been
entitled to be (and had) converted, immediately prior to such Record Date or
effective date, into a number of Common Units (or any Partnership Interests
into which such Common Units would have been merged, consolidated or combined
pursuant to clause (D) above) equal to the Conversion Number then in effect.
An adjustment made pursuant to this Section 5.13(i) shall become effective
immediately after the Record Date in the case of a distribution and shall
become effective immediately after the effective date in the case of a
subdivision, split, combination or reclassification. Adjustments shall be made
successively pursuant to this Section 5.13(i) whenever any event described in
this Section 5.13(i) shall occur. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no adjustment
would be made pursuant to clause (D) above in respect of any Fundamental
Change where the Partnership or the holders of Class B Units elect to convert
the Class B Units into Common Units in connection with such Fundamental
Change.



(j) No Fractional Converted Common Units. Notwithstanding anything in this
Section 5.13, no fractional Common Units shall be issued upon any conversion
of Class B Units into Converted Common Units in accordance with Section
5.13(f) or Section 5.13(g). All Common Units (including fractions thereof)
issuable upon conversion of more than one Class B Unit by a holder thereof
shall be aggregated for purposes of determining whether the conversion would
result in the issuance of any fractional unit. If, after the aforementioned
aggregation, the conversion would result in the issuance of a fraction of a
Common Unit, the Partnership shall, in lieu of issuing any fractional unit, at
the Partnership's option, either round each fractional Unit to the nearest
whole Unit (and a 0.5 Unit shall be rounded to the next higher Unit) or pay
the holder otherwise entitled to such fractional Unit a sum in cash determined
by reference to the Current Market Price of a Common Unit on the date of such
conversion.

(k) Surrender of Certificates. Subject to the requirements of Section 6.10,
upon a conversion of Class B Units into Common Units in accordance with
Section 5.13(f) or Section 5.13(g), the Partnership shall, as soon as
practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such office, to such holder of
Class B Units, one or more certificates, registered in the name of such
holder, or other evidence of the issuance of uncertificated certificates, for
the number of Common Units and, if applicable, Class B Units, to which such
holder shall then be entitled. Such a conversion shall be deemed to have been
made as of the applicable Class B Conversion Date, and the Person entitled to
receive the Common Units issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for
all purposes as the record holder of such Common Units as of such date.

(l) Initial Capital Account. The Capital Account with respect to each Class B
Unit as of December 4, 2015 shall equal the Class B Target Capital Amount as
of such date.

(m) Restrictions on Transfer. For purposes of this Section 5.13(m), the term
"transfer," shall be deemed to refer to a transaction by which the holder of a
Class B Unit directly or indirectly assigns such Class B Unit to another
Person, and includes (i) a sale, assignment, gift, pledge, encumbrance,
hypothecation, mortgage, exchange or any other disposition by operation of law
or otherwise and (ii) entry into any swap or other transaction or arrangement
that transfers or that is designed to, or that might reasonably be expected
to, result in the transfer to another Person, in whole or in part, any of the
economic consequences of ownership of such Class B Unit.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
without the prior approval of the Board of Directors, MandR Liberty shall not
transfer any Class B Units. Any subsequent transfer of Class B Units by a
transferee so approved by the Board of Directors shall also require the prior
written approval of the Board of Directors.

(ii) For the avoidance of doubt, subject to the other restrictions set forth
in this Section 5.13(m) and Section 4.8(g), neither MandR Liberty nor any other
MandR Group Member may in any case transfer Class B Units to an MandR Group Member
if such transfer has as a purpose the avoidance of or is otherwise undertaken
in contemplation of avoiding the restrictions on transfers in this Section
5.13(m) or elsewhere in this Agreement (it being understood that the purpose
of this Section 5.13(m) is to prohibit the transfer of Class B Units to an MandR
Group Member followed by a change in the relationship between the transferor
and



such MandR Group Member (or a change of control of such transferor or MandR Group
Member) after the transfer, with the result and effect that the transferor has
indirectly made a transfer of Class B Units by using an MandR Group Member,
which transfer would not have been directly permitted under this Section
5.13(m) had such change in such relationship occurred prior to such transfer).

(iii) Upon reasonable request by the Partnership from time to time but no more
often than quarterly, unless such a request is made in anticipation of any
vote of the Record Holders of Units (or any class of Units), MandR Liberty and
each other MandR Group Member who owns Units shall provide the Partnership with
a written certification, signed by an executive officer of such Person (to the
extent such Person is not a natural person), setting forth the number of Class
B Units and the number of Common Units owned beneficially and of record by
such Person. Each of MandR Liberty and each other MandR Group Member shall, upon
the request of the Partnership, provide the Partnership with copies of records
of any transfers of Class B Units or Common Units involving such Person.

Section 5.14 Establishment of Series A Preferred Units.

(a) General. There is hereby created a class of Units designated as "Series A
Convertible Preferred Units" (the "Series A Preferred Units"), with the
designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other
special rights, powers and duties as set forth in this Section 5.14 and
elsewhere in this Agreement.

(b) Rights of Series A Preferred Units. The Series A Preferred Units shall
have the following rights, preferences and privileges and the Series A
Preferred Unitholders shall be subject to the following duties and
obligations:

(i) Distributions.

(A) Subject to Section 5.14(b)(i)(B), commencing with the Quarter ending on
June 30, 2016, subject to Section 5.14(b)(i)(D), the Record Holders of the
Series A Preferred Units as of the applicable Record Date for each Quarter
shall be entitled to receive, in respect of each outstanding Series A
Preferred Unit, cumulative distributions in respect of such Quarter equal to
the sum of (1) the Series A Distribution Amount for such Quarter and (2) any
Series A Unpaid Cash Distributions (collectively, a "Series A Quarterly
Distribution"). Each Series A Quarterly Distribution shall be payable
quarterly in cash within sixty (60) days after the end of the applicable
Quarter (each such payment date, a "Series A Distribution Payment Date"). If
the General Partner establishes an earlier Record Date for any distribution to
be made by the Partnership on other Partnership Interests in respect of any
Quarter, then the Record Date established pursuant to this Section 5.14(b)(i)
for a Series A Quarterly Distribution in respect of such Quarter shall be the
same Record Date. For the avoidance of doubt, subject to Section
5.14(b)(i)(D), the Series A Preferred Units shall not be entitled to any
distributions made pursuant to Section 6.4 for any Quarter so long as the
Series A Quarterly Distribution has been declared and paid in accordance with
this Section 5.14(b)(i) on the Series A Preferred Units with respect to such
Quarter.



(B) If the Partnership fails to pay in full the Series A Distribution Amount
of any Series A Quarterly Distribution in cash when due for any Quarter, then
from and after the first date of such failure and continuing until such
failure is cured by payment in full in cash of all such arrearages, (1) the
amount of such unpaid cash distributions (on a per Series A Preferred Unit
basis, "Series A Unpaid Cash Distributions") unless and until paid will accrue
and accumulate from and including the first day of the Quarter immediately
following the Quarter in respect of which such payment is due until paid in
full and (2) the Partnership shall not be permitted to, and shall not, declare
or make, any distributions, redemptions or repurchases in respect of any
Series A Junior Securities or Series A Parity Securities (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, with respect to the Quarter for which the Partnership
first failed to pay in full the Series A Distribution Amount of any Series A
Quarterly Distribution in cash when due); provided, however, that
distributions may be declared and paid on the Series A Preferred Units and the
Series A Parity Securities so long as such distributions are declared and paid
pro rata so that amounts of distributions declared per Series A Preferred Unit
and Series A Parity Security shall in all cases bear to each other the same
ratio that accrued and accumulated distributions per Series A Preferred Unit
and Series A Parity Security bear to each other.

(C) The aggregate Series A Distribution Amount shall be paid out of Available
Cash that is deemed to be Operating Surplus for the applicable Quarter. To the
extent that any portion of a Series A Quarterly Distribution with respect to
any Quarter exceeds the amount of Available Cash that is deemed to be
Operating Surplus for such Quarter, the amount of cash equal to the Available
Cash that is deemed to be Operating Surplus for such Quarter will be paid to
the Series A Preferred Unitholders Pro Rata and the balance of such Series A
Quarterly Distribution shall be unpaid and shall constitute an arrearage and
shall accrue and accumulate as set forth in Section 5.14(b)(i)(B).

(D) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.14(b)(i) to the contrary, with
respect to any Series A Preferred Unit that is converted into a Common Unit,
the Record Holder thereof shall not be entitled to a distribution in respect
of such Series A Preferred Unit and a distribution in respect of such Common
Unit with respect to the same period, but shall be entitled only to the
distribution to be paid based upon the class of Units held as of the close of
business on the applicable Record Date. For the avoidance of doubt, if a
Series A Conversion Date occurs prior to the close of business on a Record
Date for payment of a distribution on the Common Units, the applicable Record
Holder of Series A Preferred Units shall receive, with respect to any Series A
Preferred Units that have converted into Common Units, only the distribution
in respect of such Common Units with respect to such period.

(E) Notwithstanding anything in Article VI to the contrary, the holders of the
Incentive Distribution Rights shall not be entitled to receive distributions
or allocations of income or gain that correspond or relate to amounts
distributed or allocated to Unitholders in respect of Series A Preferred
Units.

(ii) Issuance of the Series A Preferred Units. Subject to Section 5.14(b)(iv),
the Series A Preferred Units shall be issued by the Partnership pursuant to
the terms and conditions of the Series A Purchase Agreement.



(iii) Voting Rights.

(A) Except as provided in Section 5.14(b)(iii)(B), the Outstanding Series A
Preferred Units shall have voting rights that are identical to the voting
rights of the Common Units and shall vote with the Common Units as a single
class, so that each Outstanding Series A Preferred Unit will be entitled to
one vote for each Common Unit into which such Series A Preferred Unit would be
convertible at the then applicable Series A Conversion Rate (regardless of
whether the Series A Preferred Units are then convertible) on each matter with
respect to which each Record Holder of a Common Unit is entitled to vote. Each
reference in this Agreement to a vote of Record Holders of Common Units shall
be deemed to be a reference to the Record Holders of Common Units and Series A
Preferred Units, voting together as a single class during any period in which
any Series A Preferred Units are Outstanding.

(B) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in addition to all
other requirements imposed by Delaware law, and all other voting rights
granted under this Agreement, the affirmative vote of the Record Holders of
the Series A Required Voting Percentage shall be required for any amendment to
this Agreement or the Certificate of Limited Partnership (including by merger
or otherwise or any amendment contemplated by and made in accordance with
Section 5.14(b)(iv)) that is materially adverse to any of the rights,
preferences and privileges of the Series A Preferred Units. Without limiting
the generality of the preceding sentence, any amendment shall be deemed to
have such a material adverse impact if such amendment would:

(1) Reduce the Series A Distribution Amount, change the form of payment of
distributions on the Series A Preferred Units, defer the date from which
distributions on the Series A Preferred Units will accrue, cancel accrued and
unpaid distributions on the Series A Preferred Units, or change the seniority
rights of the Series A Preferred Unitholders as to the payment of
distributions in relation to the holders of any other class or series of
Partnership Interests;

(2) Reduce the amount payable or change the form of payment to the Record
Holders of the Series A Preferred Units upon the voluntary or involuntary
liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or sale of all or substantially all of
the assets, of the Partnership, or change the seniority of the liquidation
preferences of the Record Holders of the Series A Preferred Units in relation
to the rights upon liquidation of the holders of any other class or series of
Partnership Interests; or

(3) Make the Series A Preferred Units redeemable or convertible at the option
of the Partnership other than as set forth herein.

(C) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.14(b)(iii), in
no event shall the consent of the Series A Preferred Unitholders, as a
separate class, be required in connection with any Series A Change of Control
or Partnership Restructuring Event. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing
shall not limit the voting rights of



any Series A Preferred Unitholder in connection with the vote of Record
Holders of Common Units and Series A Preferred Units together as a single
class.

(D) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in addition to all
other voting rights granted under this Agreement, the Partnership shall not
declare or pay any distribution from Capital Surplus without the affirmative
vote of the Record Holders of the Series A Required Voting Percentage.

(iv) No Series A Senior Securities; Series A Parity Securities. Other than
issuances contemplated by the Series A Purchase Agreement, the Partnership
shall not, without the affirmative vote of the Record Holders of the Series A
Required Voting Percentage, issue any (A) Series A Senior Securities (or amend
the provisions of any class of Partnership Interests to make such class of
Partnership Interests a class of Series A Senior Securities) or (B) Series A
Parity Securities (or amend the provisions of any class of Partnership
Interests to make such class of Partnership Interests a class of Series A
Parity Securities) or Series A Preferred Units; provided that, without the
consent of the holders of Outstanding Series A Preferred Units (but without
prejudice to their rights under Section 5.14(b)(iii)(A)), the Partnership may
issue (1) at any time in the aggregate, up to the greater of (a) an aggregate
$500,000,000 of Series A Parity Securities and (b) a number of Series A Parity
Securities such that, as of the date of the issuance of the Series A Parity
Securities, the aggregate number of Series A Parity Securities, together with
the Series A Preferred Units, in each case on an "as if" converted basis (or,
if the Series A Parity Securities are not convertible, assuming that such
Series A Parity Securities are convertible into a number of Common Units equal
to the quotient of (i) the aggregate purchase price for such Series A Parity
Securities, divided by (ii) the volume-weighted average price of the Common
Units for the twenty (20) Trading Day period ending immediately prior to such
issuance (such Common Units, the "Series A Parity Equivalent Units")), equals
no more than 15% of all Outstanding Common Units (including as Outstanding for
such purposes, (i) any Common Units issuable in respect of the Series A
Preferred Units at the then applicable Series A Conversion Rate (regardless of
whether the Series A Preferred Units are then convertible), (ii) any Common
Units issuable in respect of Series A Parity Securities (including any
warrants issued in connection with Series A Parity Securities) at the initial
or then applicable conversion rate, as applicable, (iii) any Series A Parity
Equivalent Units and (iv) any Common Units that would otherwise be excluded by
operation of clauses (a) and (b) of the definition of the term "Outstanding"),
and (2) if a number of Series A Preferred Units having an aggregate Series A
Issue Price of less than $500,000,000 is then Outstanding, such number of
Series A Parity Securities as determined by the General Partner. Subject to
Section 5.14(b)(vi)(E), the Partnership may, without any vote of the holders
of Outstanding Series A Preferred Units (but without prejudice to their rights
under Section 5.14(b)(iii)(A)), create (by reclassification or otherwise) and
issue Series A Junior Securities in an unlimited amount.

(v) Legends. Each book entry evidencing a Series A Preferred Unit shall bear a
restrictive notation in substantially the form set forth in Exhibit D.



(vi) Conversion.

(A) At the Option of the Series A Preferred Unitholders. Beginning with the
earlier of (i) the third anniversary of the Series A Issuance Date, and (ii)
immediately prior to the liquidation, dissolution and winding up of the
Partnership under Section 12.4, the Series A Preferred Units owned by any
Series A Preferred Unitholder shall be convertible, in whole or in part, at
any time and from time to time upon the request of such Series A Preferred
Unitholder, but not more than once per Quarter by such Series A Preferred
Unitholder (inclusive of any conversion by such Series A Preferred
Unitholder's Affiliates, with each Series A Preferred Unitholder and its
Affiliates being entitled to a single conversion right per Quarter), into a
number of Common Units determined by multiplying the number of Series A
Preferred Units to be converted by the Series A Conversion Rate at such time;
provided, however, that the Partnership shall not be obligated to honor any
such conversion request if such conversion request does not involve an
underlying value of Common Units of at least $100,000,000 (taking into account
any concurrent conversion requests by any Affiliates of such Series A
Preferred Unitholder) based on the Closing Price of Common Units on the
Trading Day immediately preceding the Series A Conversion Notice Date (or a
lesser amount to the extent such exercise covers all of such Series A
Preferred Unitholder's Series A Preferred Units). Immediately upon the
issuance of Common Units as a result of any conversion of Series A Preferred
Units, all rights of the Series A Converting Unitholder with respect to such
Series A Preferred Units shall cease, including any further accrual of
distributions, and such Series A Converting Unitholder thereafter shall be
treated for all purposes as the owner of Common Units. Fractional Common Units
shall not be issued to any Person pursuant to this Section 5.14(b)(vi)(A)
(each fractional Common Unit shall be rounded down with the remainder being
paid an amount in cash based on the Closing Price of Common Units on the
Trading Day immediately preceding the Series A Conversion Notice Date).

(B) At the Option of the Partnership. At any time following the fourth
anniversary of the Series A Issuance Date, the Partnership shall have the
option at any time, but not more than once per Quarter, to convert all or any
portion of the Series A Preferred Units then Outstanding into a number of
Common Units determined by multiplying the number of Series A Preferred Units
to be converted by the Series A Conversion Rate. Fractional Common Units shall
not be issued to any Person pursuant to this Section 5.14(b)(vi)(B) (each
fractional Common Unit shall be rounded down with the remainder being paid an
amount in cash based on the Closing Price of Common Units on the Trading Day
immediately preceding the Series A Forced Conversion Notice Date).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in order for the Partnership to exercise such
option:

(1) The Closing Price of the Common Units must be equal to or greater than one
hundred fifty percent (150%) of the Series A Issue Price for the twenty (20)
Trading Day period immediately preceding the Series A Forced Conversion Notice
Date;

(2) The average daily trading volume of the Common Units on the National
Securities Exchange on which the Common Units are then listed or admitted to
trading must be equal to or exceed 1,000,000 (as such amount may be adjusted
to



reflect any Unit split, combination or similar event) for the twenty (20)
Trading Day period immediately preceding the Series A Forced Conversion Notice
Date; and

(3) The Partnership must have an effective registration statement on file with
the Commission covering resales of the underlying Common Units to be received
upon any such conversion, and

provided, that each such conversion by the Partnership shall be for an
aggregate amount of Series A Preferred Units involving an underlying value of
Common Units of at least $100,000,000 based on the Closing Price of Common
Units on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Series A Forced Conversion
Notice Date (or a lesser amount if such amount includes all then Outstanding
Series A Preferred Units) and shall be allocated among the Series A Preferred
Unitholders on a Pro Rata basis or on such other basis as may be agreed upon
by all Series A Preferred Unitholders.

(C) Conversion Notice.

(1) To convert Series A Preferred Units into Common Units pursuant to Section
5.14(b)(vi)(A), a Series A Converting Unitholder shall give written notice (a
"Series A Conversion Notice," and the date such notice is received, a "Series
A Conversion Notice Date") to the Partnership stating that such Series A
Preferred Unitholder elects to so convert Series A Preferred Units pursuant to
Section 5.14(b)(vi)(A) and the number of Series A Preferred Units to be
converted.

(2) To convert Series A Preferred Units into Common Units pursuant to Section
5.14(b)(vi)(B), the Partnership shall give written notice (a "Series A Forced
Conversion Notice," and the date such notice is received, a "Series A Forced
Conversion Notice Date") to each Record Holder of Series A Preferred Units
stating that the Partnership elects to force conversion of Series A Preferred
Units pursuant to Section 5.14(b)(vi)(B) and the number of Series A Preferred
Units to be so converted. The Series A Conversion Units shall be issued in the
name of the Record Holder of such Series A Preferred Units.

(D) Timing. If a Series A Conversion Notice is delivered by a Series A
Preferred Unitholder to the Partnership or a Series A Forced Conversion Notice
is delivered by the Partnership to a Series A Preferred Unitholder, each in
accordance with Section 5.14(b)(vi)(C), the Partnership shall issue the
applicable Series A Conversion Units no later than three (3) Business Days
after the Series A Conversion Notice Date or the Series A Forced Conversion
Notice Date, as the case may be, occurs (any date of issuance of such Common
Units, and any date of issuance of Common Units upon conversion of Series A
Preferred Units pursuant to Section 5.14(b)(vi)(G) or Section 5.14(b)(vii), a
"Series A Conversion Date"). On the Series A Conversion Date, the Partnership
shall instruct, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause,
its Transfer Agent to electronically transmit the Series A Conversion Units
issuable upon conversion to such Series A Preferred Unitholder (or designated
recipient(s)), by crediting the account of the Series A Preferred Unitholder
(or designated recipient(s)) prime broker with the Depository through its
Deposit Withdrawal Agent



Commission system. The parties agree to coordinate with the Depository to
accomplish this objective. Upon issuance of Series A Conversion Units to the
Series A Converting Unitholder, all rights under the converted Series A
Preferred Units shall cease, and such Series A Converting Unitholder shall be
treated for all purposes as the Record Holder of such Series A Conversion
Units.

(E) Distributions, Combinations, Subdivisions and Reclassifications by the
Partnership. If, after the Series A Issuance Date, the Partnership (i) makes a
distribution on its Common Units payable in Common Units or another
Partnership Interest, (ii) subdivides or splits its outstanding Common Units
into a greater number of Common Units, (iii) combines or reclassifies its
Common Units into a lesser number of Common Units, (iv) issues by
reclassification of its Common Units any Partnership Interests (including any
reclassification in connection with a merger, consolidation or business
combination in which the Partnership is the surviving Person), (v) effects a
Pro Rata repurchase of Common Units, in each case other than in connection
with a Series A Change of Control (which shall be governed by Section
5.14(b)(vii)), (vi) issues to holders of Common Units, in their capacity as
holders of Common Units, rights, options or warrants entitling them to
subscribe for or purchase Common Units at less than the market value thereof,
(vii) distributes to holders of Common Units evidences of indebtedness,
Partnership Interests (other than Common Units) or other assets (including
securities, but excluding any distribution referred to in clause (i), any
rights or warrants referred to in clause (ii), any consideration payable in
connection with a tender or exchange offer made by the Partnership or any of
its subsidiaries and any distribution of Units or any class or series, or
similar Partnership Interest, of or relating to a subsidiary or other business
unit in the case of certain spin-off transactions described below), or (viii)
consummates a spin-off, where the Partnership makes a distribution to all
holders of Common Units consisting of Units of any class or series, or similar
equity interests of, or relating to, a subsidiary or other business unit, then
the Series A Conversion Rate, the Series A Conversion Floor Trigger and,
solely for purposes of Section 5.14(B)(vi)(b)(1), the Series A Issue Price, in
each case, in effect at the time of the Record Date for such distribution or
the effective date of any such other transaction shall be proportionately
adjusted: (1) in respect of clauses (i) through (iv) above, so that the
conversion of the Series A Preferred Units after such time shall entitle each
Series A Preferred Unitholder to receive the aggregate number of Common Units
(or any Partnership Interests into which such Common Units would have been
combined, consolidated, merged or reclassified, as applicable) that such
Series A Preferred Unitholder would have been entitled to receive if the
Series A Preferred Units had been converted into Common Units immediately
prior to such Record Date or effective date, as the case may be, (2) in
respect of clauses (v) through (viii) above, in the reasonable discretion of
the General Partner to appropriately ensure that the Series A Preferred Units
are convertible into an economically equivalent number of Common Units after
taking into account the event described in clauses (vi) through (viii) above,
and (3) in addition to the foregoing, in the case of a merger, consolidation
or business combination in which the Partnership is the surviving Person, the
Partnership shall provide effective provisions to ensure that the provisions
in this Section 5.14 relating to the Series A Preferred Units shall not be
abridged or amended and that the Series A Preferred Units shall thereafter
retain the same powers, economic rights, preferences and relative
participating, optional and other special rights, and the qualifications,
limitations and restrictions thereon, that the Series A Preferred Units had
immediately prior to such transaction or event, and, solely for purposes of
Section



5.14(B)(vi)(b)(1), the Series A Issue Price, and any other terms of the Series
A Preferred Units that the General Partner in its reasonable discretion
determines require adjustment to achieve the economic equivalence described
below, shall be proportionately adjusted to take into account any such
subdivision, split, combination or reclassification. An adjustment made
pursuant to this Section 5.14(b)(vi)(E) shall become effective immediately
after the Record Date in the case of a distribution and shall become effective
immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision,
combination, reclassification (including any reclassification in connection
with a merger, consolidation or business combination in which the Partnership
is the surviving Person) or split. Such adjustment shall be made successively
whenever any event described above shall occur.

(F) No Adjustments for Certain Items. Notwithstanding any of the other
provisions of this Section 5.14(b)(vi), no adjustment shall be made to the
Series A Conversion Rate, the Series A Conversion Floor Trigger or the Series
A Issue Price pursuant to Section 5.14(b)(vi)(E) as a result of any of the
following:

(1) Any issuance of Partnership Interests in exchange for cash;

(2) Any grant of Common Units or options, warrants or rights to purchase or
receive Common Units or the issuance of Common Units upon the exercise or
vesting of any such options, warrants or rights in respect of services
provided to or for the benefit of the Partnership or its Subsidiaries, under
compensation plans and agreements approved by the General Partner (including
any long-term incentive plan);

(3) Any issuance of Common Units as all or part of the consideration to effect
(i) the closing of any acquisition by the Partnership of assets or equity
interests of a third party in an arm's-length transaction, (ii) closing of any
acquisition by the Partnership of assets or equity interests of MPC or any of
its Affiliates or (iii) the consummation of a merger, consolidation or other
business combination of the Partnership with another entity in which the
Partnership survives and the Common Units remain Outstanding to the extent any
such transaction set forth in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above is validly
approved by the General Partner; or

(4) The issuance of Common Units upon conversion of the Series A Preferred
Units, Series A Parity Securities or Class B Units.

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, whenever the
issuance of a Partnership Interest or other event would require an adjustment
to the Series A Conversion Rate under one or more provisions of this
Agreement, only one adjustment shall be made to the Series A Conversion Rate
in respect of such issuance or event.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.14(b)(vi)(E), unless
otherwise determined by the General Partner, no adjustment to the Series A
Conversion Rate, Series A Conversion Floor Trigger or the Series A Issue Price
shall be made with respect to any distribution or other transaction described
in Section 5.14(b)(vi)(E) if the Series A Preferred Unitholders are entitled
to participate in such distribution or transaction as if they held a number of
Common Units



issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Units immediately prior to
such event at the then applicable Series A Conversion Rate, without having to
convert their Series A Preferred Units.

(G) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.14(b)(vii) or
elsewhere in this Agreement, in connection with any transaction pursuant to
which MPC or any of its Affiliates (other than the Partnership or any of its
Subsidiaries) would acquire, (x) all of the Partnership's outstanding Common
Units or (y) all or substantially all of the assets of the Partnership and its
Subsidiaries, in each case including by way of merger, consolidation, or
otherwise (including any such transaction undertaken pursuant to Section
15.1), then the Partnership shall have the right, by delivering written notice
to the Record Holders of the Series A Preferred Units, to convert all, but not
less than all, of the Series A Preferred Units into Common Units at the Series
A COC Conversion Rate effective immediately prior to the consummation of such
transaction.

(vii) Series A Change of Control.

(A) Subject to Section 5.14(b)(vi)(B), in the event of a Series A Cash COC
Event, the Outstanding Series A Preferred Units shall be automatically
converted, without requirement of any action of the Series A Preferred
Unitholders, into Common Units immediately prior to the closing of the Series
A Cash COC Event at the Series A COC Conversion Rate.

(B) Subject to Section 5.14(b)(vi)(B) and Section 5.14(b)(vi)(G), at least ten
(10) Business Days prior to consummating a Series A Change of Control (other
than a Series A Cash COC Event), the Partnership shall provide written notice
thereof to the Series A Preferred Unitholders. Subject to Section
5.14(b)(vi)(B), if a Series A Change of Control (other than a Series A Cash
COC Event) occurs, then each Series A Preferred Unitholder, with respect to
all but not less than all of its Series A Preferred Units, by notice given to
the Partnership within five (5) Business Days of the date the Partnership
provides written notice of the execution of definitive agreements that provide
for such Series A Change of Control, shall be entitled to elect one of the
following (with the understanding that any Series A Preferred Unitholder who
fails to timely provide notice of its election to the Partnership shall be
deemed to have elected the option set forth in sub-clause (1) below):

(1) Convert all, but not less than all, of such Series A Preferred
Unitholder's Outstanding Series A Preferred Units into Common Units, at the
then-applicable Series A Conversion Rate;

(2) If the Partnership will not be the surviving entity of such Series A
Change of Control or the Partnership will be the surviving entity but its
Common Units will cease to be listed or admitted to trading on a National
Securities Exchange, require the Partnership to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to deliver or to cause to be delivered to the Series A
Preferred Unitholders, in exchange for their Series A Preferred Units upon
such Series A Change of Control, a security in the surviving entity or the
parent of the surviving entity that has substantially similar rights,
preferences and privileges as the Series A Preferred Units,



including, for the avoidance of doubt, the right to distributions equal in
amount and timing to those provided in Section 5.14(b)(i) and a conversion
rate proportionately adjusted such that the conversion of such security in the
surviving entity or parent of the surviving entity immediately following the
Series A Change of Control would entitle the Record Holder to the number of
common securities of such entity (together with a number of common securities
of equivalent value to any other assets received by holders of Common Units in
such Series A Change of Control) which, if a Series A Preferred Unit had been
converted into Common Units immediately prior to such Series A Change of
Control, such Record Holder would have been entitled to receive immediately
following such Series A Change of Control (such security in the surviving
entity, a "Series A Substantially Equivalent Unit"); provided, however, that,
if the Partnership is unable to deliver or cause to be delivered Series A
Substantially Equivalent Units to any Series A Preferred Unitholder in
connection with such Series A Change of Control, each Series A Preferred
Unitholder shall be entitled to (I) require conversion or redemption of such
Series A Preferred Units in the manner contemplated by subclause (1) or (4) of
this Section 5.14(b)(vii)(B) (at such holder's election) or (II) convert the
Series A Preferred Units held by such Series A Preferred Unitholder
immediately prior to such Series A Change of Control into a number of Common
Units at a conversion ratio equal to the quotient of: (a) the product of (i)
160% multiplied by (ii) the Series A Issue Price less the Series A Preferred
Unitholder's Pro Rata portion of the sum of all cash distributions paid on all
Series A Preferred Units on or prior to the date of the Series A Change of
Control, divided by (b) an amount equal to 95% of the volume-weighted average
price of the Common Units for the thirty (30) Trading Day period prior to the
closing of the Series A Change of Control; provided that such ratio shall in
no event exceed a value per Series A Preferred Unit equal to (i) 120% of the
Series A Issue Price in the case of a Series A Change of Control occurring on
or prior to the first anniversary of the Series A Issuance Date, (ii) 130% of
the Series A Issue Price in the case of a Series A Change of Control occurring
after the first anniversary of the Series A Issuance Date but on or prior to
the second anniversary of the Series A Issuance Date, and (iii) 140% of the
Series A Issue Price in the case of a Series A Change of Control occurring
after the second anniversary of the Series A Issuance Date but on or prior to
the third anniversary of the Series A Issuance Date.

(3) If the Partnership is the surviving entity of such Series A Change of
Control, continue to hold Series A Preferred Units; or

(4) Require the Partnership to redeem the Series A Preferred Units at a price
per Series A Preferred Unit equal to 101% of the Series A Issue Price plus (x)
Series A Unpaid Cash Distributions on the applicable Series A Preferred Unit
and (y) Series A Partial Period Distributions on the applicable Series A
Preferred Unit. Any redemption pursuant to this sub-clause (4) shall, as
determined by the General Partner, be paid in cash and/or Common Units. If all
or any portion of such redemption is to be paid in Common Units, the Common
Units to be issued shall be valued at 95% of the volume-weighted average price
of the Common Units for the thirty (30) Trading Day period ending on the fifth
Trading Day immediately prior to the Series A Change of Control. No later than
three Trading Days prior to the consummation of the related Series A Change of
Control, the Partnership shall deliver a written notice to the Record Holders
of the Series A Preferred Units stating the date on which the Series A
Preferred Units will be redeemed and the Partnership's computation of the
amount of cash or Common Units to be received by the Record Holder upon
redemption of such Series A



Preferred Units. If the Partnership shall be the surviving entity of the
related Series A Change of Control, then no later than 10 Business Days
following the consummation of such Series A Change of Control, the Partnership
shall remit the applicable cash or Common Unit consideration to the Record
Holders of then Outstanding Series A Preferred Units. If the Partnership shall
not be the surviving entity of the related Series A Change of Control, then
the Partnership shall remit the applicable cash or Common Unit immediately
prior to the consummation of the Series A Change of Control. The Record
Holders shall deliver to the Partnership any Certificates representing the
Series A Preferred Units as soon as practicable following the redemption.
Record Holders of the Series A Preferred Units shall retain all of the rights
and privileges thereof unless and until the consideration due to them as a
result of such redemption shall be paid in full in cash or Common Units, as
applicable. After any such redemption, any such redeemed Series A Preferred
Unit shall no longer constitute an issued and Outstanding Limited Partner
Interest.

(viii) Series A Preferred Unit Transfer Restrictions.

(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 5.14(b)(viii), each
Series A Preferred Unitholder shall be permitted to transfer any Series A
Preferred Units owned by such Series A Preferred Unitholder to any of its
Affiliates or to any other Series A Preferred Unitholder.

(B) Without the prior written consent of the Partnership, except as
specifically provided in this Agreement and the Series A Purchase Agreement,
each Series A Preferred Unitholder shall not, (a) during the period commencing
on the Series A Issuance Date and ending on the first anniversary of the
Series A Issuance Date, offer, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or
contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any
option, right or warrant to purchase, lend, or otherwise transfer or dispose
of, directly or indirectly, any of its Series A Preferred Units, (b) during
the period commencing on the Series A Issuance Date and ending on the second
anniversary of the Series A Issuance Date, directly or indirectly engage in
any short sales or other derivative or hedging transactions with respect to
the Series A Preferred Units that are designed to, or that might reasonably be
expected to, result in the transfer to another, in whole or in part, any of
the economic consequences of ownership of any Series A Preferred Units, (c)
transfer any Series A Preferred Units to any non-U.S. resident individual,
non-U.S. corporation or partnership, or any other non-U.S. entity, including
any foreign governmental entity, including by means of any swap or other
transaction or arrangement that transfers or that is designed to, or that
might reasonably be expected to, result in the transfer to another, in whole
or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of any Series A
Preferred Units, regardless of whether any transaction described in clauses
(a) through (c) above is to be settled by delivery of Series A Preferred
Units, Common Units or other securities, in cash or otherwise, or (d) effect
any transfer of Series A Preferred Units or Series A Conversion Units in a
manner that violates the terms of this Agreement; provided, however, that such
Series A Preferred Unitholder may pledge all or any portion of its Series A
Preferred Units to any holders of obligations owed by the Series A Preferred
Unitholders, including to the trustee for, or representative of, such holders.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any transferee receiving any Series A Preferred
Units pursuant to this Section 5.14(b)(viii)(B) shall agree to the
restrictions set forth in this Section 5.14(b)(viii)(B).



(C) Following the first anniversary of the Series A Issuance Date, the Series
A Purchasers or their permitted transferees may freely transfer Series A
Preferred Units involving an underlying value of Common Units of at least
$50,000,000 (taking into account any concurrent transfers by Affiliates of
such Series A Preferred Unitholder) based on the Series A Issue Price (or such
lesser amount if it (i) constitutes the remaining holdings of such Series A
Preferred Unitholder or (ii) has been approved by the General Partner),
subject to compliance with applicable securities laws and this Agreement,
including subclauses (b) and (c) of Section 5.14(b)(viii)(B).

(D) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in subclause (a) of Section
5.14(b)(viii)(B), but subject to compliance with applicable securities laws
and this Agreement, including subclauses (b) and (c) of Section
5.14(b)(viii)(B), during the period beginning on the Series A Issuance Date
and ending on the date that is 60 days after the Series A Issuance Date (the
"Non-Affiliate Transfer Period"), Stonepeak and its Affiliates may transfer or
dispose of Series A Preferred Units to one or more non-Affiliates of
Stonepeak, subject to the consent of the Partnership as to the identity of the
transferee (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed); provided, however, that (A) any transfer made pursuant to this
sentence must consist of Series A Preferred Units in an amount not less than
$25 million based on the Series A Issue Price, (B) the aggregate amount of
Series A Preferred Units and rights to purchase Series A Preferred Units
transferred pursuant to this Section 5.14(b)(viii)(D) and Section 8.10 of the
Series A Purchase Agreement shall not be greater than $100 million based on
the Series A Issue Price and (C) a maximum of two transfers may be made
pursuant to this Section 5.14(b)(viii)(D) and Section 8.10 of the Series A
Purchase Agreement.

(ix) Fully Paid and Non-Assessable. Any Series A Conversion Unit(s) delivered
pursuant to this Section 5.14 shall be validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable (except as such non-assessability may be affected by matters
described in Sections 17-303, 17-607 and 17-804 of the Delaware Act), free and
clear of any liens, claims, rights or encumbrances other than those arising
under the Delaware Act or this Agreement or created by the holders thereof.

(x) Notices. For the avoidance of doubt, the Partnership shall distribute to
the Record Holders of Series A Preferred Units copies of all notices,
materials, annual and quarterly reports, proxy statements, information
statements and any other documents distributed generally to the Record Holders
of Common Units of the Partnership, at such times and by such method as such
documents are distributed to such Record Holders of such Common Units.

ARTICLE VI

ALLOCATIONS AND DISTRIBUTIONS

Section 6.1 Allocations for Capital Account Purposes. For purposes of
maintaining the Capital Accounts and in determining the rights of the Partners
among themselves, the Partnership\'s items of income, gain, loss and deduction
(computed in accordance with



Section 5.5(b)) for each taxable period shall be allocated among the Partners
as provided herein, including, but not limited to, the limitations provided in
Section 6.1(e).

(a) Net Income. After giving effect to the special allocations set forth in
Section 6.1(d), Net Income for each taxable period and all items of income,
gain, loss and deduction taken into account in computing Net Income for such
taxable period shall be allocated as follows:

(i) First, to the General Partner until the aggregate of the Net Income
allocated to the General Partner pursuant to this Section 6.1(a)(i) and the
Net Termination Gain allocated to the General Partner pursuant to Section
6.1(c)(i)(A) for the current and all previous taxable periods is equal to the
aggregate of the Net Loss allocated to the General Partner pursuant to Section
6.1(b)(iv) for all previous taxable periods and the Net Termination Loss
allocated to the General Partner pursuant to Section 6.1(c)(ii)(D) for the
current and all previous taxable periods; and

(ii) The balance, if any, (A) to the General Partner in accordance with its
Percentage Interest, and (B) to all Unitholders (other than the Series A

taxable period shall be allocated as follows:

(i) First, to the General Partner and the Unitholders (other than the Series A
Preferred Unitholders), Pro Rata; provided, however, that Net Losses shall not
be allocated pursuant to this Section 6.1(b)(i) to the extent that such
allocation would cause any Unitholder to have a deficit balance in its
Adjusted Capital Account at the end of such taxable period (or increase any
existing deficit balance in its Adjusted Capital Account);

(ii) Second, to the General Partner and the Unitholders (other than the Series
A Preferred Unitholders) to the extent of and in proportion to the positive
balances in their Adjusted Capital Accounts;

(iii) Third, to the Series A Preferred Unitholders, to the extent of and in
proportion to the positive balances in their Adjusted Capital Accounts; and

(iv) The balance, if any, 100% to the General Partner.

allocations set forth in Section 6.1(d), Net Termination Gain or Net
Termination Loss (including a pro rata part of each item of income, gain, loss
and deduction taken into account in computing Net Termination Gain or Net
Termination Loss) for such taxable period shall be allocated in the manner set
forth in this Section 6.1(c). All allocations under this Section 6.1(c) shall
be made after Capital Account balances have been adjusted by all other
allocations provided under this Section 6.1 and after all distributions of
Available Cash provided under Section 6.4 and



Section 6.5 have been made; provided, however, that solely for purposes of
this Section 6.1(c), Capital Accounts shall not be adjusted for distributions
made pursuant to Section 12.4.

(i) Net Termination Gain (including a pro rata part of each item of income,
gain, loss, and deduction taken into account in computing Net Termination
Gain) shall be allocated:

(A) First, to the General Partner until the aggregate of the Net Termination
Gain allocated to the General Partner pursuant to this Section 6.1(c)(i)(A)
and the Net Income allocated to the General Partner pursuant to Section
6.1(a)(i) for the current and all previous taxable periods is equal to the
aggregate of the Net Loss allocated to the General Partner pursuant to Section
6.1(b)(iv) for all previous taxable periods and the Net Termination Loss
allocated to the General Partner pursuant to Section 6.1(c)(ii)(D) for all
previous taxable periods;

(B) Second, to the Series A Preferred Unitholders, Pro Rata, until the Capital
Account in respect of each Series A Preferred Unit is equal to the Series A
Issue Price;

(C) Third, (x) to the General Partner in accordance with its Percentage
Interest and (y) to all Unitholders (other than the Series A Preferred
Unitholders), Pro Rata, a percentage equal to 100% less the General Partner's
Percentage Interest, until the Capital Account in respect of each Common Unit
then Outstanding is equal to the sum of (1) its Unrecovered Initial Unit Price
and (2) the Minimum Quarterly Distribution for the Quarter during which the
Liquidation Date occurs, reduced by any distribution pursuant to Section
6.4(a)(i) with respect to such Common Unit for such Quarter (the amount
determined pursuant to this clause (2) is hereinafter referred to as the
"Unpaid MQD");

(D) Fourth, 100% to the General Partner and all Unitholders (other than the
Series A Preferred Unitholders), Pro Rata, until the Capital Account in
respect of each Common Unit then Outstanding is equal to the sum of (1) its
Unrecovered Initial Unit Price, (2) the Unpaid MQD, and (3) the excess of (aa)
the First Target Distribution less the Minimum Quarterly Distribution for each
Quarter of the Partnership's existence over (bb) the cumulative per Unit
amount of any distributions of Available Cash that is deemed to be Operating
Surplus made pursuant to Section 6.4(a)(ii) (the sum of subclauses (1),
(2),and (3) is hereinafter referred to as the "First Liquidation Target
Amount");

(E) Fifth, (x) to the General Partner in accordance with its Percentage
Interest, (y) 13% to the holders of the Incentive Distribution Rights, Pro
Rata, and (z) to all Unitholders (other than the Series A Preferred
Unitholders), Pro Rata, a percentage equal to 100% less the sum of the
percentages applicable to subclauses (x) and (y) of this clause (E), until the
Capital Account in respect of each Common Unit then Outstanding is equal to
the sum of (1) the First Liquidation Target Amount, and (2) the excess of (aa)
the Second Target Distribution less the First Target Distribution for each
Quarter of the Partnership's existence over (bb) the cumulative per Unit
amount of any distributions of Available Cash that is deemed to be



Operating Surplus made pursuant to Section 6.4(a)(iii) (the sum of subclauses
(1) and (2) is hereinafter referred to as the "Second Liquidation Target
Amount");

(F) Sixth, (x) to the General Partner in accordance with its Percentage
Interest, (y) 23% to the holders of the Incentive Distribution Rights, Pro
Rata, and (z) to all Unitholders (other than the Series A Preferred
Unitholders), Pro Rata, a percentage equal to 100% less the sum of the
percentages applicable to subclauses (x) and (y) of this clause (F), until the
Capital Account in respect of each Common Unit then Outstanding is equal to
the sum of (1) the Second Liquidation Target Amount, and (2) the excess of
(aa) the Third Target Distribution less the Second Target Distribution for
each Quarter of the Partnership's existence over (bb) the cumulative per Unit
amount of any distributions of Available Cash that is deemed to be Operating
Surplus made pursuant to Section 6.4(a)(iv); and

(G) Finally, (x) to the General Partner in accordance with its Percentage
Interest, (y) 48% to the holders of the Incentive Distribution Rights, Pro
Rata, and (z) to all Unitholders (other than the Series A Preferred
Unitholders), Pro Rata, a percentage equal to 100% less the sum of the
percentages applicable to subclauses (x) and (y) of this clause (G).

For purposes of subsections (D) through (F) of this Section 6.1(c)(i),
distributions to the Common Units pursuant to the referenced subsections of
Section 6.4(a) shall be deemed to include any distributions in respect of
Common Units and Subordinated Units made pursuant to the corresponding
provisions of this Agreement that were operative prior to the conversion of
the Subordinated Units.

(ii) Net Termination Loss (including a pro rata part of each item of income,
gain, loss, and deduction taken into account in computing Net Termination
Loss) shall be allocated:

(A) First, (x) to the General Partner in accordance with its Percentage
Interest and (y) to all Unitholders (other than the Series A Preferred
Unitholders), Pro Rata, a percentage equal to 100% less the General Partner's
Percentage Interest, until the Capital Account in respect of each Unit then
Outstanding has been reduced to zero;

(B) Second, to the General Partner and the Unitholders (other than the Series
A Preferred Unitholders), to the extent of and in proportion to the positive
balances in their Adjusted Capital Accounts;

(C) Third, to all Series A Preferred Unitholders, Pro Rata, until the Capital
Account in respect of each Series A Preferred Unit then Outstanding has been
reduced to zero; and

(D) Fourth, the balance, if any, 100% to the General Partner.

(iii) For the avoidance of doubt and consistent with Section 6.1(e), if on the
Liquidation Date the Partnership owns any shares of MarkWest Hydrocarbon, Inc.
or there are any Hydrocarbon Items for the period ending on the Liquidation
Date, the allocations required under Section 6.1(c) will (i) first be
performed with respect to any gain or loss of the



Partnership that is not attributable to Hydrocarbon Items, and (ii) then
performed a second time with respect to any remaining Net Termination Gains or
Net Termination Losses.

(iv) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, no amounts of income, gain,
loss, expense or deduction shall be allocated to any Class B Units pursuant to
Sections 6.1(c)(i) prior to the conversion of such Class B Units into Common
Units, although amounts may be allocated to such units under Section
6.1(d)(x).

(d) Special Allocations. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section
6.1, the following special allocations shall be made for such taxable period:

(i) Partnership Minimum Gain Chargeback. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Section 6.1, if there is a net decrease in Partnership Minimum Gain
during any Partnership taxable period, each Partner shall be allocated items
of Partnership income and gain for such period (and, if necessary, subsequent
periods) in the manner and amounts provided in Treasury Regulation Sections
1.704-2(f)(6), 1.704-2(g)(2) and 1.704-2(j)(2)(i), or any successor provision.
For purposes of this Section 6.1(d), each Partner's Adjusted Capital Account
balance shall be determined, and the allocation of income or gain required
hereunder shall be effected, prior to the application of any other allocations
pursuant to this Section 6.1(d) with respect to such taxable period (other
than an allocation pursuant to Section 6.1(d)(vi) and Section 6.1(d)(vii)).
This Section 6.1(d)(i) is intended to comply with the Partnership Minimum Gain
chargeback requirement in Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(f) and shall be
interpreted consistently therewith.

(ii) Chargeback of Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain. Notwithstanding the
other provisions of this Section 6.1 (other than Section 6.1(d)(i)), except as
provided in Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(i)(4), if there is a net
decrease in Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain during any Partnership
taxable period, any Partner with a share of Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum
Gain at the beginning of such taxable period shall be allocated items of
Partnership income and gain for such period (and, if necessary, subsequent
periods) in the manner and amounts provided in Treasury Regulation Sections
1.704-2(i)(4) and 1.704-2(j)(2)(ii), or any successor provisions. For purposes
of this Section 6.1(d), each Partner's Adjusted Capital Account balance shall
be determined, and the allocation of income or gain required hereunder shall
be effected, prior to the application of any other allocations pursuant to
this Section 6.1(d) and other than an allocation pursuant to Section
6.1(d)(i), Section 6.1(d)(vi) and Section 6.1(d)(vii) with respect to such
taxable period. This Section 6.1(d)(ii) is intended to comply with the
chargeback of items of income and gain requirement in Treasury Regulation
Section 1.704-2(i)(4) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.

(iii) Priority Allocations.

(A) If the amount of cash or the Net Agreed Value of any property distributed
(except cash or property distributed pursuant to Section 12.4 or with respect
to Series A Preferred Units) with respect to a Unit exceeds the amount of cash
or the Net Agreed Value of property distributed with respect to another Unit
(the amount of the excess, an "Excess Distribution" and the Unit with respect
to which the greater distribution is paid, an "Excess



Distribution Unit"), then (1) there shall be allocated gross income and gain
to each Unitholder receiving an Excess Distribution with respect to the Excess
Distribution Unit until the aggregate amount of such items allocated with
respect to such Excess Distribution Unit pursuant to this Section
6.1(d)(iii)(A) for the current taxable period and all previous taxable periods
is equal to the amount of the Excess Distribution; and (2) the General Partner
shall be allocated gross income and gain with respect to each such Excess
Distribution in an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying (aa)
the quotient determined by dividing (x) the General Partner's Percentage
Interest at the time when the Excess Distribution occurs by (y) a percentage
equal to 100% less the General Partner's Percentage Interest at the time when
the Excess Distribution occurs, times (bb) the total amount allocated in
clause (1) above with respect to such Excess Distribution.

(B) After the application of Section 6.1(d)(iii)(A) and Section 6.1(d)(xi)(A)
and (B), if the amount of cash or the Net Agreed Value of any property
distributed (except cash or property distributed pursuant to Section 12.4) to
any Common Unitholder or Class A Unitholder with respect to its Units for a
taxable year is greater (on a per Unit basis) than the amount of cash or the
Net Agreed Value of property distributed to the Class B Unitholders with
respect to their Class B Units (on a per Unit basis), then gross income in an
amount equal to the product of 60%, multiplied by the aggregate amount of such
distribution shall be allocated to the holders of Common Units and Class A
Units, Pro Rata.

(C) After the application of Section 6.1(d)(iii)(A) and (B), all or any
portion of the remaining items of Partnership gross income or gain for the
taxable period, if any, shall be allocated (1) to the holders of Incentive
Distribution Rights, Pro Rata, until the aggregate amount of such items
allocated to the holders of Incentive Distribution Rights pursuant to this
Section 6.1(d)(iii)(B) for the current taxable period and all previous taxable
periods is equal to the cumulative amount of all Incentive Distributions made
to the holders of Incentive Distribution Rights from the Closing Date to a
date 60 days after the end of the current taxable period; and (2) to the
General Partner an amount equal to the product of (aa) an amount equal to the
quotient determined by dividing (x) the General Partner's Percentage Interest
by (y) the sum of 100 less the General Partner's Percentage Interest times
(bb) the sum of the amounts allocated in clause (1) above.

(iv) Qualified Income Offset. In the event any Partner unexpectedly receives
any adjustments, allocations or distributions described in Treasury Regulation
Sections 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(5), or
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(6), items of Partnership gross income and gain shall be
specially allocated to such Partner in an amount and manner sufficient to
eliminate, to the extent required by the Treasury Regulations promulgated
under Section 704(b) of the Code, the deficit balance, if any, in its Adjusted
Capital Account created by such adjustments, allocations or distributions as
quickly as possible; provided, however, that an allocation pursuant to this
Section 6.1(d)(iv) shall be made only if and to the extent that such Partner
would have a deficit balance in its Adjusted Capital Account as adjusted after
all other allocations provided for in this Section 6.1 have been tentatively
made as if this Section 6.1(d)(iv) were not in this Agreement.



(v) Gross Income Allocation. In the event any Partner has a deficit balance in
its Capital Account at the end of any taxable period in excess of the sum of
(A) the amount such Partner is required to restore pursuant to the provisions
of this Agreement and (B) the amount such Partner is deemed obligated to
restore pursuant to Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704-2(g) and 1.704-2(i)(5),
such Partner shall be specially allocated items of Partnership gross income
and gain in the amount of such excess as quickly as possible; provided,
however, that an allocation pursuant to this Section 6.1(d)(v) shall be made
only if and to the extent that such Partner would have a deficit balance in
its Capital Account as adjusted after all other allocations provided for in
this Section 6.1 have been tentatively made as if Section 6.1(d)(iv) and this
Section 6.1(d)(v) were not in this Agreement.

(vi) Nonrecourse Deductions. Nonrecourse Deductions for any taxable period
shall be allocated to the Partners Pro Rata. If the General Partner determines
that the Partnership's Nonrecourse Deductions should be allocated in a
different ratio to satisfy the safe harbor requirements of the Treasury
Regulations promulgated under Section 704(b) of the Code, the General Partner
is authorized, upon notice to the other Partners, to revise the prescribed
ratio to the numerically closest ratio that does satisfy such requirements.

(vii) Partner Nonrecourse Deductions. Partner Nonrecourse Deductions for any
taxable period shall be allocated 100% to the Partner that bears the Economic
Risk of Loss with respect to the Partner Nonrecourse Debt to which such
Partner Nonrecourse Deductions are attributable in accordance with Treasury
Regulation Section 1.704-2(i). If more than one Partner bears the Economic
Risk of Loss with respect to a Partner Nonrecourse Debt, the Partner
Nonrecourse Deductions attributable thereto shall be allocated between or
among such Partners in accordance with the ratios in which they share such
Economic Risk of Loss.

(viii) Nonrecourse Liabilities. For purposes of Treasury Regulation Section
1.752-3(a)(3), the Partners agree that Nonrecourse Liabilities of the
Partnership in excess of the sum of (A) the amount of Partnership Minimum Gain
and (B) the total amount of Nonrecourse Built-in Gain shall be allocated among
the Partners Pro Rata.

(ix) Code Section 754 Adjustments. To the extent an adjustment to the adjusted
tax basis of any Partnership asset pursuant to Section 734(b) or 743(b) of the
Code is required, pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), to be taken into account in determining Capital
Accounts, the amount of such adjustment to the Capital Accounts shall be
treated as an item of gain (if the adjustment increases the basis of the
asset) or loss (if the adjustment decreases such basis), and such item of gain
or loss shall be specially allocated to the Partners in a manner consistent
with the manner in which their Capital Accounts are required to be adjusted
pursuant to such Section of the Treasury Regulations.

(x) Economic Uniformity; Changes in Law.

(A) Reserved.

(B) With respect to an event triggering an adjustment to the Carrying Value of
Partnership property pursuant to Section 5.5(d) during any taxable period of



the Partnership ending upon, or after, the issuance of Affiliate Retained
Units pursuant to Section 5.11, any Unrealized Gains and Unrealized Losses
shall be allocated among the Partners in a manner that to the nearest extent
possible results in the Capital Accounts maintained with respect to such
Affiliate Retained Units issued pursuant to Section 5.11 equaling the product
of (1) the Aggregate Quantity of Affiliate Retained Units and (2) the Per Unit
Capital Amount for an Initial Common Unit.

(C) With respect to any taxable period during which an Affiliate Retained Unit
is transferred to any Person who is not an Affiliate of the transferor, all or
a portion of the remaining items of Partnership gross income or gain for such
taxable period shall be allocated 100% to the transferor Partner of such
transferred Affiliate Retained Unit until such transferor Partner has been
allocated an amount of gross income or gain that increases the Capital Account
maintained with respect to such transferred Affiliate Retained Unit to an
amount equal to the Per Unit Capital Amount for an Initial Common Unit.

(D) For the proper administration of the Partnership and for the preservation
of uniformity of the Limited Partner Interests (or any class or classes
thereof), the General Partner shall (1) adopt such conventions as it deems
appropriate in determining the amount of depreciation, amortization and cost
recovery deductions; (2) make special allocations of income, gain, loss,
deduction, Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss; and (3) amend the provisions of
this Agreement as appropriate (x) to reflect the proposal or promulgation of
Treasury Regulations under Section 704(b) or Section 704(c) of the Code or (y)
otherwise to preserve or achieve uniformity of the Limited Partner Interests
(or any class or classes thereof). The General Partner may adopt such
conventions, make such allocations and make such amendments to this Agreement
as provided in this Section 6.1(d)(x)(D) only if such conventions, allocations
or amendments would not have a material adverse effect on the Partners, the
holders of any class or classes of Limited Partner Interests issued and
Outstanding or the Partnership, and if such allocations are consistent with
the principles of Section 704 of the Code.

(E) Except as addressed by Section 6.1(d)(x)(H), with respect to an event
triggering an adjustment to the Carrying Value of Partnership property
pursuant to Section 5.5(d) when a disparity exists between the Per Unit
Capital Amounts of the Initial Common Units and the Converted Common Units,
any Unrealized Gains and Unrealized Losses shall be allocated among (x) the
General Partner, in accordance with its Percentage Interest, and the holders
of Common Units other than the Converted Common Units and holders of Class A
Units, Pro Rata, a percentage equal to 100% less the General Partner's
Percentage Interest, and (y) the General Partner, in accordance with its
Percentage Interest, and the holders of Converted Common Units a percentage
equal to 100% less the General Partner's Percentage Interest, in a manner that
to the nearest extent possible results in the elimination of such disparity
between the Per Unit Capital Amounts of the Initial Common Units and the
Converted Common Units.

(F) With respect to an event triggering an adjustment to the Carrying Value of
Partnership property pursuant to Section 5.5(d) when a disparity exists
between the Per Unit Capital Amounts of a Class B Unit and the Class B Target
Capital Amount at such time, any Unrealized Gains and Unrealized Losses shall
be allocated among (x) the General Partner, in accordance with its Percentage
Interest, and the holders of Common Units



and holders of Class A Units, Pro Rata, a percentage equal to 100% less the
General Partner's Percentage Interest, and (y) the General Partner, in
accordance with its Percentage Interest, and the holders of Class B Units, a
percentage equal to 100% less the General Partner's Percentage Interest, in a
manner that to the nearest extent possible results in the elimination of such
disparity between the Per Unit Capital Amounts of a Class B Unit and the Class
B Target Capital Amount.

(G) At the election of the General Partner, with respect to any taxable
period, subject to the priorities established herein for the Series A
Preferred Units (including pursuant to Section 6.1(d)(xi)) all or a portion of
the remaining items of Partnership gross income, gain, loss or deduction for
such taxable period shall be allocated to each Partner holding Converted
Common Units in the proportion of the number of Converted Common Units held by
such Partner to the total number of Converted Common Units then Outstanding,
until each such Partner has been allocated an amount of gross income or gain
that increases the Capital Account maintained with respect to such Converted
Common Units to an amount equal to the product of (A) the number of Converted
Common Units held by such Partner and (B) the Per Unit Capital Amount of an
Initial Common Unit. The purpose of this allocation is to establish uniformity
between the Capital Accounts underlying Converted Common Units and those
Capital Accounts underlying other Common Units immediately prior to the
transfer or other disposition of a Converted Common Unit. This allocation
method for establishing such economic uniformity will only be available to the
General Partner if the method for allocating the Capital Account maintained
with respect to the holder of Converted Common Units between the transferred
and retained Converted Common Units pursuant to Section 5.5(c)(iv) does not
otherwise provide such economic uniformity to the transferred Converted Common
Units.

(H) After the conversion of any Class B Units based upon the Discounted
Conversion Number, all or a portion of the remaining items of Net Termination
Loss, Net Loss, and if necessary gross loss and deduction, for the taxable
period in which such conversion occurs shall be allocated 100% to Partners
holding the Converted Common Units (which were converted based upon such
Discounted Conversion Number) in the proportion of the number of such
Converted Common Units held by such Partners, until each such Partner has been
allocated the minimum amount necessary to reduce the Capital Account of each
such Converted Common Unit to the Per Unit Capital Amount of an Initial Common
Unit; provided that, to the extent possible, a portion of such allocation
shall consist of gross operating loss equal to the lesser of (x) the aggregate
amount of the incremental Section 704(c) income allocations allocated to the
Class B Units converted based upon the Discounted Conversion Number for the
current and prior taxable periods relating to the built-in gain value
discrepancy between the Discounted Conversion Number and the Adjusted Class B
Conversion Number with respect to the Class B Units converted based upon the
Discounted Conversion Number and (y) the aggregate amount of taxable income
that has been allocated the Class B Units converted based upon the Discounted
Conversion Number for the current and prior taxable periods.

(I) The provisions of this Section 6.1(d)(x) shall also be subject to the
limitations and requirements of Section 6.10, as applicable.

(xi) Allocations with Respect to Series A Preferred Units.



(A) Items of Partnership gross income shall be allocated to the Series A
Preferred Unitholders, Pro Rata, until the aggregate amount of gross income
allocated to each Series A Preferred Unitholder pursuant hereto for the
current taxable period and all previous taxable periods is equal to the
cumulative amount of all cash distributions made with respect to such Series A
Preferred Unit pursuant to Section 5.14(b)(i) from the date such Series A
Preferred Unit was issued to a date 60 days after the end of the current
taxable year.

(B) Items of Partnership gross income shall be allocated to the Series A
Preferred Unitholders, Pro Rata, until the aggregate amount of gross income
allocated to each Series A Preferred Unitholder pursuant hereto for the
current taxable period and all previous taxable periods is equal to the
cumulative amount of all Net Losses allocated to such Series A Preferred
Unitholder pursuant to Section 6.1(b)(iii) for all previous taxable years.

(C) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 6.1 (other than the
Required Allocations), if (A) the Liquidation Date occurs prior to the
conversion of the last Outstanding Series A Preferred Unit and (B) after
having made all other allocations provided for in this Section 6.1 for the
taxable period in which the Liquidation Date occurs, the Per Unit Capital
Amount of each Series A Preferred Unit would not equal or exceed the Series A
Liquidation Value, then items of income, gain, loss and deduction for such
taxable period shall instead be allocated among the Partners in a manner
determined appropriate by the General Partner so as to cause, to the maximum
extent possible, the Per Unit Capital Amount in respect of each Series A
Preferred Unit to equal the Series A Liquidation Value (and no other
allocation pursuant to this Agreement shall reverse the effect of such
allocation). For the avoidance of doubt, the reallocation of items set forth
in the immediately preceding sentence provides that, to the extent necessary
to achieve the Per Unit Capital Amount balances described above, items of
income and gain that would otherwise be included in Net Income or Net Loss, as
the case may be, for the taxable period in which the Liquidation Date occurs,
shall be reallocated from the Unitholders holding Units other than Series A
Preferred Units to Unitholders holding Series A Preferred Units. In the event
that (i) the Liquidation Date occurs on or before the date (not including any
extension of time) prescribed by law for the filing of the Partnership's
federal income tax return for the taxable period immediately prior to the
taxable period in which the Liquidation Date occurs and (ii) the reallocation
of items for the taxable period in which the Liquidation Date occurs as set
forth above in this Section 6.1(d)(xi)(C) fails to achieve the Per Unit
Capital Amounts described above, then items of income, gain, loss and
deduction for such prior taxable period shall be reallocated among all
Partners in a manner that will, to the maximum extent possible and after
taking into account all other allocations made pursuant to this Section
6.1(d)(xi)(C), cause the Per Unit Capital Amount in respect of each Series A
Preferred Unit to equal the Series A Liquidation Value.

(xii) Curative Allocation.

(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 6.1, other than the
Required Allocations, the Required Allocations shall be taken into account in
making the Agreed Allocations so that, to the extent possible, the net amount
of items of gross income, gain, loss and deduction allocated to each Partner
pursuant to the Required Allocations and the Agreed Allocations, together,
shall be equal to the net amount of such items that would



have been allocated to each such Partner under the Agreed Allocations had the
Required Allocations and the related Curative Allocation not otherwise been
provided in this Section 6.1. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, Required
Allocations relating to (1) Nonrecourse Deductions shall not be taken into
account except to the extent that there has been a decrease in Partnership
Minimum Gain and (2) Partner Nonrecourse Deductions shall not be taken into
account except to the extent that there has been a decrease in Partner
Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain. In exercising its discretion under this Section
6.1(d)(xii)(A), the General Partner may take into account future Required
Allocations that, although not yet made, are likely to offset other Required
Allocations previously made. Allocations pursuant to this Section
6.1(d)(xii)(A) shall only be made with respect to Required Allocations to the
extent the General Partner determines that such allocations will otherwise be
inconsistent with the economic agreement among the Partners. Further,
allocations pursuant to this Section 6.1(d)(xii)(A) shall be deferred with
respect to allocations pursuant to clauses (1) and (2) hereof to the extent
the General Partner determines that such allocations are likely to be offset
by subsequent Required Allocations.

(B) The General Partner shall, with respect to each taxable period, (1) apply
the provisions of Section 6.1(d)(xii)(A) in whatever order is most likely to
minimize the economic distortions that might otherwise result from the
Required Allocations, and (2) divide all allocations pursuant to Section
6.1(d)(xii)(A) among the Partners in a manner that is likely to minimize such
economic distortions.

(xiii) Corrective and Other Allocations. In the event of any allocation of
Additional Book Basis Derivative Items or any Book-Down Event or any
recognition of a Net Termination Loss, the following rules shall apply:

(A) Except as provided in Section 6.1(d)(xiii)(B), in the case of any
allocation of Additional Book Basis Derivative Items (other than an allocation
of Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss under Section 5.5(d) hereof), the
General Partner shall allocate such Additional Book Basis Derivative Items to
(1) the holders of Incentive Distribution Rights and the General Partner to
the same extent that the Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss giving rise to
such Additional Book Basis Derivative Items was allocated to them pursuant to
Section 5.5(d) and (2) all Unitholders, Pro Rata, to the extent that the
Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss giving rise to such Additional Book Basis
Derivative Items was allocated to any Unitholders pursuant to Section 5.5(d).

(B) In the case of any allocation of Additional Book Basis Derivative Items
(other than an allocation of Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss under Section
5.5(d) hereof or an allocation of Net Termination Gain or Net Termination Loss
pursuant to Section 6.1(c) hereof) as a result of a sale or other taxable
disposition of any Partnership asset that is an Adjusted Property ("Disposed
of Adjusted Property"), the General Partner shall allocate (1) additional
items of gross income and gain (aa) away from the holders of Incentive
Distribution Rights and (bb) to the Unitholders, or (2) additional items of
deduction and loss (aa) away from the Unitholders and (bb) to the holders of
Incentive Distribution Rights, to the extent that the Additional Book Basis
Derivative Items allocated to the Unitholders exceed their Share of Additional
Book Basis Derivative Items with respect to such Disposed of Adjusted
Property.



Any allocation made pursuant to this Section 6.1(d)(xiii)(B) shall be made
after all of the other Agreed Allocations have been made as if this Section
6.1(d)(xiii) were not in this Agreement and, to the extent necessary, shall
require the reallocation of items that have been allocated pursuant to such
other Agreed Allocations.

(C) In the case of any negative adjustments to the Capital Accounts of the
Partners resulting from a Book-Down Event or from the recognition of a Net
Termination Loss, such negative adjustment (1) shall first be allocated, to
the extent of the Aggregate Remaining Net Positive Adjustments, in such a
manner, as determined by the General Partner, that to the extent possible the
aggregate Capital Accounts of the Partners will equal the amount that would
have been the Capital Account balances of the Partners if no prior Book-Up
Events had occurred, and (2) any negative adjustment in excess of the
Aggregate Remaining Net Positive Adjustments shall be allocated pursuant to
Section 6.1(c) hereof.

(D) For purposes of this Section 6.1(d)(xiii), the Unitholders shall be
treated as being allocated Additional Book Basis Derivative Items to the
extent that such Additional Book Basis Derivative Items have reduced the
amount of income that would otherwise have been allocated to the Unitholders
under this Agreement. In making the allocations required under this Section
6.1(d)(xiii), the General Partner may apply whatever conventions or other
methodology it determines will satisfy the purpose of this Section
6.1(d)(xiii). Without limiting the foregoing, if an Adjusted Property is
contributed by the Partnership to another entity classified as a partnership
for federal income tax purposes (the "lower tier partnership"), the General
Partner may make allocations similar to those described in Sections
6.1(d)(xiii)(A) through (C) to the extent the General Partner determines such
allocations are necessary to account for the Partnership's allocable share of
income, gain, loss and deduction of the lower tier partnership that relate to
the contributed Adjusted Property in a manner that is consistent with the
purpose of this Section 6.1(d)(xiii).

(e) Allocations to Class A Units. For purposes of this Agreement, including,
but not limited to, the allocations under this Article VI, for each taxable
period, all Hydrocarbon Items shall be allocated solely to the Unitholders
other than the holders of Class A Units pursuant to this Agreement as if the
Class A Units were not treated as Units or Common Units.

Section 6.2 Allocations for Tax Purposes.

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, for federal income tax purposes, each
item of income, gain, loss and deduction shall be allocated among the Partners
in the same manner as its correlative item of "book" income, gain, loss or
deduction is allocated pursuant to Section 6.1.

(b) In an attempt to eliminate Book-Tax Disparities attributable to a
Contributed Property or Adjusted Property, items of income, gain, loss,
depreciation, amortization and cost recovery deductions shall be allocated for
federal income tax purposes among the Partners in the manner provided under
Section 704(c) of the Code, and the Treasury Regulations promulgated under
Section 704(b) and 704(c) of the Code, as determined to be appropriate by the
General Partner (taking into account the General Partner's discretion under



Section 6.1(d)(x)(D)); provided, however, that the General Partner shall apply
the principles of Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-3(d) in all events.

(c) The General Partner may determine to depreciate or amortize the portion of
an adjustment under Section 743(b) of the Code attributable to unrealized
appreciation in any Adjusted Property (to the extent of the unamortized Book-
Tax Disparity) using a predetermined rate derived from the depreciation or
amortization method and useful life applied to the unamortized Book-Tax
Disparity of such property, despite any inconsistency of such approach with
Treasury Regulation Section 1.167(c)-l(a)(6) or any successor regulations
thereto. If the General Partner determines that such reporting position cannot
reasonably be taken, the General Partner may adopt depreciation and
amortization conventions under which all purchasers acquiring Limited Partner
Interests in the same month would receive depreciation and amortization
deductions, based upon the same applicable rate as if they had purchased a
direct interest in the Partnership's property. If the General Partner chooses
not to utilize such aggregate method, the General Partner may use any other
depreciation and amortization conventions to preserve the uniformity of the
intrinsic tax characteristics of any Limited Partner Interests, so long as
such conventions would not have a material adverse effect on the Limited
Partners or the Record Holders of any class or classes of Limited Partner
Interests.

(d) In accordance with Treasury Regulation Sections 1.1245-1(e) and
1.1250-1(f), any gain allocated to the Partners upon the sale or other taxable
disposition of any Partnership asset shall, to the extent possible, after
taking into account other required allocations of gain pursuant to this
Section 6.2, be characterized as Recapture Income in the same proportions and
to the same extent as such Partners (or their predecessors in interest) have
been allocated any deductions directly or indirectly giving rise to the
treatment of such gains as Recapture Income.

(e) All items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit recognized by the
Partnership for federal income tax purposes and allocated to the Partners in
accordance with the provisions hereof shall be determined without regard to
any election under Section 754 of the Code that may be made by the
Partnership; provided, however, that such allocations, once made, shall be
adjusted (in the manner determined by the General Partner) to take into
account those adjustments permitted or required by Sections 734 and 743 of the
Code.

(f) Each item of Partnership income, gain, loss and deduction, for federal
income tax purposes, shall be determined for each taxable period and prorated
on a monthly basis and shall be allocated to the Partners as of the opening of
the National Securities Exchange on which the Partnership Interests are listed
or admitted to trading on the first Business Day of each month; provided,
however, that such items for the period beginning on the Closing Date and
ending on the last day of the month in which the last Option Closing Date or
the expiration of the Over-Allotment Option occurs shall be allocated to the
Partners as of the opening of the National Securities Exchange on which the
Partnership Interests are listed or admitted to trading on the first Business
Day of the next succeeding month; provided further, that gain or loss on a
sale or other disposition of any assets of the Partnership or any other
extraordinary item of income or loss realized and recognized other than in the
ordinary course of business, as determined by the General Partner, shall be
allocated to the Partners as of the opening of the National Securities



Exchange on which the Partnership Interests are listed or admitted to trading
on the first Business Day of the month in which such gain or loss is
recognized for federal income tax purposes. The General Partner may revise,
alter or otherwise modify such methods of allocation to the extent permitted
or required by Section 706 of the Code and the regulations or rulings
promulgated thereunder.

(g) Allocations that would otherwise be made to a Limited Partner under the
provisions of this Article VI shall instead be made to the beneficial owner of
Limited Partner Interests held by a nominee, agent or representative in any
case in which such nominee, agent or representative has furnished the identity
of such owner to the Partnership in accordance with Section 6031(c) of the
Code or any other method determined by the General Partner.

(h) If, as a result of the conversion of a Series A Preferred Unit into Common
Units and the adjustments pursuant to Section 5.5(d)(iii), a Capital Account
reallocation is required consistent with the principles of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(s)(3), the General Partner shall make corrective
allocations pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(4)(x).

Section 6.3 Requirement and Characterization of Distributions; Distributions
to Record Holders.

(a) Subject to Section 5.14(b)(i), within 60 days following the end of each
Quarter commencing with the Quarter ending on December 31, 2012, an amount
equal to 100% of Available Cash with respect to such Quarter shall be
distributed in accordance with this Article VI, by the Partnership to the
Partners as of the Record Date selected by the General Partner. The Record
Date for the first distribution of Available Cash shall not be prior to the
final closing of the Over-Allotment Option. All amounts of Available Cash
distributed by the Partnership on any date from any source shall be deemed to
be Operating Surplus until the sum of all amounts of Available Cash
theretofore distributed by the Partnership to the Partners pursuant to Section
6.4 equals the Operating Surplus from the Closing Date through the close of
the immediately preceding Quarter. Any remaining amounts of Available Cash
distributed by the Partnership on such date shall, except as otherwise
provided in Section 6.5, be deemed to be "Capital Surplus." All distributions
required to be made under this Agreement shall be made subject to Sections
17-607 and 17-804 of the Delaware Act and other applicable law,
notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding Section 6.3(a) (but subject to the last sentence of
Section 6.3(a)), in the event of the dissolution and liquidation of the
Partnership, all cash received during or after the Quarter in which the
Liquidation Date occurs shall be applied and distributed solely in accordance
with, and subject to the terms and conditions of, Section 12.4.

(c) Each distribution in respect of a Partnership Interest shall be paid by
the Partnership, directly or through the Transfer Agent or through any other
Person or agent, only to the Record Holder of such Partnership Interest as of
the Record Date set for such distribution. Such payment shall constitute full
payment and satisfaction of the Partnership's liability in



respect of such payment, regardless of any claim of any Person who may have an
interest in such payment by reason of an assignment or otherwise.

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, a Class A Unit shall not be entitled to receive any
distributions pursuant to this Agreement to the extent such distributions are
attributable to Hydrocarbon Available Cash.

Section 6.4 Distributions of Available Cash from Operating Surplus.

(a) Available Cash with respect to any Quarter that is deemed to be Operating
Surplus pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.3 or Section 6.5 shall be
distributed as follows, except as otherwise required by Section 5.14(b)(i) or
in respect of additional Partnership Interests issued pursuant to Section
5.6(b):

(i) First, (A) to the General Partner in accordance with its Percentage
Interest and (B) to the holders of Common Units and Class A Units Pro Rata
(except that the holders of Class A Units will not be entitled to receive any
Hydrocarbon Available Cash), a percentage equal to 100% less the General
Partner's Percentage Interest in subclause (A), until there has been
distributed in respect of each Common Unit then Outstanding an amount equal to
the Minimum Quarterly Distribution for such Quarter;

(ii) Second, (A) to the General Partner in accordance with its Percentage
Interest and (B) to the holders of Common Units and Class A Units, Pro Rata
(except that the holders of Class A Units will not be entitled to receive any
Hydrocarbon Available Cash), a percentage equal to 100% less the General
Partner's Percentage Interest in subclause (A), until there has been
distributed in respect of each Common Unit then Outstanding an amount equal to
the excess of the First Target Distribution over the Minimum Quarterly
Distribution for such Quarter;

(iii) Third, (A) to the General Partner in accordance with its Percentage
Interest, (B) 13% to the holders of the Incentive Distribution Rights, Pro
Rata, and (C) to the holders of Common Units and Class A Units, Pro Rata
(except that the holders of Class A Units will not be entitled to receive any
Hydrocarbon Available Cash), a percentage equal to 100% less the sum of the
percentages applicable to subclauses (A) and (B) of this clause (iii), until
there has been distributed in respect of each Common Unit then Outstanding an
amount equal to the excess of the Second Target Distribution over the First
Target Distribution for such Quarter;

(iv) Fourth, (A) to the General Partner in accordance with its Percentage
Interest, (B) 23% to the holders of the Incentive Distribution Rights, Pro
Rata, and (C) to the holders of Common Units and Class A Units, Pro Rata
(except that the holders of Class A Units will not be entitled to receive any
Hydrocarbon Available Cash), a percentage equal to 100% less the sum of the
percentages applicable to subclauses (A) and (B) of this clause (iv), until
there has been distributed in respect of each Common Unit then Outstanding an
amount equal to the excess of the Third Target Distribution over the Second
Target Distribution for such Quarter; and



(v) Thereafter, (A) to the General Partner in accordance with its Percentage
Interest, (B) 48% to the holders of the Incentive Distribution Rights, Pro
Rata, and (C) to holders of Common Units and Class A Units, Pro Rata (except
that the holders of Class A Units will not be entitled to receive any
Hydrocarbon Available Cash), a percentage equal to 100% less the sum of the
percentages applicable to subclauses (A) and (B) of this clause (v);

provided, however, that if the Minimum Quarterly Distribution, the First
Target Distribution, the Second Target Distribution and the Third Target
Distribution have been reduced to zero pursuant to the second sentence of
Section 6.6(a), the distribution of Available Cash that is deemed to be
Operating Surplus with respect to any Quarter will be made solely in
accordance with Section 6.4(a)(v).

Section 6.5 Distributions of Available Cash from Capital Surplus. Available
Cash that is deemed to be Capital Surplus pursuant to the provisions of
Section 6.3(a) shall be distributed, unless the provisions of Section 6.3
require otherwise, to the General Partner and the holders of Common Units and
Class A Units Pro Rata (except that the holders of Class A Units will not be
entitled to receive any Hydrocarbon Available Cash), until a hypothetical
holder of a Common Unit acquired on the Closing Date has received with respect
to such Common Unit distributions of Available Cash that are deemed to be
Capital Surplus in an aggregate amount equal to the Initial Unit Price.
Thereafter, all Available Cash shall be distributed as if it were Operating
Surplus and shall be distributed in accordance with Section 6.4.

Section 6.6 Adjustment of Minimum Quarterly Distribution and Target
Distribution Levels.

(a) The Minimum Quarterly Distribution and Target Distributions shall be
proportionately adjusted in the event of any distribution, combination or
subdivision (whether effected by a distribution payable in Units or otherwise)
of Units or other Partnership Interests in accordance with Section 5.9. In the
event of a distribution of Available Cash that is deemed to be from Capital
Surplus, the then applicable Minimum Quarterly Distribution and Target
Distributions shall be adjusted proportionately downward to equal the product
obtained by multiplying the otherwise applicable Minimum Quarterly
Distribution, First Target Distribution, Second Target Distribution and Third
Target Distribution, as the case may be, by a fraction, the numerator of which
is the Unrecovered Initial Unit Price of the Common Units immediately after
giving effect to such distribution and the denominator of which is the
Unrecovered Initial Unit Price of the Common Units immediately prior to giving
effect to such distribution.

(b) The Minimum Quarterly Distribution, First Target Distribution, Second
Target Distribution and Third Target Distribution, shall also be subject to
adjustment pursuant to Section 5.11 and Section 6.9.



Section 6.7 Reserved.

Section 6.8 Special Provisions Relating to the Holders of Incentive
Distribution Rights.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
holders of the Incentive Distribution Rights (1) shall (x) possess the rights
and obligations provided in this Agreement with respect to a Limited Partner
pursuant to Article III and Article VII and (y) have a Capital Account as a
Partner pursuant to Section 5.5 and all other provisions related thereto and
(2) shall not (x) be entitled to vote on any matters requiring the approval or
vote of the holders of Outstanding Units, except as provided by law, (y) be
entitled to any distributions other than as provided in Sections 6.4(a)(iii),
(iv) and (v), and Section 12.4 or (z) be allocated items of income, gain, loss
or deduction other than as specified in this Article VI; provided, however,
that for the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall not preclude the
Partnership from making any other payments or distributions in connection with
other actions permitted by this Agreement.

(b) A Unitholder shall not be permitted to transfer an IDR Reset Common Unit
(other than a transfer to an Affiliate) if the remaining balance in the
transferring Unitholder's Capital Account with respect to the retained IDR
Reset Common Units would be negative after giving effect to the allocation
under Section 5.5(c)(iii).

(c) A holder of an IDR Reset Common Unit that was issued in connection with an
IDR Reset Election pursuant to Section 5.11 shall not be issued a Common Unit
Certificate pursuant to Section 4.1 (if the Common Units are evidenced by
Certificates) or evidence of the issuance of uncertificated Common Units, and
shall not be permitted to transfer such Common Unit to a Person that is not an
Affiliate of such holder, until such time as the General Partner determines,
based on advice of counsel, that each such IDR Reset Common Unit should have,
as a substantive matter, like intrinsic economic and federal income tax
characteristics, in all material respects, to the intrinsic economic and
federal income tax characteristics of an Initial Common Unit. In connection
with the condition imposed by this Section 6.8(c), the General Partner may
take whatever steps are required to provide economic uniformity to such IDR
Reset Common Units in preparation for a transfer of such IDR Reset Common
Units, including the application of Section 5.5(c)(iii), Section 6.1(d)(x)(B),
or Section 6.1(d)(x)(C); provided, however, that no such steps may be taken
that would have a material adverse effect on the Unitholders holding Common
Units.

Section 6.9 Entity-Level Taxation. If legislation is enacted or the official
interpretation of existing legislation is modified by a governmental
authority, which after giving effect to such enactment or modification,
results in a Group Member becoming subject to federal, state or local or
non-U.S. income or withholding taxes in excess of the amount of such taxes due
from the Group Member prior to such enactment or modification (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, any increase in the rate of such taxation applicable
to the Group Member), then the General Partner may, at its option, reduce the
Minimum Quarterly Distribution and the Target Distributions by the amount of
income or withholding taxes that are payable by reason of any such new
legislation or interpretation (the "Incremental Income Taxes"), or any portion



thereof selected by the General Partner, in the manner provided in this
Section 6.9. If the General Partner elects to reduce the Minimum Quarterly
Distribution and the Target Distributions for any Quarter with respect to all
or a portion of any Incremental Income Taxes, the General Partner shall
estimate for such Quarter the Partnership Group's aggregate liability (the
"Estimated Incremental Quarterly Tax Amount") for all (or the relevant portion
of) such Incremental Income Taxes; provided that any difference between such
estimate and the actual liability for Incremental Income Taxes (or the
relevant portion thereof) for such Quarter may, to the extent determined by
the General Partner, be taken into account in determining the Estimated
Incremental Quarterly Tax Amount with respect to each Quarter in which any
such difference can be determined. For each such Quarter, the Minimum
Quarterly Distribution, First Target Distribution, Second Target Distribution
and Third Target Distribution, shall be the product obtained by multiplying
(a) the amounts therefor that are set out herein prior to the application of
this Section 6.9 times (b) the quotient obtained by dividing (i) Available
Cash with respect to such Quarter by (ii) the sum of Available Cash with
respect to such Quarter and the Estimated Incremental Quarterly Tax Amount for
such Quarter, as determined by the General Partner. For purposes of the
foregoing, Available Cash with respect to a Quarter will be deemed reduced by
the Estimated Incremental Quarterly Tax Amount for that Quarter.

Section 6.10 Special Provisions Relating to the Holders of Converted Units.

(a) A Unitholder holding a Converted Common Unit shall not be issued a Common
Unit pursuant to Section 4.1, and shall not be permitted to transfer such
Converted Common Units to a Person that is not an Affiliate of the holder
(subject to the other transfer restrictions set forth in this Agreement) until
such time as the General Partner reasonably determines that, upon transfer,
each such Converted Common Unit would have, as a substantive matter, like
intrinsic economic and U.S. federal income tax characteristics to the
transferee, in all material respects, to the intrinsic economic and U.S.
federal income tax characteristics of an Initial Common Unit to such
transferee. In connection with the condition imposed by this Section 6.10, the
General Partner shall take whatever steps are required to provide economic
uniformity to the Converted Common Units in preparation for a transfer of such
Converted Common Units, including the application of Section 5.5(c)(iv) and
Section 6.1(d)(x); provided, however, that no such steps may be taken that
would have a material adverse effect on the Unitholders holding Converted
Common Units (for this purpose the allocations of items of income, gain, loss
or deduction with respect to Common Units, Class A Units or Class B Units will
be deemed not to have a material adverse effect on the Common Units).

(b) A holder of a Converted Common Unit or a Class B Unit shall be required to
provide notice to the General Partner of any transfer, disposition, or other
"sale or exchange" (within the meaning of Section 708(b)(1)(B) of the Code) of
any of its Converted Common Units or Class B Units within 45 days of such
event, or by the last Business Day of the calendar year in which such event
occurs, if shorter, providing the number of Converted Common Units or Class B
Units that were transferred, disposed of or subject to the sale or exchange.

Section 6.11 Special Distribution Provisions Relating to Class A Units.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, distributions of
Available Cash to the General Partner and the holders of the Incentive
Distribution Rights as provided for in



Section 6.4 and Section 6.5 shall be adjusted, commencing with the payment
date of the quarterly distribution declared and paid with respect to the
fourth Quarter of 2015 and for each Quarter thereafter, such that the
distributions paid to the General Partner and the holders of the Incentive
Distribution Rights are calculated without regard to, and do not take into
account, any Available Cash distributed to the holders of Class A Units;
provided, however, that this Section 6.11 shall be effective only for so long
as all of the Class A Units issued and Outstanding, if any, are held by a
direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Partnership.

even if the same results in the terms of the transaction being less favorable
to the Partnership than would otherwise be the case);

(vi) the distribution of Partnership cash;

(vii) the selection and dismissal of officers, employees, agents, internal and

the restrictions set forth in Section 2.4;

(x) the control of any matters affecting the rights and obligations of the
Partnership, including the bringing and defending of actions at law or in

(xi) the indemnification of any Person against liabilities and contingencies
to the extent permitted by law;

(xii) the entering into of listing agreements with any National Securities

from, or requesting that trading be suspended on, any such exchange (subject
to any prior approval that may be required under Section 4.8);

(xiii) subject to Section 5.14(b), the purchase, sale or other acquisition or
disposition of Partnership Interests, or the issuance of Derivative

(xv) the entering into of agreements with any of its Affiliates to render

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, any Group Member
Agreement, the Delaware Act or any applicable law, rule or regulation, each
Record



Holder and each other Person who may acquire an interest in a Partnership
Interest or that is otherwise bound by this Agreement hereby (i) approves,
ratifies and confirms the execution, delivery and performance by the parties
thereto of this Agreement and the Group Member Agreement of each other Group
Member, the IPO Underwriting Agreement, the Omnibus Agreement, the
Contribution Agreement, the Employee Services Agreements, and the other
agreements described in or filed as exhibits to the IPO Registration Statement
that are related to the transactions contemplated by the IPO Registration
Statement (collectively, the "Transaction Documents") (in each case other than
this Agreement, without giving effect to any amendments, supplements or
restatements thereof entered into after the date such Person becomes bound by
the provisions of this Agreement); (ii) agrees that the General Partner (on
its own or on behalf of the Partnership) is authorized to execute, deliver and
perform the agreements referred to in clause (i) of this sentence and the
other agreements, acts, transactions and matters described in or contemplated
by the IPO Registration Statement on behalf of the Partnership without any
further act, approval or vote of the Partners or the other Persons who may
acquire an interest in Partnership Interests or are otherwise bound by this
Agreement; and (iii) agrees that the execution, delivery or performance by the
General Partner, any Group Member or any Affiliate of any of them of this
Agreement or any agreement authorized or permitted under this Agreement
(including the exercise by the General Partner or any Affiliate of the General
Partner of the rights accorded pursuant to Article XV) shall not constitute a
breach by the General Partner of any duty that the General Partner may owe the
Partnership or the Limited Partners or any other Persons under this Agreement
(or any other agreements) or of any duty existing at law, in equity or
otherwise.

Section 7.2 Certificate of Limited Partnership. The General Partner has caused
the Certificate of Limited Partnership to be filed with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware as required by the Delaware Act. The General Partner
shall use all reasonable efforts to cause to be filed such other certificates
or documents that the General Partner determines to be necessary or
appropriate for the formation, continuation, qualification and operation of a
limited partnership (or a partnership in which the limited partners have
limited liability) in the State of Delaware or any other state in which the
Partnership may elect to do business or own property. To the extent the
General Partner determines such action to be necessary or appropriate, the
General Partner shall file amendments to and restatements of the Certificate
of Limited Partnership and do all things to maintain the Partnership as a
limited partnership (or a partnership or other entity in which the limited
partners have limited liability) under the laws of the State of Delaware or of
any other state in which the Partnership may elect to do business or own
property. Subject to the terms of Section 3.3(a), the General Partner shall
not be required, before or after filing, to deliver or mail a copy of the
Certificate of Limited Partnership, any qualification document or any
amendment thereto to any Limited Partner.

Section 7.3 Restrictions on the General Partner's Authority to Sell Assets of
the Partnership Group. Except as provided in Article XII and Article XIV, the
General Partner may not sell, exchange or otherwise dispose of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Partnership Group, taken as a whole, in
a single transaction or a series of related transactions (including by way of
merger, consolidation or other combination or sale of ownership interests of
the Partnership's Subsidiaries) without the approval of holders of a Unit
Majority; provided, however, that this provision shall not preclude or limit
the General Partner's ability to mortgage,



pledge, hypothecate or grant a security interest in all or substantially all
of the assets of the Partnership Group and shall not apply to any forced sale
of any or all of the assets of the Partnership Group pursuant to the
foreclosure of, or other realization upon, any such encumbrance.

Section 7.4 Reimbursement of and Other Payments to the General Partner.

(a) Except as provided in this Section 7.4, and elsewhere in this Agreement or
in the Omnibus Agreement, the General Partner shall not be compensated for its
services as a general partner or managing member of any Group Member.

(b) Except as may be otherwise provided in the Omnibus Agreement, the General
Partner shall be reimbursed on a monthly basis, or such other basis as the
General Partner may determine, for (i) all direct and indirect expenses it
incurs or payments it makes on behalf of the Partnership Group (including
salary, bonus, incentive compensation and other amounts paid to any Person,
including Affiliates of the General Partner, to perform services for the
Partnership Group or for the General Partner in the discharge of its duties to
the Partnership Group), and (ii) all other expenses allocable to the
Partnership Group or otherwise incurred by the General Partner or its
Affiliates in connection with managing and operating the Partnership Group's
business and affairs (including expenses allocated to the General Partner by
its Affiliates). The General Partner shall determine the expenses that are
allocable to the Partnership Group. Reimbursements pursuant to this Section
7.4 shall be in addition to any reimbursement to the General Partner as a
result of indemnification pursuant to Section 7.7. Any allocation of expenses
to the Partnership by the General Partner in a manner consistent with its or
its Affiliates' past business practices and, in the case of assets regulated
by FERC, then applicable accounting and allocation methodologies generally
permitted by FERC for rate-making purposes (or in the absence of then-
applicable methodologies permitted by FERC, consistent with the most-recently
applicable methodologies), shall be deemed to have been made in good faith.

(c) The General Partner, without the approval of the Limited Partners (who
shall have no right to vote in respect thereof), may propose and adopt on
behalf of the Partnership employee benefit plans, employee programs and
employee practices (including plans, programs and practices involving the
issuance of Partnership Interests or Derivative Partnership Interests), or
cause the Partnership to issue Partnership Interests or Derivative Partnership
Interests in connection with, or pursuant to, any employee benefit plan,
employee program or employee practice maintained or sponsored by the General
Partner or any of its Affiliates in each case for the benefit of officers,
employees and directors of the General Partner or any of its Affiliates, in
respect of services performed, directly or indirectly, for the benefit of the
Partnership Group. The Partnership agrees to issue and sell to the General
Partner or any of its Affiliates any Partnership Interests that the General
Partner or such Affiliates are obligated to provide to any officers,
employees, consultants and directors pursuant to any such employee benefit
plans, employee programs or employee practices. Expenses incurred by the
General Partner in connection with any such plans, programs and practices
(including the net cost to the General Partner or such Affiliates of
Partnership Interests purchased by the General Partner or such Affiliates from
the Partnership to fulfill options or awards under such plans, programs and
practices) shall be reimbursed in accordance with Section 7.4(b). Any and all
obligations of the



General Partner under any employee benefit plans, employee programs or
employee practices adopted by the General Partner as permitted by this Section
7.4(c) shall constitute obligations of the General Partner hereunder and shall
be assumed by any successor General Partner approved pursuant to Section 11.1
or Section 11.2 or the transferee of or successor to all of the General
Partner's General Partner Interest pursuant to Section 4.6.

(d) The General Partner and its Affiliates may charge any member of the
Partnership Group a management fee to the extent necessary to allow the
Partnership Group to reduce the amount of any state franchise or income tax or
any tax based upon the revenues or gross margin of any member of the
Partnership Group if the tax benefit produced by the payment of such
management fee or fees exceeds the amount of such fee or fees.

(e) The General Partner and its Affiliates may enter into an agreement to
provide services to any Group Member for a fee or otherwise than for cost.

Section 7.5 Outside Activities.

(a) The General Partner, for so long as it is the General Partner of the
Partnership (i) agrees that its sole business will be to act as a general
partner or managing member, as the case may be, of the Partnership and any
other partnership or limited liability company of which the Partnership is,
directly or indirectly, a partner or member and to undertake activities that
are ancillary or related thereto (including being a Limited Partner in the
Partnership) and (ii) shall not engage in any business or activity or incur
any debts or liabilities except in connection with or incidental to (A) its
performance as general partner or managing member, if any, of one or more
Group Members or as described in or contemplated by the IPO Registration
Statement, (B) the acquiring, owning or disposing of debt securities or equity
interests in any Group Member, (C) the guarantee of, and mortgage, pledge, or
encumbrance of any or all of its assets in connection with, any indebtedness
of any Group Member or (D) the performance of its obligations under the
Omnibus Agreement.

(b) Subject to the terms of Section 7.5(c), each Unrestricted Person (other
than the General Partner) shall have the right to engage in businesses of
every type and description and other activities for profit and to engage in
and possess an interest in other business ventures of any and every type or
description, whether in businesses engaged in or anticipated to be engaged in
by any Group Member, independently or with others, including business
interests and activities in direct competition with the business and
activities of any Group Member, and none of the same shall constitute a breach
of this Agreement or any duty otherwise existing at law, in equity or
otherwise, to any Group Member or any Partner. None of any Group Member, any
Limited Partner or any other Person shall have any rights by virtue of this
Agreement, any Group Member Agreement, or the partnership relationship
established hereby in any business ventures of any Unrestricted Person.

(c) Subject to the terms of Section 7.5(a) and Section 7.5(b), but otherwise
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) the engaging
in competitive activities by any Unrestricted Person (other than the General
Partner) in accordance with the provisions of this Section 7.5 is hereby
approved by the Partnership and all Partners, (ii) it shall



be deemed not to be a breach of any duty or any other obligation of any type
whatsoever of the General Partner or any other Unrestricted Person for the
Unrestricted Persons (other than the General Partner) to engage in such
business interests and activities in preference to or to the exclusion of the
Partnership and (iii) the Unrestricted Persons shall have no obligation
hereunder or as a result of any duty otherwise existing at law, in equity or
otherwise, to present business opportunities to the Partnership.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any duty
otherwise existing at law or in equity, the doctrine of corporate opportunity,
or any analogous doctrine, shall not apply to any Unrestricted Person
(including the General Partner). No Unrestricted Person (including the General
Partner) who acquires knowledge of a potential transaction, agreement,
arrangement or other matter that may be an opportunity for the Partnership,
shall have any duty to communicate or offer such opportunity to the
Partnership, and such Unrestricted Person (including the General Partner)
shall not be liable to the Partnership, to any Limited Partner or any other
Person bound by this Agreement for breach of any duty by reason of the fact
that such Unrestricted Person (including the General Partner) pursues or
acquires for itself, directs such opportunity to another Person or does not
communicate such opportunity or information to the Partnership, provided that
such Unrestricted Person does not engage in such business or activity using
confidential or proprietary information provided by or on behalf of the
Partnership to such Unrestricted Person.

(d) The General Partner and each of its Affiliates may acquire Units or other
Partnership Interests in addition to those acquired on the Closing Date and,
except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, shall be entitled to exercise,
at their option, all rights relating to all Units and/or other Partnership
Interests acquired by them. The term "Affiliates" when used in this Section
7.5(d) with respect to the General Partner shall not include any Group Member.

Section 7.6 Loans from the General Partner; Loans or Contributions from the
Partnership or Group Members.

(a) The General Partner or any of its Affiliates may lend to any Group Member,
and any Group Member may borrow from the General Partner or any of its
Affiliates, funds needed or desired by the Group Member for such periods of
time and in such amounts as the General Partner may determine; provided,
however, that in any such case the lending party may not charge the borrowing
party interest at a rate greater than the rate that would be charged the
borrowing party or impose terms less favorable to the borrowing party than
would be charged or imposed on the borrowing party by unrelated lenders on
comparable loans made on an arm's-length basis (without reference to the
lending party's financial abilities or guarantees), all as determined by the
General Partner. The borrowing party shall reimburse the lending party for any
costs (other than any additional interest costs) incurred by the lending party
in connection with the borrowing of such funds. For purposes of this Section
7.6(a) and Section 7.6(b), the term "Group Member" shall include any Affiliate
of a Group Member that is controlled by the Group Member.

(b) The Partnership may lend or contribute to any Group Member, and any Group
Member may borrow from the Partnership, funds on terms and conditions
determined by the General Partner. No Group Member may lend funds to the
General Partner or any of its Affiliates (other than another Group Member).



(c) No borrowing by any Group Member or the approval thereof by the General
Partner shall be deemed to constitute a breach of any duty, expressed or
implied, of the General Partner or its Affiliates to the Partnership or the
Limited Partners existing hereunder, or existing at law, in equity or
otherwise by reason of the fact that the purpose or effect of such borrowing
is directly or indirectly to enable distributions to the General Partner or
its Affiliates (including in their capacities as Limited Partners) to exceed
the General Partner's Percentage Interest of the total amount distributed to
all Partners.

Section 7.7 Indemnification.

(a) To the fullest extent permitted by law but subject to the limitations
expressly provided in this Agreement, all Indemnitees shall be indemnified and
held harmless by the Partnership from and against any and all losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, joint or several, expenses (including legal fees and
expenses), judgments, fines, penalties, interest, settlements or other amounts
arising from any and all threatened, pending or completed claims, demands,
actions, suits or proceedings, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, and whether formal or informal and including appeals, in which
any Indemnitee may be involved, or is threatened to be involved, as a party or
otherwise, by reason of its status as an Indemnitee and acting (or refraining
to act) in such capacity on behalf of or for the benefit of the Partnership;
provided, that the Indemnitee shall not be indemnified and held harmless
pursuant to this Agreement if there has been a final and non-appealable
judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that, in
respect of the matter for which the Indemnitee is seeking indemnification
pursuant to this Agreement, the Indemnitee acted in bad faith or engaged in
intentional fraud, willful misconduct or, in the case of a criminal matter,
acted with knowledge that the Indemnitee's conduct was unlawful; provided,
further, no indemnification pursuant to this Section 7.7 shall be available to
any Affiliate of the General Partner (other than a Group Member), or to any
other Indemnitee, with respect to any such Affiliate's obligations pursuant to
the Transaction Documents. Any indemnification pursuant to this Section 7.7
shall be made only out of the assets of the Partnership, it being agreed that
the General Partner shall not be personally liable for such indemnification
and shall have no obligation to contribute or loan any monies or property to
the Partnership to enable it to effectuate such indemnification.

(b) To the fullest extent permitted by law, expenses (including legal fees and
expenses) incurred by an Indemnitee who is indemnified pursuant to Section
7.7(a) in defending any claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding shall, from
time to time, be advanced by the Partnership prior to a final and non-
appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining
that, in respect of the matter for which the Indemnitee is seeking
indemnification pursuant to this Section 7.7, the Indemnitee is not entitled
to be indemnified upon receipt by the Partnership of any undertaking by or on
behalf of the Indemnitee to repay such amount if it shall be ultimately
determined that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified as authorized
by this Section 7.7.

(c) The indemnification provided by this Section 7.7 shall be in addition to
any other rights to which an Indemnitee may be entitled under any agreement,
pursuant to any vote of the holders of Outstanding Limited Partner Interests,
as a matter of law, in equity or otherwise, both as to actions in the
Indemnitee's capacity as an Indemnitee and as to actions in



any other capacity (including any capacity under the IPO Underwriting
Agreement), and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to serve in
such capacity and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, successors, assigns
and administrators of the Indemnitee.

(d) The Partnership may purchase and maintain (or reimburse the General
Partner or its Affiliates for the cost of) insurance, on behalf of the General
Partner, its Affiliates and such other Persons as the General Partner shall
determine, against any liability that may be asserted against, or expense that
may be incurred by, such Person in connection with the Partnership's
activities or such Person's activities on behalf of the Partnership,
regardless of whether the Partnership would have the power to indemnify such
Person against such liability under the provisions of this Agreement.

(e) For purposes of this Section 7.7, the Partnership shall be deemed to have
requested an Indemnitee to serve as fiduciary of an employee benefit plan
whenever the performance by it of its duties to the Partnership also imposes
duties on, or otherwise involves services by, it to the plan or participants
or beneficiaries of the plan; excise taxes assessed on an Indemnitee with
respect to an employee benefit plan pursuant to applicable law shall
constitute "fines" within the meaning of Section 7.7(a); and action taken or
omitted by it with respect to any employee benefit plan in the performance of
its duties for a purpose reasonably believed by it to be in the best interest
of the participants and beneficiaries of the plan shall be deemed to be for a
purpose that is in the best interests of the Partnership.

(f) In no event may an Indemnitee subject the Limited Partners to personal
liability by reason of the indemnification provisions set forth in this
Agreement.

(g) An Indemnitee shall not be denied indemnification in whole or in part
under this Section 7.7 because the Indemnitee had an interest in the
transaction with respect to which the indemnification applies if the
transaction was otherwise permitted by the terms of this Agreement.

(h) The provisions of this Section 7.7 are for the benefit of the Indemnitees
and their heirs, successors, assigns, executors and administrators and shall
not be deemed to create any rights for the benefit of any other Persons.

(i) No amendment, modification or repeal of this Section 7.7 or any provision
hereof shall in any manner terminate, reduce or impair the right of any past,
present or future Indemnitee to be indemnified by the Partnership, nor the
obligations of the Partnership to indemnify any such Indemnitee under and in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 7.7 as in effect immediately
prior to such amendment, modification or repeal with respect to claims arising
from or relating to matters occurring, in whole or in part, prior to such
amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of when such claims may arise or
be asserted.

Section 7.8 Liability of Indemnitees.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no
Indemnitee shall be liable for monetary damages to the Partnership, the
Limited Partners, or any other Persons who are bound by this Agreement for
losses sustained or liabilities incurred as a



result of any act or omission of an Indemnitee unless there has been a final
and non-appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction
determining that, in respect of the matter in question, the Indemnitee acted
in bad faith or engaged in intentional fraud, willful misconduct or, in the
case of a criminal matter, acted with knowledge that the Indemnitee's conduct
was criminal.

(b) The General Partner may exercise any of the powers granted to it by this
Agreement and perform any of the duties imposed upon it hereunder either
directly or by or through its agents, and the General Partner shall not be
responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any such agent
appointed by the General Partner in good faith.

(c) To the extent that, at law or in equity, an Indemnitee has duties
(including fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating thereto to the
Partnership or to the Partners, the General Partner and any other Indemnitee
acting in connection with the Partnership's business or affairs shall not be
liable to the Partnership or to any Partner or to any other Persons who are
bound by this Agreement for its good faith reliance on the provisions of this
Agreement.

(d) Any amendment, modification or repeal of this Section 7.8 or any provision
hereof shall be prospective only and shall not in any way affect the
limitations on the liability of the Indemnitees under this Section 7.8 as in
effect immediately prior to such amendment, modification or repeal with
respect to claims arising from or relating to matters occurring, in whole or
in part, prior to such amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of when
such claims may arise or be asserted.

Section 7.9 Resolution of Conflicts of Interest; Standards of Conduct and
Modification of Duties.

(a) Unless otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or any Group Member
Agreement, whenever a potential conflict of interest exists or arises between
the General Partner or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the
Partnership, any Group Member or any Partner, on the other, any resolution or
course of action by the General Partner or its Affiliates in respect of such
conflict of interest shall be permitted and deemed approved by all Partners,
and shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement, of any Group Member
Agreement, of any agreement contemplated herein or therein, or of any duty
stated or implied by law or equity, if the resolution or course of action in
respect of such conflict of interest is (i) approved by Special Approval, (ii)
approved by the vote of a majority of the Outstanding Common Units (excluding
Common Units owned by the General Partner and its Affiliates) and Series A
Preferred Units voting together as a single class, (iii) on terms no less
favorable to the Partnership than those generally being provided to or
available from unrelated third parties or (iv) fair and reasonable to the
Partnership, taking into account the totality of the relationships between the
parties involved (including other transactions that may be particularly
favorable or advantageous to the Partnership). The General Partner shall be
authorized but not required in connection with its resolution of such conflict
of interest to seek Special Approval or Unitholder approval of such
resolution, and the General Partner may also adopt a resolution or course of
action that has not received Special Approval or Unitholder approval. Whenever
the General Partner makes a determination to refer any potential conflict of
interest to the Conflicts Committee for Special Approval, seek Unitholder
approval or adopt a resolution or course of action that has not received
Special Approval or Unitholder approval, then the General



Partner shall be entitled, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to make
such determination or to take or decline to take such other action free of any
duty or obligation whatsoever to the Partnership or any Limited Partner, and
the General Partner shall not, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be
required to act in good faith or pursuant to any other standard or duty
imposed by this Agreement, any Group Member Agreement, any other agreement
contemplated hereby or under the Delaware Act or any other law, rule or
regulation or at equity, and the General Partner in making such determination
or taking or declining to take such other action shall be permitted to do so
in its sole and absolute discretion. If Special Approval is sought, then it
shall be presumed that, in making its decision, the Conflicts Committee acted
in good faith, and if the Board of Directors determines that the resolution or
course of action taken with respect to a conflict of interest satisfies either
of the standards set forth in clauses (iii) or (iv) above or that a director
satisfies the eligibility requirements to be a member of the Conflicts
Committee, then it shall be presumed that, in making its decision, the Board
of Directors acted in good faith. In any proceeding brought by any Limited
Partner or by or on behalf of such Limited Partner or any other Limited
Partner or the Partnership challenging any action by the Conflicts Committee
with respect to any matter referred to the Conflicts Committee for Special
Approval by the General Partner, any determination by the Board of Directors
that the resolution or course of action taken with respect to a conflict of
interest satisfies either of the standards set forth in clauses (iii) or (iv)
above or any determination by the Board of Directors that a director satisfies
the eligibility requirements to be a member of the Conflicts Committee, the
Person bringing or prosecuting such proceeding shall have the burden of
overcoming the presumption that the Conflicts Committee or the Board of
Directors, as applicable, acted in good faith. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement or any duty otherwise existing at law or equity,
the existence of the conflicts of interest described in the IPO Registration
Statement are hereby approved by all Partners and shall not constitute a
breach of this Agreement or any such duty.

(b) Whenever the General Partner or the Board of Directors, or any committee
thereof (including the Conflicts Committee), makes a determination or takes or
declines to take any other action, or any Affiliate of the General Partner
causes the General Partner to do so, in its capacity as the general partner of
the Partnership as opposed to in its individual capacity, whether under this
Agreement, any Group Member Agreement or any other agreement contemplated
hereby or otherwise, then, unless another express standard is provided for in
this Agreement, the General Partner, the Board of Directors or such committee
or such Affiliates causing the General Partner to do so, shall make such
determination or take or decline to take such other action in good faith and
shall not be subject to any other or different standards (including fiduciary
standards) imposed by this Agreement, any Group Member Agreement, any other
agreement contemplated hereby or under the Delaware Act or any other law, rule
or regulation or at equity. A determination or other action or inaction will
conclusively be deemed to be in "good faith" for all purposes of this
Agreement, if the Person or Persons making such determination or taking or
declining to take such other action subjectively believe that the
determination or other action or inaction is not adverse to the best interests
of the Partnership Group.



(c) Whenever the General Partner makes a determination or takes or declines to
take any other action, or any of its Affiliates causes it to do so, in its
individual capacity as opposed to in its capacity as the general partner of
the Partnership, whether under this Agreement, any Group Member Agreement or
any other agreement contemplated hereby or otherwise, then the General
Partner, or such Affiliates causing it to do so, are entitled, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, to make such determination or to take or decline to
take such other action free of any duty or obligation whatsoever to the
Partnership or any Limited Partner, and the General Partner, or such
Affiliates causing it to do so, shall not, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, be required to act in good faith or pursuant to any other standard
imposed by this Agreement, any Group Member Agreement, any other agreement
contemplated hereby or under the Delaware Act or any other law, rule or
regulation or at equity, and the Person or Persons making such determination
or taking or declining to take such other action shall be permitted to do so
in their sole and absolute discretion. By way of illustration and not of
limitation, whenever the phrase, "the General Partner at its option," or some
variation of that phrase, is used in this Agreement, it indicates that the
General Partner is acting in its individual capacity. For the avoidance of
doubt, whenever the General Partner votes or transfers its Partnership
Interests, or refrains from voting or transferring its Partnership Interests,
it shall be acting in its individual capacity.

(d) The General Partner's organizational documents may provide that
determinations to take or decline to take any action in its individual, rather
than representative, capacity may or shall be determined by its members, if
the General Partner is a limited liability company, stockholders, if the
General Partner is a corporation, or the members or stockholders of the
General Partner's general partner, if the General Partner is a partnership.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the General
Partner and its Affiliates shall have no duty or obligation, express or
implied, to (i) sell or otherwise dispose of any asset of the Partnership
Group other than in the ordinary course of business or (ii) permit any Group
Member to use any facilities or assets of the General Partner and its
Affiliates, except as may be provided in contracts entered into from time to
time specifically dealing with such use. Any determination by the General
Partner or any of its Affiliates to enter into such contracts shall be at its
option.

(f) Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement or required by the
Delaware Act, neither the General Partner nor any other Indemnitee shall have
any duties or liabilities, including fiduciary duties, to the Partnership or
any Limited Partner and the provisions of this Agreement, to the extent that
they restrict, eliminate or otherwise modify the duties and liabilities,
including fiduciary duties, of the General Partner or any other Indemnitee
otherwise existing at law or in equity, are agreed by the Partners to replace
such other duties and liabilities of the General Partner or such other
Indemnitee.

(g) The Unitholders hereby authorize the General Partner, on behalf of the
Partnership as a partner or member of a Group Member, to approve actions by
the general partner or managing member of such Group Member similar to those
actions permitted to be taken by the General Partner pursuant to this Section
7.9.



Section 7.10 Other Matters Concerning the General Partner and Other
Indemnitees.

(a) The General Partner and any other Indemnitee may rely and shall be
protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any resolution,
certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent,
order, bond, debenture or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine
and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties.

(b) The General Partner and any other Indemnitee may consult with legal
counsel, accountants, appraisers, management consultants, investment bankers
and other consultants and advisers selected by it, and any act taken or
omitted to be taken in reliance upon the advice or opinion (including an
Opinion of Counsel) of such Persons as to matters that the General Partner or
such Indemnitee, respectively, reasonably believes to be within such Person's
professional or expert competence shall be conclusively presumed to have been
done or omitted in good faith and in accordance with such opinion.

(c) The General Partner shall have the right, in respect of any of its powers
or obligations hereunder, to act through any of its duly authorized officers,
a duly appointed attorney or attorneys-in-fact or the duly authorized officers
of the Partnership or any Group Member.

Section 7.11 Purchase or Sale of Partnership Interests. The General Partner
may cause the Partnership to purchase or otherwise acquire Partnership
Interests or Derivative Partnership Interests. As long as Partnership
Interests are held by any Group Member, such Partnership Interests shall not
be considered Outstanding for any purpose, except as otherwise provided
herein. The General Partner or any Affiliate of the General Partner may also
purchase or otherwise acquire and sell or otherwise dispose of Partnership
Interests for its own account, subject to the provisions of Articles IV and X.

Section 7.12 Registration Rights of the General Partner and its Affiliates.

(a) Demand Registration. Upon receipt of a Notice from any Holder at any time
after the 180th day after the Closing Date, the Partnership shall file with
the Commission as promptly as reasonably practicable a registration statement
under the Securities Act (each, a "Registration Statement") providing for the
resale of the Registrable Securities, which may, at the option of the Holder
giving such Notice, be a Registration Statement that provides for the resale
of the Registrable Securities from time to time pursuant to Rule 415 under the
Securities Act. The Partnership shall not be required pursuant to this Section
7.12(a) to file more than one Registration Statement in any twelve-month
period nor to file more than three Registration Statements in the aggregate.
The Partnership shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such
Registration Statement to become effective as soon as reasonably practicable
after the initial filing of the Registration Statement and to remain effective
and available for the resale of the Registrable Securities by the Selling
Holders named therein until the earlier of (i) six months following such
Registration Statement's effective date and (ii) the date on which all
Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement have been sold.
In the event one or more



Holders request in a Notice to dispose of a number of Registrable Securities
that such Holder or Holders reasonably anticipates will result in gross
proceeds of at least $30,000,000 in the aggregate pursuant to a Registration
Statement in an Underwritten Offering, the Partnership shall retain
underwriters that are reasonably acceptable to such Selling Holders in order
to permit such Selling Holders to effect such disposition through an
Underwritten Offering; provided, however, that the Partnership shall have the
exclusive right to select the bookrunning managers. The Partnership and such
Selling Holders shall enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form
that is reasonably acceptable to the Partnership and take all reasonable
actions as are requested by the managing underwriters to facilitate the
Underwritten Offering and sale of Registrable Securities therein. No Holder
may participate in the Underwritten Offering unless it agrees to sell its
Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement on the terms and
conditions of the underwriting agreement and completes and delivers all
necessary documents and information reasonably required under the terms of
such underwriting agreement. In the event that the managing underwriter of
such Underwritten Offering advises the Partnership and the Holder in writing
that in its opinion the inclusion of all or some Registrable Securities would
adversely and materially affect the timing or success of the Underwritten
Offering, the amount of Registrable Securities that each Selling Holder
requested be included in such Underwritten Offering shall be reduced on a Pro
Rata basis to the aggregate amount that the managing underwriter deems will
not have such material and adverse effect. Any Holder may withdraw from such
Underwritten Offering by notice to the Partnership and the managing
underwriter; provided such notice is delivered prior to the launch of such
Underwritten Offering.

(b) Piggyback Registration. At any time after the 180th day after the Closing
Date, if the Partnership shall propose to file a Registration Statement (other
than pursuant to a demand made pursuant to Section 7.12(a)) for an offering of
Partnership Interests for cash (other than an offering relating solely to an
employee benefit plan, an offering relating to a transaction on Form S-4 or an
offering on any registration statement that does not permit secondary sales),
the Partnership shall notify all Holders of such proposal at least five
business days before the proposed filing date. The Partnership shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to include such number of Registrable
Securities held by any Holder in such Registration Statement as each Holder
shall request in a Notice received by the Partnership within two business days
of such Holder's receipt of the notice from the Partnership. If the
Registration Statement about which the Partnership gives notice under this
Section 7.12(b) is for an Underwritten Offering, then any Holder's ability to
include its desired amount of Registrable Securities in such Registration
Statement shall be conditioned on such Holder's inclusion of all such
Registrable Securities in the Underwritten Offering; provided that, in the
event that the managing underwriter of such Underwritten Offering advises the
Partnership and the Holder in writing that in its opinion the inclusion of all
or some Registrable Securities would adversely and materially affect the
timing or success of the Underwritten Offering, the amount of Registrable
Securities that each Selling Holder requested be included in such Underwritten
Offering shall be reduced on a Pro Rata basis to the aggregate amount that the
managing underwriter deems will not have such material and adverse effect. In
connection with any such Underwritten Offering, the Partnership and the
Selling Holders involved shall enter into an underwriting agreement in
customary form that is reasonably acceptable to the Partnership and take all
reasonable actions as are requested by the managing underwriters to facilitate
the Underwritten Offering and sale of Registrable Securities therein. No
Holder may participate in the Underwritten



Offering unless it agrees to sells its Registrable Securities covered by the
Registration Statement on the terms and conditions of the underwriting
agreement and completes and delivers all necessary documents and information
reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting agreement. Any Holder
may withdraw from such Underwritten Offering by notice to the Partnership and
the managing underwriter; provided such notice is delivered prior to the
launch of such Underwritten Offering. The Partnership shall have the right to
terminate or withdraw any Registration Statement or Underwritten Offering
initiated by it under this Section 7.12(b) prior to the effective date of the
Registration Statement or the pricing date of the Underwritten Offering, as
applicable.

(c) Sale Procedures. In connection with its obligations under this Section
7.12, the Partnership shall:

(i) furnish to each Selling Holder (A) as far in advance as reasonably
practicable before filing a Registration Statement or any supplement or
amendment thereto, upon request, copies of reasonably complete drafts of all
such documents proposed to be filed (including exhibits and each document
incorporated by reference therein to the extent then required by the rules and
regulations of the Commission), and provide each such Selling Holder the
opportunity to object to any information pertaining to such Selling Holder and
its plan of distribution that is contained therein and make the corrections
reasonably requested by such Selling Holder with respect to such information
prior to filing a Registration Statement or supplement or amendment thereto,
and (B) such number of copies of such Registration Statement and the
prospectus included therein and any supplements and amendments thereto as such
Persons may reasonably request in order to facilitate the public sale or other
disposition of the Registrable Securities covered by such Registration
Statement; provided, however, that the Partnership will not have any
obligation to provide any document pursuant to clause (B) hereof that is
available on the Commission's website;

(ii) if applicable, use its commercially reasonable efforts to register or
qualify the Registrable Securities covered by a Registration Statement under
the securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as the Selling Holders
or, in the case of an Underwritten Offering, the managing underwriter, shall
reasonably request; provided, however, that the Partnership will not be
required to qualify generally to transact business in any jurisdiction where
it is not then required to so qualify or to take any action that would subject
it to general service of process in any jurisdiction where it is not then so
subject;

(iii) promptly notify each Selling Holder and each underwriter, at any time
when a prospectus is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, of (A)
the filing of a Registration Statement or any prospectus or prospectus
supplement to be used in connection therewith, or any amendment or supplement
thereto, and, with respect to such Registration Statement or any post-
effective amendment thereto, when the same has become effective; and (B) any
written comments from the Commission with respect to any Registration
Statement or any document incorporated by reference therein and any written
request by the Commission for amendments or supplements to a Registration
Statement or any prospectus or prospectus supplement thereto;



(iv) immediately notify each Selling Holder and each underwriter, at any time
when a prospectus is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, of (A)
the occurrence of any event or existence of any fact (but not a description of
such event or fact) as a result of which the prospectus or prospectus
supplement contained in a Registration Statement, as then in effect, includes
an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading (in the case of the prospectus contained therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which a statement is made); (B) the issuance or threat
of issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness
of a Registration Statement, or the initiation of any proceedings for that
purpose; or (C) the receipt by the Partnership of any notification with
respect to the suspension of the qualification of any Registrable Securities
for sale under the applicable securities or blue sky laws of any jurisdiction.
Following the provision of such notice, subject to Section 7.12(f), the
Partnership agrees to, as promptly as practicable, amend or supplement the
prospectus or prospectus supplement or take other appropriate action so that
the prospectus or prospectus supplement does not include an untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the
light of the circumstances then existing and to take such other reasonable
action as is necessary to remove a stop order, suspension, threat thereof or
proceedings related thereto; and

(v) enter into customary agreements and take such other actions as are
reasonably requested by the Selling Holders or the underwriters, if any, in
order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities,
including the provision of comfort letters and legal opinions as are customary
in such securities offerings.

(d) Suspension. Each Selling Holder, upon receipt of notice from the
Partnership of the happening of any event of the kind described in Section
7.12(c)(iv), shall forthwith discontinue disposition of the Registrable
Securities by means of a prospectus or prospectus supplement until such
Selling Holder's receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended
prospectus contemplated by such subsection or until it is advised in writing
by the Partnership that the use of the prospectus may be resumed, and has
received copies of any additional or supplemental filings incorporated by
reference in the prospectus.

(e) Expenses. Except as set forth in an underwriting agreement for the
applicable Underwritten Offering or as otherwise agreed between a Selling
Holder and the Partnership, all costs and expenses of a Registration Statement
filed or an Underwritten Offering that includes Registrable Securities
pursuant to this Section 7.12 (other than underwriting discounts and
commissions on Registrable Securities and fees and expenses of counsel and
advisors to Selling Holders) shall be paid by the Partnership.

(f) Delay Right. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if the
General Partner determines that the Partnership's compliance with its
obligations in this Section 7.12 would be detrimental to the Partnership
because such registration would (x) materially interfere with a significant
acquisition, reorganization or other similar transaction involving the
Partnership, (y) require premature disclosure of material information that the
Partnership has a bona fide business purpose for preserving as confidential or
(z) render the



Partnership unable to comply with requirements under applicable securities
laws, then the Partnership shall have the right to postpone compliance with
such obligations for a period of not more than six months; provided, however,
that such right may not be exercised more than twice in any 24-month period.

(g) Indemnification.

(i) In addition to and not in limitation of the Partnership's obligation under
Section 7.7, the Partnership shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
indemnify and hold harmless each Selling Holder, its officers, directors and
each Person who controls the Holder (within the meaning of the Securities Act)
and any agent thereof (collectively, "Indemnified Persons") from and against
any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, joint or several, expenses
(including legal fees and expenses), judgments, fines, penalties, interest,
settlements or other amounts arising from any and all claims, demands,
actions, suits or proceedings, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, in which any Indemnified Person may be involved, or is
threatened to be involved, as a party or otherwise, under the Securities Act
or otherwise (hereinafter referred to in this Section 7.12(g) as a "claim" and
in the plural as "claims") based upon, arising out of or resulting from any
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in
any Registration Statement, preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or issuer
free writing prospectus under which any Registrable Securities were registered
or sold under the Securities Act, or arising out of, based upon or resulting
from the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading; provided, however, that the Partnership shall not be liable to any
Indemnified Person to the extent that any such claim arises out of, is based
upon or results from an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or
omission or alleged omission made in such Registration Statement, preliminary
prospectus, final prospectus or issuer free writing prospectus in reliance
upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Partnership
by or on behalf of such Indemnified Person specifically for use in the
preparation thereof.

(ii) Each Selling Holder shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
indemnify and hold harmless the Partnership, the General Partner, the General
Partner's officers and directors and each Person who controls the Partnership
or the General Partner (within the meaning of the Securities Act) and any
agent thereof to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the
Partnership to the Selling Holders, but only with respect to information
regarding such Selling Holder furnished in writing by or on behalf of such
Selling Holder expressly for inclusion in a Registration Statement, prospectus
or free writing prospectus relating to the Registrable Securities held by such
Selling Holder.

(iii) The provisions of this Section 7.12(g) shall be in addition to any other
rights to indemnification or contribution that a Person entitled to
indemnification under this Section 7.12(g) may have pursuant to law, equity,
contract or otherwise.

(h) Specific Performance. Damages in the event of breach of Section 7.12 by a
party hereto may be difficult, if not impossible, to ascertain, and it is
therefore agreed that each party, in addition to and without limiting any
other remedy or right it may have, will have



the right to seek an injunction or other equitable relief in any court of
competent jurisdiction, enjoining any such breach, and enforcing specifically
the terms and provisions hereof, and each of the parties hereto hereby waives,
to the fullest extent permitted by law, any and all defenses it may have on
the ground of lack of jurisdiction or competence of the court to grant such an
injunction or other equitable relief. The existence of this right will not
preclude any such party from pursuing any other rights and remedies at law or
in equity that such party may have.

Section 7.13 Reliance by Third Parties. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, any Person dealing with the Partnership shall be
entitled to assume that the General Partner and any officer of the General
Partner authorized by the General Partner to act on behalf of and in the name
of the Partnership has full power and authority to encumber, sell or otherwise
use in any manner any and all assets of the Partnership and to enter into any
authorized contracts on behalf of the Partnership, and such Person shall be
entitled to deal with the General Partner or any such officer as if it were
the Partnership's sole party in interest, both legally and beneficially. Each
Limited Partner hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any and
all defenses or other remedies that may be available against such Person to
contest, negate or disaffirm any action of the General Partner or any such
officer in connection with any such dealing. In no event shall any Person
dealing with the General Partner or any such officer or its representatives be
obligated to ascertain that the terms of this Agreement have been complied
with or to inquire into the necessity or expedience of any act or action of
the General Partner or any such officer or its representatives. Each and every
certificate, document or other instrument executed on behalf of the
Partnership by the General Partner or its representatives shall be conclusive
evidence in favor of any and every Person relying thereon or claiming
thereunder that (a) at the time of the execution and delivery of such
certificate, document or instrument, this Agreement was in full force and
effect, (b) the Person executing and delivering such certificate, document or
instrument was duly authorized and empowered to do so for and on behalf of the
Partnership and (c) such certificate, document or instrument was duly executed
and delivered in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement
and is binding upon the Partnership.

be kept at the principal office of the Partnership appropriate books and
records with respect to the Partnership's business, including all books and
records necessary to provide to the Limited Partners any information required

accrual basis in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Partnership shall not be
required to keep books maintained on a cash basis and the General Partner
shall be permitted to calculate cash-based measures, including Operating

year ending December 31.

Section 8.3 Reports.

(a) Whether or not the Partnership is subject to the requirement to file
reports with the Commission, as soon as practicable, but in no event later
than 105 days after the close of each fiscal year of the Partnership (or such
shorter period as required by the Commission), the General Partner shall cause
to be mailed or made available, by any reasonable means (including posting on
or accessible through the Partnership's or the Commission's website) to each
Record Holder of a Unit as of a date selected by the General Partner, an
annual report containing financial statements of the Partnership for such
fiscal year of the Partnership, presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP,
including a balance sheet and statements of operations, Partnership equity and
cash flows, such statements to be audited by a firm of independent public
accountants selected by the General Partner, and such other information as may
be required by applicable law, regulation or rule of the Commission or any
National Securities Exchange on which the Units are listed or admitted to
trading, or as the General Partner determines to be necessary or appropriate.

(b) Whether or not the Partnership is subject to the requirement to file
reports with the Commission, as soon as practicable, but in no event later
than 50 days after the close of each Quarter (or such shorter period as
required by the Commission) except the last Quarter of each fiscal year, the
General Partner shall cause to be mailed or made available, by any reasonable
means (including posting on or accessible through the Partnership's or the
Commission's website) to each Record Holder of a Unit, as of a date selected
by the General Partner, a report containing unaudited financial statements of
the Partnership and such other information as may be required by applicable
law, regulation or rule of the Commission or any National Securities Exchange
on which the Units are listed or admitted to trading, or as the General
Partner determines to be necessary or appropriate.

ARTICLE IX

TAX MATTERS

Section 9.1 Tax Returns and Information. The Partnership shall timely file all
returns of the Partnership that are required for federal, state and local
income tax purposes on the basis of the accrual method and the taxable period
or year that it is required by law to adopt, from time to time, as determined
by the General Partner. In the event the Partnership is required to use a
taxable period other than a year ending on December 31, the General Partner
shall use reasonable efforts to change the taxable period of the Partnership
to a year ending on December 31. The tax information reasonably required by
Record Holders for federal, state and local income tax reporting purposes with
respect to a taxable period shall be furnished to them within 90 days of the
close of the calendar year in which the Partnership's taxable period ends. The



classification, realization and recognition of income, gain, losses and
deductions and other items shall be on the accrual method of accounting for
federal income tax purposes.

Section 9.2 Tax Elections.

(a) The Partnership shall make the election under Section 754 of the Code in
accordance with applicable regulations thereunder, subject to the reservation
of the right to seek to revoke any such election upon the General Partner's
determination that such revocation is in the best interests of the Limited
Partners. Notwithstanding any other provision herein contained, for the
purposes of computing the adjustments under Section 743(b) of the Code, the
General Partner shall be authorized (but not required) to adopt a convention
whereby the price paid by a transferee of a Limited Partner Interest will be
deemed to be the lowest quoted closing price of the Limited Partner Interests
on any National Securities Exchange on which such Limited Partner Interests
are listed or admitted to trading during the calendar month in which such
transfer is deemed to occur pursuant to Section 6.2(f) without regard to the
actual price paid by such transferee.

(b) Except as otherwise provided herein, the General Partner shall determine
whether the Partnership should make any other elections permitted by the Code.

Section 9.3 Tax Controversies. Subject to the provisions hereof, the General
Partner is designated as the "tax matters partner" (as defined in Section
6231(a)(7) of the Code as in effect prior to the enactment of the Bipartisan
Budget Act of 2015), and the "partnership representative" (as defined in
Section 6223 of the Code following the enactment of the Bipartisan Budget Act
of 2015) and is authorized and required to represent the Partnership (at the
Partnership's expense) in connection with all examinations of the
Partnership's affairs by tax authorities, including resulting administrative
and judicial proceedings, and to expend Partnership funds for professional
services and costs associated therewith. In its capacity as "partnership
representative," the General Partner shall exercise, in its sole discretion,
any and all authority of the "partnership representative" under the Code,
including, without limitation, (i) binding the Partnership and its Partners
with respect to tax matters and (ii) determining whether to make any available
election under Section 6226 of the Code. Each Partner agrees to cooperate with
the General Partner and to do or refrain from doing any or all things
reasonably required by the General Partner to conduct such proceedings. Each
Partner agrees that notice of or updates regarding tax controversies shall be
deemed conclusively to have been given or made by the General Partner if the
Partnership has either (a) filed the information for which notice is required
with the Commission via its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval
system and such information is publicly available on such system or (b) made
the information for which notice is required available on any publicly
available website maintained by the Partnership, whether or not such Partner
remains a Partner in the Partnership at the time such information is made
publicly available. The General Partner may amend the provisions of this
Agreement as determined appropriate in order to minimize the potential U.S.
federal and state or local income tax consequences to current and former
Limited Partners, and for the proper administration of the Partnership, upon
any amendment to the provisions of Subchapter C of Chapter 63 of Subtitle A of
the Code, as enacted by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, or the promulgation
of regulations or publication of other administrative guidance thereunder.



Section 9.4 Withholding; Tax Payments. The General Partner may treat taxes
paid by the Partnership on behalf of all or less than all of the Partners,
including any taxes imposed under Section 6225 of the Code, either as an
advance of a distribution of cash to such Partners or as a general expense of
the Partnership, as determined appropriate under the circumstances by the
General Partner. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
General Partner is authorized to take any action that may be required to cause
the Partnership and other Group Members to comply with any withholding
requirements established under the Code or any other federal, state or local
law including pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442, 1445 and 1446 of the Code, or
established under any foreign law. To the extent that the Partnership is
required or elects to withhold and pay over to any taxing authority any amount
resulting from the allocation or distribution of income to any Partner
(including by reason of Section 1446 of the Code), the General Partner may
treat the amount withheld as a distribution of cash pursuant to Section 6.3 or
Section 12.4(c) in the amount of such withholding from such Partner.

Limited Partner without the consent or approval of any of the Partners. A
Person may not become a Limited Partner without acquiring a Limited Partner
Interest and becoming the Record Holder of such Limited Partner Interest. The
rights and obligations of a Person who is an Ineligible Holder shall be

shall, in exercising the rights of a Limited Partner in respect of such Units
on any matter, and unless the arrangement between such Persons provides
otherwise, take all action as a Limited Partner by virtue of being the Record
Holder of such Units at the direction of the Person who is the beneficial
owner, and the Partnership shall be entitled to assume such Limited Partner is
so acting without further inquiry.

(e) Any transfer of a Limited Partner Interest shall not entitle the
transferee to share in the profits and losses, to receive distributions, to
receive allocations of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit or any similar
item or to any other rights to which the transferor was entitled until the
transferee becomes a Limited Partner pursuant to Section 10.1(b).

Section 10.2 Admission of Successor General Partner. A successor General
Partner approved pursuant to Section 11.1 or Section 11.2 or the transferee of
or successor to all of the General Partner Interest pursuant to Section 4.6

admitted to the Partnership as the General Partner, effective immediately
prior to the withdrawal or removal of the predecessor or transferring General
Partner, pursuant to Section 11.1 or 11.2 or the transfer of the General
Partner Interest pursuant to Section 4.6; provided, however, that no such
successor shall be admitted to the Partnership until compliance with the terms
of Section 4.6 has occurred and such successor has executed and delivered such
other documents or instruments as may be required to effect such admission.
Any such successor is hereby authorized to and shall, subject to the terms
hereof, carry on the business of the members of the Partnership Group without

If an Event of Withdrawal specified in Section 11.1(a)(iv), (v) or (vi)(A),
(B), (C) or (E) occurs, the withdrawing General Partner shall give notice to
the Limited Partners within 30 days after such occurrence. The Partners hereby
agree that only the Events of Withdrawal described in this Section 11.1 shall
result in the withdrawal of the General Partner from the Partnership.

(b) Withdrawal of the General Partner from the Partnership upon the occurrence
of an Event of Withdrawal shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement
under the



following circumstances: (i) at any time during the period beginning on the
Closing Date and ending at 12:00 midnight, Eastern Time, on December 31, 2022
the General Partner voluntarily withdraws by giving at least 90 days' advance
notice of its intention to withdraw to the Limited Partners; provided, that
prior to the effective date of such withdrawal, the withdrawal is approved by
Unitholders holding at least a majority of the Outstanding Common Units
(excluding Common Units owned by the General Partner and its Affiliates) and
Series A Preferred Units voting together as a single class and the General
Partner delivers to the Partnership an Opinion of Counsel ("Withdrawal Opinion
of Counsel") that such withdrawal (following the selection of the successor
General Partner) would not result in the loss of the limited liability under
the Delaware Act of any Limited Partner or cause any Group Member to be
treated as an association taxable as a corporation or otherwise to be taxed as
an entity for federal income tax purposes (to the extent not already so
treated or taxed); (ii) at any time after 12:00 midnight, Eastern Time, on
December 31, 2022 the General Partner voluntarily withdraws by giving at least
90 days' advance notice to the Unitholders, such withdrawal to take effect on

at any time that the General Partner voluntarily withdraws by giving at least
90 days' advance notice of its intention to withdraw to the Limited Partners,
such withdrawal to take effect on the date specified in the notice, if at the
time such notice is given one Person and its Affiliates (other than the
General Partner and its Affiliates) own beneficially or of record or control
at least 50% of the Outstanding Units. The withdrawal of the General Partner
from the Partnership upon the occurrence of an Event of Withdrawal shall also
constitute the withdrawal of the General Partner as general partner or
managing member, if any, to the extent applicable, of the other Group Members.
If the General Partner gives a notice of withdrawal pursuant to Section
11.1(a)(i), the holders of a Unit Majority, may, prior to the effective date
of such withdrawal, elect a successor General Partner. The Person so elected
as successor General Partner shall automatically become the successor general
partner or managing member, to the extent applicable, of the other Group
Members of which the General Partner is a general partner or a managing
member. If, prior to the effective date of the General Partner's withdrawal, a
successor is not elected by the Unitholders as provided herein or the
Partnership does not receive a Withdrawal Opinion of Counsel, the Partnership
shall be dissolved in accordance with Section 12.1 unless the business of the
Partnership is continued pursuant to Section 12.2. Any successor General
Partner elected in accordance with the terms of this Section 11.1 shall be
subject to the provisions of Section 10.2.

Section 11.2 Removal of the General Partner. The General Partner may be
removed if such removal is approved by the Unitholders holding at least 66
2/3% of the Outstanding Units (including Units held by the General Partner and
its Affiliates) voting as a single class. Any such action by such holders for
removal of the General Partner must also provide for the election of a
successor General Partner by the Unitholders holding a Unit Majority. Such
removal shall be effective immediately following the admission of a successor
General Partner pursuant to Section 10.2. The removal of the General Partner
shall also automatically constitute the removal of the General Partner as
general partner or managing member, to the extent applicable, of the other
Group Members of which the General Partner is a general partner or a managing
member. If a Person is elected as a successor General Partner in accordance
with the terms of this Section 11.2, such Person shall, upon admission
pursuant to Section 10.2, automatically become



a successor general partner or managing member, to the extent applicable, of
the other Group Members of which the General Partner is a general partner or a
managing member. The right of the holders of Outstanding Units to remove the
General Partner shall not exist or be exercised unless the Partnership has
received an opinion opining as to the matters covered by a Withdrawal Opinion
of Counsel. Any successor General Partner elected in accordance with the terms
of this Section 11.2 shall be subject to the provisions of Section 10.2.

Section 11.3 Interest of Departing General Partner and Successor General
Partner.

(a) In the event of (i) withdrawal of the General Partner under circumstances
where such withdrawal does not violate this Agreement or (ii) removal of the
General Partner by the holders of Outstanding Units under circumstances where
Cause does not exist, if the successor General Partner is elected in
accordance with the terms of Section 11.1 or Section 11.2, the Departing
General Partner shall have the option, exercisable prior to the effective date
of the withdrawal or removal of such Departing General Partner, to require its
successor to purchase its General Partner Interest and its or its Affiliates'
general partner interest (or equivalent interest), if any, in the other Group
Members and all of its or its Affiliates' Incentive Distribution Rights
(collectively, the "Combined Interest") in exchange for an amount in cash
equal to the fair market value of such Combined Interest, such amount to be
determined and payable as of the effective date of its withdrawal or removal.
If the General Partner is removed by the Unitholders under circumstances where
Cause exists or if the General Partner withdraws under circumstances where
such withdrawal violates this Agreement, and if a successor General Partner is
elected in accordance with the terms of Section 11.1 or Section 11.2 (or if
the business of the Partnership is continued pursuant to Section 12.2 and the
successor General Partner is not the former General Partner), such successor
shall have the option, exercisable prior to the effective date of the
withdrawal or removal of such Departing General Partner (or, in the event the
business of the Partnership is continued, prior to the date the business of
the Partnership is continued), to purchase the Combined Interest for such fair
market value of such Combined Interest. In either event, the Departing General
Partner shall be entitled to receive all reimbursements due such Departing
General Partner pursuant to Section 7.4, including any employee-related
liabilities (including severance liabilities), incurred in connection with the
termination of any employees employed by the Departing General Partner or its
Affiliates (other than any Group Member) for the benefit of the Partnership or
the other Group Members.

For purposes of this Section 11.3(a), the fair market value of the Combined
Interest shall be determined by agreement between the Departing General
Partner and its successor or, failing agreement within 30 days after the
effective date of such Departing General Partner's withdrawal or removal, by
an independent investment banking firm or other independent expert selected by
the Departing General Partner and its successor, which, in turn, may rely on
other experts, and the determination of which shall be conclusive as to such
matter. If such parties cannot agree upon one independent investment banking
firm or other independent expert within 45 days after the effective date of
such withdrawal or removal, then the Departing General Partner shall designate
an independent investment banking firm or other independent expert, the
Departing General Partner's successor shall designate an independent
investment



banking firm or other independent expert, and such firms or experts shall
mutually select a third independent investment banking firm or independent
expert, which third independent investment banking firm or other independent
expert shall determine the fair market value of the Combined Interest. In
making its determination, such third independent investment banking firm or
other independent expert may consider the then current trading price of Units
on any National Securities Exchange on which Units are then listed or admitted
to trading, the value of the Partnership's assets, the rights and obligations
of the Departing General Partner, the value of the Incentive Distribution
Rights and the General Partner Interest and other factors it may deem
relevant.

(b) If the Combined Interest is not purchased in the manner set forth in
Section 11.3(a), the Departing General Partner (or its transferee) shall
become a Limited Partner and its Combined Interest shall be converted into
Common Units pursuant to a valuation made by an investment banking firm or
other independent expert selected pursuant to Section 11.3(a), without
reduction in such Partnership Interest (but subject to proportionate dilution
by reason of the admission of its successor). Any successor General Partner
shall indemnify the Departing General Partner (or its transferee) as to all
debts and liabilities of the Partnership arising on or after the date on which
the Departing General Partner (or its transferee) becomes a Limited Partner.
For purposes of this Agreement, conversion of the Combined Interest of the
Departing General Partner to Common Units will be characterized as if the
Departing General Partner (or its transferee) contributed its Combined
Interest to the Partnership in exchange for the newly issued Common Units.

(c) If a successor General Partner is elected in accordance with the terms of
Section 11.1 or Section 11.2 (or if the business of the Partnership is
continued pursuant to Section 12.2 and the successor General Partner is not
the former General Partner) and the option described in Section 11.3(a) is not
exercised by the party entitled to do so, the successor General Partner shall,
at the effective date of its admission to the Partnership, contribute to the
Partnership cash in the amount equal to the product of (x) the quotient
obtained by dividing (A) the Percentage Interest of the General Partner
Interest of the Departing General Partner by (B) a percentage equal to 100%
less the Percentage Interest of the General Partner Interest of the Departing
General Partner and (y) the Net Agreed Value of the Partnership's assets on
such date. In such event, such successor General Partner shall, subject to the
following sentence, be entitled to its Percentage Interest of all Partnership
allocations and distributions to which the Departing General Partner was
entitled. In addition, the successor General Partner shall cause this
Agreement to be amended to reflect that, from and after the date of such
successor General Partner's admission, the successor General Partner's
interest in all Partnership distributions and allocations shall be its
Percentage Interest.

Section 11.4 Conversion of General Partner Interest and Incentive Distribution
Rights. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, if the General
Partner is removed as general partner of the Partnership under circumstances
where Cause does not exist and Units held by the General Partner and its
Affiliates are not voted in favor of such removal, the General Partner will
have the right to convert its General Partner Interest and its Incentive
Distribution Rights into Common Units or to receive cash in exchange therefor
in accordance with Section 11.3.



Section 11.5 Withdrawal of Limited Partners. No Limited Partner shall have any
right to withdraw from the Partnership; provided, however, that when a
transferee of a Limited Partner's Limited Partner Interest becomes a Record
Holder of the Limited Partner Interest so transferred, such transferring
Limited Partner shall cease to be a Limited Partner with respect to the
Limited Partner Interest so transferred.

ARTICLE XII

DISSOLUTION AND LIQUIDATION

Section 12.1 Dissolution. The Partnership shall not be dissolved by the
admission of additional Limited Partners or by the admission of a successor
General Partner in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon the
removal or withdrawal of the General Partner, if a successor General Partner
is elected pursuant to Section 11.1, Section 11.2 or Section 12.2, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, the Partnership shall not be dissolved and
such successor General Partner shall continue the business of the Partnership.
The Partnership shall dissolve, and (subject to Section 12.2) its affairs
shall be wound up, upon:

(a) an Event of Withdrawal of the General Partner as provided in Section
11.1(a) (other than Section 11.1(a)(ii)), unless a successor is elected and a
Withdrawal Opinion of Counsel is received as provided in Section 11.1(b) or
11.2 and such successor is admitted to the Partnership pursuant to Section
10.2;

(b) an election to dissolve the Partnership by the General Partner that is
approved by the holders of a Unit Majority;

(c) the entry of a decree of judicial dissolution of the Partnership pursuant
to the provisions of the Delaware Act; or

(d) at any time there are no Limited Partners, unless the Partnership is
continued without dissolution in accordance with the Delaware Act.

Section 12.2 Continuation of the Business of the Partnership After
Dissolution. Upon (a) dissolution of the Partnership following an Event of
Withdrawal caused by the withdrawal or removal of the General Partner as
provided in Section 11.1(a)(i) or (iii) and the failure of the Partners to
select a successor to such Departing General Partner pursuant to Section 11.1
or Section 11.2, then, to the maximum extent permitted by law, within 90 days
thereafter, or (b) dissolution of the Partnership upon an event constituting
an Event of Withdrawal as defined in Section 11.1(a)(iv), (v) or (vi), then,
to the maximum extent permitted by law, within 180 days thereafter, the
holders of a Unit Majority may elect to continue the business of the
Partnership on the same terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement by
appointing as a successor General Partner a Person approved by the holders of
a Unit Majority. Unless such an election is made within the applicable time
period as set forth above, the Partnership shall conduct only activities
necessary to wind up its affairs. If such an election is so made, then:

(i) the Partnership shall continue without dissolution unless earlier
dissolved in accordance with this Article XII;



(ii) if the successor General Partner is not the former General Partner, then
the interest of the former General Partner shall be treated in the manner
provided in Section 11.3; and

(iii) the successor General Partner shall be admitted to the Partnership as
General Partner, effective as of the Event of Withdrawal, by agreeing in
writing to be bound by this Agreement;

provided, however, that the right of the holders of a Unit Majority to approve
a successor General Partner and to continue the business of the Partnership
shall not exist and may not be exercised unless the Partnership has received
an Opinion of Counsel that (x) the exercise of the right would not result in
the loss of limited liability of any Limited Partner under the Delaware Act
and (y) neither the Partnership nor any Group Member would be treated as an
association taxable as a corporation or otherwise be taxable as an entity for
federal income tax purposes upon the exercise of such right to continue (to
the extent not already so treated or taxed).

Section 12.3 Liquidator. Upon dissolution of the Partnership, unless the
business of the Partnership is continued pursuant to Section 12.2, the General
Partner shall select one or more Persons to act as Liquidator. The Liquidator
(if other than the General Partner) shall be entitled to receive such
compensation for its services as may be approved by holders of at least a Unit
Majority . The Liquidator (if other than the General Partner) shall agree not
to resign at any time without 15 days' prior notice and may be removed at any
time, with or without cause, by notice of removal approved by holders of at
least a Unit Majority. Upon dissolution, removal or resignation of the
Liquidator, a successor and substitute Liquidator (who shall have and succeed
to all rights, powers and duties of the original Liquidator) shall within 30
days thereafter be approved by holders of at least a Unit Majority. The right
to approve a successor or substitute Liquidator in the manner provided herein
shall be deemed to refer also to any such successor or substitute Liquidator
approved in the manner herein provided. Except as expressly provided in this
Article XII, the Liquidator approved in the manner provided herein shall have
and may exercise, without further authorization or consent of any of the
parties hereto, all of the powers conferred upon the General Partner under the
terms of this Agreement (but subject to all of the applicable limitations,
contractual and otherwise, upon the exercise of such powers, other than the
limitation on sale set forth in Section 7.3) necessary or appropriate to carry
out the duties and functions of the Liquidator hereunder for and during the
period of time required to complete the winding up and liquidation of the
Partnership as provided for herein.

Section 12.4 Liquidation. The Liquidator shall proceed to dispose of the
assets of the Partnership, discharge its liabilities, and otherwise wind up
its affairs in such manner and over such period as determined by the
Liquidator, subject to Section 17-804 of the Delaware Act and the following:

(a) The assets may be disposed of by public or private sale or by distribution
in kind to one or more Partners on such terms as the Liquidator and such
Partner or Partners may agree. If any property is distributed in kind, the
Partner receiving the property shall be deemed for purposes of Section 12.4(c)
to have received cash equal to its fair market value; and contemporaneously
therewith, appropriate cash distributions must be made to the other Partners.



The Liquidator may defer liquidation or distribution of the Partnership's
assets for a reasonable time if it determines that an immediate sale or
distribution of all or some of the Partnership's assets would be impractical
or would cause undue loss to the Partners. The Liquidator may distribute the
Partnership's assets, in whole or in part, in kind if it determines that a
sale would be impractical or would cause undue loss to the Partners.

(b) Liabilities of the Partnership include amounts owed to the Liquidator as
compensation for serving in such capacity (subject to the terms of Section
12.3) and amounts to Partners otherwise than in respect of their distribution
rights under Article VI. With respect to any liability that is contingent,
conditional or unmatured or is otherwise not yet due and payable, the
Liquidator shall either settle such claim for such amount as it thinks
appropriate or establish a reserve of cash or other assets to provide for its
payment. When paid, any unused portion of the reserve shall be distributed as
additional liquidation proceeds.

(c) All property and all cash in excess of that required to satisfy
liabilities as provided in Section 12.4(b) shall be distributed to the
Partners in accordance with, and to the extent of, the positive balances in
their respective Capital Accounts, as determined after taking into account all
Capital Account adjustments (including, without limitation, the allocation
provided for under Section 6.1(d)(xi)(C), which allocates items of gross
income, gain, loss and deduction among the Partners to the maximum extent
possible to provide a preference in liquidation to the Capital Account of the
Series A Preferred Units over the Capital Accounts of Series A Junior
Interests, but excluding adjustments made by reason of distributions pursuant
to this Section 12.4(c)) for the taxable period of the Partnership during
which the liquidation of the Partnership occurs (with such date of occurrence
being determined pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(g)), and such distribution shall be made by the end of such
taxable period (or, if later, within 90 days after said date of such
occurrence); provided that any cash or cash equivalents available for
distribution under this Section 12.4(c) shall be distributed with respect to
the Series A Preferred Units and Series A Senior Securities (up to the
positive balances in the associated Capital Accounts) prior to any
distribution of cash or cash equivalents with respect to the Series A Junior
Securities.

Section 12.5 Cancellation of Certificate of Limited Partnership. Upon the
completion of the distribution of Partnership cash and property as provided in
Section 12.4 in connection with the liquidation of the Partnership, the
Certificate of Limited Partnership and all qualifications of the Partnership
as a foreign limited partnership in jurisdictions other than the State of
Delaware shall be canceled and such other actions as may be necessary to
terminate the Partnership shall be taken.

Section 12.6 Return of Contributions. The General Partner shall not be
personally liable for, and shall have no obligation to contribute or loan any
monies or property to the Partnership to enable it to effectuate, the return
of the Capital Contributions of the Limited Partners or Unitholders, or any
portion thereof, it being expressly understood that any such return shall be
made solely from Partnership assets.

Section 12.7 Waiver of Partition. To the maximum extent permitted by law, each
Partner hereby waives any right to partition of the Partnership property.



Section 12.8 Capital Account Restoration. No Limited Partner shall have any
obligation to restore any negative balance in its Capital Account upon
liquidation of the Partnership. The General Partner shall be obligated to
restore any negative balance in its Capital Account upon liquidation of its
interest in the Partnership by the end of the taxable year of the Partnership
during which such liquidation occurs, or, if later, within 90 days after the
date of such liquidation.

place of business of the Partnership, the registered agent of the Partnership
or the registered office of the Partnership;

with this Agreement;

Members will not be treated as associations taxable as corporations or
otherwise taxed as entities for federal income tax purposes;

(d) a change that the General Partner determines, (i) does not adversely
affect the Limited Partners considered as a whole or any particular class of
Partnership Interests as compared to other classes of Partnership Interests in
any material respect (except as permitted by subsection (g) of this Section
13.1), (ii) to be necessary or appropriate to (A) satisfy any requirements,
conditions or guidelines contained in any opinion, directive, order, ruling or
regulation of any federal or state agency or judicial authority or contained
in any federal or state statute (including the Delaware Act) or (B) facilitate
the trading of the Units (including the division of any class or classes of
Outstanding Units into different classes to facilitate uniformity of tax
consequences within such classes of Units) or comply with any rule,
regulation, guideline or requirement of any National Securities Exchange on
which the Units are or will be listed or admitted to trading, (iii) to be

distributions are to be made by the Partnership;

(f) an amendment that is necessary, in the Opinion of Counsel, to prevent the
Partnership, or the General Partner or its directors, officers, trustees or
agents from in any manner being subjected to the provisions of the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as
amended, or "plan asset" regulations adopted under the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, regardless of whether such are
substantially similar to plan asset regulations currently applied or proposed
by the United States Department of Labor;

(g) an amendment that the General Partner determines to be necessary or
appropriate in connection with the authorization or issuance of any class or
series of Partnership Interests pursuant to Section 5.6;

(h) any amendment expressly permitted in this Agreement to be made by the
General Partner acting alone;

(i) an amendment effected, necessitated or contemplated by a Merger Agreement
or Plan of Conversion approved in accordance with Section 14.3;

7.1(a);

(k) a merger, conveyance or conversion pursuant to Section 14.3(d) or Section

Section 13.2 Amendment Procedures. Amendments to this Agreement may be
proposed only by the General Partner. To the fullest extent permitted by law,
the General Partner shall have no duty or obligation to propose or approve any
amendment to this Agreement and may decline to do so free of any duty or
obligation whatsoever to the Partnership, any Limited Partner or any other
Person bound by this Agreement, and, in declining to propose or approve an
amendment to this Agreement, to the fullest extent permitted by law, shall not
be required to act in good faith or pursuant to any other standard imposed by
this Agreement, any Group Member Agreement, any other agreement contemplated
hereby or under the Delaware Act or any other law, rule or regulation or at
equity, and the General Partner in determining whether to propose or approve
any amendment to this Agreement shall be permitted to do so in its sole and
absolute discretion. An amendment to this Agreement shall be effective upon
its approval by the General Partner and, except as otherwise provided by
Section 13.1 or Section 13.3, the holders of a Unit Majority, unless a greater
or different percentage of Outstanding Units or class of Limited Partners is
required under this Agreement. Each proposed amendment that requires the
approval of the holders of a specified percentage of Outstanding Units or
class of Limited Partners shall be



set forth in a writing that contains the text of the proposed amendment. If
such an amendment is proposed, the General Partner shall seek the written
approval of the requisite percentage of Outstanding Units or class of Limited
Partners or call a meeting of the Unitholders to consider and vote on such
proposed amendment. The General Partner shall notify all Record Holders upon
final adoption of any amendments. The General Partner shall be deemed to have
notified all Record Holders as required by this Section 13.2 if it has posted
or made accessible such amendment through the Partnership's or the
Commission's website.

Section 13.3 Amendment Requirements.

(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 13.1 and Section 13.2, no
provision of this Agreement that establishes a percentage of Outstanding Units
or class of Limited Partners required to take any action shall be amended,
altered, changed, repealed or rescinded in any respect that would have the
effect of (i) in the case of any provision of this Agreement other than
Section 11.2 or Section 13.4, reducing such percentage or changing the
required vote of such class or (ii) in the case of Section 11.2 or Section
13.4, increasing such percentages or changing the required vote of such class,
unless such amendment is approved by the written consent or the affirmative
vote of holders of Outstanding Units whose aggregate Outstanding Units
constitute (w) in the case of a change of the required vote of such class as
described in subclause (a)(i) or (a)(ii), not less than 66.7% of the class to
be changed, (x) in the case of a reduction as described in subclause (a)(i)
hereof, not less than the voting requirement sought to be reduced, (y) in the
case of an increase in the percentage in Section 11.2, not less than 90% of
the Outstanding Units, or (z) in the case of an increase in the percentage in
Section 13.4, not less than a majority of the Outstanding Units.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 13.1 and Section 13.2, no
amendment to this Agreement may (i) enlarge the obligations of any Limited
Partner without its consent, unless such shall be deemed to have occurred as a
result of an amendment approved pursuant to Section 13.3(c) or (ii) enlarge
the obligations of, restrict in any way any action by or rights of, or reduce
in any way the amounts distributable, reimbursable or otherwise payable to,
the General Partner or any of its Affiliates without its consent, which
consent may be given or withheld at its option.

(c) Except as provided in Section 14.3, and without limitation of the General
Partner's authority to adopt amendments to this Agreement without the approval
of any Partners as contemplated in Section 13.1, any amendment that would have
a material adverse effect on the rights or preferences of any class of
Partnership Interests in relation to other classes of Partnership Interests
must be approved by the holders of not less than a majority of the Outstanding
Partnership Interests of the class affected.

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, except for
amendments pursuant to Section 13.1 and except as otherwise provided by
Section 14.3(f), no amendments shall become effective without the approval of
the holders of at least 90% of the Outstanding Units voting as a single class
unless the Partnership obtains an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such
amendment will not affect the limited liability of any Limited Partner under
applicable partnership law of the state under whose laws the Partnership is
organized.



(e) Except as provided in Section 13.1, this Section 13.3 shall only be
amended with the approval of the holders of at least 90% of the Outstanding
Units.

Section 13.4 Special Meetings. All acts of Limited Partners to be taken
pursuant to this Agreement shall be taken in the manner provided in this
Article XIII. Special meetings of the Limited Partners may be called by the
General Partner or by Limited Partners owning 20% or more of the Outstanding
Units of the class or classes for which a meeting is proposed. Limited
Partners shall call a special meeting by delivering to the General Partner one
or more requests in writing stating that the signing Limited Partners wish to
call a special meeting and indicating the specific purposes for which the
special meeting is to be called and the class or classes of Units for which
the meeting is proposed. No business may be brought by any Limited Partner
before such special meeting except the business listed in the related request.
Within 60 days after receipt of such a call from Limited Partners or within
such greater time as may be reasonably necessary for the Partnership to comply
with any statutes, rules, regulations, listing agreements or similar
requirements governing the holding of a meeting or the solicitation of proxies
for use at such a meeting, the General Partner shall send or cause to be sent
a notice of the meeting to the Limited Partners. A meeting shall be held at a
time and place determined by the General Partner on a date not less than 10
days nor more than 60 days after the time notice of the meeting is given as
provided in Section 16.1. Limited Partners shall not be permitted to vote on
matters that would cause the Limited Partners to be deemed to be taking part
in the management and control of the business and affairs of the Partnership
so as to jeopardize the Limited Partners' limited liability under the Delaware
Act or the law of any other state in which the Partnership is qualified to do
business. If any such vote were to take place, to the fullest extent permitted
by law, it shall be deemed null and void to the extent necessary so as not to
jeopardize the Limited Partners' limited liability under the Delaware Act or
the law of any other state in which the Partnership is qualified to do
business.

Section 13.5 Notice of a Meeting. Notice of a meeting called pursuant to
Section 13.4 shall be given to the Record Holders of the class or classes of
Units for which a meeting is proposed in writing by mail or other means of
written communication in accordance with Section 16.1.

Section 13.6 Record Date. For purposes of determining the Limited Partners who
are Record Holders of the class or classes of Limited Partner Interests
entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of the Limited Partners or to
give approvals without a meeting as provided in Section 13.11, the General
Partner shall set a Record Date, which shall not be less than 10 nor more than
60 days before (a) the date of the meeting (unless such requirement conflicts
with any rule, regulation, guideline or requirement of any National Securities
Exchange on which the Units are listed or admitted to trading or U.S. federal
securities laws, in which case the rule, regulation, guideline or requirement
of such National Securities Exchange or U.S. federal securities laws shall
govern) or (b) in the event that approvals are sought without a meeting, the
date by which such Limited Partners are requested in writing by the General
Partner to give such approvals.

Section 13.7 Postponement and Adjournment. Prior to the date upon which any
meeting of Limited Partners is to be held, the General Partner may postpone
such meeting one or



more times for any reason by giving notice to each Limited Partner entitled to
vote at the meeting so postponed of the place, date and hour at which such
meeting would be held. Such notice shall be given not fewer than two days
before the date of such meeting and otherwise in accordance with this Article
XIII. When a meeting is postponed, a new Record Date need not be fixed unless
such postponement shall be for more than 45 days. Any meeting of Limited
Partners may be adjourned by the General Partner one or more times for any
reason, including the failure of a quorum to be present at the meeting with
respect to any proposal or the failure of any proposal to receive sufficient
votes for approval. No Limited Partner vote shall be required for any
adjournment. A meeting of Limited Partners may be adjourned by the General
Partner as to one or more proposals regardless of whether action has been
taken on other matters. When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place,
notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting and a new Record Date need
not be fixed, if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at
which the adjournment is taken, unless such adjournment shall be for more than
45 days. At the adjourned meeting, the Partnership may transact any business
which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment
is for more than 45 days or if a new Record Date is fixed for the adjourned
meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given in accordance with
this Article XIII.

Section 13.8 Waiver of Notice; Approval of Meeting. The transactions of any
meeting of Limited Partners, however called and noticed, and whenever held,
shall be as valid as if it had occurred at a meeting duly held after regular
call and notice, if a quorum is present either in person or by proxy.
Attendance of a Limited Partner at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of
notice of the meeting, except when the Limited Partner attends the meeting for
the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the
transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or
convened; and except that attendance at a meeting is not a waiver of any right
to disapprove of any matters submitted for consideration or to object to the
failure to submit for consideration any matters required to be included in the
notice of the meeting, but not so included, if such objection is expressly
made at the beginning of the meeting.

Section 13.9 Quorum and Voting. The presence, in person or by proxy, of
holders of a majority of the Outstanding Units of the class or classes for
which a meeting has been called (including Outstanding Units deemed owned by
the General Partner) shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of Limited
Partners of such class or classes unless any such action by the Limited
Partners requires approval by holders of a greater percentage of such Units,
in which case the quorum shall be such greater percentage. At any meeting of
the Limited Partners duly called and held in accordance with this Agreement at
which a quorum is present, the act of Limited Partners holding Outstanding
Units that in the aggregate represent a majority of the Outstanding Units
entitled to vote at such meeting shall be deemed to constitute the act of all
Limited Partners, unless a different percentage or class vote is required with
respect to such action under the provisions of this Agreement, in which case
the act of the Limited Partners holding Outstanding Units that in the
aggregate represent at least such different percentage, or the act of the
Limited Partners holding the requisite percentage of the necessary class,
shall be required. The Limited Partners present at a duly called or held
meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to transact business until
adjournment, notwithstanding the exit of enough Limited Partners to leave less
than a quorum, if any action taken (other than adjournment) is approved by the
required percentage of Outstanding Units or class of Limited Partners
specified in this Agreement.



Section 13.10 Conduct of a Meeting. The General Partner shall have full power
and authority concerning the manner of conducting any meeting of the Limited
Partners or solicitation of approvals in writing, including the determination
of Persons entitled to vote, the existence of a quorum, the satisfaction of
the requirements of Section 13.4, the conduct of voting, the validity and
effect of any proxies and the determination of any controversies, votes or
challenges arising in connection with or during the meeting or voting. The
General Partner shall designate a Person to serve as chairman of any meeting
and shall further designate a Person to take the minutes of any meeting. All
minutes shall be kept with the records of the Partnership maintained by the
General Partner. The General Partner may make such other regulations
consistent with applicable law and this Agreement as it may deem advisable
concerning the conduct of any meeting of the Limited Partners or solicitation
of approvals in writing, including regulations in regard to the appointment of
proxies, the appointment and duties of inspectors of votes and approvals, the
submission and examination of proxies and other evidence of the right to vote,
and the submission and revocation of approvals in writing.

Section 13.11 Action Without a Meeting. If authorized by the General Partner,
any action that may be taken at a meeting of the Limited Partners may be taken
without a meeting if an approval in writing setting forth the action so taken
is signed by Limited Partners owning not less than the minimum percentage of
the Outstanding Units or of any class of Limited Partners that would be
necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all the
Limited Partners were present and voted (unless such provision conflicts with
any rule, regulation, guideline or requirement of any National Securities
Exchange on which the Units are listed or admitted to trading, in which case
the rule, regulation, guideline or requirement of such National Securities
Exchange shall govern). Prompt notice of the taking of action without a
meeting shall be given to the Limited Partners who have not approved in
writing. The General Partner may specify that any written ballot submitted to
Limited Partners for the purpose of taking any action without a meeting shall
be returned to the Partnership within the time period, which shall be not less
than 20 days, specified by the General Partner. If a ballot returned to the
Partnership does not vote all of the Outstanding Units held by such Limited
Partners, the Partnership shall be deemed to have failed to receive a ballot
for the Outstanding Units that were not voted. If approval of the taking of
any permitted action by the Limited Partners is solicited by any Person other
than by or on behalf of the General Partner, the written approvals shall have
no force and effect unless and until (a) approvals sufficient to take the
action proposed are deposited with the Partnership in care of the General
Partner, (b) approvals sufficient to take the action proposed are dated as of
a date not more than 90 days prior to the date sufficient approvals are first
deposited with the Partnership and (c) an Opinion of Counsel is delivered to
the General Partner to the effect that the exercise of such right and the
action proposed to be taken with respect to any particular matter (i) will not
cause the Limited Partners to be deemed to be taking part in the management
and control of the business and affairs of the Partnership so as to jeopardize
the Limited Partners' limited liability, and (ii) is otherwise permissible
under the state statutes then governing the rights, duties and liabilities of
the Partnership and the Partners.

Section 13.12 Right to Vote and Related Matters.

(a) Only those Record Holders of the Outstanding Units on the Record Date set
pursuant to Section 13.6 (and also subject to the limitations contained in the
definition of



"Outstanding") shall be entitled to notice of, and to vote at, a meeting of
Limited Partners or to act with respect to matters as to which the holders of
the Outstanding Units have the right to vote or to act. All references in this
Agreement to votes of, or other acts that may be taken by, the Outstanding
Units shall be deemed to be references to the votes or acts of the Record
Holders of such Outstanding Units.

(b) With respect to Units that are held for a Person's account by another
Person that is the Record Holder (such as a broker, dealer, bank, trust
company or clearing corporation, or an agent of any of the foregoing), such
Record Holder shall, in exercising the voting rights in respect of such Units
on any matter, and unless the arrangement between such Persons provides
otherwise, vote such Units in favor of, and at the direction of, the Person
who is the beneficial owner, and the Partnership shall be entitled to assume
such Record Holder is so acting without further inquiry. The provisions of
this Section 13.12(b) (as well as all other provisions of this Agreement) are
subject to the provisions of Section 4.3.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Record
Holder of an Incentive Distribution Right shall not be entitled to vote such
Incentive Distribution Right on any Partnership matter.

Section 14.1 Authority. The Partnership may merge or consolidate with or into
one or more corporations, limited liability companies, statutory trusts or
associations, real estate investment trusts, common law trusts or
unincorporated businesses, including a partnership (whether general or limited
(including a limited liability partnership)) or convert into any such entity,
whether such entity is formed under the laws of the State of Delaware or any
other state of the United States of America or any other country, pursuant to
a written plan of merger or consolidation ("Merger Agreement") or a written
plan of conversion ("Plan of Conversion"), as the case may be, in accordance
with this Article XIV.

Section 14.2 Procedure for Merger, Consolidation or Conversion.

(a) Merger, consolidation or conversion of the Partnership pursuant to this
Article XIV requires the prior consent of the General Partner, provided,
however, that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the General Partner
shall have no duty or obligation to consent to any merger, consolidation or
conversion of the Partnership and may decline to do so free of any duty or
obligation whatsoever to the Partnership or any Limited Partner and, in
declining to consent to a merger, consolidation or conversion, shall not be
required to act in good faith or pursuant to any other standard imposed by
this Agreement, any other agreement contemplated hereby or under the Act or
any other law, rule or regulation or at equity, and the General Partner in
determining whether to consent to any merger, consolidation or conversion of
the Partnership shall be permitted to do so in its sole and absolute
discretion.

(b) If the General Partner shall determine to consent to the merger or
consolidation, the General Partner shall approve the Merger Agreement, which
shall set forth:



(i) name and state or country of domicile of each of the business entities
proposing to merge or consolidate;

(ii) the name and state of domicile of the business entity that is to survive
the proposed merger or consolidation (the "Surviving Business Entity");

(iii) the terms and conditions of the proposed merger or consolidation;

(iv) the manner and basis of exchanging or converting the equity securities of
each constituent business entity for, or into, cash, property or interests,
rights, securities or obligations of the Surviving Business Entity; and (A) if
any general or limited partner interests, securities or rights of any
constituent business entity are not to be exchanged or converted solely for,

Section 14.3 Approval by Limited Partners.

(a) Except as provided in Section 14.3(d) and Section 14.3(e), the General
Partner, upon its approval of the Merger Agreement or the Plan of Conversion,
as the case may be, shall direct that the Merger Agreement or the Plan of
Conversion, as applicable, be submitted to a vote of Limited Partners, whether
at a special meeting or by written consent, in either case in accordance with
the requirements of Article XIII. A copy or a summary of the Merger Agreement
or the Plan of Conversion, as the case may be, shall be included in or
enclosed with the notice of a special meeting or the written consent and,
subject to any applicable requirements of Regulation 14A pursuant to the
Exchange Act or successor provision, no other disclosure regarding the
proposed merger, consolidation or conversion shall be required.

(b) Except as provided in Section 14.3(d) and Section 14.3(e), the Merger
Agreement or Plan of Conversion, as the case may be, shall be approved upon
receiving the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of a Unit Majority
unless the Merger Agreement or Plan of Conversion, as the case may be, effects
an amendment to any provision of this Agreement that, if contained in an
amendment to this Agreement adopted pursuant to Article XIII, would require
for its approval the vote or consent of a greater percentage of the
Outstanding Units or of any class of Limited Partners, in which case such
greater percentage vote or consent shall be required for approval of the
Merger Agreement or the Plan of Conversion, as the case may be.



(c) Except as provided in Section 14.3(d) and Section 14.3(e), after such
approval by vote or consent of the Limited Partners, and at any time prior to

Section 14.4, the merger, consolidation or conversion may be abandoned
pursuant to provisions therefor, if any, set forth in the Merger Agreement or
Plan of Conversion, as the case may be.

(d) Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Article XIV or in this
Agreement, the General Partner is permitted, without Limited Partner approval,
to convert the Partnership or any Group Member into a new limited liability
entity, to merge the Partnership or any Group Member into, or convey all of
the Partnership's assets to, another limited liability entity that shall be
newly formed and shall have no assets, liabilities or operations at the time
of such conversion, merger or conveyance other than those it receives from the
Partnership or other Group Member if (i) the General Partner has received an
Opinion of Counsel that the conversion, merger or conveyance, as the case may
be, would not result in the loss of limited liability under the laws of the
jurisdiction governing the other limited liability entity (if that
jurisdiction is not Delaware) of any Limited Partner as compared to its
limited liability under the Delaware Act or cause the Partnership to be
treated as an association taxable as a corporation or otherwise to be taxed as
an entity for federal income tax purposes (to the extent not previously
treated as such), (ii) the sole purpose of such conversion, merger, or
conveyance is to effect a mere change in the legal form of the Partnership
into another limited liability entity and (iii) the General Partner determines
that the governing instruments of the new entity provide the Limited Partners
and the General Partner with substantially the same rights and obligations as
are herein contained.

(e) Additionally, notwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement,
but subject to Section 5.14(b)(vii), the General Partner is permitted, without
Limited Partner approval, to merge or consolidate the Partnership with or into
another limited liability entity if (i) the General Partner has received an
Opinion of Counsel that the merger or consolidation, as the case may be, would
not result in the loss of the limited liability of any Limited Partner under
the laws of the jurisdiction governing the other limited liability entity (if
that jurisdiction is not Delaware) as compared to its limited liability under
the Delaware Act or cause the Partnership to be treated as an association
taxable as a corporation or otherwise to be taxed as an entity for federal
income tax purposes (to the extent not previously treated as such), (ii) the
merger or consolidation would not result in an amendment to this Agreement,
other than any amendments that could be adopted pursuant to Section 13.1,
(iii) the Partnership is the Surviving Business Entity in such merger or
consolidation, (iv) each Unit outstanding immediately prior to the effective
date of the merger or consolidation is to be an identical Unit of the
Partnership after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, and (v)
the number of Partnership Interests to be issued by the Partnership in such
merger or consolidation does not exceed 20% of the Partnership Interests
(other than Incentive Distribution Rights) Outstanding immediately prior to
the effective date of such merger or consolidation.

(f) Pursuant to Section 17-211(g) of the Delaware Act, an agreement of merger
or consolidation approved in accordance with this Article XIV may (i) effect
any amendment to this Agreement or (ii) effect the adoption of a new
partnership agreement for the Partnership if it is the Surviving Business
Entity. Any such amendment or adoption made



pursuant to this Section 14.3 shall be effective at the effective time or date
of the merger or consolidation.

Section 14.4 Certificate of Merger or Certificate of Conversion. Upon the
required approval by the General Partner and the Unitholders of a Merger
Agreement or the Plan of Conversion, as the case may be, a certificate of
merger or certificate of conversion or other filing, as applicable, shall be
executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or the
appropriate filing office of any other jurisdiction, as applicable, in
conformity with the requirements of the Delaware Act or other applicable law.

Section 14.5 Effect of Merger, Consolidation or Conversion.

(a) At the effective time of the merger:

(i) all of the rights, privileges and powers of each of the business entities
that has merged or consolidated, and all property, real, personal and mixed,
and all debts due to any of those business entities and all other things and
causes of action belonging to each of those business entities, shall be vested
in the Surviving Business Entity and after the merger or consolidation shall
be the property of the Surviving Business Entity to the extent they were of
each constituent business entity;

(ii) the title to any real property vested by deed or otherwise in any of
those constituent business entities shall not revert and is not in any way
impaired because of the merger or consolidation;

(iii) all rights of creditors and all liens on or security interests in
property of any of those constituent business entities shall be preserved
unimpaired; and

(iv) all debts, liabilities and duties of those constituent business entities
shall attach to the Surviving Business Entity and may be enforced against it
to the same extent as if the debts, liabilities and duties had been incurred
or contracted by it.

(b) At the effective time of the conversion:

(i) the Partnership shall continue to exist, without interruption, but in the
organizational form of the converted entity rather than in its prior
organizational form;

(ii) all rights, title, and interests to all real estate and other property
owned by the Partnership shall continue to be owned by the converted entity in
its new organizational form without reversion or impairment, without further
act or deed, and without any transfer or assignment having occurred, but
subject to any existing liens or other encumbrances thereon;

(iii) all liabilities and obligations of the Partnership shall continue to be
liabilities and obligations of the converted entity in its new organizational
form without impairment or diminution by reason of the conversion;



(iv) all rights of creditors or other parties with respect to or against the
prior interest holders or other owners of the Partnership in their capacities
as such in existence as of the effective time of the conversion will continue
in existence as to those liabilities and obligations and may be pursued by
such creditors and obligees as if the conversion did not occur;

(v) a proceeding pending by or against the Partnership or by or against any of
Partners in their capacities as such may be continued by or against the
converted entity in its new organizational form and by or against the prior
Partners without any need for substitution of parties; and

(vi) subject to Section 5.14(b)(vii), the Partnership Interests that are to be
converted into partnership interests, shares, evidences of ownership, or other
securities in the converted entity as provided in the plan of conversion shall
be so converted, and Partners shall be entitled only to the rights provided in
the Plan of Conversion.

ARTICLE XV

RIGHT TO ACQUIRE LIMITED PARTNER INTERESTS

Section 15.1 Right to Acquire Limited Partner Interests.

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement except Section
5.14(b)(vi)(G), if at any time the General Partner and its Affiliates hold
more than 85% of the total Limited Partner Interests of any class then
Outstanding, the General Partner shall then have the right, which right it may
assign and transfer in whole or in part to the Partnership or any Affiliate of
the General Partner, exercisable at its option, to purchase all, but not less
than all, of such Limited Partner Interests (but excluding the Series A
Preferred Units, which are subject to Section 5.14(b)(vi)(G)), of such class
then Outstanding held by Persons other than the General Partner and its
Affiliates, at the greater of (x) the Current Market Price as of the date
three Business Days prior to the date that the notice described in Section
15.1(b) is mailed and (y) the highest price paid by the General Partner or any
of its Affiliates for any such Limited Partner Interest of such class
purchased during the 90-day period preceding the date that the notice
described in Section 15.1(b) is mailed.

(b) If the General Partner, any Affiliate of the General Partner or the
Partnership elects to exercise the right to purchase Limited Partner Interests
granted pursuant to Section 15.1(a), the General Partner shall deliver to the
applicable Transfer Agent or exchange agent notice of such election to
purchase (the "Notice of Election to Purchase") and shall cause the Transfer
Agent or exchange agent to mail a copy of such Notice of Election to Purchase
to the Record Holders of Limited Partner Interests of such class (as of a
Record Date selected by the General Partner), together with such information
as may be required by law, rule or regulation, at least 10, but not more than
60, days prior to the Purchase Date. Such Notice of Election to Purchase shall
also be filed and distributed as may be required by the Commission or any
National Securities Exchange on which such Limited Partner Interests are
listed. The Notice of Election to Purchase shall specify the Purchase Date and
the price (determined in accordance with Section 15.1(a)) at which Limited
Partner Interests will be purchased and state that the General Partner, its
Affiliate or the Partnership, as the case may be, elects to purchase such



Limited Partner Interests, upon surrender of Certificates representing such
Limited Partner Interests, in the case of Limited Partner Interests evidenced
by Certificates, or instructions agreeing to such redemption in exchange for
payment, at such office or offices of the Transfer Agent or exchange agent as
the Transfer Agent or exchange agent may specify, or as may be required by any
National Securities Exchange on which such Limited Partner Interests are
listed. Any such Notice of Election to Purchase mailed to a Record Holder of
Limited Partner Interests at his address as reflected in the Partnership
Register shall be conclusively presumed to have been given regardless of
whether the owner receives such notice. On or prior to the Purchase Date, the
General Partner, its Affiliate or the Partnership, as the case may be, shall
deposit with the Transfer Agent or exchange agent cash in an amount sufficient
to pay the aggregate purchase price of all of such Limited Partner Interests
to be purchased in accordance with this Section 15.1. If the Notice of
Election to Purchase shall have been duly given as aforesaid at least 10 days
prior to the Purchase Date, and if on or prior to the Purchase Date the
deposit described in the preceding sentence has been made for the benefit of
the holders of Limited Partner Interests subject to purchase as provided
herein, then from and after the Purchase Date, notwithstanding that any
Certificate or redemption instructions shall not have been surrendered for
purchase or provided, respectively, all rights of the holders of such Limited
Partner Interests (including any rights pursuant to Article IV, Article V,
Article VI, and Article XII) shall thereupon cease, except the right to
receive the purchase price (determined in accordance with Section 15.1(a)) for
Limited Partner Interests therefor, without interest, upon surrender to the
Transfer Agent or exchange agent of the Certificates representing such Limited
Partner Interests, in the case of Limited Partner Interests evidenced by
Certificates, or instructions agreeing to such redemption, and such Limited
Partner Interests shall thereupon be deemed to be transferred to the General
Partner, its Affiliate or the Partnership, as the case may be, on the
Partnership Register, and the General Partner or any Affiliate of the General
Partner, or the Partnership, as the case may be, shall be deemed to be the
Record Holder of all such Limited Partner Interests from and after the
Purchase Date and shall have all rights as the Record Holder of such Limited
Partner Interests (including all rights as owner of such Limited Partner
Interests pursuant to Article IV, Article V, Article VI and Article XII).

(c) In the case of Limited Partner Interests evidenced by Certificates, at any
time from and after the Purchase Date, a holder of an Outstanding Limited
Partner Interest subject to purchase as provided in this Section 15.1 may
surrender his Certificate evidencing such Limited Partner Interest to the
Transfer Agent or exchange agent in exchange for payment of the amount
described in Section 15.1(a) therefor, without interest thereon, in accordance
with procedures set forth by the General Partner.

ARTICLE XVI

GENERAL PROVISIONS

Section 16.1 Addresses and Notices; Written Communications.

(a) Any notice, demand, request, report or proxy materials required or

sent by first class United States mail or by other means of written
communication to the Partner at the address described below. Except



as otherwise provided herein, any notice, payment or report to be given or
made to a Partner hereunder shall be deemed conclusively to have been given or
made, and the obligation to give such notice or report or to make such payment
shall be deemed conclusively to have been fully satisfied, upon sending of
such notice, payment or report to the Record Holder of such Partnership
Interests at his address as shown in the Partnership Register, regardless of
any claim of any Person who may have an interest in such Partnership Interests
by reason of any assignment or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
(i) a Partner shall consent to receiving notices, demands, requests, reports
or proxy materials via electronic mail or by the Internet or (ii) the rules of
the Commission shall permit any report or proxy materials to be delivered
electronically or made available via the Internet, any such notice, demand,
request, report or proxy materials shall be deemed given or made when
delivered or made available via such mode of delivery. An affidavit or
certificate of making of any notice, payment or report in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 16.1 executed by the General Partner, the Transfer
Agent or the mailing organization shall be prima facie evidence of the giving
or making of such notice, payment or report. If any notice, payment or report
addressed to a Record Holder at the address of such Record Holder appearing in
the Partnership Register is returned by the United States Postal Service
marked to indicate that the United States Postal Service is unable to deliver
it, such notice, payment or report and any subsequent notices, payments and
reports shall be deemed to have been duly given or made without further
mailing (until such time as such Record Holder or another Person notifies the
Transfer Agent or the Partnership of a change in his address) if they are
available for the Partner at the principal office of the Partnership for a
period of one year from the date of the giving or making of such notice,
payment or report to the other Partners. Any notice to the Partnership shall
be deemed given if received by the General Partner at the principal office of
the Partnership designated pursuant to Section 2.3. The General Partner may
rely and shall be protected in relying on any notice or other document from a
Partner or other Person if believed by it to be genuine.

(b) The terms "in writing", "written communications," "written notice" and
words of similar import shall be deemed satisfied under this Agreement by use
of e-mail and other forms of electronic communication.

documents, provide all information and take or refrain from taking action as
may be necessary or appropriate to achieve the purposes of this Agreement.

Section 16.3 Binding Effect. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the parties hereto and their heirs, executors, administrators,
successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns.

Section 16.4 Integration. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement
among the parties hereto pertaining to the subject matter hereof and
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings pertaining thereto.

Section 16.5 Creditors. None of the provisions of this Agreement shall be for
the benefit of, or shall be enforceable by, any creditor of the Partnership.



Section 16.6 Waiver. No failure by any party to insist upon the strict
performance of any covenant, duty, agreement or condition of this Agreement or
to exercise any right or remedy consequent upon a breach thereof shall
constitute waiver of any such breach of any other covenant, duty, agreement or
condition.

Section 16.7 Third-Party Beneficiaries. Each Partner agrees that (a) any
Indemnitee shall be entitled to assert rights and remedies hereunder as a
third-party beneficiary hereto with respect to those provisions of this
Agreement affording a right, benefit or privilege to such Indemnitee and (b)
any Unrestricted Person shall be entitled to assert rights and remedies
hereunder as a third-party beneficiary hereto with respect to those provisions
of this Agreement affording a right, benefit or privilege to such Unrestricted
Person.

of which together shall constitute an agreement binding on all the parties
hereto, notwithstanding that all such parties are not signatories to the
original or the same counterpart. Each party shall become bound by this
Agreement immediately upon affixing its signature hereto or, in the case of a
Person acquiring a Limited Partner Interest, pursuant to Section 10.1(a) or
(b) without execution hereof.

Section 16.9 Applicable Law; Forum; Venue and Jurisdiction; Waiver of Trial by
Jury.

(a) This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the
laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the principles of conflicts
of law.

(b) Each of the Partners and each Person or Group holding any beneficial
interest in the Partnership (whether through a broker, dealer, bank, trust
company or clearing corporation or an agent of any of the foregoing or
otherwise):

(i) irrevocably agrees that any claims, suits, actions or proceedings (A)
arising out of or relating in any way to this Agreement (including any claims,
suits or actions to interpret, apply or enforce the provisions of this
Agreement or the duties, obligations or liabilities among Partners or of
Partners to the Partnership, or the rights or powers of, or restrictions on,
the Partners or the Partnership), (B) brought in a derivative manner on behalf
of the Partnership, (C) asserting a claim of breach of a duty owed by any
director, officer, or other employee of the Partnership or the General
Partner, or owed by the General Partner, to the Partnership or the Partners,
(D) asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware Act or
(E) asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall be
exclusively brought in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, in each
case regardless of whether such claims, suits, actions or proceedings sound in
contract, tort, fraud or otherwise, are based on common law, statutory,
equitable, legal or other grounds, or are derivative or direct claims;

(ii) irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware in connection with any such claim, suit,
action or proceeding;

of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or of any other court to
which proceedings in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware may be
appealed, (B) such claim, suit, action or proceeding is brought in an
inconvenient forum, or (C) the venue of such claim, suit, action or proceeding
is improper;

(iv) expressly waives any requirement for the posting of a bond by a party
bringing such claim, suit, action or proceeding; and

(v) consents to process being served in any such claim, suit, action or
proceeding by mailing, certified mail, return receipt requested, a copy
thereof to such party at the address in effect for notices hereunder, and
agrees that such services shall constitute good and sufficient service of
process and notice thereof; provided, nothing in clause (v) hereof shall
affect or limit any right to serve process in any other manner permitted by
law.

Section 16.10 Invalidity of Provisions. If any provision or part of a
provision of this Agreement is or becomes for any reason, invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality and enforceability of the
remaining provisions and/or parts thereof contained herein shall not be
affected thereby and this Agreement shall, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, be reformed and construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provision, or part of a provision, had never been contained herein, and such
provisions and/or part shall be reformed so that it would be valid, legal and
enforceable to the maximum extent possible.

Section 16.11 Consent of Partners. Each Partner hereby expressly consents and
agrees that, whenever in this Agreement it is specified that an action may be
taken upon the affirmative vote or consent of less than all of the Partners,
such action may be so taken upon the concurrence of less than all of the
Partners and each Partner shall be bound by the results of such action.

Section 16.12 Facsimile and Email Signatures. The use of facsimile signatures
and signatures delivered by email in portable document format (.pdf) affixed

Representing Limited Partner Interests in 
MPLX LP

No. Common Units

In accordance with Section 4.1 of the Second Amended and Restated Agreement of
Limited Partnership of MPLX LP, as amended, supplemented or restated from time
to time (the "Partnership Agreement"), MPLX LP, a Delaware limited partnership
(the "Partnership"), hereby certifies that (the "Holder") is the registered
owner of Common Units representing limited partner interests in the
Partnership (the "Common Units") transferable on the books of the Partnership,
in person or by duly authorized attorney, upon surrender of this Certificate

are issued and shall in all respects be subject to the terms and provisions
of, the Partnership Agreement. Copies of the Partnership Agreement are on file

Partnership at, the principal office of the Partnership located at 200 E.
Hardin Street, Findlay, Ohio 45840. Capitalized terms used herein but not
defined shall have the meanings given them in the Partnership Agreement.

THE HOLDER OF THIS SECURITY ACKNOWLEDGES FOR THE BENEFIT OF MPLX LP THAT THIS

COMMISSION, ANY STATE SECURITIES COMMISSION OR ANY OTHER GOVERNMENTAL
AUTHORITY WITH JURISDICTION OVER SUCH TRANSFER, (B) TERMINATE THE EXISTENCE OR
QUALIFICATION OF MPLX LP UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, OR (C) CAUSE
MPLX LP TO BE TREATED AS AN ASSOCIATION TAXABLE AS A CORPORATION OR OTHERWISE

ALREADY SO TREATED OR TAXED). THE GENERAL PARTNER OF MPLX LP MAY IMPOSE

SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS ON ITS TRANSFER PROVIDED IN THE PARTNERSHIP
AGREEMENT. COPIES OF SUCH AGREEMENT MAY BE OBTAINED AT NO COST BY WRITTEN

ARTICLE II.

REGISTRATION RIGHTS

Section 2.01 Shelf Registration.

(a) Shelf Registration. The Partnership shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to (i) prepare and file an initial registration statement under the
Securities Act to permit the resale of Registrable Securities from time to
time as permitted by Rule 415 (or any similar provision adopted by the
Commission then in effect) of the Securities Act (a "Registration Statement")
and (ii) cause such initial Registration Statement to become effective no
later than the third anniversary of the date hereof (the "Target Effective
Date"). The Partnership will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
such initial Registration Statement filed pursuant to this Section 2.01(a) to
be continuously effective under the Securities Act, with respect to any
Holder, until the earliest to occur of the following: (A) the date on which
there are no longer any Registrable Securities outstanding and (B) the third
anniversary of the date on which all Series A Preferred Units have been
converted into Common Units pursuant to Article V of the Partnership Agreement
(in each case of clause (A) or (B) the "Effectiveness Period"). A Registration
Statement filed pursuant to this Section 2.01(a) shall be on such appropriate
registration form of the Commission as shall be selected by the Partnership;
provided that, if the Partnership is then eligible, it shall file such
Registration Statement on Form S-3. A Registration Statement when declared
effective (including the documents incorporated therein by reference) will
comply as to form in all material respects with all applicable requirements of
the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and will not contain an untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading
(and, in the case of any prospectus contained in such Registration Statement,
in the light of the circumstances under which a statement is made). As soon as
practicable following the date that a Registration Statement becomes
effective, but in any event within three Business Days of such date, the
Partnership shall provide the Holders with written notice of the effectiveness
of such Registration Statement. The Partnership shall not be obligated to have
more than one effective Registration Statement at any given time pursuant to
this Section 2.01.

(b) Failure to Become Effective. If a Registration Statement required by
Section 2.01(a) does not become or is not declared effective by the Target
Effective Date, then each Holder shall be entitled to a payment (with respect
to each of the Holder's Registrable Securities which are included in such
Registration Statement), as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, of (i)
for each non-overlapping 30-day period for the first 60 days following the
Target Effective Date, an amount equal to 0.25% of the Liquidated Damages
Multiplier, and (ii) for each non-overlapping 30-day period beginning on the
61st day following the Target Effective Date, an amount equal to the amount
set forth in clause (i) plus an additional 0.25% of the Liquidated Damages
Multiplier for each subsequent 60 days (i.e., 0.5% for 61-120 days, 0.75% for
121-180 days, and 1.0% thereafter), up to a maximum amount equal to 1.0% of
the Liquidated Damages Multiplier per non-overlapping 30-day period (the
"Liquidated Damages"), until such time as such Registration Statement is
declared or becomes effective or there are no longer any Registrable
Securities outstanding. The Liquidated Damages shall be 

payable within 10 Business Days after the end of each such 30-day period in
immediately available funds to the account or accounts specified by the
applicable Holders. Any amount of Liquidated Damages shall be prorated for any
period of less than 30 days accruing during any period for which a Holder is
entitled to Liquidated Damages hereunder.

(c) Waiver of Liquidated Damages. If the Partnership is unable to cause a
Registration Statement to become effective on or before the Target Effective
Date, then the Partnership may request a waiver of the Liquidated Damages,
which may be granted by the consent of the Holders of at least the Registrable
Securities Required Voting Percentage, in their sole discretion, and which
such waiver shall apply to all the Holders of Registrable Securities included
on such Registration Statement.

(d) Delay Rights. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
the Partnership may, upon written notice to any Selling Holder whose
Registrable Securities are included in a Registration Statement, suspend such
Selling Holder's use of any prospectus which is a part of such Registration
Statement (in which event the Selling Holder shall suspend sales of the
Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement) if (i) the
Partnership is pursuing an acquisition, merger, reorganization, disposition or
other similar transaction and the Partnership determines in good faith that
the Partnership's ability to pursue or consummate such a transaction would be
materially and adversely affected by any required disclosure of such
transaction in such Registration Statement or (ii) the Partnership has
experienced some other material non-public event, the disclosure of which at
such time, in the good faith judgment of the Partnership, would materially and
adversely affect the Partnership; provided, however, that in no event shall
the Selling Holders be suspended from selling Registrable Securities pursuant
to such Registration Statement for a period that exceeds an aggregate of 60
days in any 180-day period or 90 days in any 365-day period. Upon disclosure
of such information or the termination of the condition described above, the
Partnership shall provide prompt notice to the Selling Holders whose
Registrable Securities are included in such Registration Statement, and shall
promptly terminate any suspension of sales it has put into effect and shall
take such other actions necessary or appropriate to permit registered sales of
Registrable Securities as contemplated in this Agreement. For the avoidance of
doubt, the provisions of this Section 2.01(d) shall apply to any Underwritten
Offering undertaken pursuant to Section 2.03.

Section 2.02 Piggyback Registration.

(a) Participation. If at any time the Partnership proposes to file (i) a
Registration Statement (other than a Registration Statement contemplated by
Section 2.01(a)) on behalf of any other Holder who has registration rights
related to an Underwritten Offering undertaken pursuant to Section 2.03 (the
"Other Holder"), or (ii) following the Series A Conversion Date, a prospectus
supplement relating to the sale of Common Units by any Other Holders to an
effective "automatic" registration statement, so long as the Partnership is a
WKSI at such time or, whether or not the Partnership is a WKSI, so long as the
Common Unit Registrable Securities were previously included in the underlying
shelf Registration Statement or are included on an effective Registration
Statement, or in any case in which Holders may participate in such offering
without the filing of a post-effective amendment, in each case, for the sale
of Common Units by Other Holders in an Underwritten Offering undertaken
pursuant to Section 2.03, then the Partnership shall give not less than four
Business Days' notice (including, 

but not limited to, notification by electronic mail) (the "Piggyback Notice")
of such proposed Underwritten Offering to each Holder (together with its
Affiliates) owning Common Unit Registrable Securities and such Piggyback
Notice shall offer such Holder the opportunity to include in such Underwritten
Offering for Other Holders such number of Common Unit Registrable Securities
(the "Included Registrable Securities") as such Holder may request in writing
(a "Piggyback Registration"); provided, however, that the Partnership shall
not be required to offer such opportunity (A) to such Holders if the Holders,
together with their Affiliates, do not offer a minimum of $50 million of
Common Unit Registrable Securities, in the aggregate (determined by
multiplying the number of Common Unit Registrable Securities owned by the
average of the closing price on the NYSE for the Common Units for the 10
trading days preceding the date of such notice), or such lesser amount if it
constitutes the remaining holdings of the Holder and its Affiliates, or (B) to
such Holders if and to the extent that the Partnership has been advised by the
Managing Underwriter that the inclusion of Common Unit Registrable Securities
for sale for the benefit of such Holders will have an adverse effect on the
price, timing or distribution of the Common Units in such Underwritten
Offering, then the amount of Common Unit Registrable Securities to be offered
for the accounts of Holders shall be determined based on the provisions of
Section 2.02(b). Each Piggyback Notice shall be provided to Holders on a
Business Day pursuant to Section 3.01 and receipt of such notice shall be
confirmed and kept confidential by the Holders until either (x) such proposed
Underwritten Offering has been publicly announced by the Partnership or (y)
the Holders have received notice from the Partnership that such proposed
Underwritten Offering has been abandoned, which the Partnership shall provide
to the Holders reasonably promptly after the final decision to abandon a
proposed Underwritten Offering has been made. Each such Holder will have four
Business Days (or two Business Days in connection with any overnight or bought
Underwritten Offering) after such Piggyback Notice has been delivered to
request in writing to the Partnership the inclusion of Common Unit Registrable
Securities in the Underwritten Offering for Other Holders. If no request for
inclusion from a Holder is received by the Partnership within the specified
time, such Holder shall have no further right to participate in such
Underwritten Offering. If, at any time after giving written notice of the
Partnership's intention to undertake an Underwritten Offering for Other
Holders and prior to the pricing of such Underwritten Offering, such
Underwritten Offering is terminated or delayed pursuant to the provisions of
this Agreement, the Partnership may, at its election, give written notice of
such determination to the Selling Holders and, (1) in the case of a
termination of such Underwritten Offering, shall be relieved of its obligation
to sell any Included Registrable Securities in connection with such terminated
Underwritten Offering, and (2) in the case of a determination to delay such
Underwritten Offering, shall be permitted to delay offering any Included
Registrable Securities for the same period as the delay in the Underwritten
Offering. Any Selling Holder shall have the right to withdraw such Selling
Holder's request for inclusion of such Selling Holder's Common Unit
Registrable Securities in such Underwritten Offering by giving written notice
to the Partnership of such withdrawal at least one Business Day prior to the
time of pricing of such Underwritten Offering. Any Holder may deliver written
notice (a "Piggyback Opt-Out Notice") to the Partnership requesting that such
Holder not receive notice from the Partnership of any proposed Underwritten
Offering for Other Holders; provided, however, that such Holder may later
revoke any such Piggyback Opt-Out Notice in writing. Following receipt of a
Piggyback Opt-Out Notice from a Holder (unless subsequently revoked), the
Partnership shall not be required to deliver any notice to such Holder
pursuant to this Section 2.02(a) and such Holder shall no longer be entitled
to participate in 

Underwritten Offerings for Other Holders pursuant to this Section 2.02(a),
unless such Piggyback Opt-Out Notice is revoked by such Holder. The Holders
listed on Schedule B shall each be deemed to have delivered a Piggyback Opt-
Out Notice as of the date hereof.

(b) Priority of Piggyback Registration. If the Managing Underwriter or
Underwriters of any proposed Underwritten Offering for Other Holders advise
the Partnership that the total amount of Common Unit Registrable Securities
that Holders intend to include in such offering exceeds the number that can be
sold in such offering without being likely to have an adverse effect on the
price, timing or distribution of the Common Unit Registrable Securities
offered or the market for the Common Units, then the Partnership shall include
the number of Common Units that such Managing Underwriter or Underwriters
advise the Partnership can be sold without having such adverse effect, with
such number to be allocated (i) in the case of the Stonepeak Priority UW
Request, (A) first, to Stonepeak and to any other Holders who are exercising
piggyback rights pursuant to this Section 2.02 as designated by Stonepeak in
such amounts as are designated by Stonepeak, and (B) second, pro rata among
the Holders who are exercising piggyback rights pursuant to this Section 2.02;
and (ii) in all other cases, pro rata among the Holders who requested such
Underwritten Offering or are exercising piggyback rights pursuant to this
Section 2.02 (in each case, based, for each such Holder, on the percentage
derived by dividing (x) the number of Common Unit Registrable Securities
proposed to be sold by such Holder in such offering by (y) the aggregate
number of Common Unit Registrable Securities proposed to be sold by all
Holders in such offering).

Section 2.03 Underwritten Offering.

(a) S-3 Registration. In the event that Stonepeak or Magnetar elect to dispose
of Common Unit Registrable Securities under a Registration Statement pursuant
to an Underwritten Offering and reasonably expect gross proceeds of at least
$150 million from such Underwritten Offering (together with any Common Unit
Registrable Securities to be disposed of by a Selling Holder who has elected
to participate in such Underwritten Offering pursuant to Section 2.02), the
Partnership shall, at the request of such Selling Holder(s), enter into an
underwriting agreement in a form as is customary in Underwritten Offerings of
securities by the Partnership with the Managing Underwriter or Underwriters
selected by the Partnership, which shall include, among other provisions,
indemnities to the effect and to the extent provided in Section 2.08, and
shall take all such other reasonable actions as are requested by the Managing
Underwriter or Underwriters in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition
of such Common Unit Registrable Securities; provided, however, that the
Partnership shall have no obligation to facilitate or participate in,
including entering into any underwriting agreement for more than:

(i) four Underwritten Offerings at the request of Stonepeak, one of which
will, at the option of Stonepeak, be designated the "Stonepeak Priority UW
Request;" provided, that any Stonepeak Priority UW Request must be associated
with Stonepeak's reasonable expectation to effect an Underwritten Offering
with anticipated gross proceeds of at least $250 million,

(ii) one Underwritten Offering at the request of Magnetar; 

(iii) one Underwritten Offering in any 365-day period; provided, that,
notwithstanding the foregoing limitation of more than one Underwritten
Offering in any 365-day period, (A) if any Underwritten Offering is initiated
and Stonepeak does not include Common Unit Registrable Securities in such
Underwritten Offering or Stonepeak requests to include Common Unit Registrable
Securities in such Underwritten Offering and more than $100 million of such
Common Unit Registrable Securities based on the Unit Purchase Price are
excluded from such Underwritten Offering pursuant to Section 2.02(b)(ii),
Stonepeak shall be entitled to initiate the Stonepeak Priority UW Request, (B)
if any Underwritten Offering is initiated, Stonepeak includes Common Unit
Registrable Securities in such Underwritten Offering and not more than $100
million of such Common Unit Registrable Securities based on the Unit Purchase
Price are excluded from such Underwritten Offering pursuant to Section
2.02(b)(ii), Stonepeak shall be entitled to initiate the Stonepeak Priority UW
Request after 180 days of the completion of such Underwritten Offering and (C)
either Stonepeak or Magnetar may initiate an Underwritten Offering 180 days
after the completion of the Stonepeak Priority UW Request; and

(iv) five Underwritten Offerings pursuant to this Agreement;

provided, further, that if the Partnership, MPC or any of their respective
Affiliates is conducting or actively pursuing a securities offering of the
Partnership's Common Units with anticipated gross offering proceeds of at
least $150 million (other than in connection with any at-the-market offering
or similar continuous offering program), then the Partnership may suspend such
Selling Holder's right to require the Partnership to conduct an Underwritten
Offering on such Selling Holder's behalf pursuant to this Section 2.03;
provided, however, that the Partnership may only suspend such Selling Holder's
right to require the Partnership to conduct an Underwritten Offering pursuant
to this Section 2.03 once in any six-month period and in no event for a period
that exceeds an aggregate of 60 days in any 180-day period or 90 days in any
365-day period.

(b) General Procedures. In connection with any Underwritten Offering
contemplated by Section 2.03(a), the underwriting agreement into which each
Selling Holder and the Partnership shall enter shall contain such
representations, covenants, indemnities (subject to Section 2.08) and other
rights and obligations as are customary in Underwritten Offerings of
securities by the Partnership. No Selling Holder shall be required to make any
representations or warranties to or agreements with the Partnership or the
underwriters other than representations, warranties or agreements regarding
such Selling Holder's authority to enter into such underwriting agreement and
to sell, and its ownership of, the securities being registered on its behalf,
its intended method of distribution and any other representation required by
law. If any Selling Holder disapproves of the terms of an Underwritten
Offering contemplated by this Section 2.03, such Selling Holder may elect to
withdraw therefrom by notice to the Partnership and the Managing Underwriter;
provided, however, that such withdrawal must be made at least one Business Day
prior to the time of pricing of such Underwritten Offering to be effective;
provided, further, that in the event the Managing Underwriter or Underwriters
of any proposed Underwritten Offering advise the Partnership that the total
amount of Common Unit Registrable Securities that Holders intend to include in
such offering exceeds the number that can be sold in such offering without
being likely to have an adverse effect on the price, timing or distribution of
the Common Unit Registrable Securities offered or the market for the Common
Units, and the 

amount of Registrable Securities requested to be included in such Underwritten
Offering by the Holder that initiated such Underwritten Offering pursuant to
Section 2.03(a) (the "Initiating Holder") is reduced by 50% or more, the
Initiating Holder will have the right to withdraw from such Underwritten
Offering by delivering notice to the Partnership at least one Business Day
prior to the time of pricing of such Underwritten Offering, in which case the
Partnership will have no obligation to proceed with such Underwritten Offering
and such Underwritten Offering, whether or not completed, will not decrease
the number of Underwritten Offerings the Initiating Holder shall have the
right and option to request under this Section 2.03. No such withdrawal or
abandonment shall affect the Partnership's obligation to pay Registration
Expenses.

Section 2.04 Further Obligations. In connection with its obligations under
this Article II, the Partnership will:

(a) promptly prepare and file with the Commission such amendments and
supplements to a Registration Statement and the prospectus used in connection
therewith as may be necessary to keep such Registration Statement effective
for the Effectiveness Period and as may be necessary to comply with the
provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all
Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement;

(b) if a prospectus supplement will be used in connection with the marketing
of an Underwritten Offering under a Registration Statement and the Managing
Underwriter at any time shall notify the Partnership in writing that, in the
sole judgment of such Managing Underwriter, inclusion of detailed information
to be used in such prospectus supplement is of material importance to the
success of such Underwritten Offering, the Partnership shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to include such information in such prospectus
supplement;

(c) furnish to each Selling Holder (i) as far in advance as reasonably
practicable before filing a Registration Statement or any other registration
statement contemplated by this Agreement or any supplement or amendment
thereto, upon request, copies of reasonably complete drafts of all such
documents proposed to be filed (including exhibits and each document
incorporated by reference therein to the extent then required by the rules and
regulations of the Commission), and provide each such Selling Holder the
opportunity to object to any information pertaining to such Selling Holder and
its plan of distribution that is contained therein and, to the extent timely
received, make the corrections reasonably requested by such Selling Holder
with respect to such information prior to filing such Registration Statement
or such other registration statement and the prospectus included therein or
any supplement or amendment thereto, and (ii) such number of copies of such
Registration Statement or such other registration statement and the prospectus
included therein and any supplements and amendments thereto as such Persons
may reasonably request in order to facilitate the resale or other disposition
of the Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement or other
registration statement;

(d) if applicable, use its commercially reasonable efforts to promptly
register or qualify the Registrable Securities covered by any Registration
Statement or any other registration statement contemplated by this Agreement
under the securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as the Selling
Holders or, in the case of an Underwritten Offering, the Managing Underwriter,
shall reasonably request; provided, however, that the Partnership will not 

be required to qualify generally to transact business in any jurisdiction
where it is not then required to so qualify or to take any action that would
subject it to general service of process in any such jurisdiction where it is
not then so subject;

(e) promptly notify each Selling Holder, at any time when a prospectus
relating thereto is required to be delivered by any of them under the
Securities Act, of (i) the filing of a Registration Statement or any other
registration statement contemplated by this Agreement or any prospectus or
prospectus supplement to be used in connection therewith, or any amendment or
supplement thereto, and, with respect to a Registration Statement or any other
registration statement or any post-effective amendment thereto, when the same
has become effective; and (ii) the receipt of any written comments from the
Commission with respect to any filing referred to in clause (i) and any
written request by the Commission for amendments or supplements to any such
Registration Statement or any other registration statement or any prospectus
or prospectus supplement thereto;

(f) promptly notify each Selling Holder, at any time when a prospectus
relating thereto is required to be delivered by any of them under the
Securities Act, of (i) the happening of any event as a result of which the
prospectus or prospectus supplement contained in a Registration Statement or
any other registration statement contemplated by this Agreement, as then in
effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading (in the case of any prospectus contained
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which a statement is made);
(ii) the issuance or express threat of issuance by the Commission of any stop
order suspending the effectiveness of a Registration Statement or any other
registration statement contemplated by this Agreement, or the initiation of
any proceedings for that purpose; or (iii) the receipt by the Partnership of
any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of any
Registrable Securities for sale under the applicable securities or blue sky
laws of any jurisdiction. Following the provision of such notice, the
Partnership agrees to, as promptly as practicable, amend or supplement the
prospectus or prospectus supplement or take other appropriate action so that
the prospectus or prospectus supplement does not include an untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the
light of the circumstances then existing and to take such other action as is
reasonably necessary to remove a stop order, suspension, threat thereof or
proceedings related thereto;

(g) upon request and subject to appropriate confidentiality obligations,
furnish to each Selling Holder copies of any and all transmittal letters or
other correspondence with the Commission or any other governmental agency or
self-regulatory body or other body having jurisdiction (including any domestic
or foreign securities exchange) relating to such offering of Registrable
Securities;

(h) in the case of an Underwritten Offering, furnish, or use its reasonable
efforts to cause to be furnished, upon request, (i) an opinion of counsel for
the Partnership addressed to the underwriters, dated the date of the closing
under the applicable underwriting agreement and (ii) a "comfort letter"
addressed to the underwriters, dated the pricing date of such Underwritten
Offering and a letter of like kind dated the date of the closing under the
applicable underwriting agreement, in each case, signed by the independent
public accountants who have 

certified the Partnership's financial statements included or incorporated by
reference into the applicable registration statement, and each of the opinion
and the "comfort letter" shall be in customary form and covering substantially
the same matters with respect to such registration statement (and the
prospectus and any prospectus supplement) as have been customarily covered in
opinions of issuer's counsel and in accountants' letters delivered to the
underwriters in Underwritten Offerings of securities by the Partnership and
such other matters as such underwriters may reasonably request;

(i) otherwise use its commercially reasonable efforts to comply with all
applicable rules and regulations of the Commission;

(j) make available to the appropriate representatives of the Managing
Underwriter during normal business hours access to such information and
Partnership personnel as is reasonable and customary to enable such parties to
establish a due diligence defense under the Securities Act; provided, however,
that the Partnership need not disclose any non-public information to any such
representative unless and until such representative has entered into a
confidentiality agreement with the Partnership;

(k) use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause all Common Unit
Registrable Securities registered pursuant to this Agreement to be listed on
each securities exchange or nationally recognized quotation system on which
similar securities issued by the Partnership are then listed; provided,
however, that, for the avoidance of doubt, the Partnership shall have no
obligation to cause any Series A Preferred Unit Registrable Securities to be
listed on any securities exchange or nationally recognized quotation system;

(l) use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause Registrable Securities to
be registered with or approved by such other governmental agencies or
authorities as may be necessary by virtue of the business and operations of
the Partnership to enable the Selling Holders to consummate the disposition of
such Registrable Securities;

(m) provide a transfer agent, which may be the General Partner or one of its
Affiliates as provided in the Partnership Agreement, and registrar for all
Registrable Securities covered by any Registration Statement not later than
the Effective Date of such Registration Statement;

(n) enter into customary agreements and take such other actions as are
reasonably requested by the Selling Holders or the underwriters, if any, in
order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of Common Unit Registrable
Securities (including making appropriate officers of the General Partner
available to participate in customary marketing activities); provided,
however, that the officers of the General Partner shall not be required to
dedicate an unreasonably burdensome amount of time in connection with any
roadshow and related marketing activities for any Underwritten Offering;

(o) if reasonably requested by a Selling Holder, (i) incorporate in a
prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment such information as such
Selling Holder reasonably requests to be included therein relating to the sale
and distribution of Registrable Securities, including information with respect
to the number of Registrable Securities being offered or sold, 

the purchase price being paid therefor and any other terms of the offering of
the Registrable Securities to be sold in such offering; and (ii) make all
required filings of such prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment
after being notified of the matters to be incorporated in such prospectus
supplement or post-effective amendment;

(p) if reasonably required by the Partnership's transfer agent, the
Partnership shall promptly deliver any authorizations, certificates and
directions required by the transfer agent which authorize and direct the
transfer agent to transfer such Registrable Securities without legend upon
sale by the Holder of such Registrable Securities under the Registration
Statement; and

(q) if any Holder could reasonably be deemed to be an "underwriter," as
defined in Section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act, in connection with the
Registration Statement and any amendment or supplement thereof (a "Holder
Underwriter Registration Statement"), then the Partnership will reasonably
cooperate with such Holder in allowing such Holder to conduct customary
"underwriter's due diligence" with respect to the Partnership and satisfy its
obligations in respect thereof. In addition, at any Holder's request, the
Partnership will furnish to such Holder, on the date of the effectiveness of
the Holder Underwriter Registration Statement and thereafter from time to time
on such dates as such Holder may reasonably request (provided that such
request shall not be more frequently than on an annual basis unless such
Holder is offering Registrable Securities pursuant to a Holder Underwriter
Registration Statement), (i) a "comfort letter", dated such date, from the
Partnership's independent certified public accountants in form and substance
as has been customarily given by independent certified public accountants to
underwriters in Underwritten Offerings of securities by the Partnership,
addressed to such Holder, (ii) an opinion, dated as of such date, of counsel
representing the Partnership for purposes of the Holder Underwriter
Registration Statement, in form, scope and substance as has been customarily
given in Underwritten Offerings of securities by the Partnership, including
standard "10b-5" negative assurance for such offerings, addressed to such
Holder and (iii) a standard officer's certificate from the chief executive
officer or chief financial officer, or other officers serving such functions,
of the General Partner addressed to the Holder, as has been customarily given
by such officers in Underwritten Offerings of securities by the Partnership.
The Partnership will also use its reasonable efforts to provide legal counsel
to such Holder with an opportunity to review and comment upon any such Holder
Underwriter Registration Statement, and any amendments and supplements
thereto, prior to its filing with the Commission.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.04, the Partnership
will not name a Holder as an underwriter (as defined in Section 2(a)(11) of
the Securities Act) in any Registration Statement or Holder Underwriter
Registration Statement, as applicable, without such Holder's consent. If the
staff of the Commission requires the Partnership to name any Holder as an
underwriter (as defined in Section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act), and such
Holder does not consent thereto, then such Holder's Registrable Securities
shall not be included on the applicable Registration Statement, and the
Partnership shall have no further obligations hereunder with respect to
Registrable Securities held by such Holder, unless such Holder has not had an
opportunity to conduct customary underwriter's due diligence as set forth in
subsection (q) of this Section 2.04 with respect to the Partnership at the
time such Holder's consent is sought. 

Each Selling Holder, upon receipt of notice from the Partnership of the
happening of any event of the kind described in subsection (f) of this Section
2.04, shall forthwith discontinue offers and sales of the Registrable
Securities by means of a prospectus or prospectus supplement until such
Selling Holder's receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended
prospectus contemplated by subsection (f) of this Section 2.04 or until it is
advised in writing by the Partnership that the use of the prospectus may be
resumed and has received copies of any additional or supplemental filings
incorporated by reference in the prospectus, and, if so directed by the
Partnership, such Selling Holder will, or will request the Managing
Underwriter or Managing Underwriters, if any, to deliver to the Partnership
(at the Partnership's expense) all copies in their possession or control,
other than permanent file copies then in such Selling Holder's possession, of
the prospectus covering such Registrable Securities current at the time of
receipt of such notice.

Section 2.05 Cooperation by Holders. The Partnership shall have no obligation
to include Registrable Securities of a Holder in a Registration Statement or
in an Underwritten Offering pursuant to Section 2.03(a) if such Holder has
failed to timely furnish such information that the Partnership determines,
after consultation with its counsel, is reasonably required in order for any
registration statement or prospectus supplement, as applicable, to comply with
the Securities Act.

Section 2.06 Restrictions on Public Sale by Holders of Registrable Securities.
Each Holder of Common Unit Registrable Securities who is participating in an
Underwritten Offering and is included in a Registration Statement agrees to
enter into a customary letter agreement with underwriters providing that such
Holder will not effect any public sale or distribution of Common Unit
Registrable Securities during the 45 calendar day period beginning on the date
of a prospectus or prospectus supplement filed with the Commission with
respect to the pricing of such Underwritten Offering; provided, however, that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the duration of the foregoing restrictions
shall be no longer than the duration of the shortest restriction imposed by
the underwriters on the Partnership or the officers, directors or any other
Affiliate of the Partnership on whom a restriction is imposed and (ii) the
restrictions set forth in this Section 2.06 shall not apply to any Common Unit
Registrable Securities that are included in such Underwritten Offering by such
Holder.

Section 2.07 Expenses.

(a) Certain Definitions. "Registration Expenses" shall not include Selling
Expenses but otherwise means all expenses incident to the Partnership's
performance under or compliance with this Agreement to effect the registration
of Registrable Securities on a Registration Statement pursuant to Section
2.01, a Piggyback Registration pursuant to Section 2.02, or an Underwritten
Offering pursuant to Section 2.03, and the disposition of such Registrable
Securities, including all registration, filing, securities exchange listing
and NYSE fees, all registration, filing, qualification and other fees and
expenses of complying with securities or blue sky laws, fees of the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority, fees of transfer agents and registrars, all
word processing, duplicating and printing expenses, and the fees and
disbursements of counsel and independent public accountants for the
Partnership, including the expenses of any special audits or "cold comfort"
letters required by or incident to such performance and compliance. "Selling
Expenses" means all underwriting fees, discounts and 

selling commissions and transfer taxes allocable to the sale of the
Registrable Securities, plus any costs or expenses related to any roadshows
conducted in connection with the marketing of any Underwritten Offering.

(b) Expenses. The Partnership will pay all reasonable Registration Expenses,
as determined in good faith, in connection with a shelf Registration, a
Piggyback Registration or an Underwritten Offering, whether or not any sale is
made pursuant to such shelf Registration, Piggyback Registration or
Underwritten Offering. Each Selling Holder shall pay its pro rata share of all
Selling Expenses in connection with any sale of its Registrable Securities
hereunder. In addition, except as otherwise provided in Section 2.08, the
Partnership shall not be responsible for professional fees (including legal
fees) incurred by Holders in connection with the exercise of such Holders'
rights hereunder.

Section 2.08 Indemnification.

(a) By the Partnership. In the event of a registration of any Registrable
Securities under the Securities Act pursuant to this Agreement, the
Partnership will indemnify and hold harmless each Selling Holder thereunder,
its directors, officers, managers, partners, employees and agents and each
Person, if any, who controls such Selling Holder within the meaning of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and its directors, officers, managers,
partners, employees or agents (collectively, the "Selling Holder Indemnified
Persons"), against any losses, claims, damages, expenses or liabilities
(including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) (collectively, "Losses"),
joint or several, to which such Selling Holder Indemnified Person may become
subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as
such Losses (or actions or proceedings, whether commenced or threatened, in
respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement of any material fact (in the case of any prospectus,
in light of the circumstances under which such statement is made) contained in
(which, for the avoidance of doubt, includes documents incorporated by
reference in) the applicable Registration Statement or other registration
statement contemplated by this Agreement, any preliminary prospectus,
prospectus supplement or final prospectus contained therein, or any amendment
or supplement thereof, or any free writing prospectus relating thereto, or
arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state
therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein (in the case of a prospectus, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made) not misleading, and will reimburse each such
Selling Holder Indemnified Person for any legal or other expenses reasonably
incurred by them in connection with investigating, defending or resolving any
such Loss or actions or proceedings; provided, however, that the Partnership
will not be liable in any such case if and to the extent that any such Loss
arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement
or omission or alleged omission so made in conformity with information
furnished by such Selling Holder Indemnified Person in writing specifically
for use in the applicable Registration Statement or other registration
statement, or prospectus supplement, as applicable. Such indemnity shall
remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on
behalf of such Selling Holder Indemnified Person, and shall survive the
transfer of such securities by such Selling Holder.

(b) By Each Selling Holder. Each Selling Holder agrees severally and not
jointly to indemnify and hold harmless the Partnership, the General Partner
and the General 

Partner's directors, officers, employees and agents and each Person, who,
directly or indirectly, controls the Partnership within the meaning of the
Securities Act or of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing
indemnity from the Partnership to the Selling Holders, but only with respect
to information regarding such Selling Holder furnished in writing by or on
behalf of such Selling Holder expressly for inclusion in a Registration
Statement or any other registration statement contemplated by this Agreement,
any preliminary prospectus, prospectus supplement or final prospectus
contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto or any free writing
prospectus relating thereto; provided, however, that the liability of each
Selling Holder shall not be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the
proceeds (net of any Selling Expenses) received by such Selling Holder from
the sale of the Registrable Securities giving rise to such indemnification.

(c) Notice. Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party hereunder of notice
of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in
respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party hereunder, notify
the indemnifying party in writing thereof, but the omission to so notify the
indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to
any indemnified party other than under this Section 2.08(c), except to the
extent that the indemnifying party is materially prejudiced by such failure.
In any action brought against any indemnified party, it shall notify the
indemnifying party of the commencement thereof. The indemnifying party shall
be entitled to participate in and, to the extent it shall wish, to assume and
undertake the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such
indemnified party and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such
indemnified party of its election so to assume and undertake the defense
thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party
under this Section 2.08 for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by such
indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable
costs of investigation and of liaison with counsel so selected; provided,
however, that, (i) if the indemnifying party has failed to assume the defense
or employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party or (ii) if
the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the
indemnifying party and counsel to the indemnified party shall have concluded
that there may be reasonable defenses available to the indemnified party that
are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party,
or if the interests of the indemnified party reasonably may be deemed to
conflict with the interests of the indemnifying party, then the indemnified
party shall have the right to select a separate counsel and to assume such
legal defense and otherwise to participate in the defense of such action, with
the reasonable expenses and fees of such separate counsel and other reasonable
expenses related to such participation to be reimbursed by the indemnifying
party as incurred. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no
indemnifying party shall settle any action brought against any indemnified
party with respect to which such indemnified party may be entitled to
indemnification hereunder without the consent of the indemnified party, unless
the settlement thereof imposes no liability or obligation on, includes a
complete and unconditional release from liability of, and does not contain any
admission of wrongdoing by, the indemnified party.

(d) Contribution. If the indemnification provided for in this Section 2.08 is
held by a court or government agency of competent jurisdiction to be
unavailable to any indemnified party or is insufficient to hold them harmless
in respect of any Losses, then each such indemnifying party, in lieu of
indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or
payable by such indemnified party as a result of such Losses in such
proportion 

as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party, on
the one hand, and of the indemnified party, on the other hand, in connection
with the statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses, as well as any
other relevant equitable considerations; provided, however, that in no event
shall any Selling Holder be required to contribute an aggregate amount in
excess of the dollar amount of proceeds (net of Selling Expenses) received by
such Selling Holder from the sale of Registrable Securities giving rise to
such indemnification. The relative fault of the indemnifying party, on the one
hand, and the indemnified party, on the other, shall be determined by
reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a
material fact has been made by, or relates to, information supplied by such
party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The parties
hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant
to this paragraph were to be determined by pro rata allocation or by any other
method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable
considerations referred to herein. The amount paid by an indemnified party as
a result of the Losses referred to in the first sentence of this paragraph
shall be deemed to include any legal and other expenses reasonably incurred by
such indemnified party in connection with investigating, defending or
resolving any Loss that is the subject of this paragraph. No person guilty of
fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the
Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who is not
guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

(e) Other Indemnification. The provisions of this Section 2.08 shall be in
addition to any other rights to indemnification or contribution that an
indemnified party may have pursuant to law, equity, contract or otherwise.

Section 2.09 Rule 144 Reporting. With a view to making available the benefits
of certain rules and regulations of the Commission that may permit the resale
of the Registrable Securities without registration, the Partnership agrees to
use its commercially reasonable efforts to:

(a) make and keep public information regarding the Partnership available, as
those terms are understood and defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act
(or any similar provision then in effect), at all times from and after the
date hereof;

(b) file with the Commission in a timely manner all reports and other
documents required of the Partnership under the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act at all times from and after the date hereof; and

(c) so long as a Holder owns any Registrable Securities, furnish (i) to the
extent accurate, forthwith upon request, a written statement of the
Partnership that it has complied with the reporting requirements of Rule 144
under the Securities Act (or any similar provision then in effect) and (ii)
unless otherwise available via the Commission's EDGAR filing system, to such
Holder forthwith upon request a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly
report of the Partnership, and such other reports and documents so filed as
such Holder may reasonably request in availing itself of any rule or
regulation of the Commission allowing such Holder to sell any such securities
without registration. 

Section 2.10 Transfer or Assignment of Registration Rights. The rights to
cause the Partnership to register Registrable Securities under this Article II
may be transferred or assigned by each Holder to one or more transferees or
assignees of Registrable Securities; provided, however, that (a) unless any
such transferee or assignee is an Affiliate of, and after such transfer or
assignment continues to be an Affiliate of, such Holder, the amount of
Registrable Securities transferred or assigned to such transferee or assignee
shall represent at least $50 million of Registrable Securities, calculated on
the basis of the Purchased Unit Price, (b) the Partnership is given written
notice prior to any said transfer or assignment, stating the name and address
of each such transferee or assignee and identifying the securities with
respect to which such registration rights are being transferred or assigned
and (c) each such transferee or assignee assumes in writing responsibility for
its portion of the obligations of such transferring Holder under this
Agreement.

Section 2.11 Limitation on Subsequent Registration Rights. From and after the
date hereof, the Partnership shall not, without the prior written consent of
the Holders of at least the Registrable Securities Required Voting Percentage,
enter into any agreement with any current or future holder of any securities
of the Partnership that would allow such current or future holder to require
the Partnership to include securities in any registration statement filed by
the Partnership for Other Holders on a basis other than pari passu with, or
expressly subordinate to, the piggyback rights of the Holders of Common Unit
Registrable Securities hereunder.

Section 2.12 Limitation on Obligations for Series A Preferred Unit Registrable
Securities. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
nothing contained herein shall be construed to require the Partnership to (a)
conduct an underwritten offering for the public sale, resale or any other
disposition of Series A Preferred Unit Registrable Securities, (b) otherwise
assist in the public resale of any Series A Preferred Unit Registrable

Partnership, each of the Purchasers and their respective successors and
permitted assigns, including subsequent Holders of Registrable Securities to
the extent permitted herein. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement,
this Agreement shall not be construed so as to confer any right or benefit
upon any Person other than the parties to this Agreement and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

Section 3.03 Assignment of Rights. Except as provided in Section 2.10, neither
this Agreement nor any of the rights, benefits or obligations hereunder may be
assigned or transferred, by operation of law or otherwise, by any party hereto
without the prior written consent of the other party.

Section 3.04 Recapitalization, Exchanges, Etc. Affecting Units. The provisions
of this Agreement shall apply to the full extent set forth herein with respect
to any and all units of 

the Partnership or any successor or assign of the Partnership (whether by
merger, acquisition, consolidation, reorganization, sale of assets or
otherwise) that may be issued in respect of, in exchange for or in
substitution of, the Registrable Securities, and shall be appropriately
adjusted for combinations, unit splits, recapitalizations, pro rata
distributions of units and the like occurring after the date of this
Agreement.

Section 3.05 Aggregation of Registrable Securities. All Registrable Securities
held or acquired by Persons who are Affiliates of one another shall be
aggregated together for the purpose of determining the availability of any
rights under this Agreement.

Section 3.06 Specific Performance. Damages in the event of breach of this
Agreement by a party hereto may be difficult, if not impossible, to ascertain,
and it is therefore agreed that each such Person, in addition to and without
limiting any other remedy or right it may have, will have the right to seek an
injunction or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction,
enjoining any such breach, and enforcing specifically the terms and provisions
hereof, and each of the parties hereto hereby waives any and all defenses it
may have on the ground of lack of jurisdiction or competence of the court to
grant such an injunction or other equitable relief. The existence of this
right will not preclude any such Person from pursuing any other rights and
remedies at law or in equity that such Person may have.

Section 3.07 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of
which counterparts, when so executed and delivered, shall be deemed to be an
original and all of which counterparts, taken together, shall constitute but
one and the same agreement.

Section 3.08 Governing Law, Submission to Jurisdiction. This Agreement, and
all claims or causes of action (whether in contract or tort) that may be based
upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution
or performance of this Agreement (including any claim or cause of action based
upon, arising out of or related to any representation or warranty made in or
in connection with this Agreement), will be construed in accordance with and
governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to principles of
conflicts of laws. Any action against any party relating to the foregoing
shall be brought in any federal or state court of competent jurisdiction
located within the State of Delaware, and the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or state
court located within the State of Delaware over any such action. The parties
hereby irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
any objection which they may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of
any such dispute brought in such court or any defense of inconvenient forum
for the maintenance of such dispute. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a
judgment in any such dispute may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on
the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.

Section 3.09 Waiver of Jury Trial. THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT EACH HEREBY
WAIVE, AND AGREE TO CAUSE THEIR AFFILIATES TO WAIVE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR
CAUSE OF ACTION (A) ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR (B) IN ANY WAY CONNECTED
WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES HERETO IN RESPECT
OF THIS 

AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED HERETO, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW
EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY OR
OTHERWISE. THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT EACH HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT
ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT
TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY AND THAT THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY FILE AN
ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OF A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN
EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY.

Section 3.10 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Purchase Agreement and the
other agreements and documents referred to herein and therein are intended by
the parties as a final expression of their agreement and intended to be a
complete and exclusive statement of the agreement and understanding of the
parties hereto in respect of the subject matter contained herein and therein.
There are no restrictions, promises, warranties or undertakings, other than
those set forth or referred to herein or in the Purchase Agreement with
respect to the rights granted by the Partnership or any of its Affiliates or
the Purchasers or any of their respective Affiliates set forth herein or
therein. This Agreement, the Purchase Agreement and the other agreements and
documents referred to herein or therein supersede all prior agreements and
understandings between the parties with respect to such subject matter.

Section 3.11 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended only by means of a
written amendment signed by the Partnership and the Holders of at least the
Registrable Securities Required Voting Percentage; provided, however, that no
such amendment shall adversely affect the rights of any Holder hereunder
without the consent of such Holder. Any amendment, supplement or modification
of or to any provision of this Agreement, any waiver of any provision of this
Agreement, and any consent to any departure by the Partnership or any Holder
from the terms of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective only in
the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which such amendment,
supplement, modification, waiver or consent has been made or given.

Section 3.12 No Presumption. This Agreement has been reviewed and negotiated
by sophisticated parties with access to legal counsel and shall not be
construed against the drafter.

Section 3.13 Obligations Limited to Parties to Agreement. Each of the parties
hereto covenants, agrees and acknowledges that, other than as set forth
herein, no Person other than the Purchasers, the Holders, their respective
permitted assignees and the Partnership shall have any obligation hereunder
and that, notwithstanding that one or more of such Persons may be a
corporation, partnership or limited liability company, no recourse under this
Agreement or under any documents or instruments delivered in connection
herewith shall be had against any former, current or future director, officer,
employee, agent, general or limited partner, manager, member, stockholder or
Affiliate of any of such Persons or their respective permitted assignees, or
any former, current or future director, officer, employee, agent, general or
limited partner, manager, member, stockholder or Affiliate of any of the
foregoing, whether by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or
equitable proceeding, or by virtue of any applicable law, it being expressly
agreed and acknowledged that no personal liability whatsoever shall attach to,
be imposed on or otherwise be incurred by any former, current or future
director, officer, employee, 

agent, general or limited partner, manager, member, stockholder or Affiliate
of any of such Persons or any of their respective assignees, or any former,
current or future director, officer, employee, agent, general or limited
partner, manager, member, stockholder or Affiliate of any of the foregoing, as
such, for any obligations of such Persons or their respective permitted
assignees under this Agreement or any documents or instruments delivered in
connection herewith or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of
such obligation or its creation, except, in each case, for any assignee of any
Purchaser or a Selling Holder hereunder.

Section 3.14 Interpretation. Article, Section and Schedule references in this
Agreement are references to the corresponding Article, Section or Schedule to
this Agreement, unless otherwise specified. All Schedules to this Agreement
are hereby incorporated and made a part hereof as if set forth in full herein
and are an integral part of this Agreement. All references to instruments,
documents, contracts and agreements are references to such instruments,
documents, contracts and agreements as the same may be amended, supplemented
and otherwise modified from time to time, unless otherwise specified. The word
"including" shall mean "including but not limited to" and shall not be
construed to limit any general statement that it follows to the specific or
similar items or matters immediately following it. Whenever the Partnership
has an obligation under this Agreement, the expense of complying with that
obligation shall be an expense of the Partnership unless otherwise specified.
Any reference in this Agreement to "$" shall mean U.S. dollars. Whenever any
determination, consent or approval is to be made or given by a Purchaser, such
action shall be in such Holder's sole discretion, unless otherwise specified
in this Agreement. If any provision in this Agreement is held to be illegal,
invalid, not binding or unenforceable, (a) such provision shall be fully
severable and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such
illegal, invalid, not binding or unenforceable provision had never comprised a
part of this Agreement, and the remaining provisions shall remain in full
force and effect, and (b) the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest
extent possible. When calculating the period of time before which, within
which or following which any act is to be done or step taken pursuant to this
Agreement, the date that is the reference date in calculating such period
shall be excluded. If the last day of such period is a non-Business Day, the
period in question shall end on the next succeeding Business Day. Any words
imparting the singular number only shall include the plural and vice versa.
The words such as "herein," "hereinafter," "hereof' and "hereunder" refer to
this Agreement as a whole and not merely to a subdivision in which such words
appear unless the context otherwise requires. The provision of a Table of
Contents, the division of this Agreement into Articles, Sections and other
subdivisions and the insertion of headings are for convenience of reference
only and shall not affect or be utilized in construing or interpreting this
Agreement.
