collectively, the " _Transactions_ "), in accordance with the Minnesota

WHEREAS, (i) the Board of Directors of Parent has, upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth herein, approved this Agreement and (ii) Parent,
as the sole stockholder of Purchaser, has adopted and approved this Agreement;

ARTICLE I

 

THE OFFER AND THE MERGER

 

SECTION 1.01 _The Offer_.

 

(a) Provided that (i) this Agreement shall not have been terminated in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.01_, (ii) the Company is prepared (in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.02(b)_) to file the Schedule 14D-9 on the
same date as Purchaser commences the Offer and (iii) none of the events set
forth in clauses (c)(i) through (vi) of _Annex I_ shall have occurred and be
continuing, as promptly as practicable (and in any event within ten (10)
Business Days) after the Agreement Date, Purchaser shall commence, within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act, the Offer to purchase all the
outstanding Shares at the Offer Price, subject to: (A) there being validly
tendered in the Offer and not properly withdrawn prior to the Expiration
Date that number of Shares which, together with the number of Shares (if any)
then beneficially owned by Parent or Purchaser, in the aggregate, or with
respect to which Parent or Purchaser otherwise has, directly or indirectly,
sole voting power, represents at least one Share more than 50% of the Fully
Diluted Shares (excluding from the number of tendered Shares, but not from the
outstanding Shares, Shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures
that have not yet been delivered in settlement or satisfaction of such
guarantee) (collectively, the " _Minimum Condition_ "); and (B) the
satisfaction, or written waiver (where permitted by applicable Law) by Parent
or Purchaser, of the other conditions and requirements set forth in _Annex
I_.

(b) Subject to the satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the satisfaction,
or written waiver (where permitted by applicable Law) by Parent or Purchaser,
of the other conditions and requirements set forth in _Annex I_ , Purchaser
shall accept for payment and pay for all Shares validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer promptly after Purchaser is legally
permitted to do so under applicable Law in accordance with the Exchange Act.
The Offer Price payable in respect of each Share validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be paid net to the seller in
cash, without interest, subject to any withholding of Taxes required by
applicable Law in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.02(e)_.

 

(c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to
Purchase_ ") that describes the terms and conditions of the Offer in
accordance with applicable Law and this Agreement, including the Minimum
Condition and the other conditions and requirements set forth in _Annex I_.
Parent and Purchaser expressly reserve the right to waive (where permitted by
applicable Law), in their sole discretion, in whole or in part, any of the
conditions set forth in _Annex I_ , to increase the Offer Price or to make any
other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that unless otherwise contemplated by this

 



2  Agreement or as previously approved by the Company in writing, Purchaser
shall not (i) decrease the Offer Price, (ii) change the form of consideration
payable in the Offer, (iii) reduce the maximum number of Shares to be
purchased in the Offer, (iv) amend or waive the Minimum Condition, (v) amend
any of the other conditions and requirements to the Offer set forth in _Annex
I_ in a manner materially adverse to the holders of Shares or (vi) extend the
Expiration Date in a manner other than in accordance with this Agreement.

(d) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, unless extended in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Offer shall expire at 5:00
p.m. (New York City time) on the date that is twenty (20) Business Days (for
this purpose calculated in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under
the Exchange Act) following the commencement (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2
promulgated under the Exchange Act) of the Offer (the " _Initial Expiration
Date_ ") or, if the Initial Expiration Date has been extended in accordance
with this Agreement, the date on which the Offer has been so extended (the
Initial Expiration Date, or such later date to which the Initial Expiration
Date has been extended in accordance with this Agreement, the " _Expiration
Date_ ").

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, (i) Purchaser shall extend the Offer for any period or periods
required by (A) applicable Law, (B) applicable rules, regulations,
interpretations or positions of the SEC or its staff or (C) any of the rules
and regulations, including listing standards, of NASDAQ or any other United
States national securities exchange registered under the Exchange Act on which
the applicable common stock is then traded, (ii) in the event that any of the
conditions to the Offer set forth in _Annex I_ are not satisfied or, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, waived as of any then scheduled Expiration
Date, Purchaser may, in its sole discretion, extend the Offer for successive
extension periods of not more than twenty (20) Business Days each in order to
permit the satisfaction of the conditions to the Offer set forth in _Annex I_
and (iii) in the event that any of the conditions to the Offer set forth in 
_Annex I_ are not satisfied or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
waived as of any then scheduled Expiration Date and there has not been an
Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company may, in its sole discretion and by
written notice at least two (2) Business Days prior to such scheduled
Expiration Date, request that Purchaser extend the Offer for one period of ten
(10) Business Days, until all of the conditions to the Offer set forth in
_Annex I_ are satisfied or, to the extent permitted, validly waived;
_provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing clause (ii) of
this _Section_ __ _ 1.01(e)_, in no event shall Purchaser be required to
extend the Offer beyond the earlier to occur of (1) the date this Agreement
is terminated pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.01_ or (2) the Outside Date; and
_provided_ _,_ _further_ , that the foregoing clause (ii) of this  _Section_
__ _ 1.01(e)_ shall not be deemed to impair, limit or otherwise restrict in
any manner the right of Parent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.01_.

 

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if necessary to obtain sufficient Shares to
reach the Short Form Threshold, Purchaser shall provide for a "subsequent
offering period" in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act of not
more than twenty (20) Business Days in the aggregate; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if Purchaser exercises the Top Up Option pursuant to _Section_ __ _
1.04_, it shall not be required to provide for a "subsequent offering period."
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Offer, Purchaser
shall immediately accept for payment and pay for all Shares that are validly
tendered pursuant to the Offer during any such "subsequent offering period."
The Offer Documents will provide for the possibility of a "subsequent
offering period" in a manner consistent with the terms of this _Section_ __ _
1.01(f)_.

 



3 (g) Purchaser shall not terminate or withdraw the Offer prior to any scheduled
Expiration Date without the prior written consent of the Company, except if
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article_ __ _ VIII_. If this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article_ __ _ VIII_, Purchaser shall
promptly (and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours of such
termination), irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer. If the
Offer is terminated or withdrawn by Purchaser, or this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to  _Article_ __ _ VIII_ prior to the purchase of Shares in the
Offer, Purchaser shall promptly return and shall cause any depositary acting
on behalf of Purchaser to return, in accordance with applicable Law, all
tendered Shares to the registered holders thereof.

(h) As promptly as practicable on the date of the commencement of the Offer,
Parent and Purchaser shall file with the SEC, in accordance with Rule 14d-3
under the Exchange Act, a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect
to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto,
the " _Schedule TO_ "). The Schedule TO shall include, as exhibits, the Offer
to Purchase, a form of letter of transmittal, a form of summary advertisement
and other ancillary Offer documents and instruments, if any, in respect of the
Offer (collectively, together with any amendments and supplements thereto and
the Schedule TO, the " _Offer Documents_ "). Parent and Purchaser agree to
cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares, as and to
the extent required by the Exchange Act. Parent and Purchaser, on the one
hand, and the Company, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any
information provided by such Party for use in the Offer Documents, if and to
the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law, and Parent and Purchaser
agree to cause the Offer Documents, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC
and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent
required by the Exchange Act. The Company and its legal counsel shall be given
a reasonable opportunity to review the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents
before they are filed with the SEC, and Parent and Purchaser shall give
due consideration to the additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by
the Company and its legal counsel, in each case, so long as the Company Board
has not effected an Adverse Recommendation Change. In addition, so long as the
Company Board has not effected an Adverse Recommendation Change, Parent and
Purchaser shall provide the Company with (i) a copy of any written comments or
telephonic notice of any oral comments that may be received from the SEC or
its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after receipt thereof
and prior to responding thereto and (ii) a reasonable opportunity to provide
comments on that response (to which due consideration shall be given) and to
participate in such response, including by participating in any discussions
with the SEC.

(i) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Purchaser on a timely
basis the funds necessary to pay for any Shares that Purchaser becomes
obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer.

(j) Parent and Purchaser shall timely file with the Commissioner of Commerce
of the State of Minnesota any registration statement relating to the
Transactions required to be filed pursuant to Chapter 80B of the Minnesota
Statutes and shall disseminate to the holders of Shares via the Offer
Documents the information set forth in any such registration statement to the
extent and within the time period required by Chapter 80B of the Minnesota
Statutes.

 

(k) The Offer Price shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse
stock split), or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any
stock dividend or stock distribution occurring (or for which a record date is
established) after the Agreement Date and prior to the payment by Purchaser
for Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn in connection with the
Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that this sentence shall not be construed to
permit the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is
prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 



4 SECTION 1.02 _Company Actions_.

 

(a) The Company hereby approves of and consents to the Offer and consents to
the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the Company Board Recommendation, and
the Company shall not withdraw or modify such recommendation in any manner
adverse to Purchaser or Parent except as set forth in _Section_ __ _
6.03(e)_.

 

(b) On the date the Schedule TO is filed with the SEC, the Company shall, in a
manner that complies with Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act, file with the
SEC a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9
with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and
exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule 14D_ _-9_ ") that shall reflect the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and, subject to  _Section_ __ _ 6.03(e)_,
contain the Company Board Recommendation. The Company agrees to cause the
Schedule 14D-9 to be disseminated to holders of Shares, as and to the extent
required by the Exchange Act. The Company shall use its best efforts to
obtain the consent of the Company Financial Advisor to permit the Company to
include in the Schedule 14D-9, in its entirety, the Opinion, together with
a summary thereof (which summary shall comply with the provisions of Item
1015(b) of Regulation M-A promulgated by the SEC). The Company also hereby
consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of a description of the
Company Board actions described in _Section_ __ _ 3.04_ and, to the extent
that no Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 6.03(e)_, the Company consents to the inclusion of the
Company Board Recommendation in the Offer Documents. The Company, on the one
hand, and Parent and Purchaser, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct
any information provided by such Party for use in the Schedule 14D-9, if and
to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law, and the Company agrees to
cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case, as and to the extent required
by the Exchange Act. Parent, Purchaser and their legal counsel shall be given
a reasonable opportunity to review the Schedule 14D-9 before it is filed with
the SEC, and the Company shall give due consideration to the additions,
deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent, Purchaser and their legal
counsel. In addition, the Company shall provide Parent, Purchaser and their
legal counsel with (i) a copy of any written comments or telephonic notice of
any oral comments that may be received from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt thereof and prior to
responding thereto and (ii) a reasonable opportunity to provide comments on
that response (to which due consideration shall be given) and to participate
in such response, including by participating in any discussions with the SEC.

 



5 (c) Promptly after the Agreement Date (and in any event in sufficient time to
permit Purchaser to commence the Offer within the time period required by
_Section_ __ _ 1.01(a)_) and otherwise from time to time as requested by
Purchaser or its agents, the Company shall furnish or cause to be furnished to
Purchaser mailing labels, security position listings, non-objecting
beneficial owner lists and any other listings or computer files containing the
names and addresses of the record or beneficial owners of the Shares as of the
most recent practicable date, and shall promptly furnish Purchaser with such
information (including updated lists of holders of the Shares and their
addresses, mailing labels, security position listings and non-objecting
beneficial owner lists) and such other assistance as Purchaser or its agents
may reasonably request in communicating with the record and beneficial owners
of Shares, in connection with the preparation and dissemination of the
Schedule TO and the Offer Documents and the solicitation of tenders of Shares
in the Offer.

(d) Subject to the requirements of applicable Law, and except for such steps
as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents to consummate the Offer as
contemplated hereby and any other documents necessary to consummate the Merger
as contemplated hereby, Parent and Purchaser shall, and Parent and Purchaser
shall require their Representatives to, keep confidential any information
provided by or on behalf of Company pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1.02_ and
use all such information only in connection with the Offer, the Merger and
the other Transactions and, should the Offer terminate or if this Agreement
shall be terminated, will, in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement, promptly deliver, and will require their Representatives to
deliver, to the Company or destroy all copies, summaries and extracts of such
information then in their possession or control.

 

SECTION 1.03 _Directors_.

 

(a) Effective immediately after the time Purchaser accepts for payment and
pays for any Shares tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer (the "
_Acceptance Time_ "), and at all times thereafter, subject to compliance with
the provisions of the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws, applicable Law and
the Listing Rules of the NASDAQ, Parent shall be entitled to elect or
designate such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on
the Company Board as is equal to the product of the total number of directors
on the Company Board (giving effect to the directors elected or designated by
Parent pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by the percentage that the
aggregate number of Shares beneficially owned by Parent, Purchaser or any of
their respective Affiliates bears to the total number of Shares then
outstanding; _provided_ ,  _however_ , Parent shall be entitled to designate
at least a majority of the directors on the Company Board (as long as Parent,
Purchaser and their Affiliates beneficially own a majority of the outstanding
Shares); _provided_ ,  _further_ , that prior to the Effective Time, the
Company Board shall always have at least two (2) members who are not officers,
directors, employees or designees of Parent or Purchaser or any of their
Affiliates (" _Purchaser Insiders_ "). If the number of directors who are not
Purchaser Insiders is reduced below two (2) prior to the Effective Time, the
remaining director who is not a Purchaser Insider shall be entitled to
designate a person to fill such vacancy who is not a Purchaser Insider and
who shall be a director not deemed to be a Purchaser Insider for all purposes
of this Agreement, and the Company shall cause such designee to be appointed
to the Company Board. If, notwithstanding compliance with the foregoing
provisions, the number of directors who are not Purchaser Insiders is reduced
to zero, then the other directors on the Company Board shall designate and
appoint to the

 



6  Company Board two (2) directors who are not officers, directors, employees
or otherwise affiliated with Purchaser or Parent (other than as a result of
such designation). After the Acceptance Time, the Company shall take all
actions as are necessary to enable Parents designees to be so elected or
designated to the Company Board (including, if necessary, seeking the
resignations of one or more existing directors or increasing the size of the
Company Board or both) in compliance with applicable Law. The Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause persons designated by Parent to
constitute the same percentage as persons designated by Parent on the Company
Board of (i) each committee of the Company Board, (ii) each board of
directors (or other similar body) of each Company Subsidiary and (iii) each
committee of each such board, in each case only to the extent permitted by
applicable Law.

 

(b) The Companys obligations to appoint Parents designees to the Company
Board will be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder. The Company will promptly take all actions necessary
to effect the appointment of Parents designees, including mailing to its
stockholders information with respect to the Company and its officers and
directors, as Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 require in order to fulfill its
obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 1.03_, which, unless Parent otherwise
elects, will be mailed together with the Schedule 14D-9. Parent will supply to
the Company in writing and be solely responsible for any information with
respect to itself and its nominees, officers, directors and affiliates
required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 and the Companys obligations under
_Section_ __ _ 1.03_ will be subject to the receipt of such information.

(c) Following the election or appointment of Parents designees pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 1.03_ and prior to the Effective Time, (i) any amendment
or termination of this Agreement by the Company, (ii) any extension by the
Company of the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
acts of Parent or Purchaser hereunder and (iii) any waiver or enforcement of
any of the Companys rights or any of the obligations of Parent or Purchaser
hereunder will require the consent of, or be taken at the direction of, a
majority of the directors of the Company then in office who are not Purchaser
Insiders (or the approval or direction of the sole director if there shall
only be one (1) director then in office who is not a Purchaser Insider), and
such authorization shall constitute the authorization of the Company Board,
and no other action on the part of the Company, including any action by any
other director of Company, shall be required to authorize any such action.

 

(d) After the Acceptance Time, the Company shall also, upon Parents request,
take all action necessary to elect to be treated as a "controlled company"
(as defined by Rule 5615(c) of the NASDAQ Listing Rules) and make all
necessary filings and disclosures associated with such status.

 

SECTION 1.04 _Top Up Option_.

 

(a) The Company hereby irrevocably grants to Purchaser an option (the " _Top
Up Option_ "), exercisable only from and after the Acceptance Time upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 1.04_,
to purchase at a price per share equal to the Offer Price an aggregate number
of Shares (the " _Top Up Option Shares_ ") equal to the lowest number of
Shares that, when added to the number of Shares owned, directly or indirectly,
by Purchaser and Parent, in the aggregate, at the time of such exercise, shall
constitute one Share more than

 



7  90% of the Fully Diluted Shares (after giving effect to the issuance of the
Top Up Option Shares); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Top Up Option shall
not be exercisable unless, immediately after such exercise and the issuance
of Top Up Option Shares, the Short Form Threshold would be reached (assuming
the issuance of the Top Up Option Shares but excluding from Purchasers
ownership, but not from the outstanding Shares, Shares tendered pursuant to
guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been delivered in settlement
or satisfaction of such guarantee); _provided_ , _further_ , that in no event
shall the Top Up Option be exercisable for a number of Shares in excess of
the Companys then total authorized and unissued Shares. Upon Parents
request, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its transfer
agent to certify in writing to Parent the number of shares of Company Common
Stock issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the exercise of the
Top Up Option and after giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Option
Shares. Except as otherwise provided in  _Section_ __ _ 1.04(b)_, the
aggregate amount payable to the Company for the Top Up Option Shares purchased
hereunder upon exercise of the Top Up Option shall be equal to the product of
the number of Top Up Option Shares being so purchased upon such exercise and
the Offer Price (the " _Top Up Consideration_ "). For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Fully Diluted Shares_ " means all outstanding securities
entitled to vote in the election of directors of the Company or on the
adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger, together with all such
securities which the Company would be required or permitted to issue assuming
the conversion or exchange of any then-outstanding warrants,
options, securities or instruments convertible or exchangeable into, or
rights exercisable for, such securities, whether or not then convertible,
exchangeable or exercisable.

 

(b) The Top Up Consideration shall consist of (i) an amount equal to the par
value of the Top Up Option Shares so purchased, to be paid in cash, and (ii)
an amount equal to the balance of the Top Up Consideration, which may be paid
(x) in cash, or (y) by issuance of a promissory note of Purchaser (which shall
be treated as payment to the extent of the principal amount thereof), or (z)
any combination of the foregoing, at Purchasers election. Any such promissory
note shall (A) bear interest at the rate per annum equal to the short-term
applicable federal rate on the date of execution and delivery of such
promissory note, payable in arrears at maturity, (B) shall mature on the first
anniversary of the date of execution and delivery of such promissory note, (C)
may be prepaid without premium or penalty and (D) shall have no other
material terms. The Company Board has determined that Top Up Consideration for
the Top Up Option Shares is adequate in accordance with the MBCA and otherwise
taken all steps necessary such that, upon issuance and delivery in accordance
with this _Section_ __ _ 1.04_, the Top Up Option Shares shall be validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable.

 

(c) The Top Up Option shall be exercisable once, to the full number of Top Up
Option Shares then purchasable under the Top Up Option to reach one Share
more than 90% of the Fully Diluted Shares and not in part; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
the Top Up Option shall terminate concurrently with the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with its terms. At the closing of the purchase
of Top Up Option Shares pursuant to the Top Up Option, Purchaser shall cause
to be delivered to the Company the Top Up Consideration required to be
delivered in exchange for such Top Up Option Shares, and the Company shall
cause to be issued to Purchaser a certificate (a " _Certificate_ ")
representing such Shares or, upon Purchasers request, the applicable number
of uncertificated Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ").
The Parties agree to use their reasonable best efforts to cause the closing of
the purchase of the Top Up Option Shares on the same day that Purchaser gives
the Company written notice of its intent to exercise the Top Up Option and,
in any event, as promptly thereafter as possible.

 



8 (d) In the event Purchaser exercises the Top Up Option, Purchaser shall so
notify the Company in writing, and shall set forth in such notice (i) the
number of Shares that will be owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent and
Purchaser immediately preceding the purchase of the Top Up Option Shares, (ii)
the place and time for the closing of the purchase of the Top Up Option
Shares, (iii) the number of Shares that Purchaser intends to purchase pursuant
to such exercise of the Top Up Option, (iv) the manner in which Purchaser
intends to pay the Top Up Consideration and (v) Purchasers election for
issuance of the Top Up Option Shares as Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

(e) In the event of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split
(including a reverse stock split), or combination, exchange or readjustment of
shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution occurring (or for which a
record date is established) after the Agreement Date that would have the
effect of diluting Purchasers rights under this _Section_ __ _ 1.04_, the
number of and the purchase price for the Top Up Option Shares will be adjusted
appropriately so as to restore to Purchaser its rights hereunder with respect
to the Top Up Option as the same exists as of the Agreement Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that this sentence shall not be construed to permit the Company to
take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the
terms of this Agreement.

(f) Parent and Purchaser acknowledge that the Top Up Option Shares
that Purchaser may acquire upon exercise of the Top Up Option will not be
registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon an
exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Parent
and Purchaser represent and warrant to the Company that Purchaser is, or will
be upon the purchase of the Top Up Option Shares, an "Accredited Investor," as
defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act. Purchaser agrees
that the Top Up Option and the Top Up Option Shares to be acquired upon
exercise of the Top Up Option are being and will be acquired by Purchaser for
the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection
with, any distribution thereof in violation of the Securities Act.

SECTION 1.05 _The Merger_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and in accordance

with the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Company.

of sale, instruments of conveyance, assignments, assurances or any other
actions or things are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of

the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Purchaser, the
Company or the holders of any of the following securities:

(a) _Conversion of Shares_. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, other than Shares to be canceled in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 2.01(b)_ or Dissenting Shares (collectively, the "
_Excluded Shares_ "), shall be canceled and shall be converted automatically
into the right to receive the Offer Price (the " _Merger Consideration_ "),

withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law. The Merger Consideration is
payable in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.02(b)_.

 



12 (b) _Cancellation of Parent-Owned Shares_. Each Share owned by the Company, if
any, or any direct or indirect wholly owned Company Subsidiary and each Share
owned by Purchaser, Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary
of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be
canceled without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall
be made with respect thereto.

(c) _Shares of Purchaser_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of Purchaser issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
the Surviving Company.

SECTION 2.02 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall (i) appoint a
bank or trust company approved (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) in advance by the Company (the " _Paying
Agent_ "), and (ii) enter into a paying agent agreement with such Paying Agent
for the payment of the Merger Consideration in accordance with this _Article_
__ _ II_. At or promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or
cause the Surviving Company to deposit, with the Paying Agent, for the benefit
of the holders of Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares), cash in an amount sufficient to
pay the aggregate Merger Consideration required to be paid pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)_ (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Payment Fund_ "). The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.
The Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent.
Earnings on the Payment Fund in excess of the amounts payable to
the shareholders of the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)_ shall be
the sole and exclusive property of Parent and the Surviving Company and shall
be paid to Parent or the Surviving Company, as Parent directs.

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause to be mailed to each person who was, immediately prior to the Effective

Consideration which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)_, and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith
be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not

documents required to evidence and effect such transfer or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer, and the person requesting such payment shall pay any
transfer or other Taxes required solely by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such
Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by

deemed at all times after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration to which the holder
thereof is entitled pursuant to this  _Article_ __ _ II_. No interest shall
be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares pursuant to the provisions of this _Article_ __ _ II_. Any
holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to deliver a Certificate to
the Paying Agent to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is
entitled to receive pursuant to this _Article_ __ _ II_. Payment of the
applicable Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall be
made only to the person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered.

(c)  _No Further Rights_. From and after the Effective Time, holders of
Shares shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company, except
as provided herein or by applicable Law.

 

(d) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Shares (other than Excluded Shares)
six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving
Company, upon demand, and any holders of Shares (other than Excluded Shares)
who have not theretofore complied with this  _Article_ __ _ II_ shall
thereafter look only to Parent or the Surviving Company for, and Parent and
the Surviving Company shall remain liable for, payment of their claim for the
Merger Consideration. Any portion of the Payment Fund remaining unclaimed by
holders of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) as of a date which is
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Company free and clear
of any claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. Neither
Parent nor the Surviving Company shall be liable to any person in respect of
any Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(e)  _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Paying Agent, the Surviving Company,
Purchaser and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
Shares, Company Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights, Restricted Stock
Units or Restricted Stock Awards such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to such payment under all applicable federal, state or
local Tax Laws and pay such withholding amount over to the appropriate
Governmental Authority. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the
Paying Agent, the Surviving Company, Purchaser or Parent, as the case may be,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all 

 



14  purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares,
Company Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights, Restricted Stock Units or
Restricted Stock Awards in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made by the Paying Agent, the Surviving Company, Purchaser or Parent, as
the case may be.

(f) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, then upon (i) the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and (ii) if
required by the Surviving Company, the receipt by it of an indemnity bond in
form and substance and with surety reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving
Company, the Paying Agent shall pay in respect of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is
entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)_.

SECTION 2.03 _Share Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the share
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of Shares thereafter on the records of the Company.
From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such Shares, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by
Law. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
presented to the Paying Agent or Parent for any reason shall be canceled
against delivery of the Merger Consideration to which the holders thereof are
entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)_.

(b) Each Company Stock Option that is outstanding and unexercised as of the

2.04_) be canceled effective as of the Effective Time and converted into the
right to receive, following the Effective Time (and in no event later than

(c) Each Stock Appreciation Right that is outstanding and unexercised as of
the Effective Time and has an exercise price per Share that is less than the

2.04_) be canceled effective as of the Effective Time and converted in to the
right to receive, following the Effective Time (and in no event later than the
later of fifteen (15) calendar days following the Closing and the first
Business Day on which the Surviving Company pays payroll to Service Providers
following the Closing), an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the
product of (i) the amount by which the Merger Consideration exceeds the

(ii) the aggregate number of Shares subject to such Stock Appreciation Right.
All such payments shall be subject to all applicable federal, state and local
Tax withholding requirements. Each Stock Appreciation Right that is

per Share that is greater than the Merger Consideration shall be canceled
effective as of the Effective Time without the payment of consideration.

 

(d) Each Restricted Stock Unit that vests in accordance with _Section_ __ _
2.04(a)_ shall be canceled effective as of the Effective Time and converted
into the right to receive, following the Effective Time (and in no event later
than the later of fifteen (15) calendar days following the Closing and the
first Business Day on which the Surviving Company pays payroll to Service
Providers following the Closing), an amount in cash, without interest, equal
to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration and (ii) the aggregate number
of Shares subject to such Restricted Stock Unit award. All such payments

SECTION 2.05 _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held of record or
beneficially by a

 



16  person who has not voted in favor of approval and adoption of this Agreement
and who is entitled to demand and properly exercises dissenters rights with
respect to such Shares (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") pursuant to, and who
complies in all respects with, Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 of the MBCA (the
" _Dissenters Rights_ "), shall not be converted into or represent the right
to receive the Merger Consideration for such Dissenting Shares but instead
shall be entitled to payment of the fair value (including interest determined
in accordance with Section 302A.473 of the MBCA) of such Dissenting Shares in
accordance with the Dissenters Rights; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any
such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose
the right to dissent under the Dissenters Rights, then the right of such
holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Dissenting Shares shall
cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of
the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right
to receive, the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon. If any demand
for fair value is made of Dissenting Shares and the Top Up Option was
exercised prior to the Effective Time, then for purposes of determining the
fair value of any Dissenting Shares, the cash received and/or value of
the promissory note received by the Company in payment of the exercise price
of the Top Up Option shall be treated as if it had not been paid to or
received by the Company and the Shares issued upon exercise of the Top Up
Option shall be treated as if they were not issued or outstanding.

(b) The Company shall provide prompt notice to Parent of any demands and any
other instruments served pursuant to applicable Law that are received by the
Company for Dissenters Rights with respect to any Shares, and Parent shall
have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without
the prior written consent of Purchaser, make any payment with respect to, or
settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such demand, or
agree to do any of the foregoing.

 

SECTION 2.06 _Certain Adjustments_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if between
the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the outstanding Shares
shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different
class, by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split
(including a reverse stock split), or combination, exchange or readjustment
of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution occurring (or for
which a record date is established), then the Merger Consideration shall be
appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of Shares the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that this sentence shall not be construed to permit the Company to
take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms
of this Agreement.

the assets and properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its

internal control over financial reporting as it relates to the preparation of
interim financial information that occurred subsequent to the most recently

Knowledge of the Company, any director or officer of the Company in such
capacity as director or officer) which involves an amount in excess of
$500,000 or that is material to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, or which, if determined adversely, would reasonably be
expected to prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Transactions.
Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary nor any property or asset of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary is subject to any continuing Order of,

inquiries or the implementation or submission of any Acquisition Proposal, or
any proposals or offers that would be reasonably expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any non-public
and confidential information in connection with, or for the purpose of
facilitating, any inquiries, proposals or offers that constitute, or could be
reasonably expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal except to notify such
person of the existence of this _Section_ __ _ 6.03(b)_, (iii) otherwise
facilitate any effort or attempt to make an Acquisition Proposal, or any
inquiries, proposals or offers that could reasonably be expected to lead to
an Acquisition Proposal, or (iv) execute or enter into any Acquisition

Company may respond to unsolicited inbound inquiries (orally or in writing)
from third parties that communicate an interest in pursuing an Acquisition
Proposal; _provided_ _further_ that, prior to the Acceptance Time, nothing
contained in this _Section_ __ _ 6.03_ shall prevent the Company or the
Company Board from furnishing information to, or engaging in negotiations or
discussions with, any person that makes an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition
Proposal, which Acquisition Proposal did not result in any material respect
from a breach (or deemed breach) of this _Section_ __ _ 6.03_, if, and only
if, prior to taking such action (A) the Company Board (1) determines in good
faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside
legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal is, or could reasonably be
expected to result in, a Superior Proposal and (2) determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that its failure to take
such actions would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable
Law, (B) the Company provides written notice to Parent of the determination
referenced in _clause (A)_ and (C) the Company receives from such person an
executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement. The Company shall deliver to
Parent a copy of any executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement promptly
following its execution.

 

(c) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) (i) provide
Parent written notice of (A) the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or (B)
any inquiries, proposals or offers received by, or any discussions or
negotiations sought to be initiated or continued with, the Company, any
Company Subsidiary or any Company Representatives concerning an Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) disclose to Parent the material terms of any such Acquisition
Proposal or any such inquiry, offer, proposal or request, including the
identity of the person making any such Acquisition Proposal or any such

provided or made available by the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any
Company Representative to such person to the extent not previously provided
or made available to Parent. The Company shall promptly (and in any event
within 48 hours) (x) respond

 



46  to requests by Parent for information regarding the status and details of
any such Acquisition Proposal or other inquiry, offer, proposal or request
concerning an Acquisition Proposal and (y) disclose to Parent any material
development or material amendment of any such Acquisition Proposal or other
inquiry, offer, proposal or request concerning an Acquisition Proposal. The
Company shall promptly, and in any event within 24 hours, following a
determination by the Company Board that an Acquisition Proposal is a Superior
Proposal, notify Parent of such determination.

 

(d) Except as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.03(e)_, neither the Company nor
the Company Board (or any committee thereof), shall (i) withhold, withdraw or
modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Purchaser, the Company Board
Recommendation, (ii) approve or recommend any Acquisition Proposal, (iii)
enter into any Acquisition Agreement or (iv) recommend any Acquisition
Proposal (and fail to reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation) (any such
action, other than those set forth in the preceding clause (iii), an "
_Adverse Recommendation Change_ ").

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to the
Acceptance Time, the Company Board may effect an Adverse Recommendation
Change, if (i) the Company receives an unsolicited, written Acquisition
Proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation
with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) is a Superior
Proposal and determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside
legal counsel) that its failure to take such actions would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law or (ii) an Intervening Event
occurs and as a result thereof the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to effect
an Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law; _provided_  that:

(i) prior to effecting such an Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to a
Superior Proposal, (A) the Company has notified Parent in writing that it
intends to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change, (B) the Company has
provided Parent a copy of all proposed definitive agreements (including all
financing documents, if applicable) with respect to such Superior Proposal,
(C) if requested to do so by Parent, for a period of four (4) calendar days
following delivery of such notice, the Company shall have discussed and
negotiated in good faith, and shall have made the Company Representatives
available to discuss and negotiate in good faith, with Parent and its
Representatives, any bona fide proposed modifications to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and (D) no earlier than the end of such four (4)
calendar day period, the Company Board (after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and financial advisor) shall have determined in good faith,
after considering the terms of any proposed amendment or modification to this
Agreement proposed by Parent during such four (4) calendar day period, that
such Superior Proposal still constitutes a Superior Proposal and that the
failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change in connection therewith would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law (it being
understood and agreed that any change to the financial or other material terms
of a proposal that was previously the subject of a notice hereunder shall
require a new notice to Parent as provided above and require the

 



47  Company to again comply with the requirements of this _Section_ __ _
6.03(e)(i)_) with respect to any such new notice, but with respect to any such
subsequent notices references herein to a "four (4) calendar day period"
shall be deemed references to a "two (2) calendar day period"); and

 

(ii) prior to effecting such an Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to
an Intervening Event, (A) the Company has notified Parent in writing that it
intends to effect such an Adverse Recommendation Change, describing in
reasonable detail the reasons for such Adverse Recommendation Change, (B) if
requested to do so by Parent, for a period of four (4) calendar days
following delivery of such notice, the Company shall have discussed and
negotiated in good faith, and shall have made the Company Representatives
available to discuss and negotiate in good faith, with Parent and
its Representatives any bona fide proposed modifications to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and (C) no earlier than the end of such four (4)
calendar day period, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith,
after considering the terms of any proposed amendment or modification to this
Agreement proposed by Parent during such four (4) calendar day period and
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to effect
an Adverse Recommendation Change would still be inconsistent with the Company
Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the
Company Board from issuing a "stop, look and listen" communication pursuant to
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule
14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or from
making any disclosure to the Companys shareholders if the Company
Board determines (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that its
failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; _provided_ that, in each case, any Adverse Recommendation
Change may only be made in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 6.03(e)_. For the
avoidance of doubt, a factually accurate public statement that describes the
Companys receipt of an Acquisition Proposal and the operation of this
Agreement with respect thereto shall not, in and of itself, be deemed an
Adverse Recommendation Change.

(g) Except as set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 8.03(d)_ with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal, for purposes of this Agreement:

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any oral or written proposal or offer
from any person or group (other than Parent or Purchaser) relating to, in a
single transaction or series of related transactions, (1) any direct or
indirect acquisition of (A) 20% or more of the assets (whether based on the
fair market value, revenue generation or net income) of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, including in any such case
through the acquisition of one or more Subsidiaries owning such assets, or
(B) 20% or more of the outstanding Company Common Stock (or any securities
convertible into, or exchangeable for, such Company Common Stock); (2) any
tender offer or exchange offer, as defined pursuant to the Exchange Act, that
if consummated would result, directly or indirectly, in any person or group
(or the shareholders of any person or group)

 



48  beneficially owning 20% or more of the outstanding Company Common Stock; or
(3) any merger, consolidation, business combination, share exchange,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction
involving the Company that would result in any person or group (or the
shareholders of any person or group) beneficially owning, directly or
indirectly, 20% or more of the outstanding Company Common Stock or 20% or more
of the voting power of the surviving entity in a merger involving the Company
or the resulting direct or indirect parent of the Company or such surviving
entity (or any securities convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities
representing such voting power). Whenever the term "group" is used in this
Agreement, it shall have the definition set forth in Rule 13d-3 of the
Exchange Act.

 

(ii) " _Intervening Event_ " means any material event, circumstance, change,
effect, development or condition (other than an Acquisition Proposal or any
inquiry, offer or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal) first occurring or arising after the Agreement Date that
was not known or reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board as of the
Agreement Date (or if known, the magnitude or material consequences of which
were not known or reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board as of the
Agreement Date).

 

(iii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
made by any person or group (other than Parent or Purchaser) after the
Agreement Date, which Acquisition Proposal did not result in any material
respect from a breach (or deemed breach) of this _Section_ __ _ 6.03_, that
(1) would result in such person or group (or in the case of a direct merger
between such person and the Company, the shareholders of such person)
acquiring, directly or indirectly, 50% or more of the outstanding Shares or
all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, (2) is on terms that the Company Board
determines in good faith (after receiving the advice of its financial advisor
and outside legal counsel and after taking into account all the terms and
conditions of the Acquisition Proposal) are more favorable to the Companys
shareholders from a financial point of view than the Transactions (taking into
account any proposed amendment or modification proposed by Parent pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 6.03(e)(i)_) and (3) the Company Board determines (after
receiving the advice of its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) is
reasonably capable of being consummated in accordance with its terms in
a reasonable period of time, taking into account all financial, regulatory,
legal and other aspects (including certainty of closing and certainty of
financing) of such proposal.

 

(h) Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that in the event any Company
Representative or any Company Subsidiary takes any action, on behalf of the
Company, which, if taken by the Company, would constitute a material breach of
this _Section_ __ _ 6.03_, and the Company does not take reasonable action to
seek to cure such breach within two (2) Business Days of the earlier of (x)
the date on which the Company receives written notice from Parent or Purchaser
of such breach and (y) the date on which the Company obtains Knowledge of such
breach, then the Company shall be deemed to be in breach of this _Section_ __
_ 6.03_.

 



49 SECTION 6.04 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to, to the
fullest extent permitted under the MBCA, honor and fulfill in all respects the
obligations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries under any and all
indemnification agreements between the Company or any Company Subsidiary and
any of their respective present or former directors and officers
(collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ "). In addition, the articles of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Company shall contain provisions no
less favorable with respect to exculpation and indemnification than are set
forth in the Company Charter or the Company Bylaws, which provisions shall not
be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from
the Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely in any material
respect the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the Effective
Time, were directors or officers of the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

 

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Company shall to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, indemnify
and hold harmless each Indemnified Party against all costs and expenses
(including attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and settlement amounts paid in connection with any Action
(whether arising before or after the Effective Time), whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or relating to any
action or omission in their capacity as a director or officer of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary, occurring on or before the Effective Time, and to
the fullest extent permitted by Law, the Surviving Company shall pay all
expenses of each Indemnified Party in advance of the final disposition of any
such Action, subject to receipt of an undertaking to repay such advances if
it is ultimately determined in accordance with applicable Law that such
Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification. In the event of any such
Action, (i) subject to the undertaking described in the previous sentence,
the Surviving Company shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel
selected by the Indemnified Parties, which counsel shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Surviving Company, promptly after statements therefor
are received, (ii) the Surviving Company shall not settle, compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment in any pending or threatened Action to
which an Indemnified Party is a party (and in respect of which indemnification
could be sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder), unless such settlement,
compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified
Party from all liability arising out of such Action or such Indemnified Party
otherwise consents, and (iii) the Surviving Company shall cooperate in the
defense of any such matter; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving
Company shall not be liable for any settlement effected without the Surviving
Companys written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed); _provided_ _further_ that, in the event that any
claim for indemnification is asserted or made within such six-year
period, all rights to indemnification in respect of such claim shall continue
until the disposition of such claim. The rights of each Indemnified Party
under this _Section_ __ _ 6.04(b)_ shall be in addition to any rights such
person may have under the articles of incorporation or bylaws (or similar
organizational documents) of the Company and the Surviving Company or any of
their Subsidiaries, or under any Law or under any indemnification agreement of
any Indemnified Party with the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

 



50 (c) The Surviving Company shall either (i) cause to be obtained at the
Effective Time "tail" insurance policies with a claims period of at least six
(6) years from the Effective Time with respect to directors and officers
liability insurance in an amount and scope at least as favorable, in the
aggregate, as the Companys existing policies (true and complete copies of
which have been previously made available to Parent) for claims arising from
facts or events that occurred on or prior to the Effective Time; or (ii)
maintain in effect for six (6) years from the Effective Time, if available,
the current directors and officers liability insurance policies maintained
by the Company; _provided_ that the Surviving Company may substitute therefor
policies of at least the same coverage containing terms and conditions that
are substantially similar, in the aggregate, with respect to matters occurring
prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall
the Surviving Company be required to expend pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
6.04(c)_ more than an amount per year equal to 250% of current annual premiums
paid by the Company for such insurance; _provided_ _further_ that, in the
event of an expiration, termination or cancellation of such current policies,
Parent or the Surviving Company shall be required to obtain as much coverage
as is possible under substantially similar policies for such maximum annual
amount in aggregate annual premiums.

(d) In the event Parent or the Surviving Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving company or entity of such
consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Company, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set
forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.04_.

 

(e) Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to perform all of the obligations
of the Surviving Company under this  _Section_ __ _ 6.04_.

SECTION 6.05 _Employee Benefits Matters_.

_Employee_ ") with (i) a base salary or hourly wage that is
substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to such Employee
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) employee benefits
(excluding equity-based compensation) that are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent or any
of its Affiliates as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(b) Employees shall receive credit for vesting and eligibility purposes under
any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement established or maintained by
Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries under
which each Employee may be eligible to participate on or after the Effective
Time to the same extent recognized by the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries under comparable Plans immediately prior to the

 



51  Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that such crediting of service
shall not operate to duplicate any benefit or the funding of any such benefit.
Such plan, program or arrangement shall credit each such Employee for service
accrued or deemed accrued on or prior to the Effective Time with the Company,
any Company Subsidiary and all Affiliates where service with the Affiliate was
credited under a comparable Plan of the Company prior to the Effective Time.

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to be treated as an
amendment of any particular Plan, or to create any third-party beneficiary
rights in any Employee, any beneficiary or dependent thereof, or any
collective bargaining representative thereof. Nothing contained herein,
express or implied, shall alter or limit the ability of Parent or the
Surviving Company or any of their respective Affiliates to amend, modify or
terminate any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement at any time
assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any of them, or to terminate
the employment of any Employee.

Authority relating to such matters. None of the Parties shall agree to
participate in any substantive meeting, telephone call or discussion with any
Governmental Authority in respect of any submissions, filings, investigation
(including any settlement of the investigation) or other inquiry relating to
the Transactions unless it consults with the other Parties in advance and, to

clearances, including in connection with the determination of any actions to
be taken under _Section_ __ _ 6.06(b)_, and shall take the lead in all
meetings and communications with any Governmental Authority in connection with
obtaining any necessary antitrust, competition or investment review
clearances.

54 SECTION 6.11 _Shareholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any shareholder
litigation brought by any shareholder of the Company against the Company
and/or its directors or executive officers relating to the Transactions,
whether commenced prior to or after the execution and delivery of this

Transactions.

 

SECTION 6.13 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Parent and the Company shall
each give prompt notice to the other Party if any of the following occur
after the Agreement Date: (i) receipt of any written notice to the receiving

the pursuit of such consent could (in the good faith determination of such
Party) reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the consummation
of the Transactions; (ii) receipt of any notice or other communication from
any Governmental Authority, NASDAQ or the NYSE (or any other securities
market) in connection with the Transactions; or (iii) the occurrence of an
event that would or would be reasonably likely to (A) prevent or materially

condition set forth in _Article_ __ _ VII_ or _Annex I_ to be satisfied. In
no event shall (x) the delivery of any notice by a Party pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.13_ limit or otherwise affect the respective rights,
obligations, representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the
Parties or the conditions to the obligations of the Parties under this
Agreement or (y) disclosure by the Company or Parent be deemed to amend or
supplement the Company Disclosure Schedule or constitute an exception to any
representation or warranty. The failure to comply with this _Section_ __ _
6.13_ will not constitute the failure of any condition set forth in _Article_
__ _ VII_ or _Annex I_ to be satisfied unless the underlying event would
independently result in the failure of such a condition to be so satisfied.

 

SECTION 6.14 _Rule 14d-10(d) Matters_. Prior to the Agreement Date, the
Company (acting through the Compensation Committee of the Company Board) has
taken all such steps as may be required to cause any and all employment

entered into by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or

months of the Termination Date, the Company or any Company Subsidiary enters
into a definitive agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or
consummates any Acquisition Proposal (in each case, whether or not such

within one (1) Business Day of the earlier to occur of the entry into the
definitive agreement or the consummation of any Acquisition Proposal, in each
case, as referred to in clause (B) above.

(v) For the avoidance of doubt, in the event this Agreement is terminated by
the Company for any reason at a time when Parent would have had the right to
terminate this Agreement, Parent shall be entitled to receipt of the Company
Termination Fee that would have been (or would have subsequently become)
payable had Parent terminated this Agreement at such time.

(c) The Company Termination Fee payable by the Company hereunder shall be paid
to Parent or its designee by the Company in immediately available funds: (i)
concurrently with a termination of this Agreement by Parent pursuant to

effectiveness of, a termination of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to

termination of this Agreement by Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.01(d)(i)(A)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 8.01(d)(iii)_. The payment to Parent or
its designees of the Company Termination Fee shall, except in the case of
fraud, be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent for any loss suffered by
Parent or Purchaser as a result of the failure of the Transactions to be
consummated to the

 



60  extent paid and upon such payment in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
8.03_, the Company shall not have any further liability or obligation relating
to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions.

(d) For purposes of _Section_ __ _ 8.03(b)(iv)_, Acquisition Proposal shall
have the meaning assigned to such term in _Section_ __ _ 6.03(g)(i)_, except
that references to 20% in the definition thereof shall be deemed to be

_Section_ __ _ 8.03_ are an integral part of the Transactions, and that,
without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay when due any amount pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 8.03_, then the Company shall (i) reimburse Parent for all
Expenses incurred in connection with the collection of such overdue amount and
the enforcement by Parent of its rights under this _Section_ __ _ 8.03_, and
(ii) pay to Parent interest on such overdue amount from the date such payment
was required to be made until the date of payment at the prime lending rate as
published in _The_ _Wall_ _Street_ _Journal_ in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made.

SECTION 9.04 _Interpretation and Rules of Construction_.

 

(a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Annex, Exhibit, Article
or Section, such reference shall be to an Annex, Exhibit, Article or Section
of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents, index of
defined terms and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including" are
used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." The words "hereof," "hereto," "hereby," "herein" and
"hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement. Documents, materials and information are deemed to have been "made
available" to Parent and Purchaser, if such documents, materials or
information were available for review by such person and its Representatives
through the electronic data room (the " _Data Room_ ") entitled "Project LYNX
DR," which is hosted by Merrill Datasite

 



70  (https://datasite.merrillcorp.com) in connection with the Transactions or
disclosed in a SEC Report filed and publicly available, in each case, at least
two (2) Business Days prior to the Agreement Date. The term "or" is not
exclusive. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the
degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not
mean simply "if." The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable
to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms. Any agreement,
instrument or Law defined or referred to herein means such agreement,
instrument or Law as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented,
unless otherwise specifically indicated. References to a person are also to
its successors and permitted assigns. When calculating the period of time
before which, within which or following which any act is to be done or step
taken pursuant to this Agreement, the date that is the reference date in
calculating such period shall be excluded, and if the last day of such period
is not a Business Day, the period shall end on the immediately following
Business Day. Unless otherwise specifically indicated, all references to
"dollars" and "$" will be deemed references to the lawful money of the United
States of America. References to "days" shall mean "calendar days"
unless expressly stated otherwise. No specific provision, representation or
warranty shall limit the applicability of a more general provision,
representation or warranty. It is the intent of the Parties that each
representation, warranty, covenant, condition and agreement contained in this
Agreement shall be given full, separate, and independent effect and that such
provisions are cumulative. The phrase "ordinary course of business" shall be
deemed to be followed by the words "consistent with past practice" whether or
not such words actually follow such phrase. Any reference in this Agreement to
a date or time shall be deemed to be such date or time in the City of New
York, New York, U.S.A., unless otherwise specified.

(b) Each of the Parties has participated in the drafting and negotiation of
this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation
arises, this Agreement must be construed as if it is drafted by all the
Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any Party by virtue of authorship of any of the provisions of
this Agreement.

SECTION 9.05 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law, or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in a mutually
acceptable manner in order that the Transactions be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 

SECTION 9.06 _Disclaimer of Other Representations and Warranties_. Parent,
Purchaser and the Company each acknowledges and agrees that, except for the
representations and warranties expressly set forth in this Agreement, (a) no
Party makes, and no Party has made, any representations or warranties relating
to itself or its businesses or otherwise in connection with the Transactions,
(b) no person has been authorized by any Party to make any representation or
warranty relating to such Party or its businesses or otherwise in connection
with the Transactions and, if made, such representation or warranty must
not be relied upon as having been authorized by such Party, and (c) any
estimates, projections, predictions, data, financial

 



71  information, memoranda, presentations or any other materials or information
provided or addressed to any Party or any of its Representatives are not and
shall not be deemed to be or to include representations or warranties unless
any such materials or information are the subject of any representation or
warranty set forth in this Agreement.

 

SECTION 9.07 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, taken together with the
Company Disclosure Schedule and the Confidentiality Agreement, constitutes
the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior agreements and undertakings, both
written and oral, among the Parties, or any of them, with respect to
the subject matter hereof and thereof.

SECTION 9.08 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the Parties without the
prior written consent of the other Parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Parent and Purchaser may assign all or any of their rights and obligations
hereunder to any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent so long
as Parent continues to remain liable for all of such obligations as if no such
assignment had occurred. Any purported assignment without such consent shall
be void. Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement will be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their
respective successors and assigns.

 

SECTION 9.09 _Parties in Interest_. Other than the provisions of _Section_ __
_ 6.04_ (which is for the benefit of the persons covered thereby and may be
enforced by such persons), this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
solely to the benefit of each Party, and nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other person any right,
benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement.

SECTION 9.10 _Remedies; Specific Performance_. The Parties acknowledge and
agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. Each Party agrees that, in the
event of any breach or threatened breach by any other Party of any covenant or
obligation contained in this Agreement, the non-breaching Party shall be
entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may be available to it whether
in law or equity, including monetary damages, except as limited by _Section_
__ _ 8.03_) to seek (a) an Order of specific performance to enforce the
observance and performance of such covenant or obligation, and (b) an
injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach.

SECTION 9.11 _Governing Law_.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any applicable
principles of conflict of laws that would cause the Laws of another State to
otherwise govern this Agreement, except to the extent that the MBCA
mandatorily applies and governs the Merger.

 

(b) The Parties agree that any suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce
any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection
with, this Agreement or the Transactions (whether brought by any Party or any
of its Affiliates or against any Party or

 



72  any of its Affiliates) shall be heard and determined exclusively in the
Delaware Court of Chancery; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Delaware
Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction over such Action, such Action
shall be heard and determined exclusively in the United States District Court
for the District of Delaware. Consistent with the preceding sentence, each of
the Parties hereby (i) submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts
for the purpose of any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement
brought by any Party; (ii) agrees that service of process will be validly
effected by sending notice in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 9.02_; and
(iii) irrevocably waives and agrees not to assert by way of motion, defense,
or otherwise, in any such Action, any claim that it is not subject personally
to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its property is exempt or
immune from attachment or execution, that the Action is brought in an
inconvenient forum, that the venue of the Action is improper, or that this
Agreement or the Transactions may not be enforced in or by any of the above
named courts. Process in any such Action may be served on any Party anywhere
in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court.
Without limiting the foregoing, each Party agrees that service of process on
such Party as provided in _Section_ __ _ 9.02_ shall be deemed effective
service of process on such Party.

SECTION 9.12  _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVES TO
THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING
OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS. EACH
OF THE PARTIES HEREBY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY
OF THE OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS, AS APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS  _SECTION_ __ _ 9.12_.

SECTION 9.13 _Amendment_. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 1.03(c)_, at any time
prior to the Effective Time, this Agreement may be amended by the Parties by
action taken by or on behalf of their respective boards of directors;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, after the Acceptance Time, (a) no amendment may
be made that decreases the Merger Consideration and (b) no amendment that, by
Law or in accordance with the rules of any relevant stock exchange, requires
approval by the shareholders of the Company may be made without such
shareholder approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed by Parent, Purchaser and the Company.

SECTION 9.14  _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent,
Purchaser or the Company may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations of any other
Party under this Agreement, (b) waive any breach or inaccuracy in the
representations and warranties of any other Party contained herein or in any
instrument delivered pursuant hereto or (c) waive compliance with any of the
covenants or agreements of any other Party or any condition to the
obligations of the waiving Party contained herein; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that after the Acceptance Time, (i) no waiver may be made that decreases the
Merger Consideration and (ii) no extension or waiver that, by Law or in

 



73  accordance with the rules of any relevant stock exchange, requires approval
by the shareholders of the Company may be made without such shareholder
approval. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a
written instrument signed by the Party or Parties to be bound thereby.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure or delay of any Party to assert any
of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver
of those rights, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right under
this Agreement preclude any other or further exercise of any rights hereunder.

 

SECTION 9.15 _Company Disclosure Schedule_. The Parties agree that any
reference in a particular Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be
deemed to be disclosed and incorporated by reference in each other Section of
the Company Disclosure Schedule to which such information reasonably relates
as though fully set forth in such other Section to the extent
the applicability and relevance of such information to such other Section is
reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure. Certain items and matters
may be listed in the Company Disclosure Schedule for informational purposes
only and may not be required to be listed therein by the terms of this
Agreement. In no event shall the listing of items or matters in the Company
Disclosure Schedule be deemed or interpreted to broaden, or otherwise expand
the scope of, the representations and warranties or covenants contained in
this Agreement. The mere inclusion of an item in the Company Disclosure
Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty (x) shall not be
deemed an admission that such item represents a material exception or
material event, circumstance, change, effect, development or condition or that
such item would constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect and (y) shall not
be construed as an admission by the Company of any non-compliance with, or
violation of, any third party rights (including any Intellectual Property
rights) or any Law or Order of any Governmental Authority, such disclosures
having been made solely for the purposes of creating exceptions to the
representations and warranties made herein or of disclosing any information
required to be disclosed under this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing,
no reference to or disclosure of a possible breach or violation of any
Contract, Law or Order shall be construed as an admission or indication that a
breach or violation exists or has actually occurred.

 

SECTION 9.16 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile transmission or other means of electronic
transmission, such as by electronic mail in "pdf" form) in counterparts, and
by the different Parties in separate counterparts, each of which when executed
shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together
shall constitute one and the same agreement.

Purchasers rights to extend, amend or terminate the Offer in accordance with
the provisions of the Merger Agreement and applicable Law, Purchaser shall not
be required to accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and
regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c) promulgated under the Exchange
Act, pay for any validly tendered Shares and may delay the acceptance for
payment of or, subject to the restrictions referred to above, the payment
for, any validly tendered Shares, if:

(a) the Minimum Condition shall not have been satisfied at the Expiration
Date;

(b) the waiting period applicable to the consummation of the Offer under the
HSR Act shall not have expired or been terminated at or prior to the
Expiration Date or any consent, approval, or other authorization applicable to
the consummation of the Offer under the Antitrust Laws of Germany shall not
have been received or granted; or

 

(c) at any time on or after the Agreement Date and prior to the Expiration
Date, any of the following conditions have occurred and are continuing at the
Expiration Date:

(i) any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction shall have enacted,
issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any decision, injunction, decree,
ruling, Law or Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that is in
effect and enjoins or otherwise prohibits or makes illegal the consummation of
the Transactions on the terms contemplated by this Agreement (provided that
Parent and Purchaser have used their reasonable best efforts to oppose any
such action by such Governmental Authority in accordance with _Section_ __ _
6.06_ of the Merger Agreement);

(ii) (A) any representation or warranty of the Company contained in _Section_
__ _ 3.01_ (other than _Section_ __ _ 3.01(a)_), _Section_ __ _ 3.02_,
_Section_ __ _ 3.03_ (other than _Section_ __ _ 3.03(a)_, _Section_ __ _
3.03(b)_ and  _Section_ __ _ 3.03(c)_), _Section_ __ _ 3.04_, _Section_ __
_ 3.09(a)_, _Section_ __ _ 3.24_, _Section_ __ _ 3.25_ and _Section_ __ _
3.27_ of the Merger Agreement shall, if qualified by materiality or "Company
Material Adverse Effect," fail to be true and correct in all respects or, if
not so qualified, shall fail to be true and correct in all material respects,
(B) any representation or warranty of the Company contained in _Section_ __ _
3.01(a)_ shall fail to be true and correct in all respects, (C) any
representation or warranty of the Company contained in  _Section_ __ _
3.03(b)_ and _Section_ __ _ 3.03(c)_ of the Merger Agreement shall fail to be
true and correct in all respects, except where the failure to be so true and
correct in all respects has not resulted and would not reasonably be expected
to result in an increase in the aggregate consideration required to be paid by
Purchaser under _Article_ __ _ I_ or _Article_ __ _ II_, individually or in
the aggregate, by more than $500,000, or (D) any other representation  or warranty of the Company contained in the Merger Agreement (without giving
effect to qualifications set forth therein relating to "materiality", "Company
Material Adverse Effect" or other qualifications based on the word "material"
or similar phrases) shall fail to be true and correct in any respect, except
where the failure of such representations and warranties of the Company to be
so true and correct would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect, in the
case of each of clauses (A), (B) and (C), as of the Agreement Date and as of
the Expiration Date as though made on and as of such date (unless any such
representation and warranty is made only as of a specific date, in which
event such representation or warranty shall be true and correct as of such
specified date);

 

(iii) the Company shall have breached or failed to perform or comply, in any
material respect, with any agreement or covenant to be performed or complied
with by it under the Merger Agreement and such breach or failure shall not
have been cured prior to the Expiration Date;

 

(iv) there shall have occurred since the date of the Merger Agreement a
Company Material Adverse Effect;

 

(v) Parent and Purchaser shall have failed to receive a certificate executed
by the Companys Chief Executive Officer or President on behalf of the

set forth in paragraphs (c)(ii), (iii) and (iv) of this _Annex I_ have not
occurred; or

 

(vi) the Merger Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its
terms.

 

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Purchaser and
may be asserted by Parent or Purchaser regardless of the circumstances giving
rise to any such conditions and may be waived in writing (as permitted by
applicable Law) by Parent or Purchaser in whole or in part at any time and
from time to time in their sole discretion, in each case subject to the
terms of the Merger Agreement. Any reference in this _Annex I_ or the Merger
Agreement to a condition or requirement being satisfied shall be deemed to be
satisfied if such condition or requirement is so waived in writing (where
permitted by applicable Law). The foregoing conditions shall be in addition
to, and not a limitation of, the rights of Parent and Purchaser to extend,
terminate, amend and/or modify the Offer pursuant to the terms and conditions
of the Merger Agreement. The failure by Parent or Purchaser at any time to
exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such
right and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be
asserted at any time and from time to time.
