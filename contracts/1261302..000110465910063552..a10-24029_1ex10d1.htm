the Purchasers shall treat such payments as, an adjustment to the Purchase
Price for all Tax purposes.

jurisdiction. Other than Permitted Liens, there are no Liens on any part of
the Business that arose in connection with any failure (or alleged failure) to

immediately prior to the date of this Agreement has been the subject of an
audit or other examination relating to the payment of a material amount of
Taxes of the Target Companies by the Tax authorities of any nation, state or
locality (and, to the Knowledge of Rockwood, no such audit is pending or
threatened) nor have the Target Companies received any written notices from
any Tax authority relating to any issue that could reasonably be expected to
affect the Tax liability of the Target Companies.

 



 

(d) None of the Target Companies (i) has entered into a written agreement or
waiver extending any statute of limitations relating to the payment or
collection of a material amount of Taxes of the Target Companies that has not
expired or (ii) is presently contesting any material Tax liability of the
Target Companies before any Governmental Body.

 



 

(e) There are no Tax-sharing, allocation, indemnification or similar Contracts
in effect as between any of the Target Companies or, to the Knowledge of
Rockwood, any predecessors or Related Persons thereof and any other party
(including any Rockwood Seller and any predecessors or Related Persons
thereof) under which the Purchasers or the Target Companies could be liable
for any Taxes or other claims of any other party subsequent to the Closing

Requirement for withholding or pursuant to financing arrangements, leases or
other commercial agreements entered into by the Target Companies in the
Ordinary Course of Business.

 



 

(f) No Target Company has within three years prior to the date of this
Agreement paid or become liable to pay any material penalty, fine, surcharge

properly operated such system deducting and accounting for Tax and maintaining
records as required by applicable Legal Requirements.

Specialties Groups consolidated U.S. federal income Tax Return that includes
the period from January 1 (the first day of the Rockwood Specialties Group
taxable year) of the taxable year in which the Closing Date occurs through the
Closing Date. As such, Rockwood Holdings is, and at all times prior to the
Closing will be, eligible to file an election under Section 338(h)(10) of the
Code with respect to a "qualified stock purchase" (as such term is defined in
Section 338 of the Code) of the stock of AlphaGary Corporation.

 



 

(i) The execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the
Contemplated Transactions will not result in any profit or gain being deemed
to accrue to AGL

 



      
 

 



 

for Tax purposes whether pursuant to section 179 (Companies ceasing to be a
member of a group) of the U.K. Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 or
otherwise.

 



 

(j) AGL is a registered and taxable person for the purposes of U.K. VAT and
such registration is not subject to any conditions imposed by or agreed with
HMRC.

 



 

(k) AGL has not in the last three years been treated as a member of a VAT

(l) In the last three years, all interest, discounts and premiums payable by
AGL in respect of its loan relationships (within the meaning of Part 5 (Loan
Relationships) of the CTA) have been capable of being brought into account by
AGL as a debit for the purposes of Part 5 (Loan Relationships) of the CTA as
and to the extent that they have been from time to time recognized in AGLs
accounts and the Sellers do not expect that any obligations entered into by
AGL prior to the Closing Date to make future payments of such amounts will not
also be capable of being brought into account by AGL (assuming that the
accounting policies and methods adopted for the purpose of the accounts
continue to be so adopted).

arrangement under which for the purposes of Part 4 of TIOPA (Provision not at
arms length) the actual provision that has been made or imposed between AGL
and any other person by means of a transaction or series of transactions
differs from the provision which would have been made as between independent
enterprises as determined in accordance with Part 4 of TIOPA.

 



 

(o) All documents in the possession or under the control of each Target
Company to which such Target Company is a party relating to the Business and
which are subject to stamp duty have been properly stamped.

 



 

(p) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the Contemplated Transactions will result in the withdrawal of any relief
from stamp duty or stamp duty land tax granted on or before Closing which will
affect any Target Company.

 



 

3.13 _No Adverse Change_. Since December 31, 2009, there has not been a
Material Adverse Change with respect to the Target Companies taken as a whole
or the Business, and no event has occurred or circumstance exists that could
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Change with respect to
the Target Companies taken as a whole or the Business.

 



 

3.14 _Employee Benefits_.

 



 

(a) _Schedule 3.14(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter sets forth a true,
correct and complete list of all domestic and foreign (i) "employee benefit
plans," within the meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder ("
_ERISA_ "), (ii) bonus, stock option, stock purchase, restricted stock,
incentive, fringe benefit, "voluntary employees beneficiary associations" ("
_VEBAs_ ")

 



      
 

 



 

under Section 501(c)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and
the rules and regulations thereunder (the " _Code_ "), profit-sharing,
pension, or retirement, deferred compensation, medical, life insurance,
disability, accident, salary continuation, severance, vacation, sick pay, sick
leave, supplemental retirement and unemployment benefit plans, programs,
arrangements, commitments or practices (whether or not insured) and (iii)
employment, consulting, termination, and severance contracts or agreements
that are not based on a standard form of contract or agreement; currently
covering active, retired or former employees or directors of the Target
Companies, whether or not any such plans, programs, arrangements, commitments,
contracts, agreements or practices (referred to in (i), (ii) or (iii) above)
are in writing or are otherwise exempt from the provisions of ERISA, that are
maintained or contributed to (or with respect to which an obligation to
contribute has been undertaken) or with respect to which any potential
liability is borne by Rockwood Specialties or its Affiliates (" _Benefit
Plans_ "). The Benefit Plans covering solely active, retired or former
employees of the Target Companies are denoted by asterisk on _Schedule
3.14(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter. The asterisked Benefit Plans,
excluding the AlphaGary Corporation Union Employees Pension Plan (which will
be transferred to Rockwood Specialties or one of its Affiliates (other than a
Target Company) prior to Closing in accordance with Section 10.1(d)), are
hereinafter referred to as the " _Target Company Benefit Plans_ ". For the
avoidance of doubt, the Benefit Plans shall not include any statutory foreign
plans with respect to which any Target Company, Rockwood Specialties or any of
their Affiliates are obligated to make contributions or comply with under
applicable Legal Requirements.

 



 

(b) Each Benefit Plan (including any related trust) complies in form with the
requirements of all applicable Legal Requirements, including ERISA, the Code,
and applicable foreign tax laws, and has at all times been maintained and
operated in compliance with its terms and the requirements of all applicable
Legal Requirements, including ERISA and the Code, with such exceptions as
could not, individually or in the aggregate, result in a material liability of
any Target Company. Each Benefit Plan intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS
and each trust established in connection with any Benefit Plan, which is
intended to be exempt from U.S. federal income taxation under Section 501(a)
of the Code has been determined to be so exempt by the IRS. Since the date of
each most recent determination letter, to the Knowledge of Rockwood
Specialties, no event has occurred and no condition or circumstance has
existed that has resulted, or is likely to result, in the revocation of any
such determination letter or that could adversely affect the qualified status
of any such Benefit Plan or the exempt status of any such trust, with such
exceptions as could not, individually or in the aggregate, result in a
material liability of any Target Company. No complete or partial termination
of any Benefit Plan has occurred, or to the Knowledge of Rockwood Specialties
is expected to occur, and to the Knowledge of Rockwood Specialties no
Proceedings have been instituted, and no condition exists and no event has
occurred that could constitute grounds, under Title IV of ERISA to terminate,
or appoint a trustee to administer, any Benefit Plan, with such exceptions as
could not, individually or in the aggregate, result in a material liability of
any Target Company. None of the Rockwood Sellers nor the Target Companies has
any commitment, intention or understanding to create, materially modify or
terminate any Target Company Benefit Plan, other than as required by
applicable Legal Requirements, the terms of any Material Contract, or the
terms of any Target Company Benefit Plan. Except as required to maintain the
tax-qualified status of any Benefit Plan intended to qualify under Section
401(a) of the Code, no condition or circumstance exists that would

 



      
 

 



 

prevent the amendment or termination of any Target Company Benefit Plan. No
event has occurred, and no condition or circumstance has existed, that could
result in a material increase in the benefits under, or the expense of
maintaining (as a result of a plan amendment, written interpretation or
announcement issued by a Governmental Body), any Target Company Benefit Plan
from the level of benefits thereunder or expense incurred thereof for the most
recent fiscal year ended. No Target Company Benefit Plan is a plan described
in Section 4063(a) of ERISA. No Target Company Benefit Plan has assets that
include securities issued by any Rockwood Seller or any Target Company. As of
the date of this Agreement, neither Rockwood Specialties, the Target
Companies, nor any of their Affiliates has communicated to any employee of the
Target Companies or formally adopted or authorized any creation, material
modification or termination of any Target Company Benefit Plan, other than as
may be required by Applicable Law or the terms of any applicable collective
bargaining agreement, Material Contracts or any Target Company Benefit Plan.

 



 

(c) (i) No Target Company Benefit Plan is subject to Sections 412 or 430 of
the Code or Title IV or Sections 302 or 303 of ERISA.

 



 

(ii) No Target Company Benefit Plan is a "multiemployer plan" (as such term is
defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA).

 



 

(iii) No Target Company has incurred, and no event has occurred and no
condition or circumstance exists that could result, directly or indirectly,
in, any material liability (including, without limitation, any indirect,
contingent or secondary liability) of any Target Company under Title IV of
ERISA or Sections 412 or 430 of the Code or Sections 302 or 303 of ERISA.

 



 

(iv) No Target Company Benefit Plan (whether qualified or non-qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code) provides for post-employment or retiree health,
life insurance or other welfare benefits and has unfunded liabilities, other
than continuation coverage required by Section 4980B of the Code or Sections
601-608 of ERISA (" _COBRA_ ") or similar Legal Requirements.

 



 

(v) No asset of any Target Company is subject to any Lien arising under
Section 303(k) of ERISA or Section 430(k) of the Code, and no event has
occurred and no condition or circumstance has existed that could give rise to
any such Lien. None of the Target Companies has been required to provide any
security under Section 307 of ERISA or Section 436(f) of the Code, and no
event has occurred and no condition or circumstance has existed that could
give rise to any such requirement to provide any such security.

 



 

(vi) There are no Claims or disputes pending or to the Knowledge of Rockwood,
threatened, anticipated or expected to be asserted against or with respect to
any Benefit Plan or the assets of any such Benefit Plan (other than routine
claims for benefits and appeals of denied routine claims) that could,
individually or in the aggregate, result in a material liability of any Target
Company. No civil or criminal action brought pursuant to the provisions of
Title I, Subtitle B, Part 5 of ERISA is pending, or to the Knowledge of
Rockwood, threatened, anticipated, or expected to be asserted against any
Target Company or any fiduciary of any Benefit Plan, in any case with respect
to any Benefit Plan that could, individually or in the

 



       
 

 



 

aggregate result in a material liability of any Target Company. No Benefit
Plan or any fiduciary thereof has been the direct or indirect subject of any
Proceeding that could, individually or in the aggregate, result in a material
liability of any Target Company.

 



 

(d) Full payment has been timely made of all amounts that any Target Company
is required, under applicable Legal Requirement or under the terms of any
Target Company Benefit Plan or any agreement relating to any Target Company
Benefit Plan to which any Target Company is a party, to have paid as
contributions or premiums thereto as of the last day of the most recent fiscal
year of such Target Company Benefit Plan ended prior to the date hereof or
have been timely reflected on the most recent consolidated balance sheet filed
prior to the date hereof or accrued in the account records of the Target
Companies and such contributions or premiums have been timely deposited into
the appropriate trusts or accounts.

 



 

(e) None of the Target Companies, nor any of their respective directors,
officers, or employees has engaged in any transaction with respect to any
Benefit Plan or breached any applicable fiduciary responsibilities or
obligations under Title I of ERISA that would subject any of them to a Tax,
penalty or liability for prohibited transactions or breach of any obligations
under ERISA or the Code or would result in any Claim being made under, by or
on behalf of any such Benefit Plan by any party with standing to make such
Claim, except to the extent that any such transaction or breach could not,
individually or in the aggregate, result in a material liability of any Target
Company.

 



 

(f) The execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions do not constitute a triggering event under any Target Company
Benefit Plan, which (either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or
subsequent event) will result in any payment (whether of severance pay or
otherwise), "parachute payment" (as such term is defined in Section 280G of
the Code), acceleration, vesting or increase in benefits to any employee or
former employee or director of any Target Company. Except as set forth on
_Schedule 3.14(f)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter, no Target Company Benefit
Plan provides for the payment of severance, termination, change in control or
similar-type payments or benefits.

 



 

(g) The Target Companies have classified all individuals who perform services
for them correctly under each Target Company Benefit Plan, ERISA, the Code and
other applicable Legal Requirements as common law employees, independent
contractors or leased employees.

 



 

(h) With respect to each Target Company Benefit Plan, Rockwood Specialties has
made available to the Purchasers true, correct and complete copies of: (i) all
Target Company Benefit Plans as in effect on the date hereof, together with
all amendments thereto, including, in the case of any Target Company Benefit
Plan not set forth in writing, a written description thereof; (ii) all current
summary plan descriptions and summaries of material modifications; (iii) all
current trust agreements, declarations of trust and other documents
establishing other funding arrangements (and all amendments thereto and the
latest financial statements thereof); (iv) the most recent IRS determination
letter or opinion letter, if any, obtained with respect to each Target Company
Benefit Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code or
exempt under Section 501(a) or 501(c)(9) of the Code; (v) the annual report on
IRS Form 5500-series or 990 for each of the last three years for each Target
Company Benefit Plan required to file such form; (vi) the two most recently
prepared actuarial valuation reports; (vii) the most

 



      
 

 



 

recently prepared financial statements; and (vii) with respect to each Target
Company Benefit Plan, any service provider agreements, insurance contracts,
annuity contracts, investment management agreements, subscription agreements,
participation agreements, recordkeeping agreements and collective bargaining
agreements.

 



 

(i) The UK Plan is a registered pension scheme within the meaning of the UK
Finance Act 2004, and Rockwood Specialties is not aware of any reason why the
UK Plans registered status will or may cease.

 



 

(j) No Target Company has been a party to an act, or a deliberate failure to
act, which might result in a contribution notice being issued to any Target
Company by TPR under section 38 or 47 of the PA04 in respect of the UK Plan.
No Target Company has at any time within the 12 months before the Closing Date
been "connected" with or an "associate" of any employer that is or has been
participating in a pension scheme established in the U.K. (other than the UK
Plan) to which sections 38, 43, 47 or 52 of the PA04 applies (for these
purposes, "connected" and "associate" have the meanings given to them in
sections 435 and 249 of the UK Insolvency Act 1986, respectively). No
financial support direction, contribution notice or restoration order has been
issued by TPR under sections 38, 43, 47 or 52 of the PA04 against any Target
Company or any of their directors and to the Knowledge of Rockwood there are
no circumstances that are likely to lead to any direction, notice or order
being issued.

 



 

(k) To the Knowledge of Rockwood, each of the Target Companies has complied
with its notification obligations under section 69 and section 70 of the PA04.

 



 

(l) No Canadian Target Company Benefit Plan is a "registered pension plan" as
defined in ITA.

 



 

(m) There are no unfunded liabilities in respect of any Canadian Target
Company Benefit Plan.

 



 

(n) With the exception of the Registered Retirement Savings Plan or as may be
required by any applicable Legal Requirements, none of the Canadian Target
Company Benefit Plans provide benefits after the date of retirement or other
termination of service to employees or former employees of AlphaGary Canada or
to the beneficiaries or dependents of such employees.

a violation by any Target Company of, or a failure on the part of any Target

expected to give rise to any obligation on the part of any Target Company to
undertake, or to bear all or any portion of the cost of, any remedial action
of any nature; and

 



 

(iii) no Target Company has received within the last three years any written
notice, Order or other written communication from any Person regarding any

one or more of the Purchasers shall enter into an agreement, in form
reasonably satisfactory to Seller, containing covenants to indemnify the
Rockwood Sellers in respect of any liability or any expense incurred by the
Rockwood Sellers (or any Affiliate thereof, other than the Target Companies)

of the Rockwood Sellers, lend reasonable cooperation to the Rockwood Sellers
and their Representatives in their inquires and investigations related to
Claims or Proceedings relating to the Business prior to the Closing (other

pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall be conducted in such manner as not to
unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the Purchasers. Any

Business Days of the date of the Receivables Notice, all of the Accounts
Receivable reflected on the Closing Date Balance Sheet that are at the

representation or recourse.

 



 

(d) Any amounts subsequently collected by the Purchasers or the Target
Companies in respect of returned Accounts Receivables for which the Purchaser
or the Target Companies have received payment shall be paid promptly to the
Rockwood Sellers. For the purposes of identifying returned Accounts
Receivables, any payment received from an account debtor will be applied
against Accounts Receivables specified by the account debtor or, if no such
Accounts Receivable are specified, the payment will be deemed to be payment
with respect to the oldest accounts receivable less than 120 days old of that
account debtor.

 



 

6.8 _Further Assurances_. At any time and from time to time after the Closing
Date without further consideration, the Purchasers shall, at the reasonable

prior to the Closing Date. Such authority shall include the determination of
the manner in which any items of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit
arising out of the income, properties and operations of the Target Companies
shall be reported or disclosed in such Tax Returns. Such Tax Returns shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with the past practices of the Target
Companies, except to the extent (i) required by applicable Legal Requirements,
(ii) there would not be an adverse effect on the Tax liability of the
Purchasers or their Related Persons (including, after the Closing, the Target
Companies) or (iii) consented to by the Purchasers (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or

 



       
 

 



 

conditioned). The Purchasers shall cooperate in causing the Target Companies
to provide required signatures for such Tax Returns. In addition, except as
provided in Section 9.11, the Rockwood Sellers shall pay on or prior to the
due date, any amount due and payable on such Tax Returns, except to the extent
that such amount was (A) deducted in the calculation of Closing Date Working
Capital or (B) is imposed as a result of (x) any action outside the Ordinary
Course of Business after the Closing effected by Purchasers or any Related
Persons of any Purchaser (including the Target Companies after the Closing
Date) or (y) any Tax election made by Purchasers or any Related Persons of any
Purchaser (including the Target Companies after the Closing Date) (other than
the election described in Section 9.8 or any such election directed by or

responsible for any such amount. The Purchasers or any Related Person of any
Purchaser (including the Target Companies after the Closing Date) shall not
file or cause to be filed any amended Tax Return with respect to any Target
Company for any Pre-Closing Period, except to the extent there would not be an
adverse effect on the Tax liability of the Rockwood Sellers or their Related
Persons (including the Target Companies for Pre-Closing Periods).

 



 

(b) To the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, Purchasers
Representative, Sellers Representative and their Related Persons shall
cooperate in making any elections or taking any other action that will result
in taxable periods of the Target Companies that begin prior to the Closing
Date ending on or prior to the Closing Date. Except as provided in Section
9.1(a), the Purchasers shall have the exclusive authority and obligation to
prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely filed, all Tax
Returns of the Target Companies; _provided_ that with respect to Tax Returns
to be filed by the Purchasers pursuant to this Section 9.1 for taxable periods
beginning before the Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date (the "
_Overlap Period_ "), such Tax Returns shall not be filed without the prior
written consent of the Rockwood Sellers, which consent shall not be

manner consistent with the past practices of the Target Companies, except to
the extent required by applicable Legal Requirements.

 



 

9.2 _Overlap Period_. All Taxes of the Target Companies for any Overlap Period
shall be apportioned between the portion of the Overlap Period ending on the
Closing Date and the portion following the Closing Date as follows: (i) in the
case of Taxes other than income, profits, gains, value added, stamp, sales and
use and withholding Taxes, on a per-diem-basis and (ii) in the case of income,
profits, gains, value added, stamp, sales and use and withholding Taxes, as
determined from the books and records of each Target Company as though the
taxable year of such Target Company terminated at the close of business on the
Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, all Taxes and Tax liabilities
attributable to the sale (or deemed sale under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code)
of the Purchased IP or the Purchased Equity Interests pursuant to this
Agreement shall be apportioned solely to the portion of the Overlap Period
ending on the Closing Date and be an obligation of the Rockwood Sellers as
provided below. The Rockwood Sellers shall be liable for Taxes with respect to
the income, assets or operations of the Target Companies or the ownership of
the Purchased IP or the Purchased Equity Interests that are attributable to
the portion of the Overlap Period ending on and including the Closing Date,
and shall pay such amounts to the Purchasers on or before five days prior to
the due date of such Taxes, except as provided in Section 9.11 and except to
the extent that such amounts were paid prior to the Closing Date, deducted in
the calculation of Closing Date Working Capital or are imposed as a result of
any action outside the Ordinary Course of Business after the Closing

 



      
 

 



 

effected by Purchasers or any Related Persons of any Purchaser (including the
Target Companies after the Closing Date) or any Tax election made by
Purchasers or any Related Persons of any Purchaser (including the Target
Companies after the Closing Date) (other than the election described in
Section 9.8 or any such election directed by or consented to by the Rockwood
Sellers).

 



 

9.3 _Controversies_.

 



 

(a) The Purchasers Representative shall promptly notify the Sellers
Representative upon receipt by the Purchasers or any Related Persons of any
Purchaser (including the Target Companies after the Closing Date) of written
notice of any inquiries, claims, assessments, audits or similar events with
respect to Taxes relating to a taxable period ending on or prior to the
Closing Date for which the Rockwood Sellers may be liable under this Agreement
(any such inquiry, claim, assessment, audit or similar event, a " _Tax Matter_
"). The Rockwood Sellers or the Sellers Representative, at their or its sole
expense, shall have the authority to represent the interests of the Target
Companies with respect to any Tax Matter before any Tax authority, other
Governmental Body or any court and shall have the sole right to control the
defense, compromise or other resolution of any Tax Matter, including
responding to inquiries, filing Tax Returns and contesting, defending against
and resolving any assessment for additional Taxes or notice of Tax deficiency
or other adjustment of Taxes of, or relating to, a Tax Matter; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that neither the Rockwood Sellers nor any of their Related Persons
shall enter into any settlement of or otherwise compromise any Tax Matter that
adversely affects or may adversely affect the Tax liability of the Purchasers,
any Subsidiaries of the Purchasers, the Target Companies or any Related
Persons of the foregoing for any period ending after the Closing Date,
including the portion of the Overlap Period that is after the Closing Date,
without the prior written consent of the Purchasers, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Rockwood Sellers or the Sellers
Representative shall keep the Purchasers fully and timely informed with
respect to the commencement, status and nature of any Tax Matter that may
affect the liability of the Target Companies for periods after the Closing.
The Rockwood Sellers shall, in good faith, allow the Purchasers to make
comments to the Rockwood Sellers or Sellers Representative, as the case may
be, regarding the conduct of or positions taken in any such proceeding that
may affect the liability of the Target Companies for periods after the
Closing.

 



 

(b) The Sellers Representative and the Purchasers Representative shall
jointly control the defense, compromise or other resolution of any Tax Matter
related to an Overlap Period, which control shall be exercised reasonably and
in good faith with due regard to the relative Tax liability potentially
incurred by either party. The parties shall keep each other fully and timely
informed with respect to the commencement, status and nature of any such Tax
Matter.

 



 

(c) The Purchasers shall have the sole right to control any Tax Matter before
any Governmental Body, initiate any claim for refund or amend any Tax Return,
and contest, resolve and defend against any assessment for additional Taxes,
notice of Tax deficiency or other adjustment of Taxes of or relating to, the
income, assets or operations of the Target Companies or the ownership of the
Purchased IP or the Purchased Equity Interests for all taxable periods
beginning after the Closing Date.

 



      
 

 



 

9.4 _Transfer Taxes_. Except as provided in Section 9.11, all transfer, sales
and use, registration, stamp and similar Taxes imposed in connection with the
sale of the Purchased IP or Purchased Equity Interests, or any other
transaction that occurs pursuant to this Agreement shall be borne solely by
the Rockwood Sellers, jointly and severally. The Rockwood Sellers shall
promptly reimburse the Purchasers in an amount equal to any such Tax that any
Purchaser is required to pay under any applicable Legal Requirement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Taxes paid by the Rockwood Sellers pursuant
to this Section 9.4, which are thereafter recovered by the Purchasers shall be
promptly paid by the recipient of such recovered Taxes to the Rockwood
Sellers.

 



 

9.5 _Amended Tax Returns; Tax Refunds_. The Sellers Representative (or its
designee) will be entitled to retain, or receive prompt payment from
Purchasers or any Related Persons of any Purchaser (including the Target
Companies after the Closing Date) of, any refund or credit for overpayment of
Taxes for which the Rockwood Sellers are responsible pursuant to this Article
9 plus any interest received or credited with respect thereto from the
relevant Governmental Body. The Purchasers Representative will, if the
Sellers Representative reasonably requests and at the Sellers
Representatives expense, cause Purchasers or any Related Persons of any
Purchaser (including the Target Companies after the Closing Date) to promptly
file for and obtain any refunds or credits to which the Sellers
Representative is entitled under this Section 9.5. The Sellers
Representative may prosecute any such claim for refund and, when deemed
appropriate by the Sellers Representative, will cause the relevant entity to
authorize, by appropriate power of attorney, such person as the Sellers
Representative may designate to represent such entity with respect to such
refund claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Sellers Representative shall
not take any action that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
Tax liability of Purchasers or any Related Persons of any Purchaser (including
the Target Companies after the Closing Date) for taxable periods after the
Closing Date without the prior consent of Purchasers Representative (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). For purposes of this
Section 9.5, a party will be deemed to have made prompt payment of a refund or
credit if such payment is made within 10 days of the receipt by such party of
such refund or of the use by such party of such credit.

 



 

9.6 _Prior Tax Agreements_. The Sellers shall terminate or cause to be
terminated any and all of the Tax sharing, allocation, indemnification or
similar Contracts in effect on the Closing Date as between the Rockwood
Sellers or any predecessor or Related Person thereof (other than any Target
Company), on the one hand, and any Target Company, on the other hand, for all
Taxes imposed by any Governmental Body, regardless of the period in which such
Taxes are imposed, and there shall be no continuing obligation to make any
payments under any such agreements, arrangements or undertakings.

 



 

9.7 _Indemnification for Taxes_. Except as provided in Section 9.11 and except
to the extent that such Taxes (a) were deducted in the calculation of Closing
Date Working Capital or were paid prior to the Closing or (b) are incurred as
a result of any action outside the Ordinary Course of Business after the
Closing effected by Purchasers or any Related Persons of any Purchaser
(including the Target Companies after the Closing Date) or any Tax election
made by Purchasers or any Related Persons of any Purchaser (including the
Target Companies after the Closing Date) (other than the election described in
Section 9.8 or any such election directed by or consented to by the Rockwood
Sellers), the Rockwood Sellers shall indemnify and hold

 



      
 

 



 

harmless the Purchasers and their Representatives, shareholders and their
Related Persons (the " _Purchaser Indemnified Persons_ "), and will pay the
Purchaser Indemnified Persons for: (i) all Taxes (and, for purposes of this
Section 9.7 any Damages resulting from, arising from or in connection with, or
incurred with respect to, any claims that may be asserted by any Person based
on, attributable to, or resulting from the failure of any representation or
warranty made pursuant to Section 3.12 to be true and correct in all respects
as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date shall constitute
Taxes) imposed on the Target Companies for all Pre-Closing Periods, (ii) all
Taxes imposed on the Target Companies with respect to income of the Rockwood
Sellers or any of their Related Persons (other than the Target Companies) as a
result of the provisions of United States Treasury Regulations Section

Requirement, (iii) all Taxes imposed on the Target Companies, or for which the
Target Companies may be liable, on the sale of the Purchased IP and the
Reorganization and (v) any Taxes imposed on the deemed sale resulting from the
joint election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code to treat the sale of stock
pursuant to this Agreement as an asset sale for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, and any analogous provisions of state and local law.

 



 

9.8 _Section 338 Election_.

 



 

(a) Rockwood Holdings and Mexichem shall jointly complete and make, or cause
to be completed and made, a timely election under Section 338(h)(10) of the

manner as may be required by rule or regulation of the IRS, and shall jointly
make an election in the manner required under any analogous joint election
provisions of state or local law concerning the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Mexichem shall, with the assistance and cooperation of
Rockwood Specialties Group and Rockwood Specialties, prepare all such Section
338(h)(10) forms required as attachments to Form 8023 (and all forms under
analogous provisions of state or local law) in accordance with applicable Tax
Legal Requirements, and Mexichem shall deliver such forms and related
documents to Rockwood Specialties Group and Rockwood Specialties at least 60
days prior to the due date of filing. Rockwood Specialties Group and Rockwood
Specialties shall deliver to Mexichem, at least 30 days prior to the due date
of filing, such duly executed completed forms as are required to be filed
under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and analogous provisions of state or
local law).

 



 

(b) The Sellers agree that the Purchasers shall perform or cause to be
performed an initial valuation of assets and allocation of purchase price of
AlphaGary Corporation for purposes of Section 338 of the Code. The Purchasers
shall provide the Rockwood Sellers with drafts of such valuation of assets and
allocation and computation of the aggregate deemed sale price (as defined
under Treasury Regulations Section 1.338-4) (which shall be prepared on a
basis consistent with Section 9.8(a)) within 120 days after the Closing Date.
The Rockwood Sellers shall have 45 days to provide the Purchasers with any
objections to such drafts. If the Rockwood Sellers shall object to the
computation or allocation by the Purchasers of such amounts, and the
Purchasers and the Rockwood Sellers shall not reach agreement on the
computation or allocation within 30 Business Days after notification by the
Rockwood Sellers of their objection, the Purchasers and the Rockwood Sellers
shall submit the issue to the Independent Accountant for resolution of the
disagreement within 10 days (it being agreed that the Purchasers and the
Rockwood Sellers will jointly share the fees and expenses of the

 



      
 

 



 

Independent Accountant). The valuations and allocations determined pursuant to
this Section 9.8(b) shall be used for purposes of all relevant Tax Returns,
reports and filings.

 



 

9.9 _Pre-Closing Tax Payments_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, any Taxes for a Pre-Closing Period or Overlap Period or that the
Rockwood Sellers are otherwise required to pay pursuant to this Article 9,
including any estimated Taxes, that are paid prior to the Closing shall be
credited against the Rockwood Sellers liability for Taxes pursuant to this
Article 9 and, to the extent such payments of Taxes exceed the Rockwood
Sellers liability for such Taxes pursuant to this Article 9, the Purchasers
shall pay the amount of such excess to the Rockwood Sellers within five days
after the filing of a Tax Return related to such Taxes or the taxable period
with respect to which such Taxes were paid.

 



 

9.10 _Tax Cooperation_. After the Closing Date, each of Sellers
Representative and Purchasers Representative shall, and shall cause their
respective Related Persons to, provide the other party (subject to
reimbursement by the other party for, and only for, any reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses), with such assistance as may reasonably be requested by the
other party in connection with the preparation of any return, report, or form
with respect to Taxes or any administrative or judicial proceeding relating to
liability for Taxes of the Target Companies (or any affiliated, consolidated,
combined or unitary group in which any of the Target Companies is included),
Sellers Representative, Purchasers Representative or any of their respective
Related Persons. For the avoidance of doubt, Purchasers Representative shall
timely provide Sellers Representative with any information and assistance
reasonably required by Sellers Representative in connection with any IRS Form
5471 that any Rockwood Seller is required to filed with respect to any Target
Company. The parties further agree to retain and provide each other with
reasonable access to all books and records relevant to the liabilities of the
Target Companies or the Rockwood Sellers (or any of their Related Persons) for
Taxes for any periods (or portions thereof) prior to the Closing for at least
seven years after the Closing and to give each other notice and an opportunity
to receive such books or records prior to destroying or discarding any such
books or records.

Agreement, Rockwood Sellers shall not be required to pay or indemnify
Purchaser Indemnified Parties from and against, and Purchasers shall be solely

any Benefit Plan that is not a Target Company Benefit Plan. For the avoidance
of doubt, any

Affiliates (other than a Target Company) to, be responsible for any covered
claims incurred (whether prior to or after the Closing) by Business Employees
under any Benefit Plan (other than under any Target Company Benefit Plan). For
purposes of the foregoing, a claim shall be deemed to be incurred at the time
services, with respect to such claim, are rendered and not at the time claim
for payment is made. Rockwood Specialties will be responsible for any
obligation to provide long-term disability benefits to any Business Employee
or any individual formerly employed by the Business who is on long-term

relation to the UK Plan and (y) any liabilities arising from any contribution
notice or financial support direction that may be issued pursuant to PA04 in
relation to the UK Plan. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, the indemnity contained in this Section 10.1(e) shall survive the
Closing indefinitely.

 



 

(ii) Notwithstanding the generality of Section 10.1(e)(i), if any Section 75

either:

 



      
 

 



 

(A) to procure payment to the UK Plan of an amount equal to any such debt (on
the basis that any such payment satisfies the obligation to make such payment

11.1 _Termination Events_. This Agreement may, by written notice given prior
to or at the Closing (such notice to include the reason for termination), be
terminated:

 



 

(a) (i) by the Purchasers, if satisfaction of a condition in Article 7 is or

the breach of the Agreement by the other party or because one or more of the
conditions to the terminating partys obligations under this Agreement is not
satisfied as a result of the other partys failure to comply with its
obligations under this Agreement, the terminating partys right to pursue all
legal remedies will survive such termination unimpaired.

time, whether before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or

(a) The Purchasers shall indemnify and hold harmless the Rockwood Sellers and
their Representatives, shareholders or members, as the case may be, and their

to any Claim for indemnification pursuant to clause (i) of Section 12.3(a):
(A) if the Damages relating thereto (together with all Damages arising out of
the same event or occurrence or series of related events or occurrences or
recurring Damages of a similar nature) are less than twenty five thousand
Dollars ($25,000) in the aggregate (and such Claim shall be disregarded and
shall not be aggregated for purposes of clause (i)(B) of this Section 12.3(b))
and (B) unless and until the aggregate amount of all Claims against the

of such specified date). In addition, none of the limitations set forth in
this Section 12.3(b) shall not apply to Damages that arise from fraud by an

12.4 _Third-Party Claims_.

 



 

(a) Promptly after receipt by a Person entitled to indemnity under Section
12.2 or 12.3 (an " _Indemnified Person_ ") of notice of the assertion of a
Claim by a Third Party (a " _Third-Party Claim_ ") against it, such
Indemnified Person shall give written notice to the Person obligated to
indemnify under such Section (an " _Indemnifying Person_ ") of the assertion
of such Third-Party Claim describing in reasonable detail the basis of such
Claim, _provided_ that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person will not
relieve the Indemnifying Person of any liability that it may have to any
Indemnified Person, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Person
demonstrates that the defense of such Third Party Claim is prejudiced by the
Indemnified Persons failure to give such notice.

 



 

(b) If an Indemnified Person gives notice to the Indemnifying Person pursuant
to Section 12.4(a) of the assertion of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying
Person shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such Third-Party
Claim and, to the extent that it wishes (unless the Indemnifying Person is
also a Person against whom the Third-Party Claim is made and the Indemnified
Person determines in good faith that joint representation would be
inappropriate) with respect to such Third-Party Claim), to assume the defense
of such Third-Party Claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Person. After notice from the Indemnifying Person to the
Indemnified Person of its election to assume the defense of such Third-Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Person shall not, so long as it diligently conducts
such defense, be liable to the Indemnified Person under this Article 12 for
any fees of other counsel or any other expenses with respect to the defense of
such Third-Party Claim, in each case subsequently incurred by the Indemnified
Person in connection with the defense of such Third-Party Claim. If the
Indemnifying Person assumes the defense of a Third-Party Claim, (i) such
assumption will conclusively establish for purposes of this Agreement that the
claims made in that Third-Party

 



      
 

 



 

Claim are within the scope of and subject to indemnification, and (ii) no
compromise or settlement of such Third-Party Claims may be effected by the
Indemnifying Person without the Indemnified Persons consent unless (A) there
is no finding or admission of any violation of Legal Requirement or any
violation of the rights of any Person; (B) the sole relief provided is
monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Person; and (C) the
Indemnified Person shall have no liability with respect to any such compromise
or settlement of such Third-Party Claims effected without its consent. If
notice is given to an Indemnifying Person of the assertion of any Third-Party
Claim and the Indemnifying Person does not, within 30 days after notice is
given to the Indemnified Person, give notice to the Indemnified Person of its
election to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying
Person will be bound by any determination made in such Third-Party Claim, or
any compromise or settlement effected, by the Indemnified Person with the
prior consent of the Indemnifying Person (which consent may not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), and will not be required to
indemnify Purchaser Indemnified Parties in respect of any such determination
made or compromise or settlement effected without such consent.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Indemnified Person determines in good
faith that there is a reasonable probability that a Third-Party Claim may
adversely affect it or its Related Persons other than as a result of monetary
damages for which it would be entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement, the Indemnified Person may, by notice to the Indemnifying Person,
assume the exclusive right to defend, compromise or settle such Third-Party
Claim, but the Indemnifying Person will not be bound by any determination of
any Third-Party Claim so defended for the purposes of this Agreement or any
compromise or settlement effected without its consent (which may not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

 



 

(d) The Sellers hereby consent to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any court
in which a Proceeding in respect of a Third-Party Claim is brought against any
Purchaser Indemnified Person for purposes of any claim that a Purchaser
Indemnified Person may have under this Agreement with respect to such
Proceeding or the matters alleged therein and agree that process may be served
on the Seller with respect to such a claim anywhere in the world.

 



 

(e) The Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying Person, as the case may be,
shall keep the other Person informed of the status of such Third-Party Claim
and any related Proceedings at all stages thereof where such Person is not
represented by its own counsel, and (ii) the parties agree (each at its own
expense) to render to each other such assistance as they may reasonably
require of each other and to cooperate in good faith with each other in order
to ensure the proper and adequate defense of any Third-Party Claim.

 



 

(f) The parties shall cooperate in such a manner as to preserve in full (to
the extent possible) the confidentiality of all confidential information and
the attorney-client and work-product privileges. In connection therewith, each
party agrees that: (i) it will use its commercially reasonable efforts, in
respect of any Third-Party Claim in which it has assumed or participated in
the defense, to avoid production of confidential information (consistent with
applicable law and rules of procedure), and (ii) all communications between
any party hereto and counsel responsible for or participating in the defense
of any Third-Party Claim shall, to the extent possible, be made so as to
preserve any applicable attorney-client or work-product privilege.

 



      
 

 



 

12.5 _Other Claims_. A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving
a Third-Party Claim shall be asserted by written notice to the party from whom
indemnification is sought and shall be shall be made as promptly as
practicable after the time the Indemnified Person becomes aware of the facts
forming the basis of such claim.

 



 

12.6 _Indemnification in Case of Strict Liability or_ _Indemnitee_
_Negligence_. The indemnification provisions in this Article 12 shall be
enforceable regardless of whether the liability of the person seeking
indemnification is based upon a claim of negligence or strict liability, and
regardless of whether any person (including the person from whom
indemnification is sought) alleges or proves the sole, concurrent,
contributory or comparative negligence of the person seeking indemnification
or the sole or concurrent strict liability imposed upon the person seeking
indemnification.

 



 

12.7 _Interest_. In the event that any amount due to any Purchaser Indemnified
Person or Seller Indemnified Person, as the case may be, under this Article 12
or Section 9.7 is not paid when due, the party required to make payment shall
pay interest on such amount at a rate of six percent (6%) per annum, based on
a 360-day year, from the date such amount is payable to the date of actual
payment.

 



 

12.8 _Exclusive Remedy_. The indemnity provided for in this Article 12 and
Section 9.7 shall constitute the parties sole and exclusive remedy with
respect to each other for any and all Claims for Damages (but not specific
performance or other equitable remedies) relating to this Agreement and the
Contemplated Transactions; _provided_ that nothing herein shall limit in any
way any such partys remedies in respect of fraud by the other party in
connection with the Contemplated Transactions. In furtherance of but subject
to the foregoing, each party hereby waives, from and after the Closing, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Legal Requirement, any and all other
rights, claims and causes of action (other than fraud by the other party) that
it has against the other party (or any Related Person of the other party) in
connection with this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions.

 



 

12.9 _Additional Limitations; Adjustments; Mitigation_.

 



 

(a) Any indemnity payment made by the Purchasers on the one hand, or the
Rockwood Sellers, on the other hand, pursuant to this Article 12 and Section
9.7 in respect of any Damage shall be (a) reduced by any insurance proceeds
under applicable insurance policies actually received by a party entitled to
indemnification under this Agreement in respect of such claim and (b)
increased by (i) the aggregate cost of pursuing any related insurance claims
and (ii) any related increases in insurance premiums resulting from insurance
recoveries. The Purchasers and the Rockwood Sellers each agree that they will
(and cause their Affiliates to) use commercially reasonable efforts to recover
any such insurance proceeds under applicable insurance policies to the extent
such recoveries would reduce amounts required to be paid by any party pursuant
to this Article 12. If a party receives any amounts under applicable insurance
policies, or from any other Person alleged to be responsible for any Damages,
subsequent to an indemnification payment, then such party shall promptly
reimburse the party required to provide indemnification for any payment made
or expense incurred by such party in connection with providing such
indemnification payment up to the amount received by such party, net of any
expenses incurred by such party in collecting such amount. The Purchasers
and

 



      
 

 



 

the Rockwood Sellers shall cooperate with each other with respect to resolving
any Claim or liability with respect to which one party is obligated to
indemnify the other party hereunder, including by using reasonable efforts to
minimize Damages or resolve any such Claim or liability and acting in good
faith in responding to, defending against, settling or otherwise dealing with
such Claim.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Rockwood
Sellers obligations under clause (i) of the Section 12.2(a) in respect of any
asserted breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty resulting
from, arising out or in respect of Environmental Liabilities and clause (iii)
of Section 12.2(a) shall in all circumstances be limited to the amount of the
least stringent, lowest cost approach necessary to achieve compliance with
applicable Environmental Laws.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Rockwood
Sellers shall not be responsible for any Damages for which indemnification
would otherwise be available pursuant to clause (iii) of Section 12.2(a) or
clause (i) of Section 12.2(a) (in respect of a breach of a representation and
warranty set forth in Section 3.19 (Environmental Matters)) to the extent that
such Damages would not have arisen but for initiation of any communication
with or notice to a Governmental Body or any other Person, except to the
extent such initiation of communication or notice (i) is required by
Environmental Law (including Governmental Authorizations issued thereunder),
other than any such requirement triggered by (A) the expansion in any manner,
the closure or the demolition after the Closing of any part of any Facility
owned or operated by a Target Company as of the Closing Date, (B) any zoning
or land use Legal Requirements imposed after the Closing Date or (C) any
change after the Closing in the use of any Facility, (ii) has been approved in
writing by the Sellers Representative or (iii) notwithstanding clause (i), is
required by applicable Environmental Law (including Governmental
Authorizations issued thereunder) to be made in connection with the expansion
of the Business Pineville, North Carolina facility.

 



 

12.10 _Application to Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
except for the survival period for indemnification claims for Taxes set forth
in Section 12.1, this Article 12 shall have no application with respect to
indemnification claims related to Taxes, which shall be covered exclusively by
Article 9.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 13 _ 
General Provisions_**

 



 

13.1 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement
(including Section 9.4, Article 11 and this Section 13.1), whether or not the
Closing occurs, each party to this Agreement will bear its respective expenses
(and, in the case of the Rockwood Sellers, the expenses of the Target
Companies) incurred in connection with the preparation, execution and
performance of this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions, including all
fees and expenses of its Representatives. The Purchasers, on the one hand, and
Rockwood Sellers, on the other hand, will each pay one-half of the HSR Act
filing fee. In the event of termination of this Agreement, the obligation of
each party hereto to pay its own expenses will be subject to any rights of
such party arising from a breach of this Agreement by another party, including
Article 11.

than two parties in the arbitration the arbitration tribunal shall be
constituted in accordance with the ICDR Rules. Notwithstanding Section 13.1,
the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover the costs and expenses of
the arbitration and of any action for interim relief or enforcement of the
award, which costs and expenses shall include reasonable attorneys fees. The
award of the arbitral tribunal shall be final and binding on the parties
thereto. Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered
and a confirmation order sought in any court having jurisdiction.

 



 

(c) An arbitral tribunal constituted under this Agreement may, unless
consolidation would prejudice the rights of any party, consolidate an
arbitration hereunder with arbitration under any documents entered into in
connection with this Agreement if the arbitration proceedings raise common
questions of law and fact. If two or more arbitral tribunals under these
agreements issue consolidation orders, the order issued first shall prevail.

 



 

(d) The parties undertake to keep confidential all awards in their
arbitration, together with all materials in the proceedings created for the
purpose of the arbitration and all other documents produced by another party
in the proceedings not otherwise in the public domain, save and to the extent
that disclosure may be required of a party by applicable Legal Requirements or
any self-regulatory or national securities exchange, to potential lenders,
investors or potential purchasers of all or any part of a parties business, to
protect or pursue a

 



      
 

 



 

legal right or to enforce or challenge the arbitration agreement or an award
in legal proceedings before a court or other judicial authority.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding Section 13.5(a), the parties hereto hereby acknowledge and
agree that they may apply to any court having jurisdiction for interim relief,
including temporary restraining orders or preliminary injunctions, in addition
to any remedy to which the parties may be entitled in any arbitration
proceeding.

 



 

(f) For purposes of any proceeding to enforce or confirm an award of the
arbitral tribunal pursuant to this Section 13.5 or any action brought pursuant
to Section 13.5(e), each party hereto hereby expressly submits to the non-
exclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York and of any New York State Court sitting in the City of
New York. Each party hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, any objection which it may have or
hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such proceeding brought in
such a court and any claim that any such proceeding brought in such a court
has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each party hereto consents to
process being served in any such proceeding by the mailing of a copy thereof
by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to its address specified in
Section 13.3 or in any other manner permitted by applicable Legal
Requirements. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND
INTENTIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHTS IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING.

 



 

13.6 _Waiver_. The rights and remedies of the parties to this Agreement are
cumulative and not alternative. Neither the failure nor any delay by any party
hereto in exercising any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement or
the documents referred to in this Agreement will operate as a waiver of such
right, power, or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such
right, power, or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of such
right, power, or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power, or
privilege. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirement,
(a) no claim or right arising out of this Agreement or the documents referred
to in this Agreement can be discharged by one party, in whole or in part, by a
waiver or renunciation of the claim or right unless in writing signed by the
other party; (b) no waiver that may be given by a party will be applicable
except in the specific instance for which it is given; and (c) no notice to or
demand on one party will be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of such
party or of the right of the party giving such notice or demand to take
further action without notice or demand as provided in this Agreement or the
documents referred to in this Agreement.

 



 

13.7 _Entire Agreement and Modification_. This Agreement supersedes all prior
agreements between the parties with respect to its subject matter and
constitutes (along with the documents referred to in this Agreement) a
complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement between the
parties with respect to its subject matter. This Agreement may not be amended
except by a written agreement executed by the party hereto to be charged with
the amendment.

 



 

13.8 _Assignments, Successors, and No Third-Party Rights_. No party hereto may
assign any of its rights under this Agreement without the prior consent of the
other parties, which will not be unreasonably withheld. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement will apply to,

 



      
 

 



 

be binding in all respects upon, and inure to the benefit of the successors
and permitted assigns of the parties hereto. Except for Persons entitled to
indemnification under Article 12, a Person that is not a party hereto shall
have no right to under the Contract (Rights of Third Parties) Act of 1999 to
enforce any of the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

13.9 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or
unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of
this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. Any provision of this
Agreement held invalid or unenforceable only in part or degree will remain in
full force and effect to the extent not held invalid or unenforceable.

 



 

13.10 _Joint and Several Obligations_. Any and all obligations or duties of
the Rockwood Sellers under this Agreement shall be joint and several and any
and all obligations or duties of the Purchasers under this Agreement shall be

without the necessity of proving the inadequacy as a remedy of money damages.
