   and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

            (c) Conversion of Company Stock. (i) (A) Each share of Common Stock
   issued and outstanding (other than shares of Common Stock to be canceled in
   accordance with Section 2.1(b)) shall be converted into the right to receive
   the sum of (x) the Initial Common Stock Cash Consideration in cash, without
   interest, and (y) a portion of the Escrow Funds (the "Escrow Consideration"),
   such portion determined as provided in the Escrow Agreement, and (B) each
   share of Preferred Stock issued and outstanding (other than any shares of
   Preferred Stock to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.1(b)) shall be
   converted into the right to receive the Preferred Stock Consideration in
   cash, without interest. The "Initial Merger Consideration" means the sum of
   the Initial Common Stock Cash Consideration, the Escrow Consideration and the
   Preferred Stock Consideration.

        (ii) As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Stock shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall
cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such shares of
Company Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive for each share the Initial Common Stock Cash Consideration or
the Preferred Stock Consideration, as the case may be, without interest upon
surrender of such certificate in accordance with, or as otherwise contemplated
by, Section 2.2, plus, in the case of each such share of Common Stock, the right
to receive its applicable fractional interest in the Escrow Consideration, if
any, in each case, in accordance with the applicable terms hereof and the Escrow
Agreement.

            (d) Withholding Tax. Subject to Section 11.7, the Parent and the
   Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
   consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
   shares of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
   such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to
   the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
   amended (the "Code"), or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law.
   For the avoidance of doubt, the full amount of any withholding required with
   respect to the consideration to be paid to a holder of Common Stock under
   Section 2.1(c)(i)(A) may be withheld from the Initial Common Stock Cash
   Consideration payable to such holder. To the extent that amounts are so
   withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
   Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Stock
   outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time in respect of which such
   deduction and withholding was made.

      2.2 Payment Procedures. Immediately after the Effective Time, the Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay the applicable Initial Common Stock
Cash Consideration to each holder of Common Stock and the applicable Preferred
Stock Consideration to each holder of Preferred Stock that has (a) either
tendered to the Company certificate(s) representing all of such holder's shares
of Common Stock or Preferred Stock, as the case may be, to be converted in the
Merger (such certificates to be duly endorsed in blank or accompanied by stock
powers or other instruments of transfer duly executed in blank, in either case,
and with wire instructions for such holder's receipt of such payment) or
delivered a lost certificate affidavit in form reasonably satisfactory to the
Parent to the effect that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed
(and, if required by the Parent, the posting by such holder of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as the Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to that certificate), (b) duly consented to
the Merger in accordance with Section 228 of the DGCL, and (c) with respect to
any holder other than the Primary Shareholders, executed and delivered a Holder
Agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit E (each such agreement
individually, a "Holder Agreement" and, collectively, the "Holder Agreements").

      2.3 Option and Deferred Stock Unit Cancellation.

            (a) Each Company Option, whether vested or unvested, shall be
   canceled in exchange for a cash payment equal to the Option Cancellation
   Amount. Subject to Section 2.3(c) and to the execution and delivery by each
   Option Holder of a Holder Agreement, the Company shall pay the applicable
   portion of the Option Cancellation Amount consisting of the Initial Common
   Stock Cash Consideration less the Exercise Price of such Company Option owing
   to each Option Holder immediately after the Effective Time and shall pay the
   remaining portion of the Option Cancellation

                                       4
<PAGE>

   Amount to each such Option Holder as and if the same becomes due and payable,
   in accordance with the applicable terms hereof and the Escrow Agreement.

            (b) Each Deferred Stock Unit owned by a DSU Holder, whether vested
   or unvested, shall be canceled in exchange for a cash payment to such DSU
   Holder equal to the Initial Common Stock Cash Consideration, plus the right
   to receive its portion of the Escrow Funds, if any, as and if the same
   becomes due and payable, in accordance with the applicable terms hereof and
   the Escrow Agreement. Subject to Section 2.3(c), the Company shall pay the
   amount consisting of the Initial Common Stock Cash Consideration owing to
   each such DSU Holder pursuant to this Section 2.3 immediately after the
   Effective Time and the remaining portion of such amount shall be paid to each
   such DSU Holder, as and if the same becomes due and payable, in accordance
   with the applicable terms hereof and the Escrow Agreement.

            (c) Withholding Tax -- Option Loan Repayment. Subject to Section
   11.7, the Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct
   and withhold, or cause to be deducted or withheld, from any payment made
   pursuant to this Section 2.3, such amounts as are required to be deducted and
   withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any
   provision of applicable U.S. federal, state, local or foreign tax law. For
   the avoidance of doubt, the full amount of any withholding required with
   respect to the consideration to be paid to an Option Holder under Section
   2.3(a) and to a DSU Holder under Section 2.3(b) may be withheld from the
   Initial Common Stock Cash Consideration payable to such holder. To the extent
   that amounts are so deducted and withheld from any such holder, such deducted
   and withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
   having been paid to such holder. Notwithstanding anything herein or in any
   Option Loan to the contrary, any amount otherwise payable to an Option Holder
   pursuant to Section 2.3(a), after any deduction or withholding pursuant to
   this Section 2.3(c), shall be applied first to discharge all outstanding
   principal and accrued but unpaid interest on any Option Loan to which such
   Option Holder is a party. This Section 2.3 shall be interpreted in a manner
   to avoid adverse consequences under Section 409A of the Code to the greatest
   extent practicable.

      2.4 Escrow Funds.

            (a) Deposit into Escrow. At the Effective Time, the Parent shall
   cause the Surviving Corporation to deliver an amount equal to the Escrow
   Funds to the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
   Agreement.

            (b) Release from Escrow. From and after the Effective Time, the
   Escrow Funds shall be released to the Parent and/or paid to the Holders,
   respectively, in accordance with, and subject to the conditions set forth in,
   this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

                                  ARTICLE III

                    INITIAL MERGER CONSIDERATION ADJUSTMENTS

      3.1 Delivery of Estimated Closing Statement. No later than the fifth
Business Day prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to the Parent
a statement (the "Estimated Closing Statement") of the Estimated Closing Equity
and Estimated Cash Shortfall and a calculation of the Preliminary Adjustment
Amount, together with supporting calculations. As used in this Agreement, the
"Preliminary Adjustment Amount" shall mean an amount equal to the sum of (a) the
excess, if any, of (i) the Target Equity over (ii) the Estimated Closing Equity
plus (b) the Estimated Cash Shortfall.

      3.2 Delivery and Review of Closing Statement.

            (a) Preparation of Closing Statement. As promptly as practicable,
   but no later than 120 days after the Closing Date, the Parent in good faith
   shall prepare and deliver to the Representative, at the Parent's expense, a
   statement (the "Closing Statement") of the Closing Equity and the Cash
   Shortfall, if any, together with supporting calculations.

            (b) Review of Closing Statement. The Representative shall have 30
   days from the date on which the Closing Statement is delivered to it to
   review such documents relating to the Parent's computation as the
   Representative may reasonably request (the "Review Period"). During the
   Review Period, the Representative and its representatives will have
   reasonable access to all documentation or work papers reasonably requested by
   the Representative related to the Parent's computation of Closing Equity and
   the Cash Shortfall (it being understood that access to any work papers of any
   third party accountants shall require the execution of a customary access
   letter). If the Representative believes the computation of Closing Equity or
   Cash Shortfall (i) has not been prepared in accordance with the principles,
   procedures and elections referred to in the definitions of Closing Equity and
   Closing Cash Balance or (ii) is not mathematically correct, the
   Representative may, on or prior to the last day of the Review Period, deliver
   a notice to the Parent to such effect, setting forth, in reasonable detail,
   each disputed item, the amount disputed and the basis for the
   Representative's disagreement therewith, together with supporting
   calculations and the Representative's position as to the proper calculation
   of such amount (the "Dispute Notice"). For the avoidance of doubt, the
   Representative may provide a Dispute Notice on the basis only of the matters
   referred to in clauses (i) or (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence. If
   no Dispute Notice is received by the Parent on or prior to the last day of
   the Review Period, the Closing Statement and the computation of the Closing
   Equity and Cash Shortfall set forth therein shall be deemed accepted by the
   Representative for all purposes of this Agreement.

                                       6
<PAGE>

      3.3 The Accountant. If the Representative delivers a Dispute Notice, the
Parent and the Representative will negotiate in good faith for 15 Business Days
in order to determine the actual Closing Equity and Cash Shortfall. If the
parties fail to so resolve the dispute by the end of the 15th Business Day
following the delivery of the Dispute Notice, any dispute shall be determined
within 45 days thereafter by a nationally recognized firm of independent
certified public accountants (the "Accountant") mutually agreeable to the Parent
and the Representative. The Accountant shall determine, based solely on written
presentations by the Parent and the Representative and their respective
representatives, and not by independent review, only those issues in dispute
specifically set forth in the Dispute Notice that have not previously been
resolved between the Parent and the Representative. Such written presentations
shall be made to the Accountant within 30 days of the engagement of the
Accountant. In resolving any disputed item, the Accountant: (a) shall be bound
by the principles set forth in the definitions of Closing Equity and Closing
Cash Balance, (b) shall limit its review to matters specifically set forth in
the Dispute Notice, and (c) shall further limit its review solely to whether the
determination of Closing Equity and the Cash Shortfall set forth in the Closing
Statement is mathematically accurate and has been prepared in accordance with
Section 3.2. The determination of the Accountant in respect of any disputed item
in the Dispute Notice cannot, however, be in excess of, nor less than, the
greatest or lowest value, respectively, claimed for that particular item in the
Parent's Closing Statement or in the Representative's Dispute Notice.

      3.4 The Adjustment Report. The Accountant shall, as promptly as
practicable and in no event later than 45 days following the date of its
retention, deliver to the Representative and the Parent a report (the
"Adjustment Report"), in which the Accountant shall, after considering all
matters set forth in the Dispute Notice, determine in accordance with Section
3.2 what adjustments, if any, should be made to the Closing Equity and the Cash
Shortfall. The Adjustment Report shall set forth, in reasonable detail, the
Accountant's determination with respect to each of the disputed items or amounts
specified in the Dispute Notice, and the revisions, if any, to be made to the
Closing Equity and/or the Cash Shortfall together with supporting calculations.
The determination of the Accountant will be final and binding on the parties
hereto and judgment may be entered upon the determination of the Accountant in
any court having jurisdiction over the party against which such determination is
to be enforced. The fees, costs and expenses of the Accountant shall be borne by
the Parent and the Company, jointly and severally, in the event that Closing
Equity (or, in the event that Closing Equity is not a subject of the Dispute
Notice, the Closing Cash Balance), as set forth in the Adjustment Report, is
closer to the amount proposed by the Representative to the Accountant than to
the amount proposed by the Parent to the Accountant, and otherwise shall be paid
by the Representative on behalf of the Holders, which may use the Escrow Funds
in accordance with the terms of Section 7 of the Escrow Agreement.

      3.5 Adjustment and Payment.

            (a) Effective upon the end of the Review Period (if a timely Dispute
   Notice is not delivered), or upon the resolution of all matters set forth in
   the Dispute Notice by agreement of the parties or by the issuance of the
   Adjustment Report (if a timely Dispute Notice is delivered), the Final
   Adjustment Amount and the Net Adjustment Amount shall be determined. The
   "Final Adjustment Amount" shall mean an amount equal to the sum of (a) the
   excess, if any, of (i) the Target Equity over (ii) the Closing Equity plus
   (b) the Cash Shortfall, if any. The "Net Adjustment Amount" shall mean an
   amount equal to the excess, if any, of the Final Adjustment Amount over the
   Preliminary Adjustment Amount.

            (b) Any Net Adjustment Amount payable pursuant to this Section 3.5
   shall be paid on the fifth Business Day following the end of the Review
   Period (if a timely Dispute Notice is not delivered), or on the fifth
   Business Day following either the date on which the Adjustment Report has
   been received by the Parent and the Representative (if a timely Dispute
   Notice is delivered) or the date on which the Parent and Representative
   otherwise resolve all matters in respect of a Dispute Notice, in either case,
   through the distribution by the Escrow Agent to the Parent from the Escrow
   Funds, to the extent of funds available therefor, of an amount equal to the
   Net Adjustment Amount. The Parent's sole and exclusive recourse for any
   amounts due under this Section 3.5 shall be limited to the collection of any
   amounts held in the Escrow Funds in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
   Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

      Except as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered to the Parent on
the date hereof and constituting an integral part of this Agreement (the
"Disclosure Letter") (and any fact or item disclosed in any Schedule to the
Disclosure Letter shall be deemed disclosed in all other Schedules thereof to
which such fact or item applies, but only if the application of such fact or
item to such other Schedule is reasonably apparent from a reasonable reading of
the disclosure made in the Schedule, and shall otherwise not qualify or be an
exception to any representation and warranty other than the specific
representation and warranty to which such Schedule relates), the Company
represents and warrants to the Parent and the Sub, as of the date hereof and as

<PAGE>

   "Deferred Stock Units"), outstanding. Schedule 4.2(b) of the Disclosure
   Letter contains a complete and correct list of (i) each holder of Company

   organization are identified on Schedule 4.3 of the Disclosure Letter. Each of

   entity, as the case may be, duly organized and validly existing and in good
   standing (if applicable) under the laws of its jurisdiction, (ii) has all
   requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to
   carry on its business as presently conducted and (iii) is duly qualified and
   in good standing (if applicable) as a foreign corporation duly authorized to
   do business in all jurisdictions, except, in the case of clause (ii) and
   (iii), where the failure to have such power and authority or to be duly
   qualified and in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have,
   individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Other than the
   Company Subsidiaries, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary owns any
   capital stock, membership interest, partnership interest, joint venture
   interest or other equity interest in any other Person.

            (b) All of the issued and outstanding shares or other ownership
   interests of each Company Subsidiary have been duly authorized and validly
   issued and are fully paid and non-assessable and, now and at the Closing, all

            (a) The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this
   Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and the consummation of the
   transactions contemplated hereby and thereby do not and will not (with or
   without the giving of notice, the lapse of time, or both) conflict with, or
   result in any violation or breach of, or require any Consent under or give
   rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any
   obligation or to loss of a material benefit under, or result in the creation
   of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of the Company or any
   Company Subsidiary under (i) assuming compliance with the matters referred to
   in Section 4.4(b), any Applicable Law applicable to the Company, any of the
   Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets, (ii)
   any Material Contract to which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
   is a party or by which any of them or their properties or assets is bound or
   affected or (iii) any Organizational Documents of the Company or any of the
   Company Subsidiaries, except in the case of clauses (i) and (ii) above, for
   any such violation, breach or approval which would not reasonably be expected
   to materially impair the ability of the Company to consummate the
   transactions contemplated by this Agreement or to otherwise have,
   individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

            (b) No Governmental Approval is required to be obtained or made by
   or with respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary in connection with
   the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Transaction
   Documents or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or
   thereby, except (i) any Governmental Approvals required to be obtained or
   made, as the case may be, as a result of any legal or regulatory status of,
   or other facts pertaining specifically to, the Parent, the Sub or any of
   their respective Affiliates, (ii) filings required with respect to the
   Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR
   Act"), and (iii) where the failure to do so would not reasonably be expected
   to materially impair the ability of the Company to consummate the
   transactions contemplated by this Agreement or to otherwise have,
   individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

      4.5 Financial Statements. The Company has made available to the Parent
complete and correct copies of (a) the audited consolidated balance sheet of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries as at December 31, 2004 and December 31,
2003, and the statements of income and cash flows for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, together with the report thereon by the
Company's accountants (the "Audited Financial Statements"), and (b) the
unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
as at November 30, 2005 and the related statements of income and cash flows for
the eleven month period ended November 30, 2005 (the "Unaudited Interim
Financial Statements", and together with the Audited Financial Statements, the
"Financial Statements"). The Financial Statements present

                                       12
<PAGE>


fairly in all material respects the financial position, cash flows and results
of operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as at the respective
dates or for the respective periods thereof and have been prepared in accordance
with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods presented in the
Financial Statements, except as otherwise noted therein and subject, in the case
of Unaudited Interim Financial Statements, to normal year-end adjustments that
in the aggregate would not be material and the absence of notes.

      4.6 Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities. There are no liabilities or
obligations of any nature, whether absolute, accrued, contingent, unasserted or
otherwise and whether due or to become due, which would be required to be set
forth on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries or in the notes thereto, prepared in accordance with GAAP applied
in a manner consistent with the Financial Statements, except (a) as reflected on
and reserved against in the Financial Statements or in the notes to the Audited
Financial Statements, (b) for liabilities and obligations incurred in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since December 31,
2004, and (c) for liabilities or obligations that would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.
The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have no outstanding indebtedness for
borrowed money and have not guaranteed any such indebtedness.

      4.7 Real Property; Assets.

            (a) Schedule 4.7(a) of the Disclosure Letter lists all material
   items of real property leased by the Company or any of the Company
   Subsidiaries (the "Leased Real Property"). The Company and the Company
   Subsidiaries have valid leasehold interests in the Leased Real Property, in
   each case free and clear of all Liens, except for (i) Liens for Taxes and
   other governmental charges and assessments that are not yet due and payable
   or that are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings, (ii)
   Liens of carriers, warehousemen, mechanics, materialmen and other like Liens
   arising in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice that
   are not yet due and payable or are being contested in good faith, (iii)
   purchase money Liens on property acquired by the Company or any Company
   Subsidiary after the Balance Sheet Date in connection with its business which
   were created contemporaneously with such acquisition to secure or provide for
   the payment or financing of all or any part of the purchase price thereof,
   (iv) easements, rights of way, restrictions, zoning ordinances and other
   similar encumbrances affecting the real property that do not materially
   interfere with the current use of properties or assets affected thereby, (v)
   Liens disclosed on the Balance Sheet or notes thereto or Liens incurred in
   the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since the
   Balance Sheet Date, (vi) any other Liens that do not materially interfere
   with the current use of properties or assets affected thereby, and (vii)
   statutory Liens in favor of lessors arising in connection with any property
   leased to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries (collectively, "Permitted
   Liens"). Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary owns any real
   property.

                                       13
<PAGE>

            (b) Each lease (including any option to purchase contained therein)
   pursuant to which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries leases any
   Leased Real Property (the "Leases") is in full force and effect and, to the
   knowledge of the Company, is enforceable against the landlord that is party
   thereto in accordance with its terms, except as would not reasonably be
   expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
   Effect. To the knowledge of the Company, there exists no default or event of
   default on the part of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries under
   any Leases, except for any such default or event of default which would not
   reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
   Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has
   received any written notice of any default under any Lease nor any other
   written termination notice with respect thereto.

            (c) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have good title to, or
   in the case of leased property and assets have valid leasehold interests in,
   all material property and assets (whether real, personal, tangible or
   intangible) reflected on the Balance Sheet or acquired after the Balance
   Sheet Date, except for properties and assets sold since the Balance Sheet
   Date in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice (the
   "Company Assets"). None of such owned property or assets, or leasehold
   interests in such property or assets, is subject to any Lien, except for
   Permitted Liens. All such Company Assets are in good condition and repair in
   all material respects, reasonable wear-and-tear excepted, and are adequate to
   carry on the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries.

      4.8 Contracts. Schedule 4.8 of the Disclosure Letter lists all Material
Contracts. The term "Material Contracts" means all of the following types of
Contracts to which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party or
by which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their
respective properties is bound as of the date hereof (other than real property
leases, labor or employment-related agreements and agreements related to
intellectual property, which are provided for in Sections 4.7, 4.9 and 4.10,
respectively, and agreements related to expenses of lawyers, investment bankers
and other third parties payable at or before Closing in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which are provided for in Section
4.17): (a) joint venture and partnership agreements, (b) mortgages, indentures,
loan or credit agreements, guarantees (other than any guarantees between the
Company and its Subsidiaries or between Company Subsidiaries), security
agreements and other agreements and instruments relating to the borrowing of

with customers who generate annual revenues or expenditures in excess of
$1,700,000 per year, (d) other Contracts that are not cancelable by the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries on notice of 90 days

                                       14
<PAGE>

or less and that require payment by the Company after the date hereof of more
than $325,000, (e) any agreement containing a non-competition provision or other
covenant restricting in any material respect the distribution of products and
services of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, (f) any other Contract
entered into other than in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice involving aggregate payments by or to the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries in excess of $250,000 per year or $500,000 in the aggregate, (g)
other than the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries, any Contract providing for the indemnification of any
officer, director, employee, manager or independent contractor of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary, (h) Contracts providing for any obligation of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary to provide funds to, or make any investment
(in the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in, any Company
Subsidiary or any other Person, (i) outstanding power of attorney, or obligation
or liability (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise) as guarantor,
surety, co-signer, endorser, co-maker, indemnitor or otherwise in respect of the
obligation of any Person, in each case in excess of $325,000 individually, other
than obligations between the Company and any of the Company Subsidiaries, (j)
any agency Contract with any Person for the distribution of the services of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, which Contract had relevance with respect to
more than 1% of the new business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries in
2004 or 2005, (k) any Contract set forth on Schedule 4.18 of the Disclosure
Letter and (l) any other Contract that is material to the business of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (other than Contracts
with customers, which are subject to clause (c) of this Section 4.8) which
generates annual revenues or expenditures in excess of $325,000 per year. Each
such Material Contract is and, as of the Closing Date only, each other Contract
entered into or amended after the date hereof that if in effect on such terms as
of the date hereof would have been a Material Contract (the "Other Contracts")
will be a valid and binding agreement of the Company or one of the Company
Subsidiaries and is, or will be, as the case may be, in full force and effect as
to the Company or the Company Subsidiary party thereto and, to the Company's
knowledge, as to each other party thereto, except as would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.
Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has, and, to the
Company's knowledge, none of the other parties thereto have, violated any
provision of, or committed or failed to perform any act, and no event or
condition exists, which with or without notice, lapse of time or both would
constitute a default or event of default under the provisions of, any Material
Contract, or as of the Closing Date only, any Other Contract, except in each
case for those violations and defaults which would not be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

      4.9 Employment Benefits.

            (a) Agreements and Plans. Schedule 4.9 of the Disclosure Letter sets
   forth an accurate list of all material Plans.

                                       15
<PAGE>


            (b) Documents. With respect to each Plan listed on Schedule 4.9 of
   the Disclosure Letter, the Company has provided or made available to the
   Parent true and complete copies of the following documents, to the extent
   applicable: (i) the most recent Plan document and all amendments thereto;
   (ii) the most recent trust instruments, insurance contracts or other funding
   agreements; (iii) the most recent summary plan description; (iv) the most
   recent determination letter issued by the IRS; and (v) the most recent Form
   5500 Annual Report.

            (c) Compliance with Law. All Plans comply, in form and operation, in
   all respects with their terms and the requirements of the Employee Retirement
   Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), the Code and other
   Applicable Laws, except for any failures to comply that would not reasonably
   be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
   Effect. Except for the Sedgwick Claims Management Services Retirement Plan
   (the "Pension Plan"), neither the Company nor any other entity that, together
   with the Company, is or was treated as a single employer under Section
   414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code maintains or contributes to an employee
   benefit plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA, Section 302 of ERISA or
   Section 412 of the Code for which the Company, the Parent, or any Affiliate
   of the Parent has or will have at any time in the future any liability or
   obligation. None of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries has
   incurred, or could reasonably be expected to incur, any liability for any tax
   or penalty imposed by Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA,
   except for any such liability that would not reasonably be expected to have,
   individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. No Plan is a
   multiemployer plan, as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA. There are no
   pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened claims by or on
   behalf of any of the Plans subject to ERISA or by any employee involving any
   such Plan (other than routine claims for benefits), except for any claims
   that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
   aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

            (d) Tax Qualification. Each Plan that is intended to be "qualified"
   within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code, and the trust maintained
   pursuant thereto, has been determined to be so qualified and exempt from
   federal income taxation under Section 501 of the Code by the IRS, and to the
   Company's knowledge, nothing has occurred with respect to the operation of
   any such Plan that would reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such
   qualification of exemption from tax.

            (e) Employment Relations. None of the Company or any of the Company
   Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any collective bargaining agreement,
   nor has any of them experienced any strike or material grievance, claim of
   unfair labor practices, or other collective bargaining dispute within the
   past two years.

                                       16
<PAGE>

            (f) Retiree Health and Welfare Benefits. None of the Plans provides
   post-employment or post-service welfare benefits for any current or former
   officer, employee, director, consultant or independent contractor, except as
   may be required under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of
   1985, as amended, and at the expense of the current or former officer,
   employee, director, consultant or independent contractor.

            (g) Plan Funding. Projected as of December 31, 2005, the accrued
   liabilities (as determined under GAAP) of the Pension Plan do not exceed the
   fair market value of its assets (as determined under GAAP) by more than
   $4,600,000 based on actuarial assumptions used in the letter from Mercer
   Human Resource Consulting, Inc. to Sedgwick Claims Management Services, Inc.
   dated November 14, 2005.

      4.10 Intellectual Property. (a) Schedule 4.10(a)(i) of the Disclosure
Letter lists all material applications and registrations for trademarks,
copyrights, trade names, service marks, patents and Internet domain names owned
by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries as of the date hereof. Except
for the third-party software identified on Schedule 4.10(a)(ii) of the
Disclosure Letter, the Company or the Company Subsidiaries own all right, title
and interest, including copyrights, in the JURIS Software and the viaOne
software used by them as of the date hereof. Each of the items set forth on
Schedule 4.10(a)(i) of the Disclosure Letter and each of the material
unregistered trademarks, copyrights, trade names, service marks, inventions and
trade secrets owned by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries (together
with the JURIS Software and the viaOne software not identified as third-party
software on Schedule 4.10(a)(ii) of the Disclosure Letter, collectively the
"Owned Intellectual Property") are owned free and clear of all Liens, except as
set forth in Schedule 4.10(a)(ii) of the Disclosure Letter and except for
Permitted Liens, and the Company's ownership rights in the Owned Intellectual
Property are not invalid or unenforceable, except where such invalidity or
unenforceability would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. The Company and the Company
Subsidiaries own or have the right to use, all trademarks, service marks, trade
names and designs (including any registrations or applications for registration,
as well as common law rights in any of the foregoing); patents (including any
continuations, continuations in part, renewals and applications for any of the
foregoing) and inventions; copyrights (including any registrations and
applications therefor and whether registered or unregistered); Internet domain
names, computer software, data, databases, works of authorship, mask works,
technology, trade secrets and other confidential information, know-how,
proprietary processes, formulae, algorithms, models, user interfaces,
inventions, discoveries, concepts, ideas, techniques, methods, source codes,
object codes, methodologies and, with respect to all of the foregoing, related
confidential data or information (collectively, the "Company Intellectual
Property") which in each case is used in or necessary for the conduct of their
respective business substantially as currently conducted, except where such
failures to own or possess rights to use such Company

                                       17
<PAGE>

Intellectual Property would not reasonably be expected to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. None of the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries has received any notice or claim, nor to the
Company's knowledge, has any proceeding been threatened, that its respective use
or ownership of the Company Intellectual Property infringes on or
misappropriates the trademark, patent, copyright, trade secret or other
intellectual property rights of any Person, and no infringement or
misappropriation by any Person of the Owned Intellectual Property has occurred
or exists other than, in each case, for infringements or misappropriations as
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect. Schedule 4.10(a)(iii) of the Disclosure Letter lists
all material Contracts to which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
is a party, in each case as of the date hereof (other than Contracts for
commercial, off-the-shelf software and end user license or access agreements for
the JURIS Software or viaOne software) and pursuant to which (i) the Company or
such Company Subsidiary permits any Person to use any of the Owned Intellectual
Property, including, without limitation, the JURIS Software or the viaOne
software that is not identified on Schedule 4.10(a)(ii) of the Disclosure Letter
as third-party software, (ii) any Person permits the Company or such Company
Subsidiary to use any Company Intellectual Property that is not Owned
Intellectual Property or (iii) the Company or such Company Subsidiary permits
any Person to use any Company Intellectual Property that is not Owned
Intellectual Property. Each such material Contract (and any material Contract
for commercial, off-the-shelf software and any end user license or access
agreement for the JURIS Software or viaOne software) is a valid and binding
agreement of the Company or one of the Company Subsidiaries and is in full force
and effect as to the Company or the Company Subsidiary party thereto and, to the
Company's knowledge, as to each other party thereto, except as would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect. To the Company's knowledge, all material Company Intellectual
Property that has been licensed to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries is
being used by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries substantially in
accordance with the applicable license or Contract pursuant to which the Company
or such Company Subsidiaries acquired the right to use such material Company
Intellectual Property. Other than in connection with the modification of Company
Intellectual Property for use by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries,
none of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries has entered into an
agreement to indemnify any party against a charge of infringement arising out of
the authorized use of the Owned Intellectual Property.

            (b) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have established and
are in compliance with commercially reasonable security protocols and industry
accepted practices that are designed to protect (i) the security,
confidentiality and integrity of transactions executed through their computer
systems, including transmission encryption and/or other security protocols and
techniques when appropriate and (ii) the security, confidentiality and integrity
of confidential or proprietary data except, in each case, where the failure to
be in compliance would not reasonably be expected to have,

                                       18
<PAGE>

individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. The Company and the
Company Subsidiaries have not, since December 31, 2002, suffered a material
security breach with respect to their data or systems, and neither the Company
nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has notified customers or employees of any
material information security breach with respect to the security,
confidentiality or integrity of information related to such customers or
employees due to the Company's or any of the Company Subsidiaries' computer
systems or those of any third-party subcontractor to the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries.

      4.11 Governmental Authorizations; Compliance with Law. All Governmental
Approvals necessary to conduct the business of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries as currently conducted have been duly obtained or made, are held by
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries and are in full force and effect, except
as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries are in
compliance with all Applicable Laws and none of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries has received any notice of any violation of any Applicable
Law, except in each case as would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect or with respect to
matters that prior to the date hereof have been resolved or are no longer
outstanding. This Section 4.11 does not relate to employee benefits matters, tax
matters, or environmental, health and safety matters which are instead the
subject of Section 4.9, Section 4.13 and Section 4.16, respectively.

      4.12 Litigation. There are no judicial, arbitral, governmental or
administrative actions, proceedings or investigations pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened against or affecting the Company, any
Company Subsidiary or any of their respective properties or assets that (a) have
a reasonable likelihood of being determined in a manner that would reasonably be
expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect or
(b) question the validity of this Agreement or seek to prevent or delay any
action taken or to be taken by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in
connection herewith. There are no outstanding orders, judgments, warrants,
decrees or injunctions against the Company or any Company Subsidiary issued by
any Governmental Authority, and neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
is a party to any agreement with any Governmental Authority (other than
Contracts for the provision of services entered into in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice), in each case except as would not
reasonably be expected (i) to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect or (ii) to prevent or delay the consummation of any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or by any of the other Transaction Documents.

   prohibition, limitation or other requirement of the type set forth in Section

      6.3 Further Actions. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this

administrative, whether brought derivatively or on behalf of third parties

of any registration, filing, application or undertaking as reasonably may be
requested in connection with the foregoing.

      6.4 Access and Information.

            (a) From the date hereof to the Closing Date or as otherwise
   provided in this Agreement, subject to existing confidentiality obligations
   owed to third parties, the Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries shall
   give to the Parent and its representatives reasonable access, at reasonable
   times, to the properties, books and records and personnel of the Company and
   the Company Subsidiaries and shall furnish such information and documents in
   its possession relating to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as the
   Parent may reasonably request, including with respect to operational
   developments and the general status of ongoing operations; provided that the
   Parent shall not be entitled to any such access, information or documents
   that would interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the
   Company or the Company Subsidiaries or that could, in the good faith opinion
   of the Company, result in the loss of attorney-client privilege with respect
   to any such information or documents. All such information and documents
   obtained by the Parent shall be subject to the terms of the Confidentiality
   Agreement, dated as of September 7, 2005 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"),
   between an Affiliate of the Parent and the Company, provided that the terms
   of the Confidentiality Agreement shall be binding upon the Parent and the
   Sub, and all requests for and provision of such information and documents
   shall be made through and coordinated by the Company.

            (b) Parent and Sub shall cause the Company, following the Closing,
   to reasonably cooperate with Holders (with any reasonable out of pocket
   expenses to be borne by Holders) in connection with any inquiries or
   investigations by Holders, any governmental agency or other regulatory
   authority, or any litigation of any kind, involving the business of the
   Company and relating to matters occurring prior to the Closing. Parent and
   Sub shall cause the Company to maintain, for the five year period following
   the Closing, a complete and accurate set, in all material respects, of the
   Company's and its subsidiaries' records (electronic and hardcopy), in
   existence as of the Closing, which may be relevant to the investigations,
   litigations or other regulatory

                                       31
<PAGE>

   matters existing as of the Closing Date, provided, that after such period,
   the Parent and Sub shall cause the Company, prior to the destruction or other
   disposition of any such records, to provide notice to and afford the Holders
   a reasonable opportunity to copy such records, at such Holder's expense.
   Parent and Sub shall cause the Company to afford promptly to each Holder and
   its agents reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon
   reasonable notice, to such records (except to the extent such records have
   been destroyed by the Company in compliance with the proviso in the preceding
   sentence), and to furnish copies thereof which such Holder or its agents
   reasonably requests in connection with any such matters, provided that any
   such access by any such Holder or its agents shall not unreasonably interfere
   with the conduct of the business of the Company. Parent and Sub shall cause
   the Company to afford promptly to each Holder and its agents reasonable
   access to the Company's employees, who shall be available for interviews
   and/or depositions in connection with any such inquiries, investigations or
   litigations.

      6.5 Publicity. No press release or public announcement related to this
Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby, shall be issued or made by
any party without the joint approval of the Company and the Parent, unless
required by Applicable Law (in the reasonable opinion of counsel), in which case
the Company and the Parent shall have the right to review such press release or
announcement prior to publication.

      6.6 Employee Matters. Except as provided in Schedule 6.6 of the Disclosure
Letter, the Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to, provide each employee of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries (an "Employee"), with during the period commencing on the Closing
Date and ending on December 31, 2006, (i) health and welfare benefits (other
than compensation and bonuses) that are comparable in the aggregate to the
benefits of such employee in effect as of the date hereof, as changed if at all
through the Closing Date in accordance with subclauses (iii) and (iv) of Section
6.1(b)(iv), and (ii) other benefits (other than defined benefit plans) that are
comparable in the aggregate to, at Parent's option, (x) the benefits (other than
health and welfare benefits and defined benefit plans) received by
similarly-situated employees of other subsidiaries of Parent or (y) the benefits
(other than health and welfare benefits and defined benefit plans) of such
employee as of the date hereof, as changed if at all through the Closing Date in
accordance with subclauses (iii) and (iv) of Section 6.1(b)(iv). The Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause each Buyer Plan in
which an Employee participates or will participate to (a) recognize all service
of such Employee with the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries and their
predecessor entities for purposes of vesting, eligibility, participation and
coverage (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, accrual and level of
benefits) to the extent such service would be recognized under the analogous
Plan, (b) honor or provide appropriate credit for co-payments, deductibles and
other expenses incurred by such Employee or his or her beneficiaries under the
analogous Plans, and, (c) if applicable, waive any waiting periods or other
eligibility limitations and exclusions for preexisting conditions;

                                       32
<PAGE>

provided, however that such crediting of services shall not operate to duplicate
any benefit or the funding of any such benefit. If the Closing shall have
occurred, the Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay on
or about February 15, 2006, annual bonuses to Employees as approved by the Board
prior to the date hereof and described on Schedule 6.1(b)(iv)(iii) of the
Disclosure Letter. Nothing herein shall be deemed to be a guaranty of employment
for any Employee, or to restrict the right of the Company, any Company
Subsidiaries, the Parent, the Sub or any Affiliates to amend terminate any
benefit plans in accordance with the terms and conditions of such benefit plans.

      6.7 Tax Matters.

            (a) The Parent shall not make or permit any Person to make an
   election under Section 338(g) of the Code with respect to the purchase of
   Company Stock pursuant to this Agreement.

            (b) Except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement or
   specifically consented to in writing by the Parent, from the date of this
   Agreement through the Closing Date, the Company shall not, and shall not
   permit any of the Company Subsidiaries to, (i) make or rescind any express or
   deemed material election relating to Taxes, (ii) settle or compromise any
   material claim, audit, dispute, controversy, examination, investigation, or
   other proceeding relating to Taxes, (iii) execute any waiver of restriction
   on assessment or collection of any Tax, including without limitation any
   extension of limitations period, (iv) materially change any of its methods of
   reporting income or deductions for federal income Tax purposes except as may
   be required by Applicable Tax Law, in each case other than in the ordinary
   course of business consistent with past practice.

            (c) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall timely file all
   Tax Returns required to be filed after the date of this Agreement until the
   Closing Date in a manner consistent with past practice, to the extent
   permitted by Applicable Tax Law, and shall pay any Taxes shown as due
   thereon.

      6.8 Indemnification of Directors and Officers.

            (a) The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
   Corporation shall continue to contain provisions no less favorable with
   respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of each
   present and former director and officer of the Company and the Company
   Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Indemnitees") than are presently set forth
   in the Company's certificate of incorporation and bylaws, which provisions
   shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would
   adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such individuals.

                                       33

            (b) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall purchase six year
   tail policies of directors' and officers' liability and errors and omissions
   insurance covering the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and the current and
   former officers, directors and employees of the Company and the Company
   Subsidiaries who are currently covered by the Company's existing directors'
   and officers' liability and errors and omissions insurance, as applicable,
   from an insurance carrier currently providing such coverage to Marsh &
   McLennan Companies, Inc. ("Marsh"), on terms and conditions no less favorable
   to the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and such directors and officers than
   those in effect on the date hereof, except that the maximum deductible shall
   be $1 million and the coverage limit shall be $20 million. The aggregate cost
   of such policies is referred to in this Agreement as the "Tail Cost."

      6.9 Financing. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall provide all
reasonable cooperation in connection with the arrangement of any financing
sought by the Parent in connection with the Merger (the "Financing") as may be
reasonably requested by the Parent (provided that such requested cooperation (i)
does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing business of the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries or (ii) otherwise would not reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect). Further,
subject, for the avoidance of doubt, to the last sentence of this Section 6.9,
in connection with the Financing, the Company shall make any reasonable
representations and warranties to, and enter into any reasonable covenants for
the benefit of third parties providing or arranging any Financing. In no event
shall the Company or the Company Subsidiaries be required to pay any commitment
or similar fee, enter into any binding commitment or incur any liability in
connection with the Financing prior to the Closing, except to the extent the
Parent has provided the indemnity referenced in the last sentence of this
Section 6.9. The Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs
incurred by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries in connection with such
cooperation. The Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries and their respective representatives for and against any
and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards,
judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection with the
arrangement of the Financing and the performance of their respective obligations
under this Section 6.9 and any information utilized in connection therewith.

      6.10 Intercompany Accounts. Except as set forth in Schedule 6.10 of the
Disclosure Letter, any agreements between the Company or any Company Subsidiary,
on the one hand, and any Affiliate of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, on
the other hand, shall be terminated at or prior to the Closing, and any amounts
due under such terminated agreements shall be paid in full at such time.

      6.11 Solvency of the Company. The Parent shall furnish or cause to be
furnished to the Company copies of any solvency opinions or similar materials
obtained

                                       34
<PAGE>

from third parties in connection with the financing of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, to the extent contractually permitted by the
issuer of such opinion. The Parent shall use reasonable efforts to cause the
firms issuing any such solvency opinions to allow the Company to rely thereon;
provided that no material fee or expense is associated with obtaining such
reliance.

      6.12 Disclosure of Certain Matters. Each of the Parent and the Company, as
applicable, shall promptly upon becoming aware thereof (the "Notifying Party")
disclose to the other (the "Notified Party") (i) any breach of its
representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement, whether arising after
the date hereof (a "Post-Signing Rep Breach") or existing as of the date hereof
and subsequently discovered (a "Pre-Signing Rep Breach"), (ii) any failure by it
to comply in all material respects with any material covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by any of them under this Agreement
and (iii) in the case of the Company being the Notifying Party, the occurrence
of any matter or event which would reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. In the event the Notifying Party
provides the Notified Party notice of a Post-Signing Rep Breach, the Notifying
Party will concurrently state whether such breach would cause the condition set
forth in Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.3(a), as applicable, to fail to be
satisfied (any such breach, a "Waiver Breach"). In the event the Notifying Party
so states that a Post-Signing Rep Breach is a Waiver Breach, then if the
Notified Party nonetheless proceeds with the Closing, it shall have waived any
right to indemnification for such breach under Article IX hereof. Except for the
foregoing, no notice provided under this Section 6.12 shall be deemed to cure
any breach of representation, warranty or covenant or update the Disclosure
Letter or otherwise affect in any respect the rights and remedies of the
Notified Party.

<PAGE>

   materially impair the ability of the Company to fulfill its obligations under

      8.1 Tax Indemnification.

            (a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Article
   VIII and Article IX, the Company, the Parent, and their respective Affiliates
   shall be indemnified and held harmless from and against, (i) any and all
   Taxes imposed on or due with respect to the Company or to any of the Company
   Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Period, (ii) any liability for Taxes under
   Section 6038A(d) arising from any failure by the Company or any of the
   Company Subsidiaries to comply with Section 6038A in any Pre-Closing Period,
   (iii) any Taxes resulting from, arising out of or related to any breach by
   the Company of the representation and warranty set forth in Section 4.13(q),
   (iv) any obligation of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries for any
   Pre-Closing Period to contribute to the payment of a Tax determined on a

   Subsidiaries and any corporation other than the Company and the Company
   Subsidiaries, (v) any (A) gross-up payment that results from the imposition
   of Taxes under Section 4999 of the Code on any excess parachute payments (as
   that term is used for purposes of Section 4999 of the Code) resulting (either
   alone or in combination with another event) from the execution and delivery
   of this Agreement or the

                                       38
<PAGE>

   transactions contemplated thereby (for purposes of this Article VIII and
   related provisions of Article IX and of the Escrow Agreement, any such
   gross-up payment shall be deemed to be a Tax) and (B) loss of any Tax
   deduction (excluding any loss of deduction on any gross-up payment to the
   extent the indemnification for the gross-up payment is not included in the
   taxable income of the Company or any Company Subsidiary) by the Company or
   any Company Subsidiary, or any successor thereto, resulting from the
   application of Section 280G of the Code to any payment (as that term is used
   for purposes of Section 280G of the Code and any regulations promulgated
   thereunder) made to a current or former employee, director, service provider,
   or shareholder of the Company or any Company Subsidiary and resulting (either
   alone or in combination with another event) from the execution and delivery
   of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby and (vi) any Taxes
   resulting from the denial of deductions for the items described in clauses
   (a) and (b) of the definition of Closing Tax Benefits.

            (b) The Company, the Company Subsidiaries, and the Parent will be
   liable for, and will indemnify, defend and hold the Company Indemnitees
   harmless from and against, any and all Taxes imposed on or with respect to
   the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries for which the Company
   Indemnitees are not required to indemnify the Company, the Company
   Subsidiaries, or the Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(a) of this Agreement.

            (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company,
   the Parent and their respective Affiliates shall not be indemnified under
   this Agreement with respect to Taxes of the Company or the Company
   Subsidiaries to the extent of the reserves for Taxes taken into account in
   calculating Closing Equity.

            (d) A Person entitled to indemnification for Taxes under this
   Section 8.1 shall also be entitled to indemnification for all reasonable fees
   and costs (including reasonable outside professional fees and costs) incurred
   in contesting or otherwise in connection with any such Taxes.

      8.2 Straddle Period Allocation and Tax Returns.

            (a) In the case of any Straddle Period, Tax items will be
   apportioned between Pre-Closing Periods and Post-Closing Periods based on a
   closing of the books and records of the relevant entity or entities as of the
   Closing Date, provided that:

         (i) any Tax item incurred by reason of the transactions occurring on or
before the Closing Date as contemplated by this Agreement will be treated as
occurring in a Pre-Closing Period and any Tax item incurred by reason of any
transaction not contemplated by this Agreement and occurring after the Closing
will be treated as occurring in a Post-Closing Period;

                                       39
<PAGE>

         (ii) depreciation, amortization and depletion will be apportioned on a
daily pro rata basis; and

         (iii) any liability of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
for any real property Tax, any personal property Tax, or any similar ad valorem
obligation will be apportioned between Pre-Closing Periods and Post-Closing
Periods based on the number of days of such Taxable Period that fall on or prior
to the Closing Date and the number of days of such Taxable Period that fall
after the Closing Date.

            (b) Parent shall cause the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to
   prepare and timely file all Tax Returns with respect to the Company or any
   Company Subsidiary for (i) all Straddle Periods and (ii) to the extent
   required to be filed (or otherwise filed) after the Closing Date, all
   Pre-Closing Periods, and such Tax Returns shall, with respect to any
   Pre-Closing Period, be prepared in a manner consistent with past practice of
   the Company or relevant Company Subsidiary unless the Representative consents
   otherwise (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

      8.3 Notice and Payment of Indemnified Amounts.

            (a) Duty to Notify. The Parent shall notify the Representative of
   any Taxes paid or incurred by the Parent, the Company, or any of the Company
   Subsidiaries which are subject to indemnification under this Article VIII.
   The Representative shall notify Parent of any Taxes paid or incurred by the
   Company Indemnitees which are subject to indemnification by the Parent, the
   Company, and the Company Subsidiaries under this Article VIII.

            (b) Explanation of Claim. Any notice contemplated by this Section
   8.3 shall include a detailed calculation and a brief explanation of the basis
   for such indemnification.

      8.4 Nature of Payments. Any payment (other than interest on a payment)
owing to the Parent, the Company, or any of the Company Subsidiaries pursuant to
this Article VIII shall be treated by all parties for all purposes as a
reduction of the Initial Merger Consideration. Any payment (other than interest
on a payment) owing to the Company Indemnitees pursuant to this Article VIII
shall be treated by all the parties for all purposes as a net adjustment to the
Initial Merger Consideration.

      8.5 Tax Audits and Contests; Cooperation.

            (a) After the Closing Date, except as provided in (b) and (c) below,
   the Parent shall control the conduct, through counsel of its own choosing and
   at its own expense, of any audit, claim for refund, or administrative or
   judicial proceeding

                                       40
<PAGE>

   involving any asserted Tax liability or refund with respect to the Company or
   any of the Company Subsidiaries (any such audit, claim for refund, or
   proceeding relating to an asserted Tax liability referred to herein as a
   "Contest").

            (b) In the case of a Contest after the Closing Date that relates
   solely to Taxes for which the Parent is indemnified under Section 8.1 and
   which are not reportable on Parent's consolidated federal income Tax Return
   or any state combined, consolidated, or unitary Tax Return that includes any
   entity other than the Company or a Company Subsidiary, the Representative
   shall control the conduct of such Contest, but the Parent shall have the
   right to participate in such Contest at its own expense, and the
   Representative shall not be able to settle, compromise and/or concede any
   portion of such Contest without the consent of the Parent, which consent
   shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided that, if the
   Representative fails or declines to assume control of the conduct of any such
   Contest within a reasonable period following the receipt by the
   Representative of notice of such Contest, the Parent shall have the right to
   assume control of such Contest but the Representative shall have the right to
   participate in such contest at its own expense and the Parent shall not be
   able to settle, compromise and/or concede any portion of such contest that is
   likely to result in a claim for indemnification hereunder without the consent
   of the Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
   delayed.

            (c) In the case of a Contest after the Closing Date that relates
   both to Taxes for which the Parent is indemnified under Section 8.1 and
   either (i) to Taxes of the Parent, any Parent affiliate, the Company or any
   Company Subsidiary for which the Parent is not indemnified under Section 8.1,
   or (ii) to any Taxes reportable on Parent's consolidated federal income Tax
   Return or on any state combined, consolidated, or unitary Tax Return that
   includes any entity other than the Company or a Company Subsidiary, the
   Parent shall control the conduct of such Contest, but the Representative
   shall have the right to participate in such Contest at its own expense, and
   with respect to any Tax for which Parent is indemnified under Section 8.1,
   the Parent shall not settle, compromise and/or concede such Contest without
   the consent of the Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably
   withheld or delayed.

            (d) The Representative and the Parent agree to furnish or cause to
   be furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such
   information (including access to books and records) and assistance relating
   to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as is reasonably requested for
   the preparation, prosecution, defense or conduct of any Contest. The
   Representative and Parent shall reasonably cooperate with each other in the
   conduct of any Contest or other proceeding involving or otherwise relating to
   the Company or the Company Subsidiaries (or their income or assets) with
   respect to any Tax and each shall execute and deliver such powers of attorney
   and other documents as are necessary to carry out the intent of this Section
   8.5. Any information obtained under this Section 8.5(d) shall be kept
   confidential,

                                       41
<PAGE>

   except as may be otherwise necessary in connection with the filing of Tax
   Returns or in the conduct of a Contest or other Tax proceeding.

            (e) Each of the Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best
   efforts to properly retain and maintain the Tax and accounting records of the
   Company and the Company Subsidiaries that relate to any Tax Periods (or
   portions thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date until the expiration
   of the applicable statutes of limitations. Any information obtained under
   this Section 8.5 shall be kept confidential, except as may be otherwise
   necessary in connection with the filing of tax returns or in the conduct of a
   Contest or other Tax proceeding.

            (f) The Parent shall promptly notify the Representative, and the
   Representative shall promptly notify the Parent, in writing within 30
   Business Days from the receipt of notice of any pending or threatened Tax
   audits or assessments of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, with respect
   to which the notifying party may seek to be indemnified under Section 8.1.
   Failure to notify the indemnifying party under this Section 8.5(f) shall not
   relieve the indemnifying party from its obligations under Section 8.1, except
   to the extent that the indemnifying party shall have been actually prejudiced
   as a result of such failure. In that case, the amount the indemnifying party
   is otherwise required to pay under Section 8.1 shall be reduced by the amount
   determined pursuant to the preceding sentence.

      8.6 Refunds. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall be entitled to receive
and retain any Tax refund or credit that is paid after the Closing Date with
respect to Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. If the Holders or
any Affiliate of the Holders receive any Tax refund or credit after the Closing
Date with respect to the Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the
Holders shall, within 30 days, pay the amount of such refund (together with any
interest received in connection with such refund or credit) to the Company. Any
payment made after such 30-day period shall include interest at the Overdue Rate
accrued from the final day of the 30-day period until the date of payment.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                                 INDEMNIFICATION

      9.1 Survival of Representations and Warranties and Covenants

            (a) The representations and warranties set forth herein (other than
   the representations and warranties in Section 4.13, except Section 4.13(q)),
   and the right to commence any claim with respect thereto, shall survive until
   the fifteen month anniversary of the Closing Date and shall expire
   thereafter, and the Parent and its Affiliates right to make any claim for
   indemnification for any Special Obligation in

                                       42
<PAGE>

   accordance with the terms hereof, shall survive until the twenty-seven month
   anniversary of the Closing Date and shall expire thereafter; provided that in
   the event written notice of any claim for indemnification under Section 9.2
   or Section 8.1 shall have been given in accordance with Section 9.3(b) or
   Section 8.3 hereof or written notice of the commencement of a Tax audit shall
   have been given in accordance with Section 8.5(f) hereof within the
   applicable survival period, the right to be indemnified with respect to such
   matter shall survive until such time as such matter is fully and finally
   resolved. Any investigation or other examination that may have been made or
   may be made at any time by or on behalf of the party to whom representations
   and warranties are made shall not limit, diminish or in any way affect or be
   deemed to modify the representations and warranties in this Agreement, and
   the parties may rely on the representations, warranties and covenants in this
   Agreement, and any schedule, exhibit or certificate in respect thereof,
   irrespective of any information obtained by them by any investigation,
   examination or otherwise, in all cases subject to any and all limitations to
   which such representations, warranties and covenants are subject pursuant to
   this Agreement, including the Disclosure Letter.

            (b) Any covenant or agreement of the parties contained in this

   under Section 9.2 or Section 8.1, which shall be satisfied from the Escrow
   Funds).

            (b) Each Indemnified Party agrees to provide prompt written notice
   to the Indemnifying Party of the assertion of any claim, or the commencement

   indemnification provided under this Article IX except to the extent that the
   Indemnifying Party has been actually prejudiced as a result of such failure.

            (c) The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume, conduct and
   control, through counsel of its own choosing and at its own expense, the

<PAGE>

   Indemnifying Party shall assume the control of the defense of any Third Party
   Claim in accordance with the provisions of this Section 9.3, (i) the
   Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnified
   Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld) before entering into any
   settlement of such Third Party Claim, if the settlement does not release the
   Indemnified Party from all liabilities and obligations with respect to such
   Third Party Claim or the settlement imposes injunctive or other equitable
   relief against the Indemnified Party or admits any liability in connection
   therewith and (ii) the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in
   (but not conduct or control) the defense of such Third Party Claim and to
   employ separate counsel of its choice for such purpose. The fees and expenses
   of such separate counsel shall be paid by the Indemnified Party; provided,
   however, that such Indemnified Party will be entitled to participate in any
   such defense with separate counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying Party
   if (i) authorized by the Indemnifying Party to participate or (ii) in the
   reasonable opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party, a conflict or
   potential conflict exists between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
   Party that would make such separate representation advisable; and provided
   further, that the Indemnifying Party will not be required to pay for more
   than one such counsel for all Indemnified Parties in connection with any
   Third Party Claim.

            (d) Each party shall cooperate, and cause their respective
   Affiliates to cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any Third Party
   Claim and shall furnish or cause to be furnished such records, information
   and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings,
   trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

            (e) If the Indemnifying Party receiving such notice of a Third Party
   Claim does not elect to defend such Third Party Claim or does not defend such
   Third Party Claim in good faith, the Indemnified Party shall have the right,
   in addition to any other right or remedy it may have hereunder, at the
   Indemnifying Party's expense, to defend such Third Party Claim; provided,
   however, that the Indemnified Party shall not settle, compromise or
   discharge, or admit any liability with respect to, any such Third Party Claim
   without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent will not
   be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

            (f) If the Indemnifying Party has disputed its liability with
   respect to any claim hereunder, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
   Party shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute
   and, if not resolved through negotiations, such dispute shall be resolved
   pursuant to Section 11.18 and Section 11.19.

            (g) For the avoidance of doubt, Sections 9.3(b) through (f) shall
   not apply to Taxes, which shall be governed by Article VIII.

   basis, 1% of the Purchase Price, and then only to the extent of such excess,
   (ii) only to the extent that the aggregate amounts required to be paid to the
   Parent Indemnitees in respect of all Losses or under Article VIII shall not
   exceed in the aggregate 13% of the Purchase Price, plus all Earnings (as
   defined in the Escrow Agreement) to which they are entitled under the terms
   of the Escrow Agreement and (iii) only to the extent of funds available in
   the Escrow Funds, it being understood that such Escrow Funds shall be the
   sole and exclusive source of recovery and remedy of any Parent Indemnitee
   with respect to any claim for indemnification under Sections 8.1 and 9.2(a)
   and, as such, the indemnifications obligations set forth herein are
   non-recourse to the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or the Holders in all
   respects; provided, that the limitations in clauses (i) through (iii) shall
   not apply to any Losses resulting from, arising out of or relating to any
   intentional misrepresentation or any fraud.

            (b) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
   contrary, the Company Indemnitees shall be entitled to indemnification under
   this Agreement:

         (i) in the case of indemnification for Losses under Section 9.2(b)(i)
      only to the extent that the aggregate amount thereof exceeds, on a
      cumulative basis, 1% of the Purchase Price, and then only to the extent of
      such excess; and

         (ii) only to the extent that the aggregate amount required to be paid
      to the Company Indemnitees does not exceed in the aggregate 13% of the
      Purchase Price; provided, that the limitations in clauses (i) and (ii)
      shall not apply to any Losses resulting from, arising out of or relating
      to any intentional misrepresentation or any fraud.

            (c) The amount of any Losses that the Indemnifying Party is
   obligated to pay to the Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article IX or,
   with respect to clause (ii) of this sentence only, all amounts that the
   Indemnifying Party is obligated to pay to the Indemnified Party pursuant to
   Article VIII, shall be net of (i) any amounts collected in connection with
   such Losses from any applicable insurance policies or other prior or
   subsequent recoveries from any other Person alleged to be responsible for
   such Losses, in each case subject to the limits in the last sentence of this
   Section 9.4(c) and in Section 9.7 and (ii) any Tax Benefit (net of any
   associated Tax Cost) actually realized by an Indemnified Party arising from
   the incurrence or payment of any such Losses

<PAGE>

   and the receipt of indemnity payments hereunder. Any Indemnified Party shall
   use reasonable efforts to (i) collect any amounts available under such
   insurance policies or from such other Person alleged to be responsible and
   (ii) realize any Tax Benefit with respect to any indemnified Losses. If an
   Indemnified Party receives any amounts under applicable insurance policies,
   or from any other Person alleged to be responsible for any indemnified
   Losses, subsequent to an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party,
   then such Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party
   for any payment made or expense incurred by such Indemnifying Party in
   connection with providing such indemnification payment up to the amount
   received by the Indemnified Party, net of any expenses incurred by such
   Indemnified Party in collecting such amount; provided, that such
   reimbursement shall only be required to the extent the Indemnified Party
   would otherwise retain an amount greater than the full amount of the Losses
   incurred by the Indemnified Party as a result of the underlying claim.

            (d) The Indemnified Parties shall be deemed not to have suffered or
   incurred a Loss in respect of any item to the extent (and only to the extent)
   an amount in respect of such item has reduced Closing Equity or increased the
   Cash Shortfall.

      9.5 Remedies Exclusive. Except in cases of intentional misrepresentation
or fraud or as otherwise specifically provided herein, the remedies provided in
Article VIII and this Article IX shall be the exclusive monetary remedies
(including equitable remedies that involve monetary payment, such as restitution
or disgorgement, other than specific performance to enforce any payment or
performance due hereunder) of the parties from and after the Closing in
connection with any breach of a representation or warranty, any failure or
breach of any covenant, obligation, condition or agreement to be performed or
fulfilled and any of the Special Obligations.

      9.6 Duty to Mitigate. Each Indemnified Party shall take all commercially
reasonable efforts required by Applicable Law, at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party, to mitigate any claim or liability that an Indemnified Party
asserts or is reasonably likely to assert under this Article IX or Article VIII
upon becoming aware of any event that would reasonably be expected to give rise
to such assertion. In the event that an Indemnified Party shall fail to make
such commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any such claim or liability,
then notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, to
the extent required by Applicable Law, no Indemnifying Party shall be required
to indemnify any Indemnified Party for that portion of any Losses that could
reasonably be expected to have been avoided if the Indemnified Party had made
such efforts.

"Potential Contributor") based on the underlying claim asserted, if the
Indemnified Party shall have received full payment of all Losses with respect to
such claim, such Indemnified Party shall assign such of its rights to proceed
against the Potential Contributor as are necessary to permit the Indemnifying
Party to recover from the Potential Contributor any amount of such Loss that the
Indemnifying Party paid to the Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article IX;
provided, that if the Indemnified Party shall not have received payment in full
of all such Losses (including as a result of any limits on indemnification in
this Article IX), then no such assignment shall be required until such full
payment has been received from the Indemnifying Party and such third party.

each of the parties hereto that no party nor any of its Affiliates,

   Closing Date by mutual written consent of the Parent and the Company, by

   taken place on or before February 14, 2006 or such later date as the parties
   may agree to in writing or (iii) by either the Parent or the Company by
   written notice to the other party if any event, fact or condition occurs or

   the terminating party's obligations to consummate the transactions
   contemplated by this Agreement, and such event, fact or condition shall not
   have been cured by the non-terminating party or waived by the terminating
   party within 20 Business Days of notice thereof from the terminating party,
   unless the occurrence or existence of such event, fact or condition shall be
   due to the failure of the terminating party to perform or comply with any of
   the agreements or covenants hereof to be performed or complied with by such
   party prior to the Closing.

               (b) In the event of termination by the Company or the Parent

11.5, this Agreement shall become null and void and of no further force or
effect, provided, that the Confidentiality Agreement, Section 6.5 relating to
publicity, and Section 11.6 relating to certain expenses shall survive any
termination of this Agreement. Nothing in this Section 11.5 shall be deemed to
release any party from any liability for any breach by such party of the terms
and provisions of this Agreement or to impair the right of either party to
compel specific performance by the other party of its obligations under this
Agreement.

      11.10 Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns,
provided that any assignment (other than by operation of law) by any party
hereto shall require the prior written consent of the other party and any
purported assignment or other transfer without such consent shall be void and
unenforceable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) Parent and Sub may each assign
its rights hereunder by way of security in connection with any financing and the
secured party may assign such rights by way of any exercise of remedies in
connection therewith and (ii) Parent may assign this agreement and all of its
rights and obligations hereunder to an Affiliate, provided that Parent remains
liable for the performance thereof in the event that such Affiliate fails to
perform.

      11.11 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except with respect to (a) the Option
Holders and DSU Holders under Section 2.3, (b) the Holders under Sections 2.2,
2.4(b), 6.4(b) and 9.4(b), (c) the Indemnitees under Section 6.8(a), (d) the
Company Indemnitees under Article IX and (e) the Parent Indemnitees under
Article IX, all of whom are intended third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement
for the purposes of these respective Sections only, nothing in this Agreement
shall confer any rights upon any Person that is not a party or a successor or
permitted assignee of a party to this Agreement.

      11.12 Representative. The Holders irrevocably appoint Stone Point Capital
LLC to act as the designated representative, agent and attorney-in-fact of such
Holders with full authority to make all decisions and determinations and to take
all actions required or permitted under or relating to this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement on behalf of such Holders (the committee, in such capacity, the
"Representative"), including (i) approving any of the documents required to be
delivered by such Holders on or after the Closing Date, (ii) approving or
contesting the Closing Statement, and/or the Initial Merger Consideration
adjustments, as set forth in Article III of this Agreement, and any other matter
provided for in Article III of this Agreement, (iii) administering any

                                       63

<PAGE>

indemnification matter on behalf of the Holders, agreeing to the settlement of
any indemnification matter and otherwise handling and negotiating
indemnification matters, (iv) agreeing to any waiver, consent or amendment under
or to this Agreement, provided that no such waiver, consent or amendment shall
adversely affect the allocation of any consideration hereunder to any Holder who
does not expressly consent thereto in writing, (v) distributing to the Holders
any portion of any consideration hereunder payable to the Holders after the
Closing Date, (vi) sending, receiving and reviewing notices under this Agreement
on behalf of the Holders and (vii) appointing a successor Representative in the
event of the resignation or death of the then current Representative. Each
Holder acknowledges that this Section 11.12 is intended to have the broadest
possible scope for the purpose of promoting the efficient negotiation and
handling of all matters which arise under or in connection with this Agreement.
All actions taken by the Representative in connection with, or relating to, the
subject matter of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement that are within the
authority conferred upon the Representative pursuant to this Section 11.12 shall
be deemed authorized, approved, ratified and confirmed by the Holders, having
the same force and effect as if performed pursuant to the direct authorization
of such Holders. Subject to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, the
Representative shall be entitled, absent gross negligence or bad faith, to
indemnification in connection with the performance by the Representative of its
rights and obligations pursuant to this Section 11.12 and/or under the Escrow
Agreement, which indemnification shall be satisfied solely by having recourse
against the Escrow Funds; provided that, subject to Section 7 of the Escrow
Agreement, any such indemnification of the Representative shall be subject and
strictly subordinated to any rights of the Parent and the other Indemnified
Parties against the Escrow Fund pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, with no Escrow
Funds to be paid to the Representative until the Parent and the Indemnified
Parties have no further rights thereto and such funds are about to be returned
to the Holders. The Parent shall be entitled to rely upon, without independent
investigation, any act, notice, instruction or communication from the
Representative on behalf of the Holders and shall not be liable in any manner
whatsoever for any action taken or not taken in reliance upon the actions taken
or not taken or communications or writings given or executed by the
Representative. The Parent shall be entitled to disregard any notices or
communications given or made by any Holder unless given or made through the
Representative.

      11.13 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each
of which shall constitute one and the same instrument.

      11.14 Facsimile. This Agreement, to the extent signed and delivered by
means of facsimile transmission, shall be treated in all manner and respects as
an original agreement or instrument and shall be considered to have the same
binding effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in
person. No party hereto shall claim that this Agreement is invalid, not binding
or unenforceable based upon the use of facsimile transmission to deliver a
signature, or the fact that any signature or agreement

                                       64

<PAGE>

or instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of facsimile
transmission, and each such party forever waives any such claim or defense.

      11.15 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is invalid,
inoperative or unenforceable for any reason, such circumstances shall not have
the effect of rendering the provision in question invalid, inoperative or
unenforceable in any other case or circumstance, or of rendering any other
provision or provisions contained herein invalid, inoperative or unenforceable
to any extent whatsoever.

      11.16 Interpretation. The Section headings in this Agreement are for
convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed to alter or affect the
meaning or interpretation of any provision hereof. Any references to Company's
knowledge or the knowledge of the Company shall mean the actual knowledge, after
reasonable inquiry, of any of David North, James Wiertelak, Donald Burkett or
Paul Posey, Jr. Except to the extent made by the Company under, and subject to
the terms of, Section 6.9, none of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, the
Parent or the Sub makes any representation or warranty herein other than, with
respect to Parent and the Sub, to the extent set forth in Sections 5.3 and 5.4,
the accuracy of which is based on, or gives effect to, any financing sought or
obtained by the Parent or the Sub in connection with the Merger.

      11.17 Governing Law. This Agreement and the agreements entered into in
connection with the transaction contemplated by this Agreement shall be governed
in all respects, including but not limited to, as to validity, interpretation
and effect, by the internal laws of the State of New York, without giving effect
to its principles or rules of conflict of laws.

      11.18 Enforcement.

               (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein or
   elsewhere (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Section 3.5(b)), the
   parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of
   the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
   specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
   parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
   of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of
   this Agreement in any New York State court or any Federal court of the United
   States of America sitting in New York City, this being in addition to any
   other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the
   parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and
   its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of any New York State court or
   Federal court of the United States of America sitting in New York City, and
   any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out
   of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or
   for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each of
   the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and

                                       65

<PAGE>

   unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or
   proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State court or, to
   the extent permitted by law, in such Federal court. Each of the parties
   hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
   conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
   or in any other manner provided by law.

               (b) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and
   unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively
   do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue
   of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
   Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in any New York State or
   Federal court. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the
   fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
   maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.

               (c) Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service
   of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 11.9. Nothing in
   this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve
   process in any other manner permitted by Applicable Law.

      11.19 Waiver of Jury Trial.

               (a) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT
   MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT
   ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY
   RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
   INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
   CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

               (b) EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO
   REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
   EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
   LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
   CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVER
   VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
   AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION
   11.19.
