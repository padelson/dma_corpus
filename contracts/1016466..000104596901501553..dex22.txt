their terms expire before the Closing, shall be assigned to, and  assumed by,
Purchaser at the Closing in accordance with the  corresponding provisions
of   1     Section 1.01(a), provided that (i) prior notice of such
Contracts or  such extension of the expiration dates, as the case may be, was
given  to Purchaser and (ii) Purchaser has approved such Contracts or such 
extension, as the case may be, which approval shall be deemed granted  if

2001 until the Closing, the Sections of  the Disclosure Schedules shall be
deemed amended to delete any  Contracts that terminate prior to the

to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or future Law, and
if the rights or obligations of any party hereto under this Amendment will
not be materially and adversely affected thereby, (i) such provision will be
fully severable, (ii) this Amendment will be construed and enforced as if
such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part
hereof and (iii) the remaining provisions of this Amendment will remain in
full force and effect and will not be affected by the illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provision or by its severance herefrom.   4. Full Force and
Effect. Except as expressly amended by this Amendment, the Agreement shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with the provisions thereof
on the date hereof and the parties hereto ratify and agree to be bound by all
terms and provisions of the Agreement as amended hereby.   5. Counterparts.
