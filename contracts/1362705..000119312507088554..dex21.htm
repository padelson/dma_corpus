only that portion of any charge or invoice received that is applicable to work
performed or material received in the period on or subsequent to the Effective
Time.



 

_Page - 8 -_ Section 3.03. _Certain Indemnities_.

(a) _Definition of Claims_. The term " _ _Claims__ " means any and all direct
or indirect demands, claims, notices of violation, notices of probable
violation, filings, investigations, administrative proceedings, actions,
causes of action, suits, other legal proceedings, judgments, assessments,
damages, deficiencies, Taxes, penalties, fines, obligations,
responsibilities, liabilities, payments, charges, costs and expenses
(including without limitation costs and expenses of owning and operating the
Assets) of any kind or character (whether or not asserted prior to Closing,
and whether known or unknown, fixed or unfixed, conditional or unconditional,
based on theories, contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise, choate or
inchoate, liquidated or unliquidated, secured or unsecured, accrued, absolute,
contingent or other legal theory), including, without limitation, penalties
and interest on any amount payable as a result of any of the foregoing, any
legal or other costs and expenses incurred in connection with investigating or
defending any Claim, and all amounts paid in settlement of Claims. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the term "Claims" specifically
includes any and all Claims arising from, attributable to or incurred in
connection with any (a) breach of contract, (b) loss of or damage
to property, injury to or death of persons, and other tortuous injury and (c)
violations of applicable laws, rules, regulations, orders or any other legal
right or duty actionable at law or in equity.

(b) _Seller s Indemnity_. Subject to the further provisions hereof, Seller
shall defend, indemnify and hold Buyer, its affiliates, and its/their
directors, officers, employees, contractors, and representatives (which
additional parties, together with Buyer, are hereinafter collectively referred
to as the " _ _Buyer Parties__ ") harmless from and against any and
all Claims arising from, out of or in connection with, or otherwise relating
to: (a) any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of Seller set forth
in this Agreement; (b) the Excluded Assets; (c) to the extent attributable
to periods prior to the Effective Time, (i) the payment, underpayment or
nonpayment of royalties by the Target Entities on production from or
attributable to the Target Entities interest in the Leases, Units and Wells,
or the proper accounting or payment to parties for their interests therein,
and (ii) the payment, underpayment or nonpayment by the Target Entities of
Taxes; (d) the ownership or operation of the Assets prior to the Effective
Time (other than Claims with respect to royalties and Taxes, which are
addressed in clause (c) above), expressly excluding, however, matters assumed,
indemnified against and waived by Buyer pursuant to _Sections 7.07_ , _7.08_
and _7.09_ below; and (e) Sellers breach of, or failure to perform or
satisfy, any of its covenants and obligations hereunder.

Seller shall not be liable to the Buyer Parties under clause (a) or (d) of
this _Section 3.03(b)_ with respect to any Claim unless (i) the amount of the
Claim resulting from any separate fact, condition or event that constitutes a
Claim is in excess of $25,000 (the " _ _Individual Indemnification Threshold__
") and (ii) the aggregate amount of all Claims under this Agreement and the
LLC Purchase Agreement, as defined herein, meeting the Individual
Indemnification Threshold exceeds one and one half percent (1 1/2%) of
the sum of the Purchase Price under this Agreement and the Purchase Price
under the LLC Purchase Agreement (the " _ _Aggregate Indemnification
Threshold__ "). Once the Aggregate Indemnification Threshold has been met,
Seller shall then only be liable for its pro rata portion of those Claims
exceeding the Aggregate Indemnification Threshold, excluding such Claims as
were aggregated to reach the Aggregate  



 

_Page - 9 -_  Indemnification Threshold. For purposes of the preceding sentence, Sellers
pro rata portion of Claims shall mean the amount of all Claims under
this Agreement, divided by the sum of the amount of all Claims under both
this Agreement and the LLC Purchase Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Claims relating to Taxes and claims arising from Sellers breach of its
representations and warranties in _Sections 10.01(v)_ and _10.01(z)_
(collectively, " _ _Seller s Title Warranties__") shall not be subject to the
Individual Indemnification Threshold or the Aggregate Indemnification
Threshold. 

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, unless expressly stated
herein to the contrary, the cumulative obligation of Seller to Buyer Parties
under this _Section 3.03(b)_ will be limited to the ten percent (10%) of the
Purchase Price (the " _ _Indemnity Amount__ ") and will be paid first from the
Escrow Account until the Indemnity Escrow Amount has been exhausted, and
thereafter any remaining obligations, not to exceed the Indemnity Amount,
shall be paid directly by Seller to Buyer Parties. As express exceptions to
the preceding paragraph, Sellers indemnity obligation for Claims relating to
(i) Taxes, (ii) the Excluded Assets, (iii) breaches of Sellers
representations and warranties in _Sections 10.01(a), (b) or (c)_ (" _
_Seller s Authorization Representations_"_) and (iv) breaches of Sellers
Title Warranties will not be limited to the Indemnity Amount. Sellers
obligation to indemnify the Buyer Parties pursuant to this _Section 3.03(b)_,
unless expressly stated herein to the contrary in this _Section 3.03(b)_,
will expire with respect to any Claim for which a Buyer Party has not provided
notice to Seller as provided in _Section 3.03(d)_ on or prior to 5:00
p.m., Houston, Texas time, on the six (6) month anniversary of the Closing
Date (the " _ _Closing Period Termination Date__ "); provided, however, that
(i) Sellers obligation to indemnify Buyer with respect to the
Excluded Assets and breaches of Sellers Authorization Representations and
Sellers Title Warranties shall survive the Closing forever; (ii) Sellers
obligation to indemnify Buyer with respect to breaches of Sellers
representations and warranties in _Section 10.01(g)_ (Taxes) or to otherwise
indemnify Buyer pursuant to clause (c)(ii) (Taxes) of this Section 3.03(b)
shall survive for the applicable statute of limitations, plus 90 days;
and (iii) Sellers obligation to indemnify Buyer pursuant to clauses (c)(i)
(Royalties), and (e) of this _Section 3.03(b)_ shall survive for one (1)
year. The foregoing will not limit the rights of Buyer Parties to
proceed against the Seller as provided herein after the Closing Period
Termination Date with respect to Claims for which a Buyer Party has provided
notice to Seller as provided in _Section 3.03(d)_.

(c) _Buyer s General Indemnification_. Subject to _Section 3.03(b)_, Buyer
shall defend, protect, indemnify and hold Seller, its affiliates, and
its/their partners, members, managers, directors, officers, employees,
contractors and representatives (which additional parties, together with
Seller, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the " _ _Seller Parties__
") harmless from and against any and all Claims in any way arising from, out
of or in connection with, or otherwise relating to: (a) any inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty of Buyer set forth in this Agreement; (b) Buyers
breach of, or failure to perform or satisfy, any of its covenants and
obligations hereunder; and (c) the Assets, including, without limitation, the
ownership or operation thereof and performance thereunder, to the extent such
Claims accrue or are attributable to periods subsequent to the Effective Time
or are attributable to environmental conditions whether or not such conditions
existed prior to the Effective Time or arose subsequent to the Effective Time,
or  _THE SOLE, JOINT, CONCURRENT OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE (BUT NOT SELLER S
GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL _



 

_Page - 10 -_   _MISCONDUCT), STRICT LIABILITY, LIABILITY WITHOUT FAULT, REGULATORY
LIABILITY, STATUTORY LIABILITY, BREACH OF CONTRACT, BREACH OF WARRANTY, OR
OTHER FAULT OR RESPONSIBILITY OF SELLER OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR PARTY._
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Buyers general
indemnification shall not cover, and there shall be excluded therefrom, any
penalties or fines that may now be or may hereafter become due and owing by
Seller or any Target Entity with respect to periods prior to the Effective
Time.

(d) _Claims Procedures_. Promptly upon a party becoming aware of any Claim
with respect to which it believes it is entitled to indemnification hereunder,
whether under this _Section 3.03_, _Section 7.07_, or the other provisions
hereof, such party (an " _ _Indemnified Party__ ") shall notify the other
party in writing of the existence and nature of such Claim, the identity of
any third party claimants and a description of the damages and the amount
thereof relating to such Claim (the " _ _Claim Notice__ "). The Indemnified
Party shall be responsible for the defense of any Claim unless the
Indemnifying Party, upon reasonable notice, requests that the defense of
a Claim be tendered to the Indemnifying Party. If:

(i) the defense of a Claim is so tendered and within ten (10) Business Days
thereafter such tender is accepted by the Indemnifying Party; or

(ii) within ten (10) Business Days after the date on which the Claim Notice
has been given pursuant to this _Section 3.03(d)_, the Indemnifying Party
shall acknowledge in writing to the Indemnified Party its obligation to
provide an indemnity as provided in this  _Section 3.03_ and assume the
defense of the Claim;

then, except as hereinafter provided, the Indemnified Party shall not, and the
Indemnifying Party shall, have the right to contest, defend, litigate or
settle such Claim. The Indemnified Party shall have the right to be
represented by counsel at the Indemnified Partys expense, subject to the
limitations hereof, in any such contest, defense, litigation or settlement
conducted by the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall lose its
right to defend and settle the Claim if it shall fail to diligently contest
and defend the Claim. So long as the Indemnifying Party has not lost its
right and/or obligation to contest, defend, litigate and settle as herein
provided, the Indemnifying Party shall have the exclusive right to contest,
defend and litigate the Claim and shall have the exclusive right, in its
discretion exercised in good faith, and upon the advice of counsel, to settle
any such matter, either before or after the initiation of litigation, at such
time and upon such terms as it deems fair and reasonable; provided, that at
least five (5) Business Days prior to any such settlement, written notice of
its intention to settle shall be given to the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnified Party shall have consented thereto, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. All expenses (including
without limitation attorneys fees) incurred by the Indemnifying Party in
connection with the foregoing shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party;
provided, that, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, if
the Indemnifying Party is the Seller, such expenses shall be paid or
reimbursed to the Indemnified Party solely out of the Indemnity Amount and the
Seller will have no obligation hereunder in excess of such amount.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any settlement negotiated
by an Indemnifying Party, no Indemnified Party shall be required by an
Indemnifying Party to (x) enter into any settlement that does not include as
an unconditional term thereof the delivery by the claimant or plaintiff to
the Indemnified Party of a release from



 

_Page - 11 -_  all liability in respect of such claim or litigation, (y) enter into any
settlement that attributes by its terms liability or wrongdoing to
the Indemnified Party or (z) consent to the entry of any judgment that does
not include as a term thereof a full dismissal of the litigation or Proceeding
with prejudice. No failure by an Indemnifying Party to acknowledge in writing
its indemnification obligations under this _Section 3.03_ shall relieve it
of such obligations to the extent they exist. If the Indemnifying Party fails
to accept a tender of, or assume, the defense of a Claim pursuant to this 
_Section 3.03(d)_, or if, in accordance with the foregoing, the Indemnifying
Party shall lose its right to contest, defend, litigate and settle such a
Claim or if there is a legal conflict, the Indemnified Party shall have the
right, without prejudice to its right of indemnification hereunder, in its
discretion exercised in good faith and upon the advice of counsel, to contest,
defend and litigate such Claim, and may settle such Claim, either before or
after the initiation of litigation, at such time and upon such terms as the
Indemnified Party deems fair and reasonable; provided, that, the Indemnified
Party will not settle such Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. If, pursuant to this _Section 3.03_, the Indemnified
Party so contests, defends, litigates or settles a Claim for which it is
entitled to indemnification hereunder as hereinabove provided,
the Indemnified Party shall be reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party for the
reasonable attorneys fees and other expenses of defending, contesting,
litigating and/or settling the Claim which are incurred from time to time,
forthwith following the presentation to the Indemnifying Party of itemized
bills for said attorneys fees and other expenses; provided, that if the
Indemnifying Party is the Seller and the matter relates to a matter subject to
indemnity by Seller pursuant to clause (a) of _Section 3.03(b)_ (other than
a breach of _Sections 10.01(a)_ , _10.01(b)_ , _10.01(c)_ , _10.01(d)
10.01(g)_ , _10.01(v)_ and _10.01(z)_ hereof), such expenses shall be
reimbursable to the Indemnified Party solely out of the Indemnity Amount, and
the Seller will have no obligation hereunder in excess of such amount.

(e)  _Subrogation_. Following full indemnification as provided for hereunder,
the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnified
Party with respect to all parties relating to the matter for which
indemnification has been made and the Indemnified Party agrees to fully
cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in exercising such subrogation rights.

(f) _Insured Losses; Recoveries from Third Parties_.

(i) The amount of any damages for which indemnification is provided under
this  _Section 3.03_, _Section 7.07_, or the other provisions hereof shall
be net of any duplicative amounts recovered by the Indemnified Party under
insurance policies or from unaffiliated third parties with respect to such
damages. If an Indemnified Party receives an amount under insurance coverage
or from an unaffiliated third party with respect to damages at any time
subsequent to any indemnification provided by an Indemnifying Party pursuant
to this  _Section 3.03_, _Section 7.07_, or the other provisions hereof,
then such Indemnified Party shall promptly deliver such amount (up to the
amount of the indemnification payment made to such Indemnified Party regarding
such matter) to the Indemnifying Party; provided, however, that such
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to retain the amount of any payments made
or costs or expenses incurred in connection with obtaining such payment. The
obligation created by this  _Section 3.03(f)_, _Section 7.07_,  



 

_Page - 12 -_  or the other provisions hereof is an obligation to make repayment in the
event of a recovery from a third party and shall not delay an
Indemnified Partys right to repayment from the Indemnifying Party under this
_Section 3.03_, _Section 7.07_, or the other provisions hereof.

(ii) In the event that any amount of indemnification by the Seller under this
_Section 3.03_, _Section 7.07_, or the other provisions hereof is paid out
of the Escrow Account, and any portion of such amount is subsequently
recovered by the Seller or any of their affiliates, successors or assigns from
a third party prior to the Claim Period Termination Date, the Seller shall
immediately deposit the full amount of such recovery into the Escrow Account,
and the deposited amount shall be escrow assets available for future
satisfaction of claims against the Escrow Account by the Buyer in accordance
with this _Section 3.03_, _Section 7.07_, or the other provisions hereof
and the terms of the Escrow Agreement; provided, however, that such
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to retain the amount of any payments made
or costs or expenses incurred in connection with obtaining such payments.

(g) _Characterization of Indemnification Payments_. Buyer and Seller agree to
treat any payment made under this _Section 3.03_,  _Section 7.07_, or the
other provisions hereof as an adjustment to the Purchase Price. Any
indemnification hereunder will be determined on an after-tax basis (taking
into account any actual tax benefits or detriments realized with respect to
the damages for which the payment under this _Section 3.03_, _Section 7.07_,
or the other provisions hereof is being made).

ARTICLE IV

Taxes and Payables

Section 4.01. _Payment of Taxes_. All real estate, use, ad valorem and
personal property taxes and charges upon any of the Assets or Membership
Interests shall be prorated as of the Effective Time; provided that Buyer
shall pay all such taxes attributable to the calendar year in which the
Closing Date occurs to the extent due and payable after Closing, and at
Closing the Purchase Price will be decreased by Sellers pro rata share of
such items for the period prior to the Effective Date. If the actual amount
of such items is not known as of the Closing Date and the final reconciliation
of the Final Settlement Statement under _Section 15.05_, then Sellers pro
rata share of such items will be determined by using the rates and millages
for the most recent year available and the assessed values for the calendar
year immediately preceding the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs,
with appropriate adjustments for any known changes thereto. In no event shall
the Final Settlement Statement be delayed pending determination of the
proration of taxes pursuant to this Section 4.01.

Seller shall be responsible for all oil and gas production taxes, windfall
profits taxes, and any other similar taxes applicable to Hydrocarbons produced
and saved from or attributable to the Target Entities interest in the
Leases, Wells and Units prior to the Effective Time (excluding Stock
Hydrocarbons), and Buyer shall be responsible for all such taxes applicable to
the Stock Hydrocarbons and all Hydrocarbons produced and saved from or
attributable to the Target Entities interest in the Leases, Wells and Units
from and after the Effective Time.



 

_Page - 13 -_ Both parties believe that the sale of the Membership Interests is an
occasional sale exempt from sales or use taxes and other similar taxes. If
any such taxes are assessed against the transaction, both parties will
cooperate and use their commercially reasonable efforts (at no cost to Seller)
to attempt to eliminate or reduce such taxes. If unsuccessful, Buyer shall be
responsible for any such taxes. In that event, Buyer shall pay Seller any such
state and local sales or use taxes, and Seller shall remit such amount to the
appropriate taxing authority in accordance with applicable law. Any
reasonable legal expenses incurred by Seller at Buyers request to reduce or
avoid any of the aforementioned taxes attributable to Buyer, shall be paid or
reimbursed by Buyer.

Section 4.02. _Other Tax Matters_.

(a) Seller shall be responsible for the preparation and filing of the IRS Form
1065 for the tax years ending on or prior to the Closing Date. Subject to the
adjustments provided in and the provisions of Section 4.01, Seller shall
pay, or cause to be paid, any income or franchise taxes attributable to the
Target Entities with respect to periods ending on or before the Closing Date
or for any tax year beginning before and ending after the Closing Date to the
extent allocable to the portion of such period beginning before and ending on
the Closing Date, regardless of when such returns are to be filed. The Buyer
shall be responsible for the preparation and filing of any IRS forms or other
Tax Returns and any other required Tax Returns and reports relating to income
or franchise taxes for periods of the Target Entities ending subsequent to the
Closing Date. Any Tax Return to be prepared pursuant to the provisions of this
Section 4.02(a) shall be prepared in a manner consistent with practices
followed in prior years with respect to similar Tax Returns, except for
changes required by changes in applicable law or fact.

(b) Buyer and Seller acknowledge that the purchase of the Membership Interests
by the Buyer pursuant to this Agreement will result in the termination of the
Target Entities for federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 708(b) of
the Internal Revenue Code (other than Wild West, assuming no transfers of the
Membership Interests in Wild West have occurred other than the purchase by
Seller) and that a final federal partnership Tax Return will be required to
be filed by the Target Entities, other than Wild West, as a result. Buyer and
Seller agree that such final partnership Tax Returns will be filed using a
closing of the books method, or, if applicable in the case of Wild West, an
interim closing of the books method, as of the end of the Closing Date.

(c) Each Party shall be responsible for its own federal, state, local and
foreign income and franchise taxes, if any, that may result from this
transaction.

Section 6.01. _Examination Period_. Following the execution date of this
Agreement until 5:00 p.m. CDT on April 5, 2007 (the " _ _Examination Period__
"), Seller shall permit Buyer and its representatives to examine, during
normal business hours and such other reasonable times and in Sellers

the Target Entities, subject to such restrictions upon disclosure as may exist
under confidentiality or other agreements binding upon Seller and the Target
Entities or such data; provided, however, that Seller shall, at Buyers
request and at no cost or expense to Seller, request waivers of such
confidentiality restrictions. Seller makes no representations or warranties
whatsoever as to the accuracy, completeness or reliability of such
information, and Buyer relies and depends on and uses such information
exclusively and entirely at its own risk and without recourse to Seller
whatsoever. Neither Seller nor the Target Entities shall be required to
perform any additional title work. No existing abstracts and title opinions
will be updated and made current by Seller or the Target Entities. Should
Buyer prepare or update abstracts or title opinions, a copy of such will be
made available to Seller, without cost and without warranty of any kind, for
Sellers independent examination at least two (2) Business Days prior to
Closing or upon the delivery of a notice of alleged Title Defect, whichever is
the earlier. Buyer specifically agrees that any conclusions made from any
examination done or caused to be done by Buyer from Seller or Target Entity
furnished information regarding title have resulted and shall result from its
own independent review, skill, knowledge and judgment only. 

Section 6.02. _Title Defects_. The term " _ _Title Defect__ " means (a) any
lien, burden, encumbrance, irregularity or other defect, excluding Permitted
Encumbrances, that causes the Target Entities not to have Marketable Title to
any Asset and (b) any default by the Target Entities under a Lease or Contract
that would (i) have a material adverse affect on the operation or value of
any Asset, (ii) prevent the Target Entities from receiving the proceeds of
production attributable to the Target Entities interest therein or (iii)
result in the loss or cancellation of the Target Entities interest therein.
The term " _ _Marketable Title__ " means such ownership by a Target Entity in
the Assets that, subject to and except for the Permitted Encumbrances:

(a) entitles the Target Entities to receive not less than the percentage set
forth in _Exhibit "A"_ as Target Entities Net Revenue Interest (as defined
in the Preamble to Exhibits and Schedules attached hereto) of all Hydrocarbons
produced, saved and marketed from a Lease, Well or Unit, without reduction,
suspension or termination of such interest throughout the productive life of
such Lease, Well or Unit, except as specifically set forth in such Exhibit;

(b) obligates the Target Entities to bear not greater than the Working
Interest percentage set forth in _Exhibit "A"_ of the costs and expenses
relating to the maintenance, development and operation of a Lease, Well or
Unit, all without increase throughout the productive life of such Lease, Well
or Unit, except as specifically set forth in such Exhibit;



 

_Page - 15 -_ (c) entitles the Target Entities to an ownership interest in the Surface
Interests, Personal Property and Contracts which is proportionate to the
Target Entitys working interest in the related Lease, Well or Unit; and

(d) entitles the Target Entities to an ownership interest in the Gathering
Systems not less than that set forth in _Exhibit "A_ " and rights or interests
in Surface Interests covering all of the lands on which the Gathering Systems
are located sufficient to permit the Gathering Systems to be located on such
lands; and

(e) is free and clear of all liens, burdens and encumbrances on title.

Section 6.03. _Permitted Encumbrances_. The term " _ _Permitted Encumbrances__
" means:

 

(a) lessors royalties, non-participating royalties, overriding royalties,
division orders, sales, gathering, transportation and transportation-related
services contracts containing customary terms and provisions, reversionary
interests, and similar burdens if the net cumulative effect of such burdens
does not operate to reduce the Net Revenue Interest in any Well to an amount
less than the Net Revenue Interest set forth on _Exhibit "A"_ , or increase
the Working Interest of any Well from that set forth in _Exhibit "A"_ without
a corresponding increase in the Net Revenue Interest; 

(b) the terms, conditions, restrictions, exceptions, reservations, limitations
and other matters contained in (including, without limitation, any liens or
security interests created by law or reserved in oil and gas leases for
royalty, bonus or rental, or created to secure compliance with the terms of)
the agreements, instruments and documents identified in, and all
other matters described or referred to in, any of the Exhibits and Schedules
hereto, or that otherwise create or reserve to the Target Entities their
interest in the Assets or any of them;

(c) liens for taxes or assessments not yet due or delinquent or, if
delinquent, are identified on _Schedule 6.03(c)_ and are being contested in
good faith in the normal course of business;

(d) The Kane Family Tag Along Right, as described in _Section 9.02_;

(e) all rights to consent by, required notices to, filings with, or other
actions by Governmental Authorities in connection with the sale or

obtained subsequent to such sale or conveyance;

(f) Title Defects or other deficiencies or irregularities waived by Buyer in
writing or not asserted on or before the expiration of the Examination Period;

jurisdiction over the Assets, including, without limitation, rules and
regulations governing production rates and allowables;



 

_Page - 16 -_ (i) vendors, carriers, warehousemens, repairmens, mechanics, workmens,
materialmens, construction or other like liens which have expired as a matter
of law or arising by operation of law in the ordinary course of business or
incident to the construction or improvement of any property in respect
of obligations which are not yet due;

(j) any other lien, claim, charge, encumbrance, contract, agreement,
instrument, obligation, defect, or irregularity affecting the Assets relating
to obligations not yet in default, which is of the nature customarily accepted
by prudent purchasers of oil and gas properties and which, individually or in
the aggregate does not interfere materially with the value or the use of the
Assets, as currently used by the Target Entities, does not prevent the Target
Entities from receiving the proceeds of production from the Assets, does not
reduce the Net Revenue Interest of any of the Wells to less than the Net
Revenue Interest set forth on _Exhibit "A"_ and does not obligate the Target
Entities to bear costs and expenses relating to the maintenance, development
and operation of any of the Wells in any amount greater than the
Working Interest set forth on _Exhibit "A"_ (unless the Net Revenue Interest
for such Well is greater than the Net Revenue Interest set forth in _Exhibit
"A"_ in the same proportion as any increase in such Working Interest); 

(k) lien held by First Bartlesville Bank on White Hawk natural gas compression
system, Ariel JGE/4 three stage compressor and related attached equipment

Section 6.04. _Notice of Title Defects; Title Defect Valuation_.

(a) If Buyer discovers any Title Defect affecting an Asset, Buyer shall
promptly notify Seller of such alleged Title Defect. To be effective, such
notice (a " _ _Title Defect Notice__ ") must (i) be in writing, (ii) be
received prior to the expiration of the Examination Period, (iii) describe the
Title Defect in reasonable detail (including any alleged variance in the Net
Revenue Interest or Working Interest), (iv) identify the specific Asset or
Assets affected by such Title Defect, and (v) include the Title Defect Value,
as reasonably determined by Buyer acting in good faith. Upon receipt of a
timely Title Defect Notice, upon request by Seller, Buyer shall promptly
deliver to Seller copies of all data, records, title reports, opinions and
other information in Buyers possession or control bearing upon or relating to
the alleged Title Defect and its determination of the Title Defect Value.

(b) The value attributable to each Title Defect (the " _ _Title
Defect Value__ ") shall be determined based upon the criteria set forth
below:

(i) If the Title Defect is a lien upon an Asset, the Title Defect Value is
the amount necessary to be paid to remove the lien from the affected Asset.



 

_Page - 17 -_ (ii) If the Title Defect asserted is that the Net Revenue Interest
attributable to a Well is less than that stated in _Exhibit "A"_ (and there
is a corresponding and proportionate decrease in Working Interest), then the
Title Defect Value is the product of the Allocated Value attributed to such
Asset, _multiplied_ by a fraction, the numerator of which is the difference
between the Net Revenue Interest applicable thereto set forth in _Exhibit "A"_
and the actual Net Revenue Interest, and the denominator of which is the
applicable Net Revenue Interest stated in _Exhibit "A"_.

(iii) If the Title Defect represents an obligation, encumbrance, burden
or charge upon the affected Asset (including any increase in Working Interest
for which there is not a proportionate increase in Net Revenue Interest) and
for which the economic detriment to Buyer is unliquidated, the amount of the
Title Defect Value shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated
Value of the affected Asset, the portion of the Asset affected by the Title
Defect, the legal effect of the Title Defect, and the potential discounted
economic effect of the Title Defect over the life of the affected Asset.

(iv) If a Title Defect does not adversely affect an Asset throughout the
entire productive life of such Asset, such fact shall be taken into account
in determining the Title Defect Value.

(v) The Title Defect Value of a Title Defect shall be determined without
duplication of any costs or losses included in another Title Defect Value
hereunder.

(vi) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall a
Title Defect Value exceed the Allocated Value of the Wells, Leases and other
Assets affected thereby.

(vii) Such other factors as are reasonably necessary to make a proper
evaluation.

Section 6.05. _Remedies for Title Defects_. Subject to _Sections 6.07_ and
_6.08_ , the following shall be Buyers sole and exclusive remedy with
respect to Title Defects:

(a) Upon the receipt of a Title Defect Notice from Buyer asserting an alleged
Title Defect, Seller shall have the option, but not the obligation, to
attempt to cure such Title Defect at any time prior to the Closing.

(b) With respect to any alleged Title Defect that is not reasonably cured on
or before the Closing, and the Title Defect Value for such Asset exceeds the
Allocated Value for such Asset, each Party shall have the option, but not the
obligation, to exclude the affected Asset from the Assets and the Purchase
Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of such affected Asset.



 

_Page - 18 -_ (c) With respect to each alleged Title Defect that is not reasonably cured on
or before the Closing and the affected Asset has not been excluded from the
transaction pursuant to Section 6.05(b), an amount equal to the Title Defect
Value agreed upon in writing by Buyer and Seller acting reasonably shall be
paid by Buyer at Closing out of the Adjusted Purchase Price to the Escrow
Agent for deposit in the Escrow Account and Seller shall, such subject to the
further provisions hereof, have up to ninety (90) days following the Closing
Date to attempt to cure such Title Defect; provided, that, if the parties
have not agreed upon the validity of an alleged Title Defect, or the Title
Defect Value attributable thereto, the amount so deposited in the Escrow
Account for such alleged Title Defect shall be that reasonably determined by
Buyer acting in good faith. If Seller reasonably cures the Title Defect within
such ninety-day period, Seller will be entitled to be distributed from the
Escrow Account the amount equal to the Title Defect Value, together with
any earnings on such amount. If Seller does not reasonably cure the Title
Defect within the allotted period, Buyer will be entitled to be distributed
from the Escrow Account the amount equal to the Title Defect Value, as finally
determined, together with any earnings on such amount, and the Purchase Price
hereunder will be deemed to be reduced by the amount of the Title Defect
Value.

(d) If Buyer and Seller have not agreed (i) on or before Closing upon the
validity of an asserted Title Defect, or have not agreed on the Title Defect
Value attributable thereto, or (ii) upon whether a Title Defect has
been reasonably cured, then either party shall have the right to elect by
written notice, delivered before or after Closing, to have the validity of
such Title Defect, such Title Defect Value or the sufficiency of Sellers cure
determined by an Independent Expert pursuant to _Article VIII_. In no event
shall any disbursement from the Escrow Account be made to Seller or Buyer with
respect to a Title Defect that is the subject of a dispute pending before the
Independent Expert until such dispute is finally resolved as provided in
_Section 8.02_ hereof, which shall include, without limitation, an award of
the escrowed funds attributable to such Title Defect. To the extent the
Independent Expert is determining the validity of a Title Defect, Seller
shall have ninety (90) days from the date the Independent Expert determines
that a Title Defect exists to cure such Title Defect.

(e) Any Title Defect cured by Seller or for which Buyer receives a Purchase
Price adjustment or payment pursuant to this _Article V_ , shall constitute a
Permitted Encumbrance hereunder and under the Assignment. 

Section 6.06. _Title Benefits_.

(a) Subject to _Section 6.07_, Seller shall be entitled to an upward
adjustment to the Purchase Price with respect to all Title Benefits of which
Seller provides Buyer notice (a " _ _Title Benefit Notice__ ") in writing
prior to the expiration of the Examination Period in an amount (the " _ _Title
Benefit Value__ ") mutually agreed upon by the parties determined in
accordance with the criteria set forth in the definition of the term Title
Defect Value, net of the mutually agreed Title Defect Value. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if the Title Defect Value is disputed, no upward adjustment to
the Purchase Price shall be made for Title Benefits until the Title Defect
Value has been determined in accordance with _Section 6.05_. A party
identifying a Title Benefit affecting the Assets shall promptly notify the
other party in writing of such Title Benefit. The term " _ _Title Benefit__ "
shall mean Target Entities Net Revenue Interest in any Well that is greater
than the Net Revenue Interest set forth in _Exhibit "A"_ , or Target Entities
Working Interest in any Well is less than the Working Interest set forth in
Exhibit "A" (without a proportionate decrease in the Net Revenue Interest).



 

_Page - 19 -_ (b) If with respect to an asserted Title Benefit the parties have not agreed
on the validity of the Title Benefit or the Title Benefit Value attributable
thereto on or before Closing, Seller or Buyer shall have the right to elect by
written notice to the other party to have the validity of the Title Benefit
and/or the Title Benefit Value determined by an Independent Expert pursuant
to _Section 8.01_. If the validity of the Title Benefit and/or the Title
Benefit Value is not determined pursuant to this Agreement by the Closing, the
Title Benefit Value determined by Seller, acting reasonably and in good
faith, shall be offset by the aggregate Title Defect Value, and such amount
shall be deposited in the Escrow Account at Closing. Upon the final
determination of the Title Benefit Value (i) the Escrow Agent shall refund
to Buyer the amount, if any, by which the amount so paid by Buyer at Closing
exceeds such Title Benefit Value, net of the Title Defect Value and (ii) the
Escrow Agent shall pay to Seller the amount, if any, of such Title Benefit
Value, net of the Title Defect Value. In no event shall any disbursement from
the Escrow Account be made to Seller or Buyer with respect to a Title Benefit
that is the subject of a dispute pending before the Independent Expert until
such dispute is finally resolved as provided in _Section 8.02_, which shall
include, without limitation, an award of the escrowed funds attributable to
such Title Benefit.

Section 6.07. _Limitation of Remedies for Title Defects; Title
Benefits_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, if (a) the Title Defect Value for a given Title Defect, or the
Title Benefit Value of a given Title Benefit, does not exceed $50,000, then no
claim or adjustment to the Purchase Price shall be made for such Title Defect
or Title Benefit, (b) if the aggregate net value of all uncured Title Defects
and Title Benefits under this Agreement and under that certain Purchase and
Sale Agreement of even date herewith between Buyer and EnergyQuest and
certain affiliates of EnergyQuest as Seller (the " _ _Asset Purchase
Agreement__ ") does not exceed one and one-half percent (1 1/2%) of the sum of
the Purchase Price under this Agreement and the Purchase Price under the Asset
Purchase Agreement (the _" _Aggregate Title Threshold__ "), then no
adjustment of the Purchase Price shall be made therefor, and (c) if the
aggregate net value of all uncured Title Defects and Title Benefits exceeds
the Aggregate Title Threshold (prior to any adjustments thereto), then the
Purchase Price shall only be adjusted by the amount of such excess. The
allocation of the amount of Purchase Price adjustment for Title Defects
between this Agreement and the Asset Purchase Agreement shall be determined on
a pro rata basis, based upon the contribution of Title Defect Values
attributable to each agreement relative to the total value of all Title
Defects.

Section 6.08. _Termination_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
if on the Closing Date the aggregate Title Defect Values, as finally
determined, for all uncured Title Defects (net of Title Benefits) exceeding
$50,000 and not waived by Buyer under this Agreement and the Asset Purchase
Agreement exceeds an amount equal to five percent (5%) of the sum of the
Purchase Price under this Agreement and the Purchase Price under the Asset
Purchase Agreement (in each case, prior to any adjustments thereto), then
either Buyer or Seller shall have the option to terminate this Agreement,
without any liability, upon written notice to the other party. If either party
exercises its option to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
6.08_, this Agreement shall become void and have no effect, and neither party
shall have any further right or duty to or claim against the other party under
this Agreement.



 

_Page - 20 -_ ARTICLE VII

Environmental Matters

Section 7.01. _Environmental Review_.

(a) Buyer shall have the right to conduct an environmental review of the
Assets prior to the expiration of the Examination Period (" _ _Buyer s
Environmental Review__"). Seller shall provide Buyer such access as it may
reasonably request to the Assets (if operated by Seller or a Target Entity)
and the environmental data in Sellers and the Target Entities files. With
respect to Assets not operated by Seller or a Target Entity, Seller agrees, at
no cost or expense to Seller, to request that the operator of such Assets
grant Buyer such access. Seller makes no representations or warranties
whatsoever as to the accuracy, completeness or reliability of any such
environmental information, and Buyer relies and depends on and uses any and
all such environmental information, review or inspection exclusively and
entirely at its own risk and without any recourse to Seller whatsoever.

(b) The cost and expense of Buyers Environmental Review shall be
borne solely by Buyer. The scope of work comprising Buyers Environmental
Review conducted at or upon the Leases, Units, Wells and Gathering Systems
shall be limited to that mutually agreed in writing by Buyer and Seller
(acting reasonably) prior to commencement thereof and shall not include any
intrusive test or procedure without the prior written consent of Seller;
provided, that Buyer may terminate this Agreement if Seller unreasonably
withholds such consent. Buyer shall (i) consult with Seller before conducting
any work comprising such Buyers Environmental Review, (ii) perform all such
work in a safe and workmanlike manner and so as to not unreasonably interfere
with Sellers operations, and (iii) comply with all applicable laws, rules,
and regulations of applicable Governmental Authority. Buyer shall be
responsible for obtaining any third party consents that are required in order
to perform any work comprising Buyers Environmental Review. Buyer shall
consult with Seller prior to requesting each such third party consent and
Seller shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer in connection with obtaining such
consent. Seller shall have the right to have a representative or
representatives accompany Buyer at all times during Buyers Environmental
Review, and Buyer shall give Seller notice not more than seven (7) days and
not less than 48 hours before any visits by Buyer to the Assets, and Buyer
shall seek and obtain Sellers prior consent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld) before it enters upon the Assets. With respect to any samples taken
in connection with Buyers Environmental Review, Buyer shall take split
samples, providing one of each such sample, properly labeled and identified,
to Seller. Buyer hereby agrees to release, defend, indemnify and hold harmless
Seller Parties from and against all Claims arising from, out of or in
connection with, or otherwise relating to, Buyers Environmental Review,
_REGARDLESS OF THE SOLE, JOINT, CONCURRENT OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE (BUT NOT
ANY SELLER PARTY S GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT), STRICT LIABILITY,
REGULATORY LIABILITY, STATUTORY LIABILITY, BREACH OF CONTRACT, BREACH OF
WARRANTY, OR OTHER FAULT OR RESPONSIBILITY OF A SELLER PARTY OR ANY OTHER
PERSON OR PARTY._ Notwithstanding the foregoing and assuming that Buyer
complies with the notice requirements of this Article VII, 



 

_Page - 21 -_  prior to Closing, Buyer shall have no indemnity obligation to Seller with
respect to Buyers discovery of information that may lead to Claims
arising from the condition of the Assets prior to Buyers Environmental
Review.

(c) Unless otherwise required by applicable law, Buyer shall treat all
matters revealed by Buyers Environmental Review, including, without
limitation, any analyses, compilations, studies, documents, reports or data
prepared or generated from such review (the " _ _Environmental Information__
"), as confidential, and Buyer shall not disclose any Environmental
Information to any Governmental Authority or other third party without the
prior written consent of Seller except as hereafter provided. Buyer may use
the Environmental Information only in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Environmental Information shall be
disclosed by Buyer to only those persons who need to know the Environmental
Information for purposes of evaluating the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement, and who agree to be bound by the terms of this _Section 7.01(c)_.
If Buyer or any third party to whom Buyer has provided any Environmental
Information is requested, compelled or required to disclose any of the
Environmental Information by a court or other Governmental Authority, or
disclosure is otherwise required under applicable law, Buyer shall provide
Seller with prompt notice sufficiently prior to any such disclosure so as to
allow Seller to file for any protective order, or seek any other remedy, as it
deems appropriate under the circumstances. If this Agreement is terminated
prior to the Closing, upon Sellers request Buyer shall promptly deliver
the Environmental Information, and all copies thereof and works based
thereon, to Seller, which Environmental Information shall become the sole
property of Seller; provided, however, that Buyer may retain copies thereof in
the event of a dispute between Buyer and Seller arising from or relating to
such termination. Upon request Buyer shall provide copies of the Environmental
Information to Seller without charge. The terms and provisions of this
_Section 7.01(c)_ shall survive any such termination of this Agreement,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary. In no event shall an Environmental
Defect be the basis for adjusting the Purchase Price by an amount greater than
the Allocated Value of the Asset(s) affected thereby. 

Section 7.02. _Environmental Definitions_.

(a) The term " _ _Environmental Defect__ " shall mean, with respect to any
given Asset, a material violation of Environmental Laws in effect as of the
Effective Time in the jurisdiction in which such Asset is located.

(b) The term " _ _Governmental Authority__ " shall mean any tribal authority,
the United States and any state, county, city and political subdivisions that
exercises jurisdiction, and any agency, department, board, commission or other
instrumentality thereof.

(c) The term " _ _Environmental Laws__ " shall mean all laws, statutes,
ordinances, court decisions, rules and regulations of any Governmental
Authority pertaining to the environment as may be interpreted by applicable
final, non-appealable court decisions or administrative orders.

(d) The term " _ _Environmental Defect Value__ " shall mean, with respect to
an Environmental Defect, the estimated costs and expenses to correct such
Environmental Defect in the most cost effective manner reasonably available,
consistent with Environmental Laws, taking  



 

_Page - 22 -_  into account that non-permanent remedies (such as mechanisms to contain or
stabilize hazardous materials, including without limitation monitoring
site conditions, natural attenuation, risk-based corrective action,
institutional controls or other appropriate restrictions on the use of
property, caps, dikes, encapsulation, leachate collection systems, etc.) may
be the most cost effective manner reasonably available, together with such
other Claims as may reasonably be expected to arise from such Environmental
Defect.

Section 7.03. _Notice of Environmental Defects_. If Buyer discovers any
alleged Environmental Defect affecting the Assets, Buyer shall promptly notify
Seller of such alleged Environmental Defect. To be effective, such notice
(an " _ _Environmental Defect Notice__ ") must (a) be in writing, (b) be
received by Seller prior to the expiration of the Examination Period, (c)
describe the Environmental Defect in reasonable detail, including (i) the
written conclusion of Buyer that an Environmental Defect exists, and (ii) a
citation of the Environmental Laws alleged to be violated and a summary of the
related facts that substantiate such violation, (d) identify the specific
Assets affected by such Environmental Defect, (e) the procedures recommended
to correct the Environmental Defect and (f) Buyers reasonable good faith
estimate of the Environmental Defect Value, for which Buyer would agree
to adjust the Purchase Price in order to accept such Environmental Defect if
Seller elected _Section 7.04(c)_ as the remedy therefor. Any matters that may
otherwise constitute Environmental Defects, but of which Seller has not
been specifically notified by Buyer in accordance with the foregoing,
together with any environmental matter that does not constitute an
Environmental Defect, shall, be deemed to have been waived by Buyer for all
purposes and constitute an assumed obligation of Buyer at Closing. Upon
receipt of a timely Environmental Defect Notice, upon request by Seller, Buyer
shall promptly deliver to Seller copies of all data, records, reports,
opinions and other information in Buyers possession or control bearing upon
or relating to the alleged Environmental Defect and its determination of the
Environmental Defect Value, including, without limitation, site plans showing
the location of sampling events, boring logs and other field notes describing
the sampling methods utilized and the field conditions observed, chain of
custody documentation and laboratory reports.

Section 7.04. _Remedies for Environmental Defects_. Subject to _Sections 7.05_
and _7.06_ , the following shall be Buyers sole and exclusive remedy with
respect to alleged Environmental Defects:

(a) Upon the receipt of an Environmental Defect Notice from Buyer asserting an
alleged Environmental Defect, Seller shall have the option, but not
the obligation, to attempt to cure such Environmental Defect at any time
prior to the Closing.

(b) With respect to any alleged Environmental Defect that is not reasonably
cured on or before the Closing, and the Environmental Defect Value for such
Asset exceeds the Allocated Value for such Asset, either Party may have the
option, but not the obligation, to exclude the affected Asset from the Assets
and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of such
affected Asset.

(c) With respect to each alleged Environmental Defect that is not reasonably
cured on or before the Closing and has not been excluded from the transaction
pursuant to _Section 7.04(b)_, an amount equal to the Environmental Defect
Value agreed upon in writing by  



 

_Page - 23 -_  Buyer and Seller acting reasonably shall be paid by Buyer at Closing out of
the Adjusted Purchase Price to the Escrow Agent for deposit in the Escrow
Account and Seller shall have up to ninety (90) days following the Closing
Date to attempt to cure such Environmental Defect; provided, that, if the
parties have not agreed upon the validity of the alleged Environmental Defect,
or the Environmental Defect Value attributable thereto, the amount so
deposited for such alleged Environmental Defect shall be that reasonably
determined by Buyer acting in good faith. If Seller reasonably cures the
Environmental Defect within such ninety-day period, Seller will be entitled
to be distributed from the Escrow Account the amount equal to the
Environmental Defect Value, together with any earnings on such amount. If
Seller does not cure the Environmental Defect within such sixty-day period,
Buyer will be entitled to be distributed from the Escrow Account the amount
equal to the Environmental Defect Value, together with any earnings on such
amount, and the Purchase Price hereunder will be deemed to be reduced by the
amount of the Environmental Defect Value.

(d) If Buyer and Seller have not agreed (i) on or before Closing upon the
validity of any asserted Environmental Defect, or if the parties have not
agreed on the Environmental Defect Value therefor, or (ii) upon whether an
alleged Environmental Defect has been reasonably cured, then either party by
written notice to the other party, delivered before or after Closing, shall
have the right to elect to have the validity of the asserted Environmental
Defect, the Environmental Defect Value for such Environmental Defect, or the
sufficiency of Sellers cure determined by an Independent Expert pursuant to
_Article VIII_. In no event shall any disbursement from the Escrow Account be
made to Seller or Buyer with respect to an Environmental Defect that is the
subject of a dispute pending before the Independent Expert until such dispute
is finally resolved as provided in _Article VIII_ hereof, which shall include,
without limitation, an award of the escrowed funds attributable to such
Environmental Defect. To the extent the Independent Expert is determining the
validity of an Environmental Defect, Seller shall have ninety (90) days from
the date the Independent Expert determines that an Environmental Defect exists
to cure such Environmental Defect.

Section 7.05. _Limitation of Remedies for Environmental Defects_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (a) if
the Environmental Defect Value for a given Environmental Defect does not
exceed $50,000, then no adjustment to the Purchase Price shall be made for
such Environmental Defect, (b) if the aggregate of all Environmental Defect
Values exceeding $50,000 for uncured Environmental Defects not waived by Buyer
under this Agreement and under the Asset Purchase Agreement does not exceed
one and one-half percent (1 1/2%) of the sum of the Purchase Price under this
Agreement and the Purchase Price under the Asset Purchase Agreement (the " _
_Aggregate Environmental Defect Threshold__ "), then no adjustment of the
Purchase Price shall be made therefor, and (c) if the aggregate of all
Environmental Defect Values exceeding $50,000 for uncured Environmental
Defects not waived by Buyer exceeds the Aggregate Environmental Defect
Threshold, then the Purchase Price shall only be reduced by the amount of such
excess. The allocation of the amount of Purchase Price adjustment for
Environmental Defects between this Agreement and the Asset Purchase Agreement
shall be determined on a pro rata basis, based upon the contribution of
Environmental Defect Values attributable to each agreement relative to the
total value of all Environmental Defects.



 

_Page - 24 -_ Section 7.06. _Termination_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
if on the Closing Date the aggregate of all Environmental Defect Values
exceeding $50,000 for all uncured Environmental Defects not waived by Buyer
under this Agreement and under the Asset Purchase Agreement exceeds an amount
equal to five percent (5%) of the Purchase Price under this Agreement and the
Purchase Price under the Asset Purchase Agreement (in each case, prior to any
adjustments thereto), then either Seller or Buyer shall be entitled to
terminate this Agreement, without any liability, upon written notice to the
other party. If either party exercises its option to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 7.06_, the Agreement shall become void and have no
effect, and neither party shall have any further right or duty to or claim
against the other party under this Agreement.

Section 7.07. _Post-Closing Environmental Indemnification by Buyer_. Buyer
shall, with respect to the Assets and without regard to whether same arise or
occur prior to or after the Effective Time (except as otherwise expressly
provided below) assume and indemnify, defend and hold Seller Parties harmless
from and against any and all Claims caused by, resulting from, or relating or
incidental to all matters affecting health, safety and the environment
(excluding, however, fines and penalties owed by Seller or a Target Entity
with respect to ownership or operation of the Assets prior to the Effective
Time) including without limitation Claims relating to:

(a) environmental pollution or contamination, including pollution or
contamination of the soil, groundwater or air by Hydrocarbons, drilling fluid
and other chemicals, brine, produced water, NORM or any other substance, and
other violation of Environmental Laws;

(b) underground injection activities;

(c) clean-up responses, and the cost of remediation, control, assessment or
compliance with respect to surface and subsurface pollution caused by spills,
pits, ponds, lagoons or storage tanks;

(d) failure to comply with applicable land use, surface disturbance, licensing
or notification requirements;

(e) disposal of any hazardous substances, wastes, materials and products
generated by or used in connection with the ownership, development, operation
or abandonment of any part of the Assets; provided, however, that in no event

that physical changes in the land may have occurred as a result of such uses
and that Buyer has entered into this Agreement on the basis of Buyers own
investigation or right to investigate, the physical condition of the Assets,
including, without limitation, equipment, surface and subsurface conditions.
Except as set forth in this Agreement, the Assignment, and the agreements,

ARTICLE XII

Operation of the Assets and Certain Agreements

Section 12.01. _Operation of the Assets_.

(a) _Operations Prior to Closing_. After the date of this Agreement and prior
to the Closing, to the extent within the control of Seller, Seller shall use,
operate and maintain the Assets in substantially the same manner in which they
have been used, operated and maintained prior to this Agreement. During the
period from the Effective Time until Closing, Seller shall have no liability
to Buyer for Claims sustained or liabilities incurred with respect to the
Assets, REGARDLESS OF THE SOLE, JOINT, CONCURRENT OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE
(BUT NOT SELLERS GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT), STRICT LIABILITY,
REGULATORY LIABILITY, STATUTORY LIABILITY, BREACH OF CONTRACT, BREACH OF
WARRANTY, OR OTHER FAULT OR RESPONSIBILITY OF SELLER OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR
PARTY. After the date hereof and prior to Closing, Seller may (without Buyers
consent) enter into agreements or transactions in relation to the Assets
which (a) individually involve a fair market value of less than $25,000,
individually (net to Sellers interest) or $100,000, in the aggregate (net to
Sellers interest) and (b) are entered into in the ordinary course of
business, consistent with past practices. With Closing, Seller is relieved of
and shall not be obligated for any expenditures attributable to periods after
the Effective Time, and shall recover any such charges and expenses as part
of the Closing Statement and Final Settlement Statement adjustments, as
appropriate. Except with respect to those matters described above, if any
material expenditure, contract or agreement is proposed or contemplated,
Seller shall submit such proposal to Buyer for concurrence with Sellers
recommendation. Buyer will make any required election under its independent
evaluation and shall assume the cost and risk of any consequences which arise
as a result of Buyers election to participate or Buyers failure to timely
elect or election to not participate in or not approve an operation and not
pay such expenditure, without regard to whether Closing occurs. Additionally,
after the execution of this Agreement and prior to Closing, Seller shall have
the right to make any changes, repairs or modifications to the Assets,  



 

_Page - 38 -_  and incur any related expenditure deemed necessary by Seller, to prevent or
react to an emergency involving serious risk of loss of or damage to
life, property, or the environment. With regard to the preceding sentence,
Seller shall notify Buyer as soon as possible of the emergency and Sellers
response thereto and shall have the right to cause or effect such expenditure
or action with or without Buyers approval, and recover such costs in the
Closing Statement or Final Settlement Statement adjustments, as appropriate.
Prior to Closing, Seller shall (i) consult with and advise Buyer regarding all
material matters concerning the operation, management, and administration of
the Assets; and (ii) obtain Buyers written approval before voting under any
operating, unit, joint venture, or similar agreement. Furthermore, Seller will
not, without the prior written consent of Buyer, (x) enter into any agreement
or arrangement transferring, selling, or encumbering any of the Assets; (y)
grant any preferential or other similar right to purchase any of the Assets;
or (z) enter into any new production sales contract extending beyond the
Closing Date and not terminable on thirty (30) days notice or less. Promptly
after execution of this Agreement, Seller shall notify the holders of the
Consents of the transactions contemplated herein and request their consent.
Buyer shall have the right to review and approve the form of such notices,
such approval not to be unreasonably withheld. Buyer and Seller each agree to
reasonably cooperate with efforts to obtain such required consents.

(b) Buyer acknowledges that the Target Entities own undivided interests in
some or all of the Assets, and Buyer agrees that the acts or omissions of the
other working interest owners shall not constitute a violation of the
provisions of this _Article XII_ , nor shall any action required by a vote of
working interest owners constitute such a violation so long as the Target
Entities have voted their interests in a manner that complies with the
provisions of this _Article XII_. To the extent that a Target Entity is not
the operator of any of the Assets, the obligations of Seller in this
_Article XII_ shall be construed to require that Seller use reasonable
efforts (without being obligated to incur any expense or institute any cause
of action) to cause the operator of such Assets to take such actions or render
such performance within the constraints of the applicable operating
agreements and other applicable agreements.

(c) Buyer agrees and understands that Seller shall have the right to cause
the Target Entities to make dividends or distributions of cash and the
Excluded Assets directly or indirectly to Seller at any time prior to the
Closing. No action taken in accordance with this _Section 12.01(c)_ shall be
considered as violation of any other provision of this Agreement. Any action
taken pursuant to this _Section 12.01(c)_ shall be taken by the Target
Entities without warranty of any kind (express, implied or statutory) and
without any liability to Buyer or any Target Entity.

(d) From and after the date hereof up to the Closing, Seller shall:

(i) keep or cause to be kept in full force and effect until Closing all
insurance (including operators extra expense and casualty coverages) now
maintained by Seller (with respect to the Target Entities or the Assets)
and/or the Target Entities;

(ii) not encumber or permit any Target Entity to encumber any of the Assets
other than for Permitted Encumbrances;



 

_Page - 39 -_ (iii) use reasonable efforts to preserve the present relationships of the
Target Entities with persons having significant business relations therewith
such as suppliers, customers, brokers, agents or otherwise;

(iv) cause the Target Entities to conduct their business only in the ordinary
course and, by way of amplification and not limitation, Seller will not,
without the prior written consent of Buyer:

(A) issue, sell or otherwise dispose of membership interests in the Target
Entities;

(B) make or change any material tax election or tax accounting method or
settle or compromise any material tax liability other than in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practices or change its
fiscal year;

(C) grant any options or warrants or other rights to purchase or otherwise
acquire any membership interests or issue any securities convertible into
membership interests;

(D) amend any Target Entitys Limited Liability Company Agreement;

(E) borrow, except in the ordinary course of business, or agree to borrow any
funds, or guarantee or agree to guarantee the obligations of others;

(F) waive any material rights; or except in the ordinary course of
business enter into an agreement, contract or commitment which, if entered
into prior to the date of this Agreement, would be required to be listed in a
Schedule attached to this Agreement, or materially amend or change the terms
of any such agreement, contract or commitment;

(G) renegotiate any contract or make any adjustments or settlements with
respect to any Production Imbalance, joint interest billing or oil or gas
receivable; or

(H) take any action or omit to take any action which would result in any of
its representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement becoming
untrue.

Disputes

Section 16.01. _Arbitration_. In case of a dispute, controversy or Claim
arising out of, relating to or in connection with this Agreement, including
any dispute regarding its validity or termination, but excluding any matters
as to which an Independent Expert has been selected, Seller and Buyer shall
attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with
respect to each such Claim within forty-five (45) days of receipt of notice of
such Claim. If the applicable parties should so agree, a memorandum setting
forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by such parties.

If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation lasting not
longer than forty-five (45) days after the receipt of notice of such claim,
any of the applicable parties may demand binding arbitration of the matter
unless the amount of the damage or loss is at issue in pending litigation with
a third party, in which event arbitration shall not be commenced until such
amount is ascertained or both parties agree to arbitration. If the amount in
dispute is less than Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) the Arbitration shall
be administered by AAA and shall be conducted by one neutral arbitrator. If
the amount in dispute is equal to or greater than Five Million Dollars
($5,000,000) the Arbitration shall be administered by AAA and shall be
conducted by three neutral arbitrators. The arbitrators, whether one or three,
shall be selected jointly by Seller and Buyer from a list of arbitrators
provided by the AAA having experience in the area of oil and gas asset
acquisitions. If the parties are unable or fail to agree upon an arbitrator or
arbitrators, the arbitrator(s) shall be selected by the AAA. The
arbitrator(s) shall set a limited time period and establish procedures
designed to reduce the cost and time for discovery while allowing the parties
an opportunity, adequate in the sole judgment of the arbitrator(s), to
discover relevant information from the opposing parties about the subject
matter of the dispute. Any dispute regarding discovery, or the relevance or
scope thereof, shall be determined by arbitration and shall be governed by the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The decision of the



 

_Page - 45 -_ arbitrator(s) as to the validity and amount of any claim shall be made in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and shall be binding and
conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement. The award by the arbitrator(s)
shall be in writing, shall be signed by the arbitrator(s) and shall include a
statement of written findings of fact and conclusions regarding the reasons
for the disposition of any claim. In no event shall the arbitration award
exceed the maximum amount in dispute, plus Costs and fees.

Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court
having jurisdiction. Any such arbitration shall be held in Houston, Texas
under the Commercial Arbitration Rules then in effect of the AAA. The
arbitrator shall designate which party is the prevailing party in the
dispute, taking into account, among other factors, the amount in dispute and
the amount of the award. The non-prevailing party shall pay all costs and fees
associated with the arbitration. In the event there is no prevailing party,
then the parties shall share costs and fees equally. " _ _Costs and fees__ "
for purposes of this subsection mean all reasonable pre-award expenses of the
arbitration, including the arbitrators fees, administrative fees, travel
expenses, out of pocket expenses such as copying and telephone, witness fees
and reasonable attorneys fees.

By agreeing to arbitration, the parties do not intend to deprive any court
with jurisdiction of its ability to issue a preliminary injunction, attachment
or other form of provisional remedy in aid of the arbitration and a request
of such provisional remedies by a party to a court shall not be deemed a
waiver of the agreement to arbitrate.

(b) Seller agrees that during the period between the date of this Agreement
and the Closing Date, Seller shall maintain insurance with respect to
the Assets with financially sound and reputable insurance companies, in such
amounts, with such deductibles and covering such risks as are customarily
carried by reasonable, prudent operators of similar properties.

(c) Seller and Buyer agree that, as of the Closing Date, all of the Seller
Policies shall cease to apply to the Assets and the operations in which
the Assets are used and that Buyer shall make no claims under the Seller
Policies with respect to any matter whatsoever, whether arising before or
after the Closing Date.

(d) In the event that any Claim is hereafter made under or with respect to any
of the Seller Policies by Buyer or any of its affiliates, but not an unrelated
third party, Buyer shall indemnify and defend Seller and Seller Parties
against and shall hold them harmless from such Claim and all costs and
expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys fees and court costs)
related thereto.

Section 18.03. _Casualty Loss of Assets_. If, prior to Closing, a portion of
the Assets is damaged or destroyed by a Casualty Loss, Seller may at its sole
option, prior to Closing, repair the damage at its cost or reduce the Purchase

Asset from the sale and reduce the Purchase Price by the Allocated Value

Section 18.06. _Assignment_. Prior to Closing, Buyer may not assign any rights
acquired hereunder or delegate any duties assumed hereunder without the prior
written consent of Seller or its respective successors and assigns; provided,

and liabilities under this Agreement and under the Assignment, until expressly
released by Seller in writing.

Section 18.09. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws
of the State of Texas, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts
of law. The validity of the conveyances affecting the title to real property

jurisdiction in which such property is situated. The provisions contained in
such conveyances and the remedies available because of a breach of such
provisions shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
the State of Texas, without giving effect to the principles of conflict of
laws.

Section 18.10. _Confidentiality_. Buyer agrees that all information furnished
or disclosed by Seller or acquired by Buyer in connection with the sale of
the Assets shall remain confidential prior to Closing. Buyer may disclose such
information only to its subsidiaries or affiliates, agents, advisors, counsel
or representatives (herein " _ _Representatives__ ") who have agreed, prior
to being given access to such information, to maintain the confidentiality
thereof. In the event that Closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement does not occur for any reason, Buyer agrees that all information
furnished or disclosed by Seller or acquired by Buyer in connection with the
inspection, testing, inventory or sale of the Assets shall remain
confidential, with Seller a third party beneficiary of any privilege held by
Buyer. Buyer and its Representatives shall promptly return to Seller any and
all materials and information furnished or disclosed by Seller relating in any
way to the Assets, including any notes, summaries, compilations, analyses or
other material derived from the inspection or evaluation of such material and
information, without retaining copies thereof and destroy any information
relating to the Assets and independently acquired by Buyer. In the event of
any conflict between this Section 18.10 and any other confidentiality
agreement affecting Buyer and Seller, this Section 18.10 shall control.

Section 18.11. _Survival of Certain Obligations_. Except as expressly
provided otherwise in this Agreement, waivers, disclaimers, releases,
representations, warranties and continuing obligations of Buyer, and all
obligations of either party for indemnity and defense contained in this
Agreement shall survive the execution and delivery of the Assignment and the
Closing.

Section 18.12. _Further Cooperation_. After the Closing, each party shall
execute, acknowledge, and deliver all documents, and take all such acts which
from time to time may be reasonably requested by the other party in order to
carry out the purposes and intent of this Agreement. 

Section 18.13. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts with the same effect as if all signatures of the parties hereto
were on the same document, but in such event each counterpart shall constitute
an original, and all of such counterparts shall constitute one Agreement; but
in making proof of this Agreement, it shall not be necessary to produce or
account for more than one such counterpart signed by each party.



 

_Page - 50 -_ Section 18.14. _Exhibits and Schedules_. All of the Exhibits and Schedules
referred to in this Agreement are hereby incorporated into this Agreement by
reference and constitute a part of this Agreement.

Section 18.15.  _Severability_. If any term or provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law, all other
conditions and provisions of the Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full
force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby are not affected in any materially adverse
manner to the other party.

Section 18.16. _Expenses, Post-Closing Consents and Recording_.
Notwithstanding other provisions of this Agreement, Buyer shall be responsible
for the filing and recording of the Assignment(s), conveyances or other
instruments required to convey title to the Assets to Buyer in the
appropriate federal, state and local records, and all required documentary,
filing and recording fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith. Buyer
shall supply Seller with a true and accurate photocopy of all the recorded
and filed Assignment(s) within a reasonable period of time after such are
available. Buyer shall be responsible for timely obtaining all consents and
approvals of Governmental Authorities customarily obtained subsequent to
transfer of title and all costs and fees associated therewith. Except as
otherwise specifically provided, all fees, costs and expenses incurred by
Buyer or Seller in negotiating this Agreement or in consummating the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring the same, including, without limitation, legal and accounting fees,
costs and expenses.

Section 18.17. _CONSPICUOUSNESS/EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE_. THE DEFENSE,
INDEMNIFICATION AND HOLD HARMLESS PROVISIONS PROVIDED FOR IN THIS AGREEMENT
SHALL BE APPLICABLE WHETHER OR NOT THE DAMAGES, LOSSES, INJURIES,
LIABILITIES, COSTS OR EXPENSES IN QUESTION AROSE SOLELY OR IN PART FROM THE
ACTIVE, PASSIVE OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, BREACH OF DUTY
(STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE), OR OTHER FAULT OF ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY, OR FROM
ANY PRE-EXISTING DEFECT, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT CAUSED BY THE INDEMNIFIED
PARTYS GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT. BUYER AND SELLER ACKNOWLEDGE
THAT THIS STATEMENT COMPLIES WITH THE EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE RULE AND IS
CONSPICUOUS.

 

Section 18.18. _Waiver of Certain Damages; Limitation on Seller s Indemnity_.
Each party irrevocably waives and agrees not to seek indirect, consequential,
punitive or exemplary damages of any kind in connection with any dispute
arising out of or related to this Agreement or the breach hereof. For the
avoidance of doubt, this _Section 18.18_ does not diminish or otherwise
affect the parties rights and obligations to be indemnified against, and
provide indemnity for, indirect, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages
awarded to any third party for which indemnification is provided in this
Agreement or Sellers right to receive liquidated damages.

Section 18.19. _Joint and Several Liability_. The liabilities and obligations
under this Agreement of the entities comprising Seller shall be joint and
several.
