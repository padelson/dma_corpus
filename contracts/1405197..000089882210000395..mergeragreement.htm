the Reincorporation Merger and shall continue its corporate existence under
the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia.

## Section 1.02. _Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the closing of the Mergers and the transactions contemplated hereby
(the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at 9:00 a.m., Eastern Time, on the later

the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (other than those conditions that by
their terms are to be satisfied by actions to be taken at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by applicable Law)
waiver of those conditions) and (ii) the earlier of (x) the date on which the
Financing or, in the event that alternative financing has been arranged, such
alternative financing, is available in accordance with the terms and
conditions thereof and (y) the Business Day prior to the Outside Date,
_provided_ that such date shall be no later than the Outside Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Closing may be consummated at such other

which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing
Date_ ". The Closing shall be held at the offices of Proskauer Rose LLP, at

## (the " _Reincorporation Plan of Merger_ ") to be executed. Subject to the
provisions of this Agreement, at the Closing but subject to the condition that
the Closing is to occur, the Company shall cause the Reincorporation Merger to
be consummated by causing the Reincorporation Plan of Merger to be
acknowledged and filed along with articles of merger with the Virginia State

of Delaware a certificate of merger, in such form as required by, and executed
and acknowledged by the parties in accordance with, the relevant provisions of
the DGCL, and shall make all other filings or recordings required under the
VSCA and the DGCL in connection with the Reincorporation Merger. The
Reincorporation Merger shall become effective in accordance with the

relating to the Reincorporation Merger filed with the Virginia State
Corporation Commission and in the certificate of merger filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (such time, the " _Reincorporation
Effective Time_ ").

## Section 1.04. _Effects of the Reincorporation Merger_. At and after
the Reincorporation Effective Time, the Reincorporation Merger shall have the
effects set forth herein and in the Reincorporation Plan of Merger and in the
applicable provisions of the DGCL and the VSCA. Without limiting the

liabilities and duties of the Reincorporation Merger Surviving Corporation.

## Section 1.05. _Effect on Capital Stock_.

Common Stock (including restricted shares of Company Common Stock (the
"Company Restricted Stock")) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Reincorporation Effective Time (other than shares held in the treasury of the
Company immediately prior to the Reincorporation Effective Time) shall be
converted into one share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Company Virginia Sub (the " _Company Virginia Sub Common Stock_ "), (ii) each
share of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company immediately
prior to the Reincorporation Effective Time shall be cancelled and (iii) each
share of Company Virginia Sub Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Reincorporation Effective Time shall be canceled.

### (b) All of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into
shares of Company Virginia Sub Common Stock pursuant to _Section 1.05(a)_
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall
cease to exist as of the Reincorporation Effective Time, and each certificate
(each, a " _Company Common Certificate_ ") or book-entry shares (" _Company
Common Book-Entry Shares_ ") previously representing any such shares shall
thereafter represent, without the requirement of any exchange thereof, that
number of shares of Company Virginia Sub Common Stock into which such shares
of Company Common Stock represented by such Company Common Certificate or

1.05(a)_ (such certificates following the Reincorporation

prior thereto shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Company
Common Stock and shall be converted automatically into an option (an "

Stock equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Reincorporation Effective Time
at an exercise price per share of Company Virginia Sub Common Stock equal to
the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock in effect immediately
prior to the Reincorporation Effective Time and otherwise subject to the terms
of the Companys 2009 Long Term Incentive Plan, 2006 Restricted Stock Plan or

_Company Stock Plans_ ") under which such Company Stock Options were issued
and the agreements evidencing grants thereunder (including accelerated vesting
provisions under such agreements evidencing grants thereunder or under any
employment agreements between employees of the Company and the Company). The
duration and other terms of each new option shall be the same as the original
Company Stock Option except that all references to the Company shall be deemed
to be references to Company Virginia Sub.

## Section 1.07. _Other Stock-Based Awards_. At the Reincorporation
Effective Time, each incentive award of any kind, contingent or accrued, to
receive Company Common Stock or an amount measured in whole or in part by
reference to the value of a number of shares of Company Common Stock granted
under the Company Stock Plans or otherwise (including under any Company
Benefit Plan) (including Company RSUs and performance shares) other than
Company Stock Options and Company Restricted Stock (each, other than Company
Stock Options and Company Restricted Stock, a " _Company Stock-Based Award_
"), shall cease to represent a right to acquire or receive shares of Company
Common Stock or an amount measured by reference to the value of a number of
shares of Company Common Stock and shall be converted automatically into a
right to receive a number of shares of Company Virginia Sub Common Stock or an
amount measured by reference to a number of shares of Company Virginia Sub
Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such Company Stock-Based Award immediately prior to the Reincorporation
Effective Time (a " _Stock-Based Award_ ") and subject to the terms of the

deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the Common Stock Merger Consideration and any
dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to _Section 3.02(d)_. No
interest shall be paid or will accrue on any payment to holders of Company
Virginia Sub Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_.

Stock held by such holder immediately prior to the Effective Time), (C) any
dividends or distributions payable pursuant to _Section 3.02(d)_ and (D) cash

canceled.

### (d) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_.

#### (i) No dividends or other distributions with respect to
Parent ADSs with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Company Virginia Sub Certificate with respect to
the Parent ADSs, that the holder thereof has the right to receive upon the
surrender thereof, and no cash in lieu of fractional Parent ADSs shall be paid

Following the surrender of any Company Virginia Sub Certificate, there shall
be paid to the record holder of the certificate representing whole shares of
Parent ADSs issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (A) at the time of
such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole
shares of Parent ADSs and the amount of any cash payable in lieu of fractional

record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such
Parent ADSs and the amount of any cash payable in lieu of fractional Parent
ADSs to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 3.02(f)_ and (B) at

#### amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the

### (e) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_.
The Common Stock Merger Consideration and any dividends or other distributions
payable pursuant to _Section 3.02(d)_ paid upon the surrender of Company
Virginia Sub Certificates (or automatically, in the case of Company Virginia
Sub Book-Entry Shares) in accordance with the terms of this _Article III_
shall be deemed, when paid in full, to have been paid in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Virginia Sub Common Stock
formerly represented by such Company Virginia Sub Certificates or such Company
Virginia Sub Book-Entry Shares, subject, however, to the Surviving
Corporations obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions
with a record date prior to the Effective Time which may have been declared or
made by the Company on the shares of Company Common Stock or Company Virginia
Sub Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement prior to the
Effective Time. At the close of business on the day on which the Effective
Time occurs, the share transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the share transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Virginia Sub

### (f) _No Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip
representing fractional Parent ADSs or book-entry credit of fractional Parent
ADSs shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Company Virginia Sub
Certificates or upon conversion of the Company Virginia Sub Book-Entry Shares,
no dividends or other distributions of Parent shall relate to such fractional
Parent ADSs and such fractional Parent ADSs shall not entitle the owner
thereof to any rights of a holder of Parent ADSs. Each holder of Company
Virginia Sub Common Stock who otherwise would have been entitled to fractional
Parent ADSs shall receive in lieu thereof cash equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (A) the fractional Parent ADSs to which such holder (after
taking into account all shares of Company Virginia Sub Common Stock formerly
represented by all Company Virginia Sub Certificates surrendered by such
holder and all of such holders Company Virginia Sub Book-Entry Shares) would
otherwise be entitled by (B) the Parent Closing Price.

### (g) _Termination of the Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Company
Virginia Sub Certificates for 12 months after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of the Company Virginia Sub
Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this _Article III_ shall,
subject to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law, thereafter look
only to Parent for, and Parent shall remain liable for, payment of their claim
for the Common Stock Merger Consideration and any dividends or other
distributions payable pursuant to _Section 3.02(d)_ in accordance with this
_Article III_.

### (h) _No Liability_. None of Parent, HoldCo, the Company,
the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person
in respect of any Parent ADRs

 

 



 

11

 

   

 



 

### or other cash distributions from the Exchange Fund properly delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. If any Company Virginia Sub Certificate shall not have been
surrendered prior to four years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior
to such earlier date on which any Common Stock Merger Consideration (and any
dividends or other distributions payable with respect to Parent ADSs pursuant
to _Section 3.02(d)_ would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
international, national, regional, state, local or other government, any
court, administrative, regulatory or other governmental agency, commission or
authority (each, a " _Governmental Entity_ ")), any such Common Stock Merger
Consideration (and any dividends or other distributions payable with respect
to Parent ADSs pursuant to _Section 3.02(d)_ ) shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

### (i) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent
shall invest the cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent.
Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
and be income of Parent. If for any reason (including losses) the cash in the
Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment
obligations to be made in cash by the Exchange Agent hereunder, Parent shall
promptly deposit cash into the Exchange Fund in an amount which is equal to
the deficiency in the amount of cash required to fully satisfy such cash
payment obligations. In no event shall any loss resulting from any such
investment affect Parents obligations under this Agreement, including the
payment of any amounts required to be paid pursuant to this _Article III_ and
_Section 6.05_.

### (j) _Lost Certificates_. If any Company Virginia Sub
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Company Virginia Sub
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the
posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent may
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect
to such Company Virginia Sub Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall deliver in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Virginia Sub Certificate
the Common Stock Merger Consideration and any dividends or other distributions
payable pursuant to _Section 3.02(d)_ pursuant to this _Article III_.

### (k) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law,
which in the case of any Company Options, Company RSUs and Company Stock-Based
Awards shall be in accordance with the provisions of _Section 6.05_ and in the
case of any Company Restricted Stock, shall be satisfied by withholding
proportionately from the Common Stock Share Consideration and Common Stock
Cash Consideration otherwise payable to the holder of such Company Restricted
Stock in respect of such Company Restricted Stock, assuming a fair market
value of a share of Company Virginia Sub Common Stock equal to the Per Share
Amount. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the
appropriate Taxing Authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Virginia Sub
Certificates in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent.

disclosure of any item in any section of the Parent Disclosure Letter shall

business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties or other
assets makes such qualification, licensing or good standing necessary, except

copies of the Articles of Association of Parent (the " _Parent Charter
Documents_ ") and the Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws of HoldCo

rights, "phantom" stock rights, performance units, rights to receive shares of

obligations of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire any such securities or to issue, deliver or sell, or cause
to be issued, delivered or sold, any such Parent Equity Securities. No bonds,
debentures, notes or other indebtedness of Parent having the right to vote (or
convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote) on
any matters on which the stockholders of Parent may vote are issued or
outstanding.

### (c) _Authority_.

#### (i) Each of Parent and HoldCo has all requisite corporate
power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and, in the case of
Parent, the Voting Agreements and, subject to receipt of the Parent
Stockholder Approval and to the adoption of the Plan of Merger by Parent as
the sole stockholder of HoldCo, to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Voting Agreements. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the Voting Agreements by Parent and the execution and delivery
of this Agreement by HoldCo and the consummation by Parent and HoldCo of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Voting Agreements, as
applicable, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the
part of Parent and HoldCo and no other corporate proceedings on the part of
Parent or HoldCo are necessary to authorize this Agreement or any of the
Voting Agreements or to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (other than the receipt of the Parent Stockholder Approval and the
adoption of the Plan of Merger by Parent in its capacity as sole stockholder
of HoldCo (which adoption Parent shall cause to occur as soon as reasonably

## Section 5.02. _No Solicitation_.

### (a) Subject to the provisions of this _Section 5.02_ , the
Company agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of its and
their respective Representatives shall, directly or indirectly through another
Person, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage or facilitate, any

continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations

with or otherwise cooperate with, any Takeover Proposal, (iii) waive,

"interested shareholder" under, Section 203 of the DGCL), or any restrictive
provision of any applicable anti-takeover provision in the Company
Certificate, including Article X thereof, restricting "business combinations"
with "interested stockholders" that would otherwise apply, or the Company

to any Person other than Parent or any of Parents Affiliates, under any such

Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in this _Section 5.02(a)_ by any Representative of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be a breach of this _Section 5.02(a)_
by the

 

 



 

60

 

   

 



 

### Company. The Company and its Subsidiaries and its and their respective
directors, officers and other Representatives shall immediately cease and
cause to be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any
Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Takeover Proposal. The
foregoing notwithstanding, at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, in response to a bona fide written Takeover Proposal
that the Board of Directors of the Company (acting on the recommendation of
the Special Committee) determines in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal advisors and a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation) constitutes or would reasonably be expected to constitute a
Superior Proposal, and which Takeover Proposal did not result from a breach of
this _Section 5.02(a),_ the Company may, subject to compliance with this
_Section 5.02_ , (x) furnish information with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the Person making such Takeover Proposal (and its
Representatives), _provided_ that all such information has previously been
provided to Parent or is provided to Parent prior to or substantially
concurrent with the time it is provided to such Person, and (y) participate in
discussions or negotiations with the Person making such Takeover Proposal (and
its Representatives) regarding such Takeover Proposal, if and only to the
extent that in connection with the foregoing clauses (x) and (y), the Company
has entered into a confidentiality agreement with such Person pursuant to a
customary confidentiality agreement not less restrictive to such Person than
the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement (and a copy of such
confidentiality agreement has been provided to Parent).

 

The term " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer (or any
communication or affirmation in support of any previously made proposal or
offer) from any third party relating to, or that would be expected to lead to,
(i) any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in one transaction or a
series of related transactions, of assets (including equity securities of any
Subsidiary of the Company) or businesses that constitute 20% or more of the
revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or 20% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or any
Significant Subsidiary, (ii) any tender offer or exchange offer that if
consummated would result in any Person beneficially owning 20% or more of any
class of equity securities of the Company, or (iii) any merger, consolidation,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint
venture, share exchange or similar transaction involving the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries.

 

The term " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide written offer made by a
third party that if consummated would result in such Person (or its
stockholders) owning, directly or indirectly, 100% of the shares of Company
Common Stock then outstanding (or of the shares of the surviving entity in a
merger or the direct or indirect parent of the surviving entity in a merger)
or all or substantially all the assets of the Company which the Board of
Directors of the Company (acting upon the recommendation of the Special
Committee) reasonably determines (after consultation with its outside legal
advisors and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and
taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such
proposal and the Person making the proposal) to be (i) more favorable to the
stockholders of the Company than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (after giving effect to any changes to this Agreement proposed by
Parent in response to such offer or otherwise) and (ii) reasonably capable of
being completed on the terms set forth in the proposal.

 

### (b) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any
committee thereof shall make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or (ii)
approve, adopt or recommend,

 

 



 

61

 

   

 



 

### or publicly propose to approve, adopt or recommend, or allow the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into, a merger agreement, letter of
intent, agreement in principle, share purchase agreement, asset purchase
agreement, share exchange agreement, option agreement or other similar
Contract (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in _Section
5.02(a)_ ) or any tender offer providing for, with respect to, or in
connection with, any Takeover Proposal. The foregoing notwithstanding, at any
time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval and subject to
compliance with _Section 5.02(c)_ and _Section 5.02(d)_ , the Board of
Directors of the Company may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
(and, in connection therewith in the case of a Superior Proposal, may take
actions referred to in _Section 5.02(a)(iv)_ ) in response to (A) a Superior
Proposal or (B) a material event other than (x) a Superior Proposal, (y) an
event that constitutes the receipt, existence or terms of a Takeover Proposal
or any matter relating thereto or consequence thereof or (z) an event or
circumstance relating to the likelihood of an Antitrust Approval Failure or a
Financing Failure (such material event, a " _Non-Superior Proposal Event_ "),
in the case of each of clause (A) and (B), if the Board of Directors of the
Company concludes in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
advisors, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

### (c) The Board of Directors of the Company shall not be
entitled to exercise its right to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
pursuant to _Section 5.02(b)_ unless (i) the Company has given Parent three
Business Days prior written notice of its intention to take such action,
which notice shall (A) if relating to a Superior Proposal, specify the
material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal and the identity
of the Person making such Superior Proposal and shall contemporaneously
provide Parent with the most current version of any proposed agreement or a
detailed summary of the material terms of any such proposal made by the Person
making such Superior Proposal, or (B) in respect to a Non-Superior Proposal
Event, describe such Non-Superior Proposal Event and the reasons for the
proposed Company Adverse Recommendation Change, (ii) if the Company Adverse
Recommendation Change is in response to a Superior Proposal, the Board of
Directors of the Company shall have considered in good faith any changes to
this Agreement committed to in writing by Parent and shall not have determined
(after consultation with its outside legal advisors and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) that the Superior Proposal would no longer
constitute a Superior Proposal if such changes proposed by Parent were to be
given effect (it being understood that the Company shall not take any action
described in _Section 5.02(b)_ during such three-Business-Day period, and that
any amendment to the financial terms or other material terms of such Superior
Proposal shall require a new written notification from the Company and an
additional three-Business-Day period that satisfies this _Section 5.02(c)_ ),
and (iii) if the Company Adverse Recommendation Change is in response to a
Non-Superior Proposal Event, during such three-Business-Day period, if
requested by Parent, the Company shall engage in good faith negotiations with
Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner that obviates the need for a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change as a result of the Non-Superior Proposal
Event.

### (d) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth
in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this _Section 5.02_ , the Company shall as
promptly as practicable (and in any event within 48 hours after receipt)
notify Parent orally and in writing of any Takeover Proposal and any material
subsequent modifications thereto, such notice to include the identity of the
Person making such Takeover Proposal and a copy of such Takeover Proposal,
including draft

 

 



 

62

 

   

 



 

### agreements or term sheets submitted to the Company in connection therewith
at the time such Takeover Proposal is first made or submitted thereafter
reflecting material changes to the terms and conditions (or, where no such
copy is available, a reasonably detailed description of the material terms and
conditions of such Takeover Proposal). The Company shall provide to Parent on
a reasonably prompt basis (and in any event within 48 hours) of any material
modifications to the terms of any such Takeover Proposal. The Company shall
not, and shall cause the Companys Subsidiaries not to, enter into any
Contract with any Person subsequent to the date of this Agreement, and neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is party to any Contract, in each
case, that prohibits the Company from providing such information to Parent.

### (e) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.02_ shall prohibit
the Company from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a)(2) or (3) under the Exchange Act or making a
statement required under Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act or issuing a "stop,
look and listen" statement; _provided_ , _however_ , in no event shall this
_Section 5.02(e)_ (i) affect the obligations of the Company specified in
_Section 5.02(b)_ , _Section 5.02(c)_ and _Section 5.02(d)_ , or (ii) permit
the Company to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change without complying
with _Section 5.02(c)_.

### (f) Parent agrees that neither it nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor any of its and their respective Representatives shall,
directly or indirectly through another Person, (i) solicit, initiate or
knowingly encourage or facilitate, any Parent Alternative Proposal or the
making or consummation thereof, (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
Person any non-public information in connection with, or otherwise cooperate
with, any Parent Alternative Proposal, (iii) approve, adopt or recommend, or
publicly propose to approve, adopt or recommend, or allow Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries to enter into, a merger agreement, letter of intent, agreement in
principle, share purchase or sale agreement, asset purchase or sale agreement,
share exchange agreement, option agreement or other similar Contract or any
tender offer providing for, with respect to, or in connection with, any Parent
Alternative Proposal or (iv) resolve, propose or agree to do any of the
foregoing. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of
the restrictions set forth in this _Section 5.02(f)_ by any Representative of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries shall be a breach of this _Section 5.02(f)_
by Parent. Parent and its Subsidiaries and its and their respective
directors, officers and other Representatives shall immediately cease and
cause to be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any
Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Parent Alternative Proposal.

 

The term " _Parent Alternative Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer (or any
communication or affirmation in support of any previously made proposal or
offer) from any third party relating to, or that would be expected to lead to,
(i) any direct or indirect sale, disposition, acquisition or purchase, in one
transaction or a series of related transactions, of assets (including equity
securities of any Subsidiary of Parent) or businesses that constitute 50% or
more of the revenues, net income or assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, or 40% or more of any class of equity securities of Parent
or any Subsidiary, (ii) any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated

exchange or similar transaction involving the Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries.

of Company Virginia Sub Common Stock equal to the Per Share Amount.

Company shall deliver written notice to each holder of a Company Stock Option,
Company RSUs, Company Restricted Stock or Company Stock-Based Award informing
such holder of the effect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement

Merger, Parent shall reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented
out of pocket costs (including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, and in accordance with, this
_Section 6.06_. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the officers and
directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries and, if the Effective Time does
not occur, the Company and its Subsidiaries, from and against any and all

incurred arose from disclosure regarding the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that is determined to have contained a material misstatement or
omission.

### (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
_Section 6.06_ , the refinancing and/or discharge of the Notes described in

### manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any
individuals who at the Effective Time were current or former directors,
officers or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that all rights to indemnification in respect of any Action
pending or asserted or any claim made within such period shall continue until
the disposition of such Action or resolution of such claim. From and after
the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with their respective terms, each of the
covenants contained in this _Section 6.07_.

### (b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless each

Parent, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time,

applicable Law and its certificate of incorporation or by-laws in effect on
the date hereof to indemnify such Person (and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Person to
whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if
it is determined by a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction that such Person is not legally entitled to
indemnification under applicable Law).

### (c) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of
its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all

assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.07_.

### (d) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect the Companys current
directors and officers liability insurance (or such other insurance that is
no less favorable to the Officer Indemnified Parties than the Companys
current directors and officers liability insurance) in respect of acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, covering each Person
currently covered by the Companys directors and officers liability
insurance policy (a complete and accurate copy of which has been heretofore
delivered to Parent), on terms with respect to such coverage and amounts no
less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof;
_provided_ , _however_ , (i) the Company may, at its election, substitute
therefor a single premium tail policy with respect to such directors and
officers liability insurance with policy limits, terms and conditions at
least as favorable to the directors and officers covered under such insurance
policy as the limits, terms and conditions in the existing policies of the
Company; or (ii) if the Company does not substitute as provided in clause (i)
above, then Parent may (A) substitute therefor

 

 



 

78

 

   

 



 

### policies of Parent, from an insurance carrier with the same or better
credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier, containing terms
with respect to coverage (including as coverage relates to deductibles and
exclusions) and amounts no less favorable to such directors and officers or
(B) request that the Company obtain such extended reporting period coverage
under its existing insurance programs (to be effective as of the Effective
Time); _provided_ , _further_ , that in connection with this _Section 6.07(d)_
, neither the Company nor Parent shall pay a one-time premium (in connection
with a single premium tail policy described above) in excess of the amount set
forth in Section 6.07(d)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter or be obligated
to pay annual premiums (in connection with any other directors and officers
insurance policy described above) in excess of the annual premiums set forth
in Section 6.07(d)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter. It is understood and
agreed that in the event such coverage cannot be obtained for such amount or
less, then the Company shall obtain the maximum amount of coverage as may be
obtained for such amount. 

### (e) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that
may be incurred by any Officer Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity
and other obligations provided in this _Section 6.07_ , unless it is
ultimately determined that such Officer Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnity.

### (f) The provisions of this _Section 6.07_ (i) are intended
to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable from and after the Effective
Time by, each Officer Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his or her
representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have
by Contract or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement, including this _Section
6.07_ , is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or
impair any rights to directors and officers insurance claims under any
policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or their respective officers, directors and employees, it
being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this
_Section 6.07_ is not prior to, or in substitution for, any such claims under
any such policies. The provisions of this _Section 6.07_ shall survive the
consummation of the Merger.

## Section 6.08. _Public Announcements_. Except with respect to any
Company Adverse Recommendation Change or Parent Adverse Recommendation Change
made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, Parent and the Company
shall consult with each other before issuing, and give each other the
opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other public
statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Merger, and shall not issue any such press release or make any
such public statement prior to such consultation, except as such party may
reasonably conclude may be required by applicable Law, court process or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange or national securities quotation system. The parties agree that the
initial press release to be issued with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the form heretofore agreed to by
the parties.

## Section 6.09. _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, each
of Parent and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause any
dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to Company Common Stock) or acquisitions of

Parent Non-Voting Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

## Section 6.10. _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Parent ADRs to be issued in the Merger
(i.e. required to be delivered as Common Stock Share Consideration pursuant to
_Section 3.01(c)_ and required to be delivered as aggregate stock
consideration pursuant to _Section 6.05_ ) to be approved for listing upon the
Effective Time on the NASDAQ Stock Market and to cause the Parent Non-Voting
Shares to be approved for listing, and remain listed, on the Spanish Stock
Exchanges/SIBE.

## Section 6.11. _Transaction Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent
the opportunity to participate, subject to a customary joint defense
agreement, in, but not control, the defense or settlement of any litigation
against the Company and/or its directors relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and no such settlement shall be agreed to
without Parents prior written consent.

## Section 6.12. _Employee Matters_.

### (a) For a period of 12 months following the Effective Time,
the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who remain in the active
employment of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (the "
_Continuing Employees_ ") shall receive annual base salary, other compensation
opportunities and employee benefits that, in the aggregate, are substantially
similar to the employee benefits provided by Parent and its Subsidiaries to
its similarly situated U.S.-based employees generally; _provided_ that neither
Parent nor the Surviving Corporation nor any of their Subsidiaries shall have
any obligation to issue, or adopt any plans or arrangements providing for the
issuance of, shares of capital stock, warrants, options, stock appreciation
rights or other rights in respect of any shares of capital stock of any entity
or any securities convertible or exchangeable into such shares pursuant to any
such plans or arrangements. For a period of 12 months following the Effective
Time, Parent and its Affiliates shall provide to any terminated Continuing
Employee (who is not party to an employment agreement) severance benefits in
amounts and on terms and conditions no less favorable than the severance
benefits that would have been provided by the Company and its Affiliates to
such employee immediately prior to the Effective Time.

### (b) Each Continuing Employee shall be given credit for
service with the Company or its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors
under any employee benefit plans or arrangements of Parent and its
Subsidiaries for all purposes of eligibility, vesting and accrual of benefits
solely to the extent past service was recognized for such Continuing Employees
under the comparable Company Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Closing,
and to the same extent past service is credited under such plans or
arrangements for similarly situated employees of Parent. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this _Section 6.12(b)_ shall be construed to require
crediting of service for purposes of the calculation of benefits or that would
result in (i) duplication of benefits, (ii) service credit for any purposes
under a defined benefit pension plan or any post-employment health or post-
employment welfare plan, or (iii) service credit

 

 



 

80

 

   

 



 

### under a newly established plan for which prior service is not taken into
account for employees of Parent and its subsidiaries generally.

### (c) With respect to any welfare plan maintained by Parent
in which Continuing Employees are eligible to participate after the Effective
Time, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to, (i) waive all limitations
as to preexisting conditions and exclusions and waiting periods with respect
to participation and coverage requirements applicable to such employees to the
extent such conditions and exclusions and waiting periods were satisfied or
did not apply to such employees under the welfare plans maintained by the
Company prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) provide each Continuing Employee
with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective
Time in satisfying any analogous deductible or out-of-pocket requirements to
the extent applicable under any such plan, to the extent credited under the
welfare plans maintained by the Company prior to the Effective Time.

### (d) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 6.12_ to the
contrary, nothing contained herein, whether express or implied, shall be
treated as an amendment or other modification of any employee benefit plan
maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, or on or after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or
any of its Subsidiaries, or shall limit the right of Parent to amend,
terminate or otherwise modify any Company Benefit Plan or any employee benefit
plan maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries following the Effective
Time. Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring, and the
Company shall take no action that would have the effect of requiring, Parent
or the Surviving Corporation to continue any specific employee benefit plans
or to continue the employment of any specific Person.

## Section 6.13. _Takeover Laws_. The Company and its Board of Directors
shall (1) use reasonable best efforts to ensure that no state takeover Law
(including Section 203 of the DGCL and Articles 14 and 14.1 of the VSCA) or
similar Law or provision of the Company Certificate, including Article X
thereof, restricting "business combinations" with "Interested Stockholders" is
or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Company Voting Agreement, the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Company Voting Agreement and (2) if any state takeover Law, similar Law or
provision of the Company Certificate, including Article X thereof, restricting

transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Company Voting Agreement,
use reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Company Voting Agreement
may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by
this Agreement and the Company Voting Agreement and otherwise to minimize the
effect of such Law or provision of the Company Certificate, including Article
X thereof, restricting "business combinations" with "Interested Stockholders"

transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Company Voting Agreement.

## Section 6.14. _Financing_.

### (a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate

 

 



 

81

 

   

 



 

### and obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the
Commitment Letter, including using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in
effect the Commitment Letter for the commitment period set forth therein, (ii)
negotiate definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and
conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter (the " _Definitive Agreements_

Financing that are within its control and comply with its obligations and
enforce its rights under the Commitment Letter and (iv) seek to obtain such
third-party consents as may be reasonably required in connection with the

supplement or otherwise modify, or waive any of its rights under, the
Commitment Letter and/or substitute other debt or equity financing for all or
any portion of the Financing from the same and/or alternative financing
sources (including to reduce the amount of the Financing), provided that any
such amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification to or waiver of
any provision of the Commitment Letter (A) shall not expand upon the
conditions precedent to the Financing as set forth in the original Commitment
Letter (whether by adding additional conditions precedent or modifying
conditions precedent contained in the original Commitment Letter), (B) shall
provide for a financing amount not less than the amount necessary to satisfy
the Required Amounts in full after taking into account the Specified Financial
Resources, and (C) shall not prevent or materially delay the consummation of
the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (any
financing and related commitment satisfying the foregoing conditions (A)-(C),

unavailable or Parent becomes aware of any event or circumstance that makes
any portion of the Financing unavailable, in each case, on the terms and
conditions contemplated in the Commitment Letter and such portion is
reasonably required to satisfy the Required Amounts in full, Parent shall (1)
notify the Company and (2) seek to arrange and obtain Qualifying Financing as
promptly as reasonably practicable following the occurrence of such event.
Parent shall give the Company prompt notice of any material breach by any
party to the Commitment Letter (or commitment for any alternative financing
obtained in accordance with this _Section 6.14_ ) or of any condition not
likely to be satisfied, in each case, of which Parent becomes aware or any
termination of the Commitment Letter (or commitment for any alternative
financing obtained in accordance with this _Section 6.14_ ). Parent shall
provide to the Company copies of all documents related to the Financing (other
than any ancillary documents subject to confidentiality agreements, including
fee letters and engagement letters). Parent shall refrain and shall cause its
Affiliates to refrain from taking, directly or indirectly, any action that
would reasonably be expected to result in a failure of any of the conditions
contained in the Commitment Letter or in any Definitive Agreement. Parent
shall keep the Company informed on a prompt basis and in reasonable detail of
the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing (or any replacement
Financing). Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to enforce its
rights under the Commitment Letter and to cause the lenders and the other
Persons providing such Financing (or any alternative financing) to fund the
Financing (or alternative financing) required to consummate the Merger on the
Closing Date in accordance with the terms of such Financing (or alternative
financing), including by commencing a litigation proceeding against any
breaching financial institution or institutions in which Parent will use its
reasonable best efforts to compel such breaching institution or institutions
to provide its portion of such Financing as required. Parent shall use
reasonable best efforts to maintain available to itself sufficient Specified
Financial Resources such that the representation contained in the third-to-
last sentence of _Section 4.02(k)_ remains true and correct as of each date
from and after the date hereof until the earlier to

Subsidiaries to provide, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
each of its and their respective Representatives, including legal, tax,
regulatory and accounting, to provide, at Parents sole expense, such
cooperation in connection with the Financing as Parent shall reasonably
request ( _provided_ that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably
interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries),
including using reasonable best efforts to (i) provide, as promptly as
reasonably practicable, information relating to the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the Financing Sources (including information to be used in the
preparation of a customary information package regarding the business,
operations, financial condition, projections and prospects of the Company and
its Subsidiaries customary for financings similar to the Financing) to the
extent reasonably requested by Parent and/or the Financing Sources to assist
in preparation of customary offering or information documents to be used for
the completion of the Financing as contemplated by the Commitment Letter, (ii)
cause its senior management and other appropriate employees of the Company to

of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter
genders of such term. Any Contract, instrument or Law defined or referred to
herein or in any Contract or instrument that is referred to herein means such
Contract, instrument or Law as from time to time amended, modified or

## have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this Agreement. In
the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or interpretation arises,
this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no
presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party
by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement. The fact that
any item of information is disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter or the
Parent Disclosure Letter shall not be construed to mean that such information
is required to be disclosed by this Agreement. Unless the context clearly
otherwise requires, in respect of Parent and HoldCo, the "transactions
contemplated by this Agreement" include, without limitation, the Capital
Increase, the Parent By-Law Amendments and the Financing.

## Section 9.05. _Consents and Approvals_. For any matter under this
Agreement requiring the consent or approval of any party to be valid and
binding on the parties hereto, such consent or approval must be in writing.

## Section 9.06. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one
or more counterparts (including by facsimile), all of which shall be
considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when one or
more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the
other parties (including by facsimile or other electronic image scan
transmission).

## Section 9.07. _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_.

### (a) This Agreement (including the Exhibits and Schedules
and the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter), the
Confidentiality Agreement, the Voting Agreements and any agreements entered
into contemporaneously herewith (i) constitute the entire agreement, and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and
(ii) except for _Section 3.01(c)_ , _Section 3.02(c)_ and _Section 6.05_
(which, from and after the Reincorporation Effective Time, shall be for the
benefit of holders of the shares of Company Common Stock or Company Virginia
Sub Common Stock, or Options in respect thereof, immediately prior to the
Effective Time), _Section 6.07_ (which from and after the Reincorporation
Effective Time shall be for the benefit of the Officer Indemnified Parties)
and _Section 6.02(b)(iv)_ and _Section 6.02(b)(v)_ (which from and after the
Effective Time shall be for the benefit of the holders of the Parent ADRs or
Parent Non-Voting Shares, as applicable), are not intended to and do not
confer upon any Person other than the parties any legal or equitable rights or
remedies. In furtherance of the foregoing, with respect to the provisions of
_Section 6.12_ , nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be
construed to confer upon or give to any Person (including for the avoidance of
doubt any current or former employees, directors, or independent contractors
of any of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, or on or after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or
any of its Subsidiaries), other than the parties hereto and their respective
permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or
remedies (with respect to the matters provided for in _Section 6.12_ ) under
or by reason of any provision of this Agreement, including any rights to
continued employment with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. The
representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the parties to this Agreement and are for the benefit of
the parties to this Agreement. Any inaccuracies in such representations and
warranties are subject to waiver by the parties to this Agreement in
accordance with _Section 8.05_ without notice or liability to any other

 

 



 

104

 

   

 



 

### Person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this
Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties to this Agreement of
the risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of
any of the parties to this Agreement. Consequently, Persons other than the
parties to this Agreement may not rely upon the representations and warranties
in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of
the date hereof or any other date.

### (b) Notwithstanding _Section 9.07(a)(ii)_ , (i) the
provisions of _Section_ _9.10(g)(i)(A)_ (but subject to _Section 9.10(g)(ii)_
) shall be enforceable by each Representative of a party and its successors
and assigns and (ii) the provisions of _Section 9.10(d)_ , _Section 9.10(e)_ ,
and _Section 9.10(h)_ shall be enforceable by each Financing Source and its
successors and assigns.

## Section 9.08. _GOVERNING LAW_. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE
MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED, INTERPRETED
AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT
REGARD TO THE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS THEREOF EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT
THAT IT IS MANDATORY, UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF VIRGINIA THAT THE VSCA
APPLIES.

## Section 9.09. _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in
part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties without the prior
written consent of the other parties, and any assignment without such consent
shall be null and void, except that HoldCo, upon prior written notice to the
Company, may assign, in its sole discretion, any or all its rights, interests
and obligations under this Agreement to a Delaware corporation which is a
direct wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (provided that such wholly owned
Subsidiary signs a joinder agreement and is bound hereunder), but no such
assignment shall relieve Parent or HoldCo of any of its obligations hereunder.
Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure
to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective
successors and assigns.

## Section 9.10. _Jurisdiction; Consent to Jurisdiction; Specific
Enforcement; Remedies_.

### (a) _Exclusive jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereby
agrees that any claim, dispute or controversy (of any and every kind or type,
whether based on contract, tort, statute, regulation or otherwise, and whether
based on state, federal, foreign or any other law), arising out of, relating
to or in connection with this Agreement, the documents referred to in this
Agreement, or any of the transactions contemplated thereby, and including
disputes relating to the existence, validity, breach or termination of this
Agreement (any such claim being a " _Covered Claim_ "), shall be heard and
determined exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and
the appropriate appellate courts therefrom (the " _Chancery Court_ "), and in
no other court; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event the Chancery Court
lacks subject matter jurisdiction over a Covered Claim, such claim shall be
heard and determined exclusively in another state or federal court sitting in
the state of Delaware and the appropriate appellate courts therefrom (an "
_Other Delaware Court_ "). Each of the parties expressly agrees and
acknowledges that the Delaware Chancery Court (or, if the Delaware Chancery
Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, an Other Delaware Court) is an
appropriate and convenient forum for resolution of

 

 



 

105

 

   

 



 

### any and all Covered Claims, that it will not suffer any undue hardship or
inconvenience if required to litigate in such court, and that such court is
fully competent and legally capable of adjudicating any Covered Claim. Each
party further represents that it has agreed to the jurisdiction of the
Chancery Court (or an Other Delaware Court), in respect of Covered Claims
after being fully and adequately advised by legal counsel of its own choice
concerning the procedures and laws applied in such courts and has not relied
on any representation by any other party or its affiliates, representatives or
advisors as to the content, scope or effect of such procedures and law, and
will not contend otherwise in any proceeding in any court of any
jurisdiction.

### (b) _Personal jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereby
irrevocably submits, for itself and in respect to its Affiliates and
properties, generally and unconditionally, to the exclusive personal
jurisdiction of the Chancery Court and Other Delaware Courts in respect of
Covered Claims. The parties hereby consent to and grant any such court
jurisdiction over the person of such parties and, to the extent permitted by
Law, over the subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of process
or other papers in connection with any such action or proceeding in the manner
provided in _Section 9.02_ or in such other manner as may be permitted by Law
shall be valid and sufficient service thereof. In addition, Parent consents
to service of process upon Parent by mailing or delivering such service to its
agent, Corporation Service Company (the " _Service Agent_ "), authorizes and
directs the Service Agent to accept such service, and shall take all such
action as may be necessary to continue such appointment in full force and
effect or to appoint another agent so that it will at all times have an agent
for service of process for the foregoing purposes in the State of Delaware.

### (c) _Covenants_. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably
waives, and agrees not to attempt to assert or assert, by way of motion or
other request for leave from the Chancery Court (or, if the Delaware Chancery
Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, an Other Delaware Court), as a
defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action involving a Covered Claim,
(a) the defense of sovereign immunity, the defense that any Covered Claim or
remedy with respect thereto is within the exclusive jurisdiction of a court
outside the state of Delaware, (b) any claim that it is not personally subject
to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any reason other than the
failure to serve process in accordance with this _Section 9.10_ , (c) that it
or its Affiliates or property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any
such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through
service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise), and (d) to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law that (i) the suit, action or
proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the
suit, action or proceeding is not maintainable in such court, (iii) the venue
of such suit, action or proceeding is improper or inappropriate and (iv) this
Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such
courts. Each of the parties further hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not
to attempt to assert, by way of motion or other request in any other court of
other forum, that a judgment entered by the Chancery Court or any Other
Delaware Court, including a judgment for specific performance, is not
enforceable in such other court or forum, whether in the United States, the
Kingdom of Spain or otherwise. The parties agree that a final judgment in
respect of any Covered Claim of the Delaware Chancery Court (or, if the
Delaware Chancery Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, an Other Delaware
Court) shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit
on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law.

###

 

 



 

106

 

   

 



 

### (d) _Exception to Exclusive Jurisdiction_. Notwithstanding
_Section 9.10(a)_ , each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not bring
or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party
claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in
contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing Sources in any way
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the
Commitment Letter or the performance thereof, in any forum other than the
Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under
applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (and
appellate courts thereof).

### (e) _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND
AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO
INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE VOTING AGREEMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT AND THE VOTING AGREEMENTS, INCLUDING ANY
DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE COMMITMENT LETTER OR THE PERFORMANCE
THEREOF BY PARENT OR ITS FINANCING SOURCES. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF ANY LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH
PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii)
EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED
TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 9.10(e)_.

### (f) _Specific performance_. The parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at
law. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement exclusively in the Chancery Court (or, if and only if the Delaware
Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter,
any state or federal court within the State of Delaware), in addition to any
and all other rights and remedies at law or in equity, and all such rights and
remedies shall be cumulative. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably waives,
and agrees not to attempt to assert or assert, by way of motion or other
request for leave from the Chancery Court or any Other Delaware Court, as a
defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action involving a Covered Claim,
any claim or argument that there is an adequate remedy at law or that an award
of specific performance is not otherwise an available or appropriate remedy.
Any requirements for the securing or posting of any bond with such remedy are
waived. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the parties agree
that (i) the Company shall be entitled to specific performance against Parent
and HoldCo (A) of Parents and HoldCos obligations to consummate the Mergers
and to conduct the

 

 



 

107

 

   

 



 

### Closing upon the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section
7.01_ and the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Section
7.02_ if the Financing or any alternative financing (including any bridge or
interim financing that is part of the Financing or such alternative financing)
is available, in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof, (B) of
Parents obligations to use its reasonable best efforts to enforce its rights
under the Commitment Letter and to cause the lenders and the other Persons
providing such Financing (or alternative financing) to fund the Financing (or
alternative financing) required to consummate the Merger on the Closing Date
in accordance with the terms of such Financing (or alternative financing),
including by commencing a litigation proceeding against any breaching
financial institution or institutions in which Parent will use its reasonable
best efforts to compel such breaching institution or institutions to provide
its portion of such Financing as required, as provided in _Section 6.14(a)_ ,
and its obligations set forth in clause (ii) of the first sentence of _Section
6.14(a)_ , (C) of Parents obligations (1) to pay the Parent Termination Fee,
if any, pursuant to _Section 8.03(c)_ , (2) to pay the Reverse Break-Up Fee,
if any, pursuant to _Section 8.03(e)_ , _Section 8.03(f)_ or _Section 8.03(g)_
, and (3) in respect of the expenses pursuant to _Section 6.06_ and _Section
6.14_ , and (D) subject to the last sentence of this _Section 9.10(f)_ , to
enforce and to prevent any breach by Parent or HoldCo of its covenants under
this Agreement and (ii) Parent shall be entitled to specific performance
against the Company (A) of the Companys obligation to consummate the Mergers
and to conduct the Closing upon the satisfaction the conditions set forth in
_Section 7.01_ and the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
_Section 7.03_ , (B) of the Companys obligations to pay the Company
Termination Fee, if any, pursuant to _Section 8.03(b)_ and _Section 8.03(d),_
and (C) to enforce and to prevent any breach by the Company of its covenants
under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
_Section 9.10(f)_ or anything else to the contrary contained in this Agreement
(including the imposition of a best effort standard with respect to the
Antitrust Covenants contained in _Section 6.04_ ), (x) except for, and subject
to, _Section 9.10(f)(i)(A)_ and _Section 9.10(f)(i)(B)_ , in no event shall
the Company be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent Parent or
HoldCo from breaching, or to specifically enforce the respective obligations
of Parent or HoldCo under, any Antitrust Covenant or Financing Covenant and
(y) if the Financing or any alternative financing (including any bridge or
interim financing that is part of the Financing or such alternative
financing), is not available on the date that would otherwise have been the
Closing Date, the Company shall not be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent Parent or HoldCo from failing to, or to specifically
enforce the respective obligations of Parent or HoldCo to, conduct the Closing
or cause the Mergers to be consummated pursuant to _Article I_ and _Article
II_. 

### (g) _Termination Fees_.

#### (i) The parties agree that subject to clause (ii) below: 

##### (A) with respect to Parent and HoldCo, in the event (A)
this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Section 8.01_ and (B) the
Parent Termination Fee or the Reverse Break-Up Fee is payable pursuant to
_Section 8.03(c)_ , _Section 8.03(e)_ , _Section 8.03(f)_ or _Section 8.03(g)_
(whichever is ultimately paid pursuant to _Section 8.03(h)_ ), Parents
payment of such Parent Termination Fee or Reverse Break-Up Fee (whichever is
ultimately paid pursuant to _Section 8.03(h)_ ) shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Company, its

 

 



 

108

 

   

 



 

##### Subsidiaries, shareholders, Affiliates, officers, directors, employees
and Representatives against Parent, HoldCo or any of their respective current
or former Representatives for, and in no event will the Company or any other
such Person seek to recover any other money damages or seek any other remedy
based on a claim in law or equity with respect to, (1) any loss suffered,
directly or indirectly, as a result of the failure of the Merger to be
consummated, (2) the termination of this Agreement, (3) any liabilities or
obligations arising under this Agreement, or (4) any claims or actions arising
out of or relating to any breach, termination or failure of or under this
Agreement, and upon payment of the Parent Termination Fee or the Reverse
Break-Up Fee pursuant to _Section 8.03(e)_ , _Section 8.03(e)_ , _Section
8.03(f)_ , or _Section 8.03(g)_ (whichever is ultimately paid pursuant to
_Section 8.03(h)_ ), none of Parent, HoldCo nor any of their respective
current, former or future Representative shall have any further liability or
obligation to the other party relating to or arising out of this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby; and

##### (B) with respect to the Company, in the event (i) this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Section 8.01_ and (ii) the Company
Termination Fee is payable pursuant to _Section 8.03(b)_ or _Section 8.03(d_
), the Companys payment of the Company Termination Fee pursuant to _Section
8.03(b)_ or _Section 8.03(d)_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
Parent, HoldCo, their respective Subsidiaries, shareholders, Affiliates,
officers, directors, employees and Representatives against the Company or any
of its current or former Representatives for, and in no event will Parent,
HoldCo or any other such Person seek to recover any other money damages or
seek any other remedy based on a claim in law or equity with respect to, (1)
any loss suffered, directly or indirectly, as a result of the failure of the
Merger to be consummated, (2) the termination of this Agreement, (3) any
liabilities or obligations arising under this Agreement, or (4) any claims or
actions arising out of or relating to any breach, termination or failure of or
under this Agreement, and upon payment of any Company Termination Fee in
accordance with _Section 8.03(b)_ or _Section 8.03(d)_ , neither the Company
nor any current, former or future Representative of such party shall have any
further liability or obligation to Parent or HoldCo relating to or arising out
of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby; and

##### (C) any other provision of this Agreement
notwithstanding, the right of any party to terminate this Agreement or to
receive a Termination Fee shall not limit or eliminate the right of such party
to obtain to an injunction or specific enforcement as and to the extent
provided in this _Section 9.10_ ; _provided, however_ , that in no event shall
any party be entitled to seek specific performance hereunder from and after
termination of this Agreement and receipt of a Termination Fee. 

 

 



 

109

 

   

 



 

 

 (D) For purposes of clarification, there may be circumstances under which a Termination Fee may become payable by each of Parent and the Company to the other pursuant to _Section 8.03_ , and the right of either party to receive such Termination Fee shall not affect in and of itself the obligation of such party to pay a Termination Fee to the other.

 

#### (ii) Any other provision of this Agreement (including
_Section 9.07_ , _Section 9.10(g)_ or _Section 9.10(h)_ ) notwithstanding,
nothing in this Agreement shall relieve any Parent Stockholder Party from
liability for breach of the Parent Voting Agreement, and nothing in this
Agreement shall relieve the Company Stockholder Party for breach of the
Company Voting Agreement.

### (h) _Maximum Damages for Certain Breaches_. Subject to the
Companys right to seek or obtain an injunction or specific performance with
respect to the Financing Covenants referenced in _Section 9.10(f)(i)(A)_ or
_Section 9.10(f)(i)(B),_ the Company agrees that, notwithstanding the
imposition of a best effort standard with respect to the Antitrust Covenants
contained in _Section 6.04_ or anything else to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, to the extent it has incurred losses or damages in connection with
(or following) (i) a breach by Parent or HoldCo of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements in this Agreement that constitutes or
results in, or would constitute or result in, a breach of (or that includes a
breach that constitutes or results in, or would constitute or result in, a
breach of) any Financing Covenant or any Antitrust Covenant (or otherwise
causes or results in (or would cause or result in) a Financing Failure or an
Antitrust Approval Failure), or (ii) a Financing Failure or an Antitrust
Approval Failure, (A) the maximum aggregate liability of Parent and HoldCo for
monetary damages under this Agreement, or otherwise, in respect of such
incurred losses or damages (including the payment of the Reverse Break-Up Fee
or the Parent Termination Fee, if applicable) shall be limited to
$375,000,000, and (B) in no event shall the Company seek to recover any
monetary damages (or obtain specific performance of payment) in excess of such
$375,000,000 amount from Parent or HoldCo or any of their respective former,
current or future Representatives (including the Financing Sources) in
connection therewith. For purposes of clarification, the payment by Parent of
the Reverse Break-Up Fee or the Parent Termination Fee by Parent pursuant to
_Section 8.03_ shall be included in the determination of such $375,000,000
maximum aggregate liability.

## Section 9.11. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination
that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable
manner to the end that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

## Section 9.12. _Transfer Taxes_. Anything to the contrary in this
Agreement notwithstanding, all transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes

 

 



 

110

 

   

 



 

## and fees (including penalties and interest) incurred in connection with the
Mergers shall be paid by Parent when due.

## Section 9.13. _Obligations of Parent and of the Company_. Whenever
this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such
requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to
cause such Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a
Subsidiary of the Company to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed
to include an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary
to take such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of the
Surviving Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to take such action.

 5.6. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and, to the extent referenced herein, the Merger Agreement, together with the several agreements and other documents and instruments referred to herein or therein or annexed hereto or thereto, embody the complete agreement and understanding among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede and preempt any prior understandings, agreements or representations by or among the parties, written and oral, that may have related to the subject matter hereof in any way.

 

 5.7. _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 

 (a) _GOVERNING LAW_. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED, INTERPRETED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT REGARD TO THE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS THEREOF EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS MANDATORY, UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF VIRGINIA THAT THE VIRGINIA STOCK CORPORATION ACT, AS AMENDED, APPLIES.

 

 (b) _Exclusive Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereby agrees that any claim, dispute or controversy (of any and every kind or type, whether based on contract, tort, statute, regulation or otherwise, and whether based on state, federal, foreign or any other law), arising out of, relating to or in connection with this Agreement, the documents referred to in this Agreement, or any of the transactions contemplated thereby, and including disputes relating to the existence, validity, breach or termination of this Agreement (any such claim being a " _Covered Claim_ "), shall be heard and determined exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the appropriate appellate courts therefrom (the " _Chancery Court_ "), and in no other; provided, however, that in the event the Chancery Court determines that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction over a Covered Claim, such claim shall be heard and determined exclusively in another state or federal court sitting in the state of Delaware and the appropriate appellate courts therefrom (an " _Other Delaware Court_ "). Each of the parties expressly agrees and acknowledges that the Delaware Chancery Court (or, if the Delaware Chancery Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, an Other Delaware Court) is an appropriate and convenient forum for resolution of any and all Covered Claims, that it will not suffer any undue hardship or inconvenience if required to litigate in such court, and that such court is fully competent and legally capable of adjudicating any Covered Claim. Each party further represents that it has agreed to the jurisdiction of the Chancery Court (or, if the Delaware Chancery Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, an Other Delaware Court), in respect of Covered Claims after being fully and adequately advised by legal counsel of its own choice concerning the procedures and laws applied in such courts and has not relied on any representation by any other party or its affiliates, representatives or advisors as to the content, scope or effect of such procedures and law, and will not contend otherwise in any proceeding in any court of any jurisdiction.

 

 (c) _Personal Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably submits, for itself and in respect to its Affiliates and properties, generally and unconditionally, to the

   

exclusive personal jurisdiction of the Chancery Court and Other Delaware
Courts in respect of Covered Claims. The parties hereby consent to and grant
any such court jurisdiction over the person of such parties and, to the extent
permitted by law, over the subject matter of such dispute and agree that
mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such action or
proceeding in the manner provided in Section 5.3 or in such other manner as
may be permitted by law shall be valid and sufficient service thereof. In
addition, Parent consents to service of process upon Parent by mailing or
delivering such service to its agent, Corporation Service Company (the "
_Service Agent_ "), authorizes and directs the Service Agent to accept such
service, and shall take all such action as may be necessary to continue such
appointment in full force and effect or to appoint another agent so that it
will at all times have an agent for service of process for the foregoing
purposes in the State of Delaware.

 

 (d) _Covenants_. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to attempt to assert or assert, by way of motion or other request for leave from the Chancery Court (or, if the Delaware Chancery Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, an Other Delaware Court), as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action involving a Covered Claim, (a) the defense of sovereign immunity, the defense that any Covered Claim or remedy with respect thereto is within the exclusive jurisdiction of a court outside the state of Delaware, (b) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any reason other than the failure to serve process in accordance with this Section 5.7, (c) that it or its Affiliates or property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise), and (d) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the suit, action or proceeding is not maintainable in such court, (iii) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper or inappropriate and (iv) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts. Each of the parties further hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to attempt to assert, by way of motion or other request in any other court of other forum, that a judgment entered by the Chancery Court or any Other Delaware Court, including a judgment for specific performance, is not enforceable in such other court or forum, whether in the United States, the Kingdom of Spain or otherwise. The parties agree that a final judgment in respect of any Covered Claim of the Delaware Chancery Court (or, if the Delaware Chancery Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, an Other Delaware Court) shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable law.

 

 (e) _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY

   

LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS
AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES
THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS SECTION 5.7(e).

 

 5.8. _Amendment; Waiver_. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by Parent, the Stockholder. Each party may waive any right of such party hereunder by an instrument in writing signed by such party and delivered to the other party.

 

 5.9. _Remedies_.

 

 (a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement exclusively in the Chancery Court (or, if and only if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware), in addition to any and all other rights and remedies at law or in equity, and all such rights and remedies shall be cumulative. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to attempt to assert or assert, by way of motion or other request for leave from the Chancery Court or any Other Delaware Court, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action involving a Covered Claim, any claim or argument that there is an adequate remedy at law or that an award of specific performance is not otherwise an available or appropriate remedy. Any requirements for the securing or posting of any bond with such remedy are waived. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the parties agree that Parent shall be entitled to specific performance against the Stockholder of its obligations to abide by the covenants and obligations with respect to the Covered Shares set forth herein.

 

 5.10. _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction, and if any provision of this Agreement is determined to be so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable, in all cases so long as neither the economic nor legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is affected in any manner adverse to any party. Upon any such determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith in an effort to agree upon a suitable and equitable substitute provision to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible and to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby shall be fulfilled to the maximum extent possible.

 

 5.11. _Successors and Assigns; Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except in connection with a Permitted Transfer or a Transfer of Covered Shares permitted by the proviso contained in _Section 4.1(a)_ , neither this Agreement nor any of the rights or obligations of any party under this

   

Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or in part (by operation of law or
otherwise), by any party without the prior written consent of the other
parties hereto. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall bind and inure
to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to confer on any Person other than the parties
hereto or their respective successors and permitted assigns any rights,
remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement.

 

 5.12. _Action by Stockholder Capacity Only_. Parent acknowledges that the Stockholder has entered into this Agreement solely in its capacity as the record and/or beneficial owner of the Covered Shares (and not in any other capacity, including without limitation, any capacity as a director or officer of the Company). Nothing herein shall limit or affect any actions taken by the Stockholder or its Affiliate or designee, or require the Stockholder or its Affiliate or designee to take any action, in each case, in his capacity as a director or officer of the Company, including, without limitation, to disclose information acquired solely in its or his capacity as a director or officer of the Company, and any actions taken (whatsoever), or failure to take any actions (whatsoever), by it or him in such capacity as a director or officer of the Company shall not be deemed to constitute a breach of this Agreement.

 

 5.13. _Maximum Covered Share Amount_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) the obligations of the Stockholder pursuant to this Agreement shall apply only to a maximum number of Covered Shares that is one share less than the lesser of (a) the number of Covered Shares the direct or indirect ownership (beneficially or of record) of which by Parent would result in a "Change of Control" (as defined in the Indenture, dated as of October 21, 2009, as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time, by and among the Company, its subsidiaries named therein as subsidiary guarantors and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee (the " _Indenture_ ")) and (b) the number of Covered Shares the direct or indirect ownership of which by Parent would result in a "Change in Control" (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement, dated as of December 6, 2006, among the Company, Wachovia Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent, and the other parties thereto (the " _Credit Agreement_ ")) (such number of Covered Shares that is one share less than the lesser of the number of Covered Shares referenced in clause (a) and (b), the " _Maximum Covered Share Amount_ "), (ii) to the extent that, notwithstanding the application of clause (i) of this Section, the terms of this Agreement would result in a "Change of Control" under the Indenture or a "Change in Control" under the Credit Agreement", then (a) a suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to effect, to the fullest extent permissible under the Indenture without resulting in a "Change of Control" under the Indenture or a "Change in Control" under the Credit Agreement", as applicable, the original intent of the parties as closely as possible and to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby shall be fulfilled to the maximum extent possible and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.

   |  

2. _Dividendo preferente_

  
    

2.1. _Calculation_. Each Class B Share entitles its holder to receive a
minimum annual preferred dividend out of the distributable profits for each
year at the end of which it is still in issue (the "Preferred Dividend" and,
each fiscal year in respect of which the Preferred Dividend is calculated, a
"Calculation Period") equal to 0.01 euros per Class B Share.

   |  

2.1. _C alculo_. Cada Accion Clase B da derecho a su titular a recibir un
dividendo preferente minimo anual con cargo a los beneficios distribuibles de
cada ejercicio a cuya finalizacion la Accion Clase B permanezca emitida (el
"Dividendo Preferente" y cada ejercicio respecto del que el Dividendo
Preferente se calcula, un "Periodo de Calculo") igual a 0,01 euros por Accion
Clase B.

  
    

2.2. _Preference_. The Company shall pay the Preferred Dividend on the Class
B Shares for a Calculation Period before any dividend out of distributable
profits obtained by the Company during such Calculation Period is paid on the
Class A Shares.

   |  

2.2. _Preferencia_. La Sociedad esta obligada a acordar el reparto del
Dividendo Preferente correspondiente a un Periodo de Calculo y a pagarlo a los
titulares de las Acciones Clase B antes de pagar dividendo alguno a los

obtenidos por la Sociedad en dicho Periodo de Calculo.

  
    

2.3. _Accrual_. _Payment_. _Non-cumulative nature_.

 

(A) The Preferred Dividend on all the Class B Shares in issue at the end
of a Calculation Period shall be paid by the Company to the holders of the
Class B Shares within the nine months following the end of such Calculation
Period, in the amount such aggregate Preferred Dividend does not exceed the
distributable profits obtained by the Company during such Calculation Period.

   |  

2.3. _Devengo_. _Pago_. _Car acter no acumulativo_.

 

(A) El Dividendo Preferente correspondiente a todas las Acciones Clase B
que estuviesen emitidas a la finalizacion de un Periodo de Calculo debera

nueve meses siguientes a la finalizacion de dicho Periodo de Calculo, en la
cuantia en que el importe agregado de dicho Dividendo Preferente para las
Acciones Clase B no exceda del importe de los beneficios distribuibles
obtenidos por la Sociedad en dicho Periodo de Calculo.

  
    

(B) If during a Calculation Period the Company has not obtained
sufficient distributable profits to pay in full, out of distributable profits
obtained by the Company during such Calculation Period, the Preferred Dividend

the aggregate Preferred Dividend that exceeds the distributable profits
obtained by the Company during such Calculation Period shall not be paid and
not accumulated as dividend payable in the future.

Calculo no se pagara ni se acumulara como dividendo pagadero en el futuro.

  
    

2.4. _Voting rights in case of non-payment of the Preferred Dividend_. Lack
of payment, total or partial, of the Preferred Dividend during a Calculation
Period due to the Company not having obtained sufficient distributable profits
to pay in full the Preferred Dividend for such Calculation Period, shall not
cause the Class B Shares to recover any voting rights.

   |  

2.4. _Derechos de voto en caso de falta de pago del Dividendo Preferente_.
La falta de pago, total o parcial, del Dividendo Preferente en un Periodo de
Calculo debido a la no obtencion por la Sociedad de beneficios distribuibles

Calculo, no supondra la recuperacion del derecho de voto para las Acciones
Clase B.

  
    

3. _Other Dividends_

   |  

3. _Otros dividendos y repartos_

  
    

3.1. Each Class B Share entitles its holder to receive, in addition to the
Preferred Dividend, the same dividends and other distributions (in each case,
whether in cash, securities of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or any
other securities, assets or rights) as one Class A Share and, therefore, each
Class B Share shall be treated as one Class A Share for purposes of any
dividends and other distributions made on Class A Shares, including as to the
timing of the declaration and payment of any such dividend or distribution.

   |  

3.1. Cada Accion Clase B da derecho a su titular a recibir, ademas del
Dividendo Preferente, los mismos dividendos y otros repartos o distribuciones
(con independencia de si esos dividendos, repartos o distribuciones se
satisfacen en dinero, valores de la Sociedad o de cualquiera de sus filiales,
o cualesquiera otros valores, bienes o derechos) que una Accion Clase A y, en
consecuencia, cada Accion Clase B debera ser tratada como una Accion Clase A
en relacion con cualesquiera dividendos y otras repartos o distribuciones
satisfechas a titulares de Acciones Clase A, incluyendo en lo relativo a la
fecha de declaracion y pago de tales dividendos, repartos o distribuciones.

  
    

4. _Redemption rights_

   |  

4. _Derecho de rescate_

  
    

4.1. _Redemption event_. Each Class B Share entitles its holder to have it
redeemed as set forth in this section 4 if a tender offer for all or part of
the shares in the Company is made and settled (in whole or in part) except if
holders of Class B Shares have been entitled to participate in such offer and
have their shares acquired in such offer equally and on the same terms as
holders of Class A Shares (including, without limitation, for the same
consideration) (each such a tender offer, a "Redemption Event").

   |  

4.1. _Supuesto de rescate_. Cada Accion Clase B da derecho a su titular a
obtener su rescate conforme a lo establecido en este apartado 4 en caso de que
(cada oferta que cumpla lo que sigue, un "Supuesto de Rescate") se formulase y
liquidase (en todo o en parte) una oferta publica de adquisicion por la
totalidad o parte de las acciones de la Sociedad excepto si los titulares de
Acciones Clase B hubiesen tenido derecho a participar en esa oferta y a que
sus acciones fuesen adquiridas en esa oferta de la misma forma y en los mismos
terminos que los titulares de Acciones Clase A (incluyendo, sin limitacion,
por la misma contraprestacion).

  
    

4.2. _Maximum number of shares of Class B Shares to be redeemed in a given
Redemption Event_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Class B Shares redeemed
following a given Redemption Event shall not represent a percentage over the
total Class B Shares in issue at the time the tender offer causing that
Redemption Event is made in excess of the percentage that the sum of Class A
Shares (i) to which the offer causing the Redemption Event is addressed; (ii)
held by the offerors in that offer; and (iii) held by persons acting in
concert with the offerors or by persons having reached an agreement relating
to the offer with the offerors represent over the total Class A Shares in
issue at the time the tender offer causing that Redemption Event is made.

 

In the event that due to the application of the limit referred above not all
Class B Shares in respect of which the redemption right has been exercised in
connection with a Redemption Event may be redeemed, the Class B Shares of each
holder to be redeemed shall be reduced relative to the number of Class B
Shares in respect of which such holder has exercised the redemption rights so
that the above referred limit is not exceeded.

   |  

4.2. _M aximo porcentaje de Acciones Clase B rescatadas ante un Supuesto
de Rescate_. No obstante lo anterior, las Acciones Clase B rescatadas como
consecuencia de un determinado Supuesto de Rescate no podran representar
respecto del total de Acciones Clase B en circulacion al tiempo de formularse
la oferta publica de adquisicion que de lugar a ese Supuesto de Rescate de que
se trate un porcentaje superior a ese que la suma de las Acciones Clase A (i)
a que se dirija la oferta que de lugar a ese Supuesto de Rescate, (ii) de que
sean titulares los oferentes en esa oferta y (iii) de que sean titulares las
personas que actuen en concierto con los oferentes o las personas que hayan
alcanzado con los oferentes algun acuerdo relativo a la oferta represente
respecto del total de Acciones Clase A en circulacion al tiempo de formularse
la oferta publica de adquisicion que de lugar a ese Supuesto de Rescate.

 

En caso de que por aplicacion del limite antes referido no pueda atenderse el
rescate de todas las Acciones Clase B respecto de las que en ese Supuesto de
Rescate se haya ejercitado el derecho de rescate, se reduciran las Acciones
Clase B a rescatar de cada titular de Acciones Clase B en proporcion al numero
de Acciones Clase B respecto de las que haya ejercido el derecho de rescate de
forma que no se exceda el referido limite.

  
    

4.3. _Redemption process_. Upon the occurrence of a Redemption Event,

Rescate,
