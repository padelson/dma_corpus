right to receive (i) 0.1809 Parent Shares (the " _Equity Consideration_ ," and
such ratio, the " _Exchange Ratio_ "), which Parent Shares will be duly
authorized and validly issued in accordance with applicable Laws (such Parent
Shares described in this _clause (c)_ are referred to herein as the " _New
Common Shares_ ") and (ii) cash in amount of $9.12 (the " _Cash Consideration_
" and together with the Equity Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_
").

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at the
Effective Time, all Partnership Units owned immediately prior to the Effective
Time by the Partnership (collectively, the " _Excluded Units_ ") or its
wholly-owned Subsidiaries or by Parent or its wholly-owned Subsidiaries will
automatically be cancelled and no consideration will be received therefor.

3.2 _Rights As Unitholders; Unit Transfers_. All Partnership Units converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section
3.1(c)_ will cease to be outstanding and will automatically be canceled and
will cease to exist when converted as a result of and pursuant to the Merger.
At the Effective Time, each holder of a certificate representing Partnership
Units (a " _Certificate_ ") and each holder of non-certificated Partnership
Units, represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Units_ ") will cease to be a
limited partner of the Partnership and cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive, (a) the Merger Consideration, (b) any
cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional New Common Share in accordance with
_Section 3.3(d)_, and (c) any distributions in accordance with _Section
3.3(c)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the rights of (i) any holder of the
Partnership Equity Awards will be as set forth in _Section 3.5_, and (ii)
Parent and its Subsidiaries, and the Partnership and its Subsidiaries will be
as set forth in _Section 3.1(d)_. In addition, holders as of the relevant
record date of Partnership Units outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time will have continued rights to any distribution, without
interest, with respect to such Partnership Units, with a record date occurring
prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or made by the
Partnership with respect to such units in accordance with the terms of the
Existing Partnership Agreement and this Agreement and which remains unpaid as
of the Effective Time (a " _Regular Distribution_ "). Regular Distributions
by the Partnership are not part of the Merger Consideration, and will be paid
on the payment date set therefor to such holders of Partnership 

 



19  Units, whether or not they exchange their Partnership Units, pursuant to
_Section 3.3_. At the Effective Time, the unit transfer books of the
Partnership will be closed immediately and there will be no further
registration of transfers on the unit transfer books of the Partnership with
respect to Partnership Units.

 

3.3 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will appoint a
commercial bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Partnership to
act as exchange agent hereunder for the purpose of exchanging Partnership
Units for the Merger Consideration as required by this _Article III_ (the "
_Exchange Agent_ "). On the Closing Date, promptly after the Effective Time,
Parent will deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent for the
benefit of the holders of the applicable Partnership Units, for exchange in
accordance with this _Article III_, through the Exchange Agent, New Common
Shares and cash as required by this _Article III_. Parent agrees to make
available to the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, cash sufficient
to pay any distributions pursuant to _Section 3.3(c)_ and to make payments
in lieu of any fractional New Common Shares pursuant to

_Section 3.3(d)_, in each case without interest. Any cash (including
as payment for any fractional New Common Shares in accordance with _Section
3.3(d)_ and any distributions with respect to such fractional New Common
Shares in accordance with _Section 3.3(c)_) and New Common Shares deposited
with the Exchange Agent are hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange
Fund_." The Exchange Agent will, pursuant to irrevocable instructions from
Parent, deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be paid for
Partnership Units pursuant to this Agreement out of the Exchange Fund. Except
as contemplated by _Sections 3.3(c)_ and _3.3(d)_ , the Exchange Fund will
not be used for any other purpose.

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent will
instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each record holder of Partnership
Units as of the Effective Time (other than the Partnership and its
Subsidiaries and Parent and its Subsidiaries) (i) a letter of transmittal
(specifying that in respect of certificated Partnership Units, delivery will
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and which will
be in customary form and agreed to by Parent and the Partnership prior to the
Effective Time) (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") and (ii) instructions (in
customary form and agreed to by Parent and the Partnership prior to the
Effective Time) for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or
Book-Entry Units in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in respect
of Partnership Units represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry
Certificates, as applicable. Promptly after the Effective Time, upon surrender
of Certificates, if any, for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with
such letters of transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, and such
other documents (including in respect of Book-Entry Units) as may be
reasonably required pursuant to such instructions, each holder who
held Partnership Units immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
the Partnership and its Subsidiaries and Parent and its Subsidiaries) will be
entitled to receive upon surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Units
therefor (x) New Common Shares representing, in the aggregate, the whole
number of New Common Shares that such holder has the right to receive pursuant
to _Section 3.1(c)_ (after taking into account all Partnership Units then
held by such holder) and (y) a check in an amount equal to the aggregate
amount of the cash that such holder has the right to receive with respect to
such Partnership Units pursuant to _Section 3.3(c)_

 



20   __and _Section 3.3(d)_. No interest will be paid or accrued on any Merger
Consideration, any cash payment in lieu of fractional New Common Shares, any
Parent distributions payable pursuant to _Section 3.3(c)_ or any Regular
Distribution. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Partnership Units
that is not registered in the transfer records of the Partnership or the
Merger Consideration, as applicable, and any Parent distributions payable
pursuant to _Section 3.3(c)_ payable in respect of such Partnership Units may
be paid to a transferee, if the Certificate representing such Partnership
Units or evidence of ownership of the Book-Entry Units is presented to the
Exchange Agent, and in the case of both certificated and book-entry
Partnership Units, accompanied by all documents reasonably required to
evidence and effect such transfer and the Person requesting such exchange will
pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other Taxes required by
reason of the delivery of the Merger Consideration, in any name other than
that of the record holder of such Partnership Units, or will establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Taxes have been paid or are not
payable. Until such required documentation has been delivered and
Certificates, if any, have been surrendered, as contemplated by this _Section
3.3_, each Certificate or Book-Entry Unit will be deemed at any time after
the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such delivery
and surrender the Merger Consideration, payable in respect of Partnership
Units, and any cash or distributions to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to _Section 3.3(c)_, _Section 3.3(d)_ and (without the
necessity of such surrender) Regular Distributions.

 

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Partnership Units_. No
distributions declared or made with respect to Parent Shares with a record
date after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any Partnership
Units with respect to New Common Shares that such holder would be entitled to
receive in accordance herewith and no cash payment in lieu of fractional New
Common Shares will be paid to any such holder until such holder has delivered
the required documentation and surrendered any such Certificates or Book-Entry
Units as contemplated by this _Section 3.3_. Subject to applicable Law,
following compliance with the requirements of _Section 3.3(b)_, there will
be paid to such holder of New Common Shares issuable in exchange therefor,
without interest, (i) promptly after the time of such compliance, the amount
of any cash payable in lieu of fractional New Common Shares to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 3.3(d)_ (which shall be paid by the
Exchange Agent as provided therein) and the amount of distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to New
Common Shares and payable with respect to such New Common Shares, and (ii)
promptly after such compliance, or, if later, at the appropriate payment date,
the amount of distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but
prior to such delivery and surrender and a payment date subsequent to such
compliance payable with respect to such New Common Shares (which shall be paid
by Parent).

 

(d) _Fractional New Common Shares_. No certificates or scrip of New Common
Shares representing fractional New Common Shares or book entry credit of the
same will be issued upon the surrender of Partnership Units outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time in accordance with _Section 3.3(b)_,
and such fractional interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote
or to have any rights as a holder of any New Common Shares. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of Partnership Units
converted in the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a
fraction of a New Common Share (after taking into account all Partnership
Units exchanged by such holder) will receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without
interest rounded up to the nearest whole cent) in an amount

 



21  equal to the product of (i) the Average Closing Price as of the Closing Date
and (ii) the fraction of a New Common Share that such holder would otherwise
be entitled to receive pursuant to this _Article III_. As promptly as
practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid
to holders of fractional interests, Parent will cause the Exchange Agent to
forward payments to such holders of fractional interests subject to and in
accordance with the terms hereof. The parties acknowledge that payment of the
Cash Consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares of New Common Shares
was not separately bargained-for consideration but merely represents a
mechanical rounding off for purposes of avoiding the expense and inconvenience
to Parent that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional Parent
Shares.

 

(e) _Further Rights in Partnership Units_. The Merger Consideration issued
upon conversion of a Partnership Unit in accordance with the terms hereof
(including any cash paid pursuant to _Section 3.3(d)_) and any declared
distributions to be paid on Parent Shares as described in _Section 3.3(c)_
will be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such Partnership Unit.

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Partnership Units after 180 days
following the Effective Time will be delivered to Parent upon demand by Parent
and, from and after such delivery, any former holders of Partnership Units who
have not theretofore complied with this  _Article III_ will thereafter look
only to Parent for the Merger Consideration, payable in respect of such
Partnership Units, any cash in lieu of fractional New Common Shares to which
they are entitled pursuant to  _Section 3.3(d)_, or any distributions with
respect to New Common Shares to which they are entitled pursuant to _Section
3.3(c)_, in each case, without any interest thereon.

 

(g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the
posting by such Person of an indemnity agreement or a bond, in such amount
reasonably determined by Parent, as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will pay
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration, payable in respect of Partnership Units represented by such
Certificate, any distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled
pursuant to _Section 3.3(c)_ and any cash payable in lieu of fractional New
Common Shares to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section
3.3(d)_.

 

(h) _Withholding_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Exchange Agent are
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Partnership Units such amounts or
securities as Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent determines required to
deduct and withhold under the Code or any provision of state, local, or
foreign Tax Law, with respect to the making of such payment or issuance. To
the extent that amounts or securities are so deducted and withheld such
amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid
or issued to the holder of Partnership Units in respect of whom such
deduction and withholding was made by Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange
Agent, as the case may be.

 

(i) _Issuance in Book-Entry Form_. All New Common Shares to be issued in the
Merger will be issued in book-entry form, without physical certificates. Upon
the issuance of New Common Shares to the holders of Partnership Units in
accordance with this _Section 3.3_, Parent will reflect such admission on the
books and records of Parent.

 



22 (j) _No Dissenters Rights_. No dissenters or appraisal rights shall be
available with respect to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

(k) _Tax Characterization of Merger and Cash Received_. The Partnership and
Parent each acknowledges and agrees that for federal income Tax purposes (and
applicable state income or franchise tax purposes) the transactions
consummated pursuant to this Agreement will, in accordance with IRS Revenue
Ruling 99-6; Situation 2, be treated as each holder of a Partnership Common
Unit shall be treated as transferring its Common Units in exchange for the
Merger Consideration and Parent shall be treated as acquiring the assets of
the Partnership deemed distributed to the holders of Partnership Common Units
in the deemed liquidation of Partnership. Each of the Partnership and Parent
agrees to prepare and file all U.S. federal income Tax Returns in accordance
with the foregoing and shall not take any position inconsistent therewith on
any such Tax Return, or in the course of any audit, litigation or other
proceeding with respect to U.S. federal income Taxes, except as otherwise
required by applicable Laws following a final determination by a court of
competent jurisdiction or other final administrative decision by an applicable
Governmental Authority.

(l)  _Distribution_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Merger shall not affect the right of any holder of Partnership
Units as of the record time for the Distribution to receive its share of
SpinCo Common Units pursuant to the Distribution. It is understood that no
Partnership Equity Awards existing as of the record time for the Distribution,
all of which shall be adjusted in connection with the Distribution pursuant to
_Section 3.5_, shall entitle the holder thereof to receive any SpinCo Common
Units in the distribution.

3.4 _Anti-Dilution Provisions_. Without limiting the covenants in _Sections
4.1_ and _4.2_ , in the event the outstanding Partnership Units or Parent
Shares shall have been changed into a different number of units or shares or a
different class after the date of this Agreement by reason of any
subdivisions, reclassifications, splits, unit or share distributions,
combinations or exchanges of Partnership Units or Parent Shares (other than
the Spin-Off Transactions), the Exchange Ratio will be correspondingly
adjusted to provide to the holders of such Partnership Units the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

3.5 _Treatment of Equity-Based Awards_.

(a) _Adjustment of Partnership Equity Awards in Connection with the Spin-Off
Transaction_. Prior to the actions described in _Section 2.1_, the
Partnership Equity Awards shall be adjusted in accordance with Section 5.2 of
the Employee Matters Agreement.

 

(b) _Cancellation and Settlement of SpinCo Employee Partnership Equity
Awards_.

 

(i) _Partnership Unit Options_. Each option to acquire Partnership Units
granted under the Partnerships equity plans (each such option, a "
_Partnership Unit Option_ " and such plans, the " _Partnership Equity Plans_
"), whether vested or unvested, that is held by a SpinCo Employee, a non-
employee director of the Partnership or APL or a former

 



23  employee and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall, as
of the Effective Time, become fully vested and be cancelled and converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of each Net
Partnership Unit represented by such Partnership Unit Option. Any Partnership
Unit Option that has an exercise price per Partnership Unit that is greater
than or equal to the Per Unit Cash Consideration shall be cancelled in
exchange for no consideration. The holders of the Partnership Unit Options
shall receive the payments described in this _Section 3.5(b)(i)_, less such
amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or
any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making
of such payment, within five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time.

 

(ii) _Partnership Phantom Units_. Each phantom unit based on Partnership Units
granted under the Partnership Equity Plans (each, a " _Partnership Phantom
Unit_ " and, together with the Partnership Unit Options, the " _Partnership
Equity Awards_ "), whether vested or unvested, that is held by a SpinCo
Employee, a non-employee director of the Partnership or APL or a former
employee and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall, as of
the Effective Time, become fully vested and be cancelled and converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of each Partnership
Unit underlying such Partnership Phantom Unit. The holders of Partnership
Phantom Units shall receive the payments described in the immediately
preceding sentence (together with any dividend equivalents corresponding to
Partnership Phantom Units that vest in accordance with this _Section
3.5(b)(ii)_), less such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted
under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law with
respect to the making of such payments, within five (5) Business Days
following the Effective Time.

(c) _Rollover and Partial Settlement of Midstream Business Employee
Partnership Equity Awards_.

(i) _Vested Partnership Unit Options_. Each vested Partnership Unit Option
that is held by a Midstream Business Employee and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall, as of the Effective Time, be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of
each Net Partnership Unit represented by such Partnership Unit Option. The
holders of the Partnership Unit Options shall receive the payments described
in this _Section 3.5(c)(i)_, less such amounts as are required to be withheld
or deducted under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax
Law with respect to the making of such payment, within five (5) Business Days
following the Effective Time.

 

(ii) _Unvested Partnership Unit Options_. Each unvested Partnership Unit
Option that is held by a Midstream Business Employee and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall, as of the Effective Time, be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive: (A) the Cash Consideration
in respect of each Net Partnership Unit represented by such Partnership
Unit Option, and (B) a restricted stock award in respect of Parent Shares (a
" _Parent Restricted Share Award_ ") with respect to a number of Parent Shares
equal to the product of (1) the number of Net Partnership Units represented
by such Partnership Unit Option, _multiplied by_ (2) the Equity Consideration.
Any Partnership Unit Option that has an exercise price per Partnership Unit
that is greater than or equal to the Per Unit Cash Consideration shall be
cancelled in exchange for no consideration. The holders of the Partnership
Unit Options shall receive the payments described in this _Section
3.5(c)(ii)_, less such amounts as are required to be 

 



24  withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment, within five (5)
Business Days following the Effective Time. Except as otherwise provided in
this _Section 3.5(c)(ii)_, each such Parent Restricted Share Award issued
pursuant to this _Section 3.5(c)(ii)_ shall continue to have, and shall be
subject to, the same material terms and conditions and same vesting
conditions (but excluding any terms and conditions unique to options) as
applied to the corresponding Partnership Unit Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and shall settle in Parent Shares upon vesting.

 

(iii) _Partnership Phantom Units_. Each Partnership Phantom Unit that is held
by a Midstream Business Employee and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall, as of the Effective Time, be cancelled and converted
into the right to receive: (A) the Cash Consideration in respect of each
Partnership Unit underlying such Partnership Phantom Unit and (B) a Parent
Restricted Share Award with respect to a number of Parent Shares equal to the
product of (1) the number of Partnership Units underlying such Partnership

immediately preceding sentence (together with any dividend equivalents
corresponding to Partnership Phantom Units that vest in accordance with this 
_Section 3.5(c)(iii)_), less such amounts as are required to be withheld or
deducted under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law
with respect to the making of such payments, within five (5) Business
Days following the Effective Time. Except as otherwise provided in this
_Section 3.5(c)(iii)_, each such Parent Restricted Share Award assumed and
converted pursuant to this _Section 3.5(c)(iii)_ shall continue to have, and
shall be subject to, the same material terms and conditions and the same
vesting conditions as applied to the corresponding Partnership Phantom Unit
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and shall settle in Parent Shares
upon vesting.

 

(d) _Certain Tax Considerations_. The actions contemplated by this _Section
3.5_ shall be taken in accordance with Section 409A of the Code. The
aggregate amount required to be withheld from any holder of Partnership Equity
Awards in connection with the payments described in _Sections 3.5(b)_ and
_3.5(c)_ shall first be applied to reduce the portion of such payments
payable in the form of Parent Shares and, to the extent such withholding
amount exceeds the portion of such payments payable in the form of Parent
Shares, such excess shall be applied to reduce the portion of such
payments payable in cash.

(e) _Termination of Partnership Equity Plans; Issuance of Parent Restricted
Share Awards_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Partnership shall take all
actions necessary to terminate each of the Partnership Equity Plans, effective
as of and subject to the occurrence of the Effective Time. At the Effective

reserve for issuance a sufficient number of Parent Shares for delivery with
respect to the settlement of Partnership Equity Awards contemplated by

Statement a number of Parent Shares sufficient to satisfy the settlement of
Partnership Equity Awards contemplated by _Sections 3.5(b)_ and _3.5(c)(i)_.

issuance a sufficient number of Parent Shares for delivery upon settlement of
the Parent Restricted Share Awards issued by it in

 



25  accordance with _Sections 3.5(c)(ii)_ and _3.5(c)(iii)_. As soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, if and to the extent
necessary to cause a sufficient number of Parent Shares to be registered and
issuable with respect to Parent Restricted Share Awards, Parent shall file a
post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement or a registration
statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate form) with
respect to the Parent Shares subject to Parent Restricted Share Awards and
shall use its reasonable commercial efforts to maintain the effectiveness of
such registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the
current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so
long as such Parent Restricted Share Awards remain outstanding. As soon as
reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to
each holder of a Parent Restricted Share Award issued by Parent an
appropriate notice setting forth such holders rights pursuant to the such
Parent Restricted Share Award.

 

(g) _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Each of the parties hereto shall use its
reasonable best efforts to take any actions reasonably necessary to
effectuate the transactions contemplated by this _Section 3.5_, including,
without limitation, having the applicable board or committee administering the

Option, the quotient of (A) the product of (1) the excess, if any, of the Per

Unit Option, _multiplied by_ (2) the number of Partnership Units underlying
such Partnership Unit Option, divided by (B) the Per Unit Cash Consideration.

(ii) " _Per Unit Cash Consideration_ " means the sum of (A) the Cash
Consideration plus (B) the product of (1) the Equity Consideration multiplied
by (2) the Average Closing Price.

the date of this Agreement, in which case as of the date of such amendment),
each Partnership SEC Document complied in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Exchange Act, the Securities Act and the

stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

being conducted as of the date of this Agreement (collectively, the "

applicable Governmental Authority to fail or refuse to issue, renew, extend,

 __Except as set forth in (a) all forms, registration statements, reports,
schedules and statements filed by Parent or NGLS with the SEC under the
Exchange Act or the Securities Act since January 1, 2012 and on or prior to
the date of this Agreement, and in each case excluding all exhibits and
schedules thereto and documents incorporated by reference
therein (collectively, the " _Parent SEC Documents_ ") (but excluding any
disclosure contained in any such Parent SEC Documents under the heading "Risk
Factors" or "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" or similar
heading (other than any historical factual information contained within such
headings, disclosure or statements)) or (b) the Parent Disclosure Schedule
prior to the execution of this Agreement ( __ _provided_ __that (i)
disclosure in any section of such Parent Disclosure Schedule is deemed to be
disclosed with respect to any other section of this Agreement to the extent
that it is reasonably apparent on the face of the Parent Disclosure Schedule
that such disclosure is applicable to such other section notwithstanding the
omission of a reference or cross reference thereto and (ii) the mere inclusion
of an item in such Parent Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a
representation or warranty is not deemed an admission that such item
represents a material exception or material fact, event or circumstance or
that such item has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent (a " _Parent
Material Adverse Effect_ ")), Parent and Merger Sub represent and warrant to
the Partnership and Partnership GP as follows: __

 

6.1 _Organization, General Authority and Standing_. Parent is a corporation
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State of
Delaware, and Merger Sub is a

 



49  limited liability company validly existing and in good standing under the
Laws of the State of Delaware. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite
power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and
to carry on its business as presently conducted, except as would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. _Section 6.1_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedules
sets forth a true and complete list of Parents Subsidiaries and Parents
ownership interest in each such Subsidiary. Each of Parents Subsidiaries (i)
is a limited partnership, corporation or limited liability company, as the
case may be, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of its
jurisdiction of organization, (ii) has all requisite power and authority to
own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business
as presently conducted and (iii) is duly licensed or qualified to do business
and in good standing to do business as a foreign limited partnership,
corporation or limited liability company, as the case may be, in each
jurisdiction in which the conduct or nature of its business or the ownership,
leasing, holding or operating of its properties makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except in each case of _clauses (i)_ through _(iii)_
as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent has made available to the
Partnership true and complete copies of the Parent Certificate of
Incorporation and Parent Bylaws (the " _Parent Organizational Documents_ "),
the certificate of limited partnership of NGLS and the First Amended and
Restated Operating Agreement of NGLS, dated as of February 16, 2007, as

held in treasury, and (iii) no shares of Parent Preferred Stock, and there
were (iv) 228,060 shares of restricted Parent Shares and 88,570 shares of
restricted stock units granted and outstanding under Parents equity plans
(such shares, the " _Parent Equity Awards_ "). The authorized equity
interests of NGLS consist of Common Units representing limited partner
interests in NGLS (" _NGLS Common Units_ "), Class B Common Units representing
limited partner interests in NGLS, Subordinated Units representing limited
partner interests in NGLS, the Incentive Distribution Rights (as defined in
the NGLS Partnership Agreement, the " _NGLS IDRs_ ") and a general partner
interest in NGLS. As of October 10, 2014, the issued and outstanding limited
partner interests and general partner interests of NGLS consisted of (A)
115,774,096 NGLS Common Units, (B) the NGLS IDRs and (C) an approximate 2%
general partner interest in NGLS, and there were (D) 579,273 equity-settled
performance NGLS Common Units granted and outstanding under NGLS equity plans
(the " _NGLS Equity Awards_ "). NGLS GP is the sole general partner of NGLS
and owns all of the outstanding NGLS IDRs and general partner interest in
NGLS, and Parent owns all of the outstanding equity of NGLS GP. All
outstanding equity securities of Parent and NGLS are, and all Parent Shares
issuable pursuant to Parent Equity Awards and NGLS Common Units issuable
pursuant to NGLS Equity Awards, when issued in accordance with the respective
terms thereof, will be, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. _ _

interests, or any commitment to authorize, issue or sell the same or any such
equity securities, except pursuant to this Agreement, and (C) there are no
contractual obligations of Parent to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire
any other equity interest in Parent or any such securities or agreements
listed in _clause (B)_ of this sentence.

(c) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has outstanding
bonds, debentures, notes or other Indebtedness, the holders of which have the
right to vote (or which are convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable
for securities having the right to vote) with the Parent Stockholders on any
matter.

 

(d) There are no voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to which
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the voting or
registration of capital stock or other equity interest of Parent.

(e) When issued pursuant to the terms hereof, all outstanding New Common

6.3 _Equity Interests in other Entities_. Other than the ownership interests
in its Subsidiaries set forth on  _Section 6.1_ of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule, and as reflected in _Section 6.3_ of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule, Parent does not own beneficially, directly or indirectly, any equity
securities or similar interests of any Person. Parent owns such interests in
its Subsidiaries free and clear of all Liens except for Permitted
Encumbrances.

6.4  _Power, Authority and Approvals of Transactions_. Parent has the
requisite corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its
obligations under this Agreement and, subject to the Parent Stockholder
Approval, to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. Subject to the
Parent Stockholder Approval, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated

Parent Board has (a) determined that it is in the best interests of Parent
and the Parent Stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into this
Agreement, (b) approved the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and (c) resolved to submit
the Parent Share Issuance to a vote of the Parent Stockholders and recommend
approval of the Parent Share Issuance by the Parent Stockholders. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and,
assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the Other Parties,
constitutes, as applicable, Parent and Merger Subs valid and binding
obligations, enforceable against Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its
terms (except to the extent that its enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar Law
affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally or by general
equitable principles).

 



51 6.5 _No Violations or Defaults_. Subject to required filings under federal and
state securities Laws and with the NYSE, assuming the other consents and
approvals contemplated by _Section 6.6_ and _Article VIII_ are duly obtained
and assuming the consents, waivers and approvals specified in  _Section
7.10(a)_ are obtained, the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby by
Parent do not and will not (i) constitute a breach or violation of, or result
in a default (or an event that, with notice or lapse of time or both, would
become a default) under, or result in the termination or in a right of
termination or cancellation of, or accelerate the performance required by, any
note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, franchise, lease,
contract, agreement, joint venture or other instrument or obligation to which
Parent or any of its respective Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries or properties is subject or bound, (ii) constitute
a breach or violation of, or a default under the Parent Bylaws or the Parent
Certificate of Incorporation, (iii) contravene or conflict with or constitute
a material violation of any provision of any Law binding upon or applicable
to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or (iv) result in the creation of any
Lien on any of the assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries assets, in
each case, except for such breaches, violations, defaults, terminations,
cancellations, accelerations, contraventions, conflicts or Liens which, either
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

6.6 _Consents and Approvals_. No consents or approvals of, or filings or
registrations with, any Governmental Authority are necessary in connection
with (i) the execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement
or (ii) the consummation by Parent or Merger Sub of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except for, subject to the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of the Partnership Entities set forth in
_Section 5.6_, (A) the filing with the SEC of the registration statement on
Form S-4 by Parent in connection with Parent Share Issuance, in which the
Joint Proxy Statement will be included (as amended or supplemented from time

state securities Laws, (B) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, (C) any consents, authorizations,
approvals, filings or exemptions in connection with compliance with the rules
of the NYSE, (D) such filings and approvals as may be required to be made or
obtained under the Antitrust Laws, and (E) such other consents,
authorizations, approvals, filings or registrations the absence or
unavailability of which would not, either individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or materially
delay consummation of the Merger.

 

6.7 _Financial Reports and Parent SEC Documents_.

 

(a) Since January 1, 2012, Parent and/or NGLS has filed and furnished with the
SEC all forms, registration statements, reports, schedules and statements
required to be filed or furnished prior to the date hereof under the Exchange
Act or the Securities Act. At the time filed (or, in the case of registration
statements, solely on the dates of effectiveness) (except to the
extent amended by a subsequently filed Parent SEC Document prior to the date
of this Agreement, in which case as of the date of such amendment), each
Parent SEC Document complied in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Exchange Act, the

 



52  Securities Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, and did not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact, or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

 

 __(b) Any consolidated financial statements of Parent included in the Parent
SEC Documents (the " _Parent Financial Statements_ ") as of their respective
dates (if amended, as of the date of the last such amendment) (A) complied as
to form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and
with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, (B)
were prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except as may be expressly indicated in the notes thereto,
to the extent permitted by applicable SEC regulations), and (C) fairly
present in all material respects the consolidated financial position of Parent
and its Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of
their operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the
case of unaudited quarterly statements, to normal year-end adjustments). __

(c) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar contract (including any contract relating to any
transaction or relationship between or among Parent and any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including any
structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on
the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item
303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC)), where the purpose of such contract is
to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material
liabilities of, Parent in Parents published financial statements or any
Parent SEC Documents.

6.8 _Internal Controls and Procedures_. Parent has established and maintains
internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and
procedures (as such terms are defined in Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under
the Exchange Act); such disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Parent in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC
rules and forms. Parents principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer have disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation of
internal control over financial reporting, to Parents auditors and the audit
committee of the Parent Board (x) all significant deficiencies in the design
or operation of internal controls that are reasonably likely to adversely
affect Parents ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
data and have identified for Parents auditors any material weaknesses in
internal controls and (y) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in Parents
internal controls. The principal executive officer and the principal financial
officer of Parent have made all certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, the Exchange Act and any related rules and regulations promulgated by
the SEC with respect to the Parent SEC Documents, and the statements contained
in such certifications were complete and correct as of the dates they were
made.

 

6.9 _Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except as disclosed in the audited
financial statements (or notes thereto) included in Parents Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year

 



53  ended December 31, 2013, the unaudited financial statements (or notes
thereto) included in Parents Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2014, or in the financial statements (or notes
thereto) included in subsequent Parent SEC Documents filed by Parent prior to
the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor any of its consolidated
subsidiaries had at the Balance Sheet Date or has incurred since that date,
any liabilities that would be required by GAAP to be reflected on a
consolidated balance sheet of the Parent, except liabilities (A) that are
accrued or reserved against in the financial statements of Parent included in
the Parent SEC Documents filed prior to the date of this Agreement or
reflected in the notes thereto (B) incurred since the Balance Sheet Date in
the ordinary course of business, (C) incurred in accordance with this
Agreement or in connection with the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Agreements, (D) that would not reasonably be expected to have,
either individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect or
(E) that have been discharged or paid in full.

6.10 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

 

(a) Since the Balance Sheet Date, there has not been any change, event,
development, circumstance, contribution, occurrence or effect with respect to
the Parent and its Subsidiaries that has had, or would reasonably be expected

(b) Since the Balance Sheet Date through the date of this Agreement, except
for this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, Parent and its
Subsidiaries have carried on and operated their respective businesses in all
material respects in the ordinary course of business.

(a) Except with respect to Tax matters (which are provided for in _Section
6.17_) and environmental matters (which are provided for in _Section 6.13_),
each of Parent and its Subsidiaries is in compliance with all, and is not in
default under or in violation of any, applicable Law, other than any
noncompliance, default or violation which would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written
communication since the Balance Sheet Date and prior to the date of this
Agreement from a Governmental Authority that alleges that Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries is not in compliance with or is in default or violation of
any applicable Law, except where such non-compliance, default or violation
would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Except for the Environmental Permits (which are provided for in _Section
6.13_), Parent and its Subsidiaries are in possession of all franchises,
tariffs, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances,
exemptions, consents, certificates, approvals and orders of any
Governmental Authority necessary under applicable Law to own, lease and
operate their properties and to lawfully carry on their businesses as they are
being conducted as of the date of this Agreement (collectively, the " _Parent
Permits_ "), except where the failure to be in possession of such Parent
Permits would not, individually or in the aggregate,

 



54  be reasonably expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. All Parent
Permits are in full force and effect, except where the failure to be in full
force and effect would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. No suspension or
cancellation of any of the Parent Permits is pending or threatened, except
where such suspension or cancellation would not individually or in
the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party in effect on the date of this
Agreement, other than a Parent Employee Benefit Plan is referred to as a "

aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(within the meaning of Section 351) if the partnership were incorporated; and

(i) none of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has been a member of an
affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return or has any
liability for the Taxes of any Person (other than Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries), as a transferee or successor, by contract, or otherwise.

6.18 _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) Section _6.18(a)_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete
and accurate list of each material Employee Benefit Plan that is (i)
sponsored, maintained or contributed to by the Parent or any of its ERISA
Affiliates, or (ii) for which the Parent or any of its ERISA Affiliates has or
could have any liability, contingent or otherwise (each, a " _Parent Employee
Benefit Plan_ ").

 



58 (b) Each Parent Employee Benefit Plan has been administered in all respects in
accordance with its terms, and in compliance with the applicable provisions
of all Laws applicable to such Parent Employee Benefit Plan, and complies with
such terms and such Laws, in each case except where the failure to be so
administered or to so comply, would not, individually or in the aggregate, be
reasonably expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. There are no
investigations by any Governmental Authority, termination proceedings or other
claims (except routine claims for benefits payable under the Parent Employee
Benefit Plans) or proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of the Parent,
threatened against or involving any Parent Employee Benefit Plan or asserting
any rights to, or claims for benefits under, any Parent Employee Benefit
Plan, in each case, that would be reasonably expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

(c) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect, there do not now exist, nor do any circumstances
exist that would result in, any liabilities to the Parent or any of its ERISA
Affiliates under (i) Section 302 of ERISA, (ii) Sections 412 and 4971 of the
Code, (iii) a "multiple employer welfare arrangement" (as defined in Section
3(40) of ERISA), or (iv) a "multiple employer plan" (as defined in Section
413(c) of the Code). Except as, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, each Parent
Employee Benefit Plan that is intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the
Code has either received a favorable determination letter from the Internal
Revenue Service as to its qualified status or may rely upon an opinion letter
for a prototype plan and, to the Knowledge of Parent, nothing has occurred
that could adversely affect the qualified status of any such Parent Employee
Benefit Plan.

 

(d) To the Knowledge of Parent, no Parent Employee Benefit Plan or any other
arrangement maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries provides any of the
following retiree or post-employment benefits to any Person: medical,
disability or life insurance benefits, except as required by (i) the
applicable requirements of Section 4980B of the Code or any similar state Law
or (ii) company-paid or subsidized healthcare coverage pursuant to an
employment, severance or similar agreement, plan or arrangement. Except as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect, each of Parent and each its ERISA Affiliates
is in compliance with (A) the requirements of the applicable health care
continuation and notice provisions of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended, and the regulations (including
proposed regulations) thereunder and any similar state Law and (B) the
applicable requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
Act of 1996, as amended, and the regulations (including the
proposed regulations) thereunder.

(e) To the Knowledge of Parent no Parent Employee Benefit Plan is, and none of
Parent, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates
contributes to, during the past six years has contributed to or has any
liability or obligation, whether actual or contingent, with respect to any (x)

pension plan subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the
Code.

 



59 (f) Neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will, individually or together with the
occurrence of any other event, (i) result in the imposition of sanctions
imposed under Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code to the Parent, its
Subsidiaries or any Parent Employee, (ii) result in or entitle any Parent
Employee to any payment or benefit, (iii) accelerate the vesting, funding or
time of payment of any compensation or other benefit payable pursuant to any
Parent Employee Benefit Plan or to any Parent Employee, or (iv) increase the
amount or value of any payment, compensation or benefit to any Parent
Employee.

(g) Parent is, and has been, in compliance in all respects with all
applicable Law relating to the employment of labor, including all such
applicable Law relating to wages, hours, collective bargaining,
discrimination, civil rights, safety and health and workers compensation,
except where the failure to comply would not, individually or in the
aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Parent, threatened
material investigations, audits, complaints or proceedings against the Parent
by or before any Governmental Authority involving any applicant for
employment, any current or former employee or any class of the foregoing that,
individually or in the aggregate, would be reasonably expected to result in a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(h) No Parent Employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement,
and, to the Knowledge of Parent, none of the Parent Employees are represented
by a labor organization and no organizational effort is presently being made
or threatened by or on behalf of any labor union with respect to
the Employees. There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent,
threatened, labor disputes, strike, lock-out, work stoppages, requests for
representation, pickets or work slow-downs, nor has such event or labor
difficulty occurred within the past three (3) years, except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

__6.19  _Intellectual Property_ __. Parent and its Subsidiaries own or have
the right to use all Intellectual Property necessary for the operation of its
business as presently conducted (collectively, the " _Parent
Intellectual Property_ ") free and clear of all encumbrances except for
Permitted Encumbrances, except where the failure to own or have the right to
use such Intellectual Property would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. The use of
the Parent Intellectual Property by Parent and its Subsidiaries in the
operation of Parents business as presently conducted does not infringe upon
or misappropriate any Intellectual Property of any other Person, except for
such matters that would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. __

opinion of the Parent Financial Advisors to the effect that, as of the date of

of engaging in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and has
engaged in no business other than in connection with entering into this
Agreement and engaging in the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

6.24 _Insurance_. Parent and its Subsidiaries maintain, or are entitled to the
benefits of, insurance in such amounts and against such risks substantially
as Parent believes to be customary for the industries in which it and its
Subsidiaries operate. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, (i) all
material insurance policies maintained by or on behalf of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement are in full force and effect,
and all premiums due on such policies have been paid by Parent or
its Subsidiaries and (ii) Parent and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with
the terms and provisions of all insurance policies maintained by or on behalf

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the Parent
Entities, on the one hand, and the Partnership Entities, on the other hand,
will cooperate with the other and use (and will cause their respective
Subsidiaries to use) its reasonable best efforts to (i) take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, all things, necessary, proper
or advisable to cause the conditions to the Closing to be satisfied as
promptly as practicable (and in any event no later than the Outside Date) and

HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and all other
applicable Laws issued by a Governmental Authority that are designed or
intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or
effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of competition.

 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each Party hereto

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, each
of the Parent and the Partnership agrees to take, and to cause its respective
Subsidiaries (which term, as used here with respect to the Partnership, shall
include the Spin-Off Companies) to take, any and all steps and to make, and
cause to be made, any and all undertakings necessary to resolve such
objections, if any, that a Governmental Authority may assert under any
Antitrust Law with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement

Authority with respect to such transactions so as to enable the Closing to
occur as promptly as practicable, and in any event no later than the Outside
Date, including (x) proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by
consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or

their ability to retain or hold, one or more of their or their Subsidiaries
businesses, assets, equity interests, product lines or properties, in each
case as may be required in order to obtain all approvals, consents,
clearances, expirations or terminations of waiting periods, registrations,
permits, authorizations and other confirmations or to avoid the commencement
of any action to prohibit the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
or, in the alternative, to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution
of, any injunction, temporary restraining or other order in any action or
proceeding seeking to prohibit the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or delay the Closing beyond the Outside Date (each, a " _Divestiture
Action_ "); _provided_ that none of Parent and its Subsidiaries or the
Partnership and its Subsidiaries (which term, as used here, shall include the
Spin-Off Companies) shall be required to take any action, or commit to take
any action, or agree to any condition or limitation, in connection with the
foregoing that would reasonably be expected to (i) in the case of assets,
properties or business of Parent or its Subsidiaries, materially and adversely
impact the business or operations of Parent and its Subsidiaries (as measured
prior to the Effective Time) within any specific oil and natural gas
producing basin or in any distinctive market area if outside of an oil and
natural gas producing basin or (ii) in the case of assets, properties or
business of the Partnership or its Subsidiaries, materially and adversely
impact the business or operations of the Partnership and its Subsidiaries (as
measured prior to the Effective Time) within any specific oil and natural gas

natural gas producing basin; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the
consummation of the transactions provided for in any such agreement for a
Divestiture Action shall be conditioned upon the Closing or satisfaction or
waiver of all of the conditions to Closing in a case where the Closing will
occur immediately following such Divestiture Action.

(d) Each of the Parties hereto will use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission with a Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and in connection with any investigation or other
inquiry by or before a Governmental Authority relating to the Merger,
including any proceeding initiated by a private Person, (ii) promptly inform
the Other Parties of (and supply to the Other Parties) any communication
received by such Party from, or given by such Party to, the Federal Trade

connection with any proceeding by a private Person, in each case regarding

advance of any meeting or teleconference with any Governmental Authority or,
in connection with any proceeding by a private Person, with any other Person,
and, to the extent not prohibited by the Governmental Authority or other
Person, give the Other Parties the opportunity to attend and participate in
such meetings and teleconferences. Subject to  _Section 7.5(b)_, the Parties
will take reasonable efforts to share information protected from disclosure
under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine, joint defense
privilege or any other privilege pursuant to this  _Section 7.1_ in a manner
so as to preserve the applicable privilege.

 



64  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, Parent
shall, on behalf of the Parties, control and lead all communications and
strategy relating to the Antitrust Laws, subject to the good faith
consultations with the Partnership and the inclusion of the Partnership at
meetings with any Governmental Authority with respect to any discussion
related to the Merger under the Antitrust Laws.

 

7.2 _Registration Statement; Joint Proxy Statement_.

 

(a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the
Partnership and Parent will prepare the Joint Proxy Statement and Parent will
prepare and Parent will file with the SEC the Registration Statement (which
shall include the Joint Proxy Statement). Each of the Partnership and Parent
will use its reasonable best efforts to have the Registration Statement
declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after
such filing and keep the Registration Statement effective for so long as
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the
Partnership and the Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Partnership Unitholders and the
Parent Stockholders as promptly as practicable after the Registration

take any action required to be taken under any applicable state or provincial
securities Law in connection with the issuance and reservation of the New
Common Shares, and the Partnership shall furnish all information concerning
the Partnership and the holders of Partnership Units or a beneficial interest
therein as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action. No
filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Registration Statement will be
made by Parent, and no filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Joint
Proxy Statement will be made by the Partnership or Parent without providing
the Other Parties a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon;
_provided_ , that the Partnership Parties, in connection with a Partnership
Change in Recommendation, or Parent, in connection with a Parent Change in
Recommendation, may amend or supplement the Registration Statement and the
Joint Proxy Statement to effect such change if, and to the extent, such
amendment or supplement is required by applicable Law. If at any time prior to
the Effective Time any information relating to the Partnership or Parent, or
any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, is discovered
by the Partnership or Parent that should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to either the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement,
so that any such document would not include any misstatement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, the Party that discovers such information will promptly notify the
Other Parties and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information will be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by
Law, disseminated to the Partnership Unitholders or Parent Stockholders. The
Parties will notify each other promptly of the receipt of any comments from
the SEC or the staff of the SEC and of any request by the SEC or the staff of
the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Joint Proxy Statement or the
Registration Statement or for additional information and will supply each
other with copies of (i) all correspondence between it or any of its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the
other hand, with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement, the Registration
Statement or the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) all orders of the
SEC relating to the Registration Statement.

Partnership will, as soon as reasonably practicable following the Registration
Statement being declared effective by the SEC, establish a record date for,
duly call, give notice of, convene and hold, the Partnership Meeting. Except
as permitted by _Section 7.3_, the Joint Proxy Statement shall include the
Partnership Boards recommendation that the Partnership Unitholders approve

this Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_, the Partnerships obligations to
call, give notice of and hold the Partnership Meeting in accordance with
_Section 7.2_ shall not be limited by the making, commencement, disclosure,
announcement or submission of any Superior Proposal or Alternative Proposal,
or by any Partnership Change in Recommendation. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Partnership agrees that: (i) unless this
Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with _Article IX_ (including,
if applicable, upon payment of the Termination Fee and the Expenses), the
Partnership shall not submit any Superior Proposal to a vote of the
Partnership Unitholders; and (ii) it shall not (without Parents prior written
consent) adjourn, postpone or cancel (or propose, publicly or otherwise, or
resolve to, to adjourn, postpone or cancel) the Partnership Meeting, except
(iii) in the absence of proxies sufficient to obtain the Partnership
Unitholder Approval, to solicit additional proxies for the purpose of
obtaining Partnership Unitholder Approval, (iv) in the absence of a quorum, or
(v) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and/or mailing of any
supplemental or amended disclosure that the Partnership has determined after
consultation with outside legal counsel is necessary under applicable Law and
for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by
the Partnership Unitholders prior to Partnership Meeting, such additional time
not to exceed ten (10) calendar days. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, if there occurs a Partnership Change in
Recommendation, the Partnership shall remain required to call, hold and
convene the Partnership Meeting unless this Agreement has been terminated in
accordance with its terms.

(c) Subject to _Section 7.2(d)_ and the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Article IX_, Parent will, as soon as reasonably practicable
following the Registration Statement being declared effective by the SEC,
establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold,
the Parent Meeting Except as permitted by _Section 7.3_, the Joint Proxy
Statement shall include the Parent Boards recommendation that the Parent
Stockholders approve the Parent Share Issuance (the " _Parent
Board Recommendation_ "). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the Parent agrees that it shall not (without Partnerships prior written
consent) adjourn, postpone or cancel (or propose, publicly or otherwise, or
resolve to, to adjourn, postpone or cancel) the Parent Meeting, except (i) in
the absence of proxies sufficient to obtain the Parent Stockholder Approval,
to solicit additional proxies for the purpose of obtaining Parent Stockholder
Approval, (ii) in the absence of a quorum, or (iii) to allow reasonable
additional time for the filing and/or mailing of any supplemental or amended
disclosure that the Parent has determined after consultation with outside

amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the Parent Stockholders
prior to Parent Meeting, such additional time not to exceed ten (10) calendar
days. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if there
occurs a Parent Change in Recommendation, the Parent shall remain required to
call, hold and convene the Parent Meeting unless this Agreement has been
terminated in accordance with its terms.

the same day at the same time as soon as reasonably practicable after the date
of this Agreement, and to set the same record date for each such meeting. 

 



66 7.3 _Alternative Proposals; Change in Recommendation by the Partnership_.

 

(a) Each of Partnership GP and the Partnership will and will cause the
Partnerships Subsidiaries and the Spin-Off Companies to, and will use
reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries and the Spin-Off
Companies Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated
any discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Person (other than the
Parent Entities and their respective Representatives) conducted on or prior
to the date of this Agreement with respect to any Alternative Proposal (which,
for this purpose, need not have been an unsolicited proposal) and shall

termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_, neither Partnership
GP nor the Partnership will, and each of the Partnership and the Partnership
GP will cause the Partnerships Subsidiaries and the Spin-Off Companies not
to, and use reasonable best efforts to cause its and the Subsidiaries and
Spin-Off Companies officers, directors, managers, members, employees and
other Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit,
knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing information), facilitate
the making, submission or announcement of any proposal or offer that
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to result in, any Alternative
Proposal, or (ii) enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any Person any non-public information regarding
Partnership GP, the Partnership or their Subsidiaries with respect to, or
that could reasonably be expected to lead to, or in connection with or for the
purpose of encouraging or facilitating, any Alternative Proposal.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 7.3_,
if at any time following the execution of this Agreement and prior to
obtaining the Partnership Unitholder Approval, (i) either Partnership GP or
the Partnership has received an unsolicited written Alternative Proposal that
the Partnership Board believes is _bona fide_ , and that did not result from
a breach of this _Section 7.3_, and (ii) the Partnership Board, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, determines
in good faith that such Alternative Proposal could reasonably result in a
Superior Proposal, then the Partnership may, subject to _clauses (x)_ and
_(y)_ below, (A) furnish information, including non-public information, with
respect to the Partnership and its Subsidiaries to, and afford access to the
business, properties, books and records of the Partnership and its
Subsidiaries, to the Person making such Alternative Proposal and such Persons
Representatives and (B) enter into and participate in discussions
or negotiations with the Person making such Alternative Proposal and its
Representatives; provided that (x) (I) promptly following (and in any event
within twenty-four (24) hours) of the Partnership first furnishing any such
non-public information to, or first entering into discussions

 



67  or negotiations with, such Person, the Partnership shall give Parent written
notice of such action, including the identity of such Person, and (II) prior
to furnishing any such non-public information, the Partnership shall have
received from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement with

promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) following execution
and (y) the Partnership will promptly (and in any event within 24 hours)
provide to Parent any non-public information about the Partnership and its
Subsidiaries that was not previously provided or made available to Parent
following the provision of any such non-public information to such other
Person.

(c) In addition to the other obligations of the Partnership set forth in this
_Section 7.3_, the Partnership will promptly (and in no event later than
twenty-four (24) hours after receipt) (i) advise Parent in writing of any
Alternative Proposal (and any changes thereto) that it receives and the
material terms and conditions of any such Alternative Proposal, including the
identity of such Person making such Alternative Proposal, and (ii) if in
writing, provide Parent a copy of any such Alternative Proposal.
The Partnership will keep Parent reasonably informed of the status and
material terms and conditions of such Alternative Proposal and any material
modification thereto, including if in writing, providing Parent with a copy
thereof. The Partnership Entities agree that neither the Partnership nor any
of its Subsidiaries will enter into any agreement with any Person which
prohibits the Partnership from providing any information to Parent in
accordance with this _Section 7.3_.

 

(d) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 7.3_, the Partnership Board
shall not (i): (A) change, withdraw, withhold, modify or qualify, or publicly
propose to withdraw, modify or qualify, in each case, in any manner adverse to
Parent, the Partnership Board Recommendation, (B) fail to include the
Partnership Board Recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement, (C) fail to
reaffirm (publicly, if so requested by Parent) the Partnership Board
Recommendation within five (5) Business Days after the date of any Alternative
Proposal (or material modification thereto) is publicly disclosed by
the Partnership or the Person making such Alternative Proposal (except for a
tender or exchange offer, which shall be governed by clause (D)), (D) fail to
announce publicly within the ten (10) Business Days period (as specified in
Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act) after a tender offer or exchange offer
relating to the Partnership Units shall have been commenced that the
Partnership Board recommends rejection of such tender offer or exchange offer
and reaffirming the Partnership Board Recommendation; or (E) publicly approve
or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, recommend or enter into, any
Alternative Proposal (any action described in this _Section 7.3(d)_ being
referred to as a " _Partnership Change in Recommendation_ "); or (ii)
approve, adopt or allow Partnership GP, the Partnership or any of their
Subsidiaries or the Spin-Off Companies to execute or enter into, any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement, or other similar contract or any tender or
exchange offer providing for, with respect to, or in connection with, any
Alternative Proposal. For the avoidance of doubt, a public statement that
describes the Partnerships receipt of an Alternative Proposal and the
operation of this Agreement with respect thereto shall not be deemed a
Partnership Change in Recommendation.

 



68 (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if (i) the
Partnership receives a written, unsolicited Alternative Proposal (and such
proposal is not withdrawn) that the Partnership Board believes is _bona fide_
, (ii) such Alternative Proposal did not result, directly or indirectly, from
a breach of this  _Section 7.3_, and (iii) the Partnership Board determines,
after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that
such Alternative Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, then the
Partnership Board may at any time prior to obtaining the Partnership
Unitholder Approval, effect a Partnership Change in Recommendation or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(j)_; _provided_ , _however_
, that the Partnership Board may not take such action pursuant to the
foregoing unless:

(i) the Partnership has provided prior written notice to Parent specifying in
reasonable detail the reasons for such action (including a description of the
material terms of such Superior Proposal and delivering to Parent a copy of
the proposed definitive agreement providing for the Alternative Proposal for
such Superior Proposal in the form to be entered into and any other relevant
proposed transaction agreements, at least seventy-two (72) hours in advance of
its intention to effect a Partnership Change in Recommendation or terminate
this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 9.1(j)_, unless at the time such notice
is otherwise required to be given there are less than seventy-two (72) hours
prior to the Partnership Meeting, in which case the Partnership will provide
as much notice as is reasonably practicable (the period inclusive of all such
hours, the " _Notice Period_ ") (it being understood and agreed that any
material amendment to the terms of a Superior Proposal shall require a new
notice pursuant to this  _Section 7.3(e)(i)_ and a new Notice Period, except
that the Notice Period shall be reduced to forty-eight (48) hours (or if there
are less than forty-eight (48) hours prior to the Partnership Meeting, as much
notice as is reasonably practicable)); and

(ii) during the Notice Period the Partnership has negotiated with Parent in
good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Superior Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal.

 

(f) The Partnership Board is permitted, at any time prior to obtaining the
Partnership Unitholder Approval, other than in connection with an Alternative
Proposal, to make a Partnership Change in Recommendation in response to a
Partnership Intervening Event but only if (i) prior to taking any such action,
the Partnership Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
the Partnerships outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action
would result in a breach of its duties under applicable Law, the Existing
Partnership Agreement or the Partnership GP Agreement, (ii) the Partnership
has given at least seventy-two (72) hours advance written notice to Parent
that the Partnership Board intends to take such action (which notice shall
specify in reasonable detail the reasons for such action) and (iii) during
such period the Partnership has negotiated with Parent in good faith (to the
extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so as to permit the Partnership Board not to make
a Partnership Change in Recommendation. A " _Partnership Intervening Event_ "
means a material event, circumstance, state of facts, occurrence, development
or change that did not exist or was not known to the Partnership Board on the
date of this Agreement (or if known, the consequences of which were not known
by the Partnership Board as of the date of this Agreement), which event,
circumstance, state of facts, occurrence, development or change, or any
material consequences thereof, (i) becomes known to the 

 



69  Partnership Board prior to the receipt of the Partnership Unitholder
Approval and (ii) does not relate to an Alternative Proposal; _ provided_,
_however_ , that (x) no event, circumstance, state of facts, occurrence,
development or change arising from any action or omission by Partnership GP,
the Partnership or any of their Subsidiaries or the Spinoff Companies that is
required to be taken or omitted by this Agreement, including any action taken
or omission made with respect to the obtaining of the necessary consents and
approvals pursuant to _Sections 7.1_ and _7.10_ may give rise to a Partnership
Intervening Event and (y) if the Partnership Intervening Event relates to an
event, circumstance, state of facts, occurrence, development or change
involving Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, then such event, circumstance,
state of facts, occurrence, development or change shall not constitute a
Partnership Intervening Event unless it has a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement will prevent the Partnership or the
Partnership Board from taking and disclosing to the Partnership Unitholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act (or any similar communication to the Partnership Unitholders) or
from making any legally required disclosure to Partnership Unitholders; _
provided_, _however_ , that the Partnership Board shall not make a
Partnership Change in Recommendation except in accordance with _Section
7.3(e)_ or _7.3(f)_. Any "stop-look-and-listen" communication by the
Partnership or the Partnership Board to the Partnership Unitholders
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communication to the Partnership Unitholders) will not be considered a
Partnership Change in Recommendation.

 

(h) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Alternative Proposal_ " means any unsolicited proposal or offer from
any Person or "group" (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act),
other than Parent and its Subsidiaries, relating to any (A) direct or indirect
acquisition (whether in a single transaction or a series of related
transactions, and whether through a tender offer, exchange offer, merger,
consolidation, unit exchange, share exchange, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other transaction), of assets of
the Partnership and its Subsidiaries equal to 20% or more of the
combined assets of the Partnership and its Subsidiaries or to which 20% or
more of the combined revenues or earnings of the Partnership and its
Subsidiaries are attributable, (B) direct or indirect acquisition (whether in
a single transaction or a series of related transactions, and whether through
a tender offer, exchange offer, merger, consolidation, unit exchange, share
exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or
other transaction) of beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Section
13(d) of the Exchange Act) of 20% or more of the equity securities of the
Partnership GP or securities of the Partnership representing 20% or more of
the voting power of the securities of the Partnership.

 

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means an unsolicited written offer to acquire,
directly or indirectly, (a) 75% or more of the outstanding equity securities
of APL GP or securities of the Partnership representing 75% or more of the
voting power of the securities of the Partnership, (b) 75% or more of the
combined assets of the Partnership and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or
(c) 75% or more of the combined assets of the Partnership and its Subsidiaries
and the Spin-Off Companies, taken as a whole, in each case of (a) through (c),
either with or without the Spin-Off Transaction, and on terms and conditions
which the

 



70  Partnership Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, to be more favorable from a
financial point of view to the Partnership Unitholders than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, taking into account at the time of
determination such matters the Partnership Board deems relevant, including the
legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such offer (including
conditions to and expected timing and risks of consummation and the ability of
the party making such proposal to obtain financing for such Acquisition
Proposal, as applicable) and any changes to the terms of this Agreement that
as of that time had been committed to by Parent in writing.

7.4 _Change in Recommendation by Parent_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 7.4_, the Parent Board
shall not: (A) change, withdraw, withhold, modify or qualify, or publicly
propose to withdraw, modify or qualify, in each case, in any manner adverse to
Partnership, the Parent Board Recommendation, or (B) fail to include the
Parent Board Recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement (any
action described in this _Section 7.4(a)_ being referred to as a " _Parent
Change in Recommendation_ ").

(b) The Parent Board is permitted, at any time prior to obtaining the Parent
Stockholders Approval, to make a Parent Change in Recommendation in response
to a Parent Intervening Event but only if (i) prior to taking any such action,
the Parent Board determines in good faith, after consultation with Parents
outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would result in a
breach of its duties under applicable Law, (ii) the Parent has given at least
seventy-two (72) hours advance written notice to Partnership that the Parent
Board intends to take such action (which notice shall specify in reasonable
detail the reasons for such action) and (iii) during such period Parent has
negotiated with the Partnership in good faith (to the extent Partnership
desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of
this Agreement so as to permit the Parent Board not to make a Parent Change in
Recommendation. A " _Parent Intervening Event_ " means a material event,
circumstance, state of facts, occurrence, development or change that did not
exist or was not known to the Parent Board on the date of this Agreement (or
if known, the consequences of which were not known by the Parent Board as of
the date of this Agreement), which event, circumstance, state of facts,
occurrence, development or change, or any material consequences thereof,
becomes known to the Parent Board prior to receipt of the Parent Stockholder
Approval; _provided, however_ , that (x) no event, circumstance, state of
facts, occurrence, development or change arising from any action or omission
by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that is required to be taken or omitted
by this Agreement, including any action taken or omission made with respect to
the obtaining of the necessary consents and approvals pursuant to _Sections
7.1_ and _7.10_ may give rise to a Parent Intervening Event and (y) if the
Parent Intervening Event relates to an event, circumstance, state of facts,
occurrence, development or change involving Partnership or any of its
Subsidiaries, then such event, circumstance, state of facts, occurrence,
development or change shall not constitute a Parent Intervening Event unless
it has a Partnership Material Adverse Effect.

 

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement will prevent the Parent or the Parent
Board from taking and disclosing to the Parent Stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange
Act (or any similar communication to the Parent Stockholders) or from making
any legally required disclosure to the Parent

 



71  Stockholders; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Parent Board shall not make
a Parent Change in Recommendation except in accordance with _Section 7.4(b)_.
Any "stop-look-and-listen" communication by the Parent or Parent Board to the
Parent Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange
Act (or any similar communication to the Parent Stockholders) will not be
considered a Parent Change in Recommendation.

7.5 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws, each Party shall,
and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to afford to the Other Parties and
their respective Representatives reasonable access during normal business
hours (and, with respect to books and records, the right to copy) to all of
its and its Subsidiaries properties, commitments, books, contracts, records
and correspondence (in each case, whether in physical or electronic form),
officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other
Representatives throughout the period prior to the earlier of the Effective
Time and the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_. Each
Party shall furnish promptly to the Other Parties (i) a copy of each report,
schedule and other document filed or submitted by it pursuant to the
requirements of federal or state securities Laws and a copy of any
communication (including "comment letters") received by such Party from the
SEC concerning compliance with securities Laws and (ii) all other information
concerning its and its Subsidiaries business, properties and personnel as
the Other Parties may reasonably request, including information necessary to
prepare the Joint Proxy Statement and the Registration Statement. Except for
disclosures permitted by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, each
Party and its Representatives shall hold information received from the Other
Parties pursuant to this _Section 7.5_ in confidence in accordance with the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(b) This _Section 7.5_ shall not require any Party to permit any access, or
to disclose any information, if such access or disclosure would unreasonably
disrupt the operations of such Party and its Subsidiaries or, in the
reasonable, good faith judgment (after consultation with counsel, which may be
in-house counsel) of such Party would reasonably be expected to result in (i)
any violation of any contract or Law to which such Party or its Subsidiaries
is a party or would cause a loss of privilege to such Party or any of its
Subsidiaries or (ii) if such Party or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one
hand, and any Other Party or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, are
adverse parties in a litigation, such information being reasonably pertinent
thereto; _provided_ that, in the case of  _clause (i)_, the Parties shall
cooperate in seeking to find a way to allow disclosure of such information to
the extent doing so (1) would not (in the good faith belief of the Party being
requested to disclose the information (after consultation with counsel, which
may be in-house counsel)) reasonably be likely to result in the violation of
any such contract or Law or cause a loss of such privilege or (2) could
reasonably (in the good faith belief of the Party being requested to disclose
the information (after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house
counsel)) be managed through the use of customary "clean-room" arrangements
pursuant to which non-employee Representatives of the Other Party shall be
provided access to such information; provided, further, that the Party being
requested to disclose the information shall (x) notify the Other Parties that
such disclosures are reasonably likely to violate its or its Subsidiaries
obligations under any such contract or Law or cause a loss of such privilege
and (y) communicate to the Other Parties in reasonable detail the facts
giving rise to such notification and the subject matter of such information
(to the extent it is able to do so in

 



72  accordance with the first proviso in this _Section 7.5(b)_) and (z) in the
case where such disclosures are reasonably likely to violate its or its
Subsidiaries obligations under any contract, use reasonable commercial
efforts to seek consent from the applicable third party to any such contract
with respect to the disclosures prohibited thereby (to the extent not
otherwise expressly prohibited by the terms of such contract).

7.6 _Public Statements_. The initial press releases with respect to the
execution of this Agreement shall each be reasonably agreed upon by Parent
and the Partnership. Except (a) with respect to the Spin-Off Transaction and
the Spin-Off Companies, (b) following any Partnership Change of Recommendation
or Parent Change of Recommendation, Parent and the Partnership will not, and
each of the foregoing will cause its Representatives not to, issue any public
announcements or make other public disclosures regarding this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, without the prior written approval of the
Parties; _provided, however_ , that a Party or its Representatives may issue a
public announcement or other public disclosures required by Law or the rules
of any stock exchange upon which such Partys or its Parent entitys capital
stock is traded, provided such Party uses reasonable best efforts to afford
the Other Party an opportunity to first review the content of the proposed
disclosure and provide reasonable comment regarding same.

 

7.7 _Confidentiality_. The obligations of Parent and the Partnership under the
Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance
with its terms and all information provided to any Party or its
Representatives pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement is deemed to
be "Evaluation Material" as defined under the Confidentiality Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in the Confidentiality Agreement shall
be deemed to restrict the performance by the Partnership Entities or the
Parent Entities of their respective obligations under this Agreement, and in
the case of any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall control.

 

7.8 _Takeover Laws_. Neither the Partnership nor Parent will take any action
that would cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the APL
Merger Agreement to be subject to requirements imposed by any Takeover Laws,
and each of them will take all reasonable steps within its control to exempt
(or ensure the continued exemption of) the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement from the Takeover Laws of any state that purport to apply to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

7.9 _New Common Shares Listed_. Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to
list, prior to the Closing, on the NYSE, upon official notice of issuance,
the New Common Shares.

7.10 _Third-Party Approvals_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent and the
Partnership and their respective Subsidiaries will cooperate and use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to prepare all documentation, to
effect all filings, to obtain all permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all Governmental Authorities and third parties necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to comply with
the terms and conditions of such permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations and to cause the

 



73  Merger to be consummated as expeditiously as practicable. Each of Parent and
the Partnership has the right to review in advance, and to the extent
practicable each will consult with the other, in each case subject to
applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, with respect to, all
material written information submitted to any third party or any Governmental
Authorities in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the Parties agrees
to act reasonably and promptly. Each Party agrees that it will consult with
the Other Parties with respect to the obtaining of all material permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental
Authorities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and each Party will keep the Other Parties apprised of the
status of material matters relating to completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

(b) Each of Parent and the Partnership agrees, upon request, to furnish the
Other Party with all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries,
directors, officers and unitholders and such other matters as may be
reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Joint Proxy
Statement, the Registration Statement or any filing, notice or application
made by or on behalf of such Other Party or any of such Other Partys
Subsidiaries to any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

(c) This _Section 7.10_ shall not apply to (i) approval under Antitrust Laws
or (ii) approval of the SEC of the Registration Statement and Joint Proxy
Statement.

7.11 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any director, officer,
trustee, employee, agent, or fiduciary may have under any employment
or indemnification agreement or under the Existing Partnership Agreement,
this Agreement or, if applicable, similar organizational documents or
agreements of any of the Partnerships Subsidiaries, from and after the
Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Entity, jointly and severally, will:
(i) indemnify and hold harmless each Person who is now, or has been or becomes
at any time prior to the Effective Time, an officer, director or employee of
any of the Retained Companies and also with respect to any such Person, in
their capacity as a director, officer, employee, member, trustee or fiduciary
of another corporation, foundation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension
or other employee benefit plan or enterprise (whether or not such other
entity or enterprise is affiliated with the Partnership) serving at the
request of or on behalf of any of the Retained Companies and together with
such Persons heirs, executors or administrators (collectively, the "
_Indemnified Parties_ ") to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by
applicable Law in connection with any Claim or Action against any losses,
claims, damages, liabilities, costs, Indemnification Expenses,
judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all
interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or
in respect of any thereof) resulting therefrom; and (ii) promptly pay on
behalf of or, within 15 days after any request for advancement, advance to
each of the Indemnified Parties, any Indemnification Expenses incurred in
defending, serving as a witness with respect to or otherwise participating
with respect to any Claim or Action in advance of the final disposition of
such Claim or Action, including payment on behalf of or advancement to the
Indemnified Party of any Indemnification Expenses incurred by such Indemnified
Party in connection with enforcing any rights with respect to
such indemnification or advancement, in each case without the requirement of
any bond or other

 



74  security. The indemnification and advancement obligations of Parent and the
Surviving Entity pursuant to this _Section 7.11(a)_ extend to acts or
omissions occurring at or before the Effective Time and any Claim or Action
relating thereto (including with respect to any acts or omissions occurring in
connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the APL Merger
Agreement, including the consideration and approval thereof and the process
undertaken in connection therewith and any Claim or Action relating thereto),
and all rights to indemnification and advancement conferred hereunder
continue as to any Indemnified Party who has ceased to be a director or
officer of the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries after the date of this
Agreement and inure to the benefit of such Persons heirs, executors and
personal and legal representatives. As used in this _Section 7.11_: (x) the
term " _Claim_ " means any threatened, asserted, pending or completed action
or proceeding, whether instituted by any Party, any Governmental Authority or
any other Person, that any Indemnified Party in good faith believes might lead
to the institution of any action or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative, investigative or other, including any arbitration or other
alternative dispute resolution mechanism (" _Action_ "), arising out of or
pertaining to matters that relate to such Indemnified Partys duties or
service as a director or officer of Partnership GP or of any of the
Partnerships Subsidiaries or as a trustee of (or in a similar capacity with)
any compensation and benefit plan of any thereof; (y) the term "
_Indemnification Expenses_ " means documented out-of-pocket attorneys fees
and expenses and all other reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs,
expenses and obligations (including experts fees, travel expenses, court
costs, retainers, transcript fees, duplicating, printing and binding costs, as
well as telecommunications, postage and courier charges) paid or incurred in
connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating
in (including on appeal), or preparing to investigate, defend, be a witness in
or participate in, any Claim for which indemnification is sought pursuant to
this _Section 7.11(a)_, including any Action relating to a claim for
indemnification or advancement brought by an Indemnified Party; and (z) the
phrase "to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by applicable Law"
includes, but is not limited to (1) to the fullest extent authorized or
permitted by any provision of the DRULPA and the DLLCA that authorizes or
permits additional indemnification by agreement or otherwise, or the
corresponding provision of any amendment to or replacement of the DRULPA and
the DLLCA and (2) to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by any
amendments to or replacements of the DRULPA and the DLLCA adopted after the
date of this Agreement that increase the extent to which an entity may
indemnify its directors, officers, trustees, employees, agents, or fiduciaries
or Persons serving in any capacity in which any Indemnified Party serves. Any
amendment, alteration or repeal of the DRULPA or the DLLCA that adversely
affects any right of any Indemnified Party will be prospective only and does
not limit or eliminate any such right with respect to any Claim or Action
involving any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or omission to
act that took place prior to such amendment or repeal. Neither Parent nor the
Surviving Entity will settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment in any actual or threatened Claim or Action in respect of
which indemnification has been or could be sought by such Indemnified Party
hereunder unless such settlement, compromise or judgment includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out
of such Claim or Action without admission or finding of wrongdoing, or such
Indemnified Party otherwise consents thereto.

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub agree that all
rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from
liabilities for acts or

 



75  omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor
of the Indemnitees as provided in the Existing Partnership Agreement (or, as
applicable, the charter, bylaws, partnership agreement, limited liability
company agreement, or other organizational documents of any of the
Partnerships Subsidiaries) and indemnification agreements (including, without
limitation, the Director and Officer Indemnification Agreements) of
Partnership GP, the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries will be assumed by
the Surviving Entity and Parent in the Merger, without further action, at the
Effective Time and will survive the Merger and continue in full force
and effect in accordance with their terms.

(c) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent will maintain in
effect the current directors and officers liability and fiduciary liability
insurance policies covering the Indemnified Parties (but may substitute
therefor other policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing
terms and conditions that are no less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties
so long as that substitution does not result in gaps or lapses in coverage or
are alleged to have occurred) with respect to matters occurring on or before
the Effective Time, but Parent is not required to pay annual premiums in
excess of 300% of the last annual premiums paid therefor prior to the date of
this Agreement (the " _Maximum Amount_ ") and will purchase the maximum amount
of coverage that can be obtained for that amount if the coverage described in
this _Section 7.11(c)_ would cost in excess of that amount. If the
Partnership elects, then it may, on or prior to the Effective Time, purchase a
"tail policy" with respect to acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have
occurred prior to the Effective Time that were committed or alleged to have
been committed by such Indemnified Parties in their capacity as such;
_provided_ that in no event shall the cost of such policy, if purchased by
the Partnership, exceed six times the Maximum Amount and, if such a "tail
policy" is purchased, neither Parent nor the Surviving Entity shall have any
further obligations under this _Section 7.11(c)_.

 

(d) If Parent, the Surviving Entity or any of their respective successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with or into any other Person and is
not the continuing or surviving corporation, partnership or other entity of
such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision will be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Entity assume the obligations set forth in
this _Section 7.11_.

 

(e) Parent will cause the Surviving Entity to perform all of the obligations
of the Surviving Entity under this _Section 7.11_.

 

(f) This _Section 7.11_ survives the consummation of the Merger and is
intended to be for the benefit of, and to be enforceable by, the Indemnified
Parties and the Indemnitees and their respective heirs and personal
representatives, and will be binding on Parent, the Surviving Entity and their
respective successors and assigns.

 

7.12 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Partnership shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Partnership, to
the extent in each case it obtains Knowledge thereof of (i) any notice or
other communication received by such Party from any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or from any
Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, if the subject matter of
such communication or the failure of

 



76  such Party to obtain such consent would reasonably be expected to be
material to the Partnership or Parent, (ii) any actions, suits, claims,
investigations or proceedings commenced or threatened against, relating to or
involving or otherwise affecting such Party or any of its Subsidiaries and
that relate to the Merger, (iii) the discovery of any fact or circumstance
that, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-
occurrence of which, would result in the failure to be satisfied of any of the
conditions to the Closing in _Article VIII_ and (iv) any material failure of
such Party to comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it hereby which would result in the failure to be
satisfied of any of the conditions to the Closing in _Article VIII_;
_provided_ that, in the case of  _clauses (iii)_ and _(iv)_ , the failure to
comply with this _Section 7.12_ shall not result in the failure to be
satisfied of any of the conditions to the Closing in _Article VIII_, or give
rise to any right to terminate this Agreement under _Article IX_, if the
underlying fact, circumstance, event or failure would not in and of itself
give rise to such failure or right.

 

7.13 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the
Partnership will take all such steps as may be required (to the extent
permitted under applicable Law) to cause any dispositions of Partnership Units
(including derivative securities with respect to Partnership Units) resulting
from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who
is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
with respect to the Partnership, or will become subject to such reporting
requirements with respect to Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act.

7.14 _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) For a period of twelve (12) months following the Effective Time, Parent
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, provide each Midstream Business
Employee as of the Closing Date (collectively, the " _Continuing Employees_ ")
with (i) a base salary or wage rate, as applicable, and a target bonus
opportunity that is no less favorable than such Continuing Employees base
salary or wage rate, as applicable, and target bonus opportunity as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) other employee benefits that
are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the employee benefits provided
by Parent or its Subsidiaries to their similarly situation employees
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Without limiting the foregoing,
Parent shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, provide each Continuing
Employee whose employment is terminated without cause within the twelve (12)
months following the Effective Time, with severance in an amount that is no
less than such Continuing Employees annual base salary as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time less the amount of any base salary or wages paid
to such employee during the period between the Closing Date and the date of
such Continuing Employees termination of employment.

 

(b) Effective as of the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause its
Affiliates to, cause each compensation or employee benefit plan maintained by
Parent or any of its Affiliates and in which any Continuing Employee becomes
eligible to participate in (each, a " _New Plan_ "), to treat the prior
service of such Continuing Employee with Partnership and its Affiliates as
service rendered to Parent or its Affiliates, as the case may be, for all
purposes (including vesting, eligibility, level of benefit and benefit accrual
purposes, but other than for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined
benefit plan or retiree welfare plan) to the extent that such service
crediting does not violate any applicable Law or result in duplication of
benefits

 



77  for the same period of service. In addition, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, (i) each Continuing Employee shall be immediately
eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans
and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee, Parent shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause, to the extent allowable under
Applicable Law and the New Plans, (A) all pre-existing condition exclusions
and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, unless and to the
extent the individual, immediately prior to entry in the New Plans, was
subject to such conditions under the comparable Partnership Employee Benefit
Plans in which such Continuing Employees participated immediately before the
Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), and (B) cause
any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her
covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending
on the date such Continuing Employees participation in the corresponding New
Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the
applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such
New Plan.

(c) The Partnership shall have the right, on or prior to December 15, 2014,
to pay to each Employee a cash bonus in respect of the full 2014 calendar
year, which bonus shall be paid at no more than 1.5 times target level in the
aggregate for all Employees, with no Employee with satisfactory performance
ratings receiving less than his or her target percentage prorated for time
worked. Awards to individuals will be allocated in a fair and reasonable
manner based on performance ratings. 

(d) Without limiting the generality of _Section 7.14(b)_, effective no later
than 30 days after the Closing Date, Parent shall establish participation by
the Continuing Employees in Parents tax-qualified defined contribution plan
or plans with a cash or deferred feature (the " _Parent 401(k) Plan_ ") for
the benefit of each Continuing Employee who, as of immediately prior to the
Closing Date, was eligible to participate in the Partnership 401(k) Plan.
Parent shall cause the trustee of the Parent 401(k) Plan to accept from the
Partnership 401(k) Plan (as assumed by SpinCo pursuant to the Employee
Matters Agreement) the transfer of the account balances in kind (including
promissory notes evidencing the transfer of outstanding loans) of Continuing
Employees in accordance with the Employee Matters Agreement.

 

(e) Parent shall take all actions necessary or appropriate so that, effective
as of the Closing Date, (i) the account balances (whether positive or
negative) (the " _Transferred Cafeteria Plan Balances_ ") under the applicable
flexible spending plan of the Spin-Off Companies (collectively, the " _SpinCo
Cafeteria Plans_ ") of the Midstream Business Employees who are participants
in the SpinCo Cafeteria Plans shall be transferred to one or more comparable
plans of Parent (collectively, the " _Parent Cafeteria Plans_ "); (ii) the
elections, contribution levels and coverage levels of such Midstream Business
Employees shall apply under the Parent Cafeteria Plans in the same manner as
under the SpinCo Cafeteria Plans; and (iii) such Midstream Business Employees
shall be reimbursed from the Parent Cafeteria Plans for claims incurred at
any time during the plan year of the SpinCo Cafeteria Plans in which the
Closing Date occurs that are submitted to the Parent Cafeteria Plan from and
after the Closing Date on the same basis and the same terms and conditions as
under the SpinCo Cafeteria Plans. As soon

 



78  as practicable after the Closing Date, and in any event within ten (10)
Business Days after the amount of the Transferred Cafeteria Plan Balances is
determined, SpinCo shall pay the Surviving Partnership the net aggregate
amount of the Transferred Cafeteria Plan Balances pursuant to the Employee
Matters Agreement, if such amount is positive, and the Surviving Partnership
shall pay SpinCo the net aggregate amount of the Transferred Cafeteria Plan
Balances, if such amount is negative.

(f) The provisions of this _Section 7.14_ are for the sole benefit of the
Parties and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or will be
construed to confer upon or give to any Person (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, any Midstream Business Employee or Continuing Employee or other
current or former Employee), other than the Parties and their respective
permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or
remedies (including with respect to the matters provided for in this _Section
7.14_) under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement. Nothing in this
_Section 7.14_ amends, or will be deemed to amend (or prevent the amendment
or termination of) any Partnership Employee Benefit Plan or any Parent
Employee Benefit Plan. Parent has no obligation to continue to employ or
retain the services of any Continuing Employee for any period of time
following the Effective Time and, except as specifically provided in this
_Section 7.14_, Parent will be entitled to modify any compensation or
benefits provided to, and any other terms or conditions of employment of, any
such employees in its absolute discretion.

 

7.15 _Transaction Litigation_. Other than any Proceeding or Action where
Parent is adverse to the Partnership, the Partnership shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any security holder
litigation against the Partnership, and/or its respective directors relating
to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (excluding the Spin-Off Transaction), and no such settlement shall
be agreed to without the prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

7.16 _Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Partnership Entities shall, and shall
cause their Subsidiaries to, and shall use their reasonable best efforts to
cause their respective Representatives to, provide all customary and
reasonable cooperation in connection with the arrangement of the financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (the " _Debt Financing_ ") as may
be reasonably requested by Parent ( _provided_ that such requested cooperation
does not unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of the
Partnership Entities and their respective Subsidiaries), including (a)
participation at reasonable times in a reasonable number of meetings,
presentations, roadshows (including customary one-on-one meetings), rating
agency and due diligence sessions with the Financing Sources and potential
lenders or investors in the Debt Financing, including direct contact between
senior management and the other representatives of the Partnership Entities
and their respective Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the actual and
potential Financing Sources and potential lenders or investors in the Debt
Financing, on the other hand, in each case with reasonable advance notice, (b)
reasonably assisting Parent and its Financing Sources in the preparation of
customary materials for rating agency presentations and lender and
investor presentations, business projections, pro forma financial statements,
bank books and other marketing documents customarily used to arrange

 



79  debt financing, and identifying any portion of the information contained
therein that would constitute material, non-public information with respect to
the Partnership Entities or any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of
their respective securities for purposes of foreign, United States federal or
state securities laws, (c) (i) furnishing Parent with the Required Information
and (ii) using reasonable best efforts to furnish any other information
regarding the Retained Companies as may be reasonable requested by Parent that
is customary or necessary for the preparation of a customary confidential
information memorandum for financings that are similar to the Debt Financing,
(d) using reasonable efforts to facilitate the granting of a security interest
(and perfection thereof) in collateral, guarantees, mortgages, other
definitive financing documents or other certificates or documents as may
reasonably be requested by Parent, including obtaining releases of existing
Liens; _provided_ , that any obligations and releases of Liens contained in
all such agreements and documents shall be subject to the occurrence of the
Effective Time and become effective no earlier than immediately following the
Effective Time, (e) to the extent requested by Parent at least ten (10) days
prior to the Effective Time, furnishing within 5 days prior to the Effective
Time all documentation and other information required by Governmental
Authorities under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering
rules and regulations, including the U.S.A. Patriot Act of 2001, but in each
case, solely as relating to the Partnership Entities and their respective
Subsidiaries, (f) assisting in the preparation of definitive financing
documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent, (g) reasonably cooperating
in satisfying the conditions precedent set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter or any definitive document relating to the Debt Financing to the extent
the satisfaction of such condition requires the cooperation of, or is within
the control of the Partnership Entities and their respective
Subsidiaries, (h) taking all corporate actions, subject to the occurrence of
the Effective Time, as reasonably requested by Parent to permit the
consummation of the Debt Financing, and (i) permitting the prospective lenders
or investors involved in the Debt Financing to conduct customary due
diligence. The Partnership hereby consents to the use of its and its
Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Debt Financing; _provided_ , that
such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended, nor reasonably
likely to, harm or disparage the Partnership Entities or any of their
respective Subsidiaries.

(b) If, prior to the Effective Time, Parent decides to commence a tender
offer and/or consent solicitation in respect of some or all of the outstanding
Partnership Senior Notes (each, a " _Debt Offer_ "), Parent shall prepare all
necessary and appropriate documentation in connection with such Debt Offers,
including the offers to purchase and consent solicitation statements, letters
of transmittal and other related documents (collectively, the " _Offer
Documents_ "). The closing and effectiveness of any tender offer shall be
expressly conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing at the Effective Time,
and none of the Partnership Senior Notes shall be required to be purchased
prior to the Effective Time. The Partnership agrees to use reasonable best
efforts to provide, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its
Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives to provide,
reasonable cooperation in connection with the preparation of the Offer
Documents and the consummation of such Debt Offers to the extent requested by
Parent, including with respect to the Partnership Entities execution of
supplemental indentures reflecting amendments to the indentures applicable to
the Partnership Senior Notes subject to any Debt Offer, to the extent
approved by any required consents of holders of such Partnership Senior Notes
(provided that either (x) the effectiveness of such supplemental indentures
shall be expressly conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing at the
Effective Time or (y) any amendments effectuated by such supplemental
indentures shall not

 



80  become operative until immediately prior to the Effective Time on the
Closing Date). All Offering Documents and all mailings to the holders of the
Partnership Senior Notes in connection with the Debt Offers shall be subject
to the prior review and comment by the Partnership and Parent and shall be
reasonably acceptable to each of them. If at any time prior to the completion
of any Debt Offer any information in the applicable Offer Documents should be
discovered by the Partnership or Parent that should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Offer Documents, so that such Offer Documents
shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other party, and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall be disseminated by Parent to the holders of the
applicable Partnership Senior Notes.

 

(c) Regardless of whether Closing occurs, (i) promptly upon the Partnership
Entities request, all reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by
the Partnership Entities, their subsidiaries and their Affiliates in
connection with assisting in the Debt Financing, the Debt Offers, or the
activities set forth in this _Section 7.16_ shall be paid or reimbursed
by Parent and (ii) Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Partnership
Entities and their Subsidiaries and their Affiliates from and against any
liability or obligation suffered or incurred by them in connection with the
Debt Financing, the Debt Offers or the activities set forth in this _Section
7.16_, and any information utilized in connection therewith (other than
historical information relating to the Partnership Entities and their
Subsidiaries provided by the Partnership Entities in writing specifically for
use in the Debt Financing offering documents or the Offer Documents).

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 7.16_ to the contrary, other
than in connection with the execution and delivery of any supplemental
indenture contemplated by clause (b) of this _Section 7.16_ and any related
officers certificates, (i) neither the Partnership Entities nor any of their
respective Subsidiaries shall be required to incur any liability in connection
with the Debt Financing or the Debt Offers prior to the Effective Time, (ii)
neither the Parent Entities or their Subsidiaries will be required to pass
resolutions or consents in connection with the Debt Financing or the Debt
Offers other than resolutions or consents adopted at the Effective Time and
(iii) none of the Partnership Entities or any of their respective
Subsidiaries shall be required to execute any definitive financing document,
including any credit or other agreement, pledge or security document, or other
certificate or document in connection with the Debt Financing
the effectiveness of which is not contingent upon the occurrence of the
Closing.

7.17 _Spin-Off Transaction_.

 

(a) Prior to Closing, (i) the Partnership shall take, or cause its
Subsidiaries to take, such actions as are necessary to form SpinCo and (if
SpinCo is a limited partnership) the general partner of SpinCo (" _SpinCo GP_
") and (ii) the Partnership, the Partnership GP, SpinCo and (if SpinCo is a
limited partnership) SpinCo GP shall enter into a Separation and Distribution
Agreement in substantially the form attached as _Annex A_ (subject to
_Section 7.17(b)(ii)_, the " _Separation Agreement_ "), pursuant to which, on
the terms and conditions set forth therein, (A) the Partnership will
contribute, transfer, assign, convey and deliver all of its direct or indirect

 



81  right, title and interest in and to the Transferred Assets (as defined in
the Separation Agreement) (the " _Transferred Assets_ ") to SpinCo, and SpinCo
shall accept, assume and agree faithfully to perform, discharge and fulfill
the Assumed Liabilities (as defined in the Separation Agreement) (the "
_Separation_ "), and (B) the Partnership will effect a distribution of SpinCo
Common Units representing a 100% limited partnership or limited liability
company interest in SpinCo to the Partnership Unitholders pursuant to a
special distribution (the " _Distribution_ " and, together with the
Separation, the " _Spin-Off Transaction_ ").

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, subject to the terms and conditions of the
Separation Agreement, the Partnership shall use its reasonable best efforts
to take promptly, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do promptly, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
Laws to consummate and make effective the Spin-Off Transaction and the other
transactions contemplated by the Separation Agreement, in coordination with
the Closing. Subject to _Section 7.17_, without the prior written consent of
Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), none of Partnership, Partnership GP, SpinCo or (if SpinCo is a
limited partnership) SpinCo GP shall (i) terminate the Separation Agreement or
(ii) amend or waive any provision of the Separation Agreement in a manner
that is materially adverse to the Partnership, Partnership GP or Parent or any
of its Affiliates or that would prevent or materially impede the consummation
of the Merger.

 

(c) The Partnership will, and will cause the Spin-Off Companies, to file with
the SEC a Form 10 with respect to the Spin-Off Transaction as soon as
practical following the date of this Agreement. The Partnership will, and will

Form 10, to be mailed to the Partnership Unitholders as promptly as practical
after such filing.

(d) Parent will cooperate with and use reasonable commercial efforts to
facilitate the Spin-Off Transaction as contemplated in the Separation
Agreement.

7.18  _Distributions_. Parent and the Partnership shall coordinate with each
other the declaration of, and the setting of record dates and payment dates
for, distributions in respect of their respective units so that, in respect of
any fiscal quarter, holders of Partnership Units do not (a) receive more than
one distribution in respect of both Partnership Units and Parent Shares
received pursuant to the Merger in exchange therefor, or (b) fail to receive a
distribution in respect of one of either Partnership Units or Parent Shares
received pursuant to the Merger in exchange therefor.

7.19 _Control of Operations_. Without in any way limiting any partys rights
or obligations under this Agreement, the parties understand and agree that (a)
nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or the Partnership,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the other partys
operations prior to the Closing and (b) prior to the Closing, each of Parent
and the Partnership shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its operations.

7.20 _Working Capital; Cash Requirements_. Notwithstanding any provision
herein to the contrary, the Partnership agrees to cause the Partnership to
have, as of the Effective Time

 



82  and after giving effect to the Spin-Off Transaction (i) unrestricted cash
balances in the accounts of and belonging to the Partnership and its
Subsidiaries (other than APL and its Subsidiaries) equal to at least
$5,000,000 and (ii) net working capital (including the unrestricted cash
described in clause (i)) of no less than $5,000,000. From and after the date
of this Agreement, the Partnership agrees that, unless otherwise approved by
Parent in writing, no cash distributions will be made by APL or any of its
Subsidiaries to the Partnership or Partnership GP or any other Retained
Company; _provided_ , that this provision will not restrict cash
transfers among APL and its Subsidiaries or restrict distributions in the
ordinary course to the Partnership in respect of its holdings of general
partner interests, limited partner interests and incentive distribution rights
in the Partnership.

 

7.21 _Pre-Closing Payments by Parent_. Immediately prior to the Closing,
Parent shall, or shall cause one of its Subsidiaries to, pay to the
Partnership, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by the Partnership at least three (3) Business Days prior to the

prior to the Closing as follows:

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Partnership and Parent;

(b) by the Partnership or Parent if there is in effect a final nonappealable
order of a Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby; _provided_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement
under this  _Section 9.1(b)_ is not available to the Partnership, on the one
hand, or Parent, on the other hand, if such order was due, in whole or in
part, to the failure of the Partnership, on the one hand, or any of Parent or
Merger Sub, on the other hand, to perform any of its obligations under this
Agreement;

(c) by Parent if the Partnership has breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform if it was continuing as of the
Closing Date would result in the failure of the 

 



85  conditions set forth in _Sections 8.3(a)_ or _(b)_ to be satisfied and
such breach or failure to perform is incapable of being cured or, if capable
of being cured, is not cured by the earlier of (x) the Outside Date or (y)
within 30 days following receipt by the Partnership of written notice of such
breach or failure from Parent; _provided_ that if such breach or failure to
perform is capable of being cured by the Partnership by the Outside Date,
such thirty day cure period shall be extended until the second Business Day
prior to the Outside Date solely to the extent during such period the
Partnership is using its reasonable best efforts to cure such breach or
failure to perform; _ provided_, _further_ that Parent shall not have the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(c)_ if Parent
is then in material breach of any of its representations, warranties,

other party up to a date not beyond August 31, 2015, the latest of any of

(iii) the Partnership or one of its Subsidiaries enters into a definitive
agreement with respect to, or consummates, an Alternative Proposal within 12
months after the date this Agreement is terminated, then the Partnership will
pay to Parent an amount equal to the Termination Fee  _minus_ the Expenses
previously paid by the Partnership to Parent, upon the earlier of the public
announcement that the Partnership or one of its Subsidiaries has entered into
such definitive agreement or the consummation of any such transaction. For
purposes of this _Section 9.4(a)_, the term "Alternative Proposal" has the
meaning assigned to such term in _Section 7.3(h)(i)_, except that the
references to "20% or more" are deemed to be references to "50% or more."

(b) In the event that (i) a Parent Alternative Proposal is publicly submitted,
publicly proposed or publicly disclosed prior to, and not withdrawn at the
time of, the date of the Parent Meeting and (ii) this Agreement is terminated

one of its Subsidiaries enters into a definitive agreement with respect to,
or consummates, a Parent Alternative Proposal within 12 months after the date
this Agreement is terminated, then Parent or one of its Subsidiaries will pay
to the Partnership an amount equal to the Termination Fee _minus_ the
Expenses previously paid by Parent to the Partnership, upon the earlier of the
public announcement that Parent has entered into such definitive agreement or
the consummation of any such transaction.

 



87 (c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the
Partnership pursuant to Section 9.1(k) and APL becomes obligated to pay a
"termination fee" under _Section 9.4(a)_ or _(c)_ of the APL Merger
Agreement, the Partnership shall, concurrent with the payment of such
"termination fee" by APL, pay fifty percent (50%) of the Termination Fee.

(d) In the event this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section
9.1(g)_, then the Partnership will pay to Parent, within two Business Days
after the date of termination, the Termination Fee.

 

(e) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Partnership pursuant
to _Section 9.1(i)_, then Parent will pay to the Partnership, within two
Business Days after the date of termination, the Termination Fee.

(f) In the event this Agreement is terminated by the Parent or Partnership
pursuant to _Section 9.1(f)_, then Partnership will, within two Business Days
after the date of termination, pay to Parent the Expenses.

 

(g) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the
Partnership pursuant to _Section 9.1(h)_, then Parent will, within two
Business Days after the date of termination, pay to Partnership the Expenses.

(h) In the event this Agreement is terminated by the Partnership pursuant to
_Section 9.1(j)_, then the Partnership shall pay to Parent the Termination
Fee.

(i) Any payment of the Termination Fee or Expenses (or applicable portion
thereof) will be made in cash by wire transfer of same day funds to an account
designated in writing by the recipient of such payment.

 

(j) As used herein, (i) " _Termination Fee_ " means a cash amount equal to
$53,400,000, (ii) " _Expenses_ " means a cash amount equal to $17,800,000 to
be paid in respect of the expenses of Parent or the Partnership, as
applicable, incurred in connection with the negotiation, execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the performance of the transactions
contemplated hereby. In no event will the Partnership or the Parent be
required to (i) pay the Termination Fee to the other Party on more than one
occasion or (ii) pay the Expenses to the other Party on more than one
occasion.

(k) " _Parent Alternative Proposal_ " means any unsolicited proposal or
offer from any Person or "group" (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange
Act), other than the Partnership and its Subsidiaries, relating to any (A)
direct or indirect acquisition (whether in a single transaction or a series
of related transactions, and whether through a tender offer, exchange offer,
merger, consolidation, unit exchange, share exchange, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other transaction), of assets of
Parent and its Subsidiaries equal to 50% or more of the combined assets of
Parent and its Subsidiaries or to which 50% or more of the combined revenues
or earnings of Parent and its Subsidiaries are attributable, (B) direct or
indirect acquisition (whether in a single transaction or a series of related
transactions, and whether through a tender offer, exchange offer, merger,
consolidation, unit exchange, share exchange, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other transaction) of
beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act)
of securities of Parent representing 50% or more of the voting power of the
securities of the Parent.

 



88 (l) Each of the Parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this 
_Section 9.4_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated hereby,
and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this
Agreement. Upon payment of the Termination Fee to Parent (or 50% of the
Termination Fee if that is the amount that is payable and no payment could be
payable under _Section 9.4(a)_), the Partnership and its Subsidiaries shall
not have any further liability with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby to Parent or its stockholders, except in the
case of fraud or willful and material breach, and upon payment of the
Termination Fee to the Partnership, Parent and its Subsidiaries shall not have
any further liability with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby to the Partnership or its unitholders, except in the case
of fraud or willful and material breach. The Parties acknowledge that neither
the Termination Fee (nor a 50% portion thereof) nor the Expenses are
a penalty, but rather are liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will
compensate the other Party in the circumstances in which such Termination Fee
(or a 50% portion thereof) or Expenses are payable and which do not involve
fraud or willful and material breach, for the efforts and resources expended
and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate
with precision.

90 10.6 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests

of the Other Parties, except that (i) Merger Sub may assign, in its sole

shall be null and void.

 

10.7 _Entire Understanding; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement and
the other Transaction Agreements, together with the Confidentiality Agreement
constitute the entire agreement and understanding of the Parties with respect
to the matters therein and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings
on such matters. The provisions of this Agreement are binding upon, inure to
the benefit of the Parties and, subject to _Section 10.6_, their respective
successors and assigns, and no provision of this Agreement is intended to
confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder
upon any Person other than the Parties and their respective successors and,
except (a) as provided in _Section 7.11_ (which will be to the benefit of and
enforceable by the Persons referred to in such Section), (b) following
the Effective Time, the rights of holders of Partnership Units to receive the
Merger Consideration and (c) as provided in _Section 10.14_ (which will be to
the benefit of and enforceable by the Financing Sources).

 

10.8 _Severability_. Any provision of this Agreement which is invalid, illegal
or unenforceable in any jurisdiction will, as to that jurisdiction, be
ineffective only to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability, without affecting in any way the remaining provisions hereof
in such jurisdiction or rendering that or any other provision of this
Agreement invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any other jurisdiction.

10.9 _Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) Each of the Parties irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding
with respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising
hereunder shall be brought and determined exclusively in the Court of Chancery
of the State of Delaware or, if such Court does not have subject matter
jurisdiction, to the Superior Court of the State of Delaware or, if
jurisdiction is vested exclusively in the Federal courts of the United
States, the Federal courts of the United States sitting in the State of
Delaware, and any appellate court from any such state or Federal court, and
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agree that all claims with respect to
any such claim shall be heard and determined in such Delaware court or in such
Federal court, as applicable. The Parties agree that a final judgment in any
such claim is conclusive and may be enforced in any other jurisdiction by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

 



91 (b) Each of the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest
extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now
or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any related matter in any
Delaware state or Federal court located in the State of Delaware and the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such claim in any such
court.

(c) Each of the Parties agrees that it will not, and it will not permit any
of its controlled Affiliates to, bring or support any action, cause of action,
claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind of description, whether in
law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any
Financing Source or any Financing Related Party, in any way relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the financing or the
performance thereof, in any forum other than the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of New York or, if such court does not have subject matter
jurisdiction, in any state court located in the Borough of Manhattan (and the
Parties hereto agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of, and venue in,
such court in connection therewith), and that the provisions of _Section
10.10_ relating to waiver of jury trial shall apply to such action, cause of
action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim.

10.10 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW
THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED, EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES AND COVENANTS THAT
IT WILL NOT ASSERT (WHETHER AS PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT OR OTHERWISE) ANY RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY FORUM IN RESPECT OF ANY ISSUE, CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION
OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING IN WHOLE OR IN PART UNDER, RELATED TO, BASED ON,
OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF, WHETHER
NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN TORT OR CONTRACT OR
OTHERWISE. ANY PARTY MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS
_SECTION 10.10_ WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF EACH
SUCH PARTY TO THE WAIVER OF ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

 

10.11 _No Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any
claims or causes of action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to
this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement
may only be made against the entities that are expressly identified as Parties
and no past, present or future Affiliate, director, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, manager, partner, stockholder, agent,
attorney or representative of any Party has any liability for any obligations
or liabilities of the Parties or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by
reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby.

10.12 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur and that the Parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached and it is
accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in each case, in accordance with
this _Section 10.12_ in the Delaware Court of Chancery or any state or
federal court sitting in the State of Delaware, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the

 



92  Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief as provided herein on the
basis that (x) any Party has an adequate remedy at law or (y) an award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
equity. Each Party further agrees that no Party shall be required to obtain,
furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a
condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this _Section 10.12_, and
each Party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining,
furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument. 

10.13 _Survival_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, none of the
representations, warranties, agreements and covenants contained in this
Agreement will survive the Closing or the termination of this Agreement if
this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with _Article IX_ prior to
the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Closing occurs, the
covenants and agreements of the Parties which contemplated performance after
the Effective Time or otherwise expressly by their terms survive the Effective
Time will survive the Closing and if this Agreement is terminated prior to
the Closing, the agreements of the Parties in _Sections 7.7_, _9.2_ , _9.3_
and _9.4_ , and this _Article X_ will survive such termination. The
Confidentiality Agreement shall (i) survive termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms and (ii) terminate as of the Effective Time. This
_Section 10.13_ shall not affect the rights and obligations of any party to
the Separation Agreement under such Separation Agreement.

 

10.14 _No Recourse to Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, the Partnership Entities agree, on behalf of themselves and
each of their former, current or future officers, directors, managers,
employees, members, partners, Partnership Unitholders, agents and other
representatives and controlled Affiliates (the " _Partnership Parties_ ")
that Bank of America, N.A., Merrill, Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith
Incorporated and any other arranger or lender that is or may become party to
the Debt Financing Commitment and any joinder agreements or credit agreements
relating thereto and their respective Affiliates (collectively " _Financing
Sources_ "), and each of their respective former, current or future general or
limited partners, stockholders, managers, members, officers, directors,
agents, representatives and Affiliates, and each of their successors and
assigns (collectively, " _Finance Related Parties_ ") shall be subject to no
liability or claims to the Partnership Parties in connection with the
financing of or in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, whether at law, in equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, (a) no amendment or modification to _Section 10.7(c)_,
_Section 10.9(c)_, _Section 10.10_ or this _Section 10.14_ (or amendment or
modification with respect to any related definitions as they affect  _Section
10.7(c)_, _Section 10.10_, _Section 10.9(c)_ or this _Section 10.14_) shall
be effective without the prior written consent of each Financing Source (on
behalf of themselves and the applicable Financing Related Parties), (b) no
amendment or modification to _Section 9.4_ (or any amendment or modification
with respect to any related definitions as they affect _Section 9.4_) that
would be adverse to the Financing Sources or the Financing Related Parties
shall be effective without the prior written consent of each Financing Source
(on behalf of themselves and the applicable Financing Related Parties), and
(c) each Financing Source and Financing Related Party shall be an express
third party beneficiary of, and shall have the right to enforce, _Section
9.4_, _Section 10.7(c)_, _Section 10.9(c)_, _Section 10.10_ or this
_Section 10.14_. Each of the Parties hereto agrees that _Section 10.4_
notwithstanding, this _Section 10.14_ shall be interpreted and any action
relating to this provision shall be governed by the laws of the State of New
York.

the Record Date, by means of a pro rata distribution, SpinCo Common Units
representing a 100% limited partnership interest in SpinCo, on the basis of a

amended from time to time, the " _Merger Agreement_ "), pursuant to which
TRGP Merger Sub will merge with and into Parent (the " _Merger_ "), with
Parent surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of TRGP pursuant to
the terms and conditions set forth therein; and

Time, whether as a result of the provisions of  _Section 2.4(b)_ or for any
other reason (any such Transferred Asset, a " _Delayed Transferred Asset_ "
and any such Assumed Liability, a " _Delayed Assumed Liability_ "), then,
insofar as reasonably possible and subject to applicable Law, the member of
the Parent Group retaining such Delayed Transferred Asset or such Delayed
Assumed Liability, as the case may be, shall thereafter hold such Delayed
Transferred Asset or Delayed Assumed Liability, as the case may be, for the
use and benefit of the member of the SpinCo Group entitled thereto (at the
expense of the member of the SpinCo Group entitled thereto). In addition, the
member of the Parent Group retaining such Delayed Transferred Asset or
such Delayed Assumed Liability shall, insofar as reasonably possible and to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, treat such Delayed Transferred Asset
or Delayed Assumed Liability in the ordinary course of business in accordance
with past practice. Such member of the Parent Group shall also take such
other actions as may be reasonably requested by the member of the Parent Group
to whom such Delayed Transferred Asset is to be transferred or assigned, or
which will assume such Delayed Assumed Liability, as the case may be, in
order to place such member of the SpinCo in a substantially similar position
as if such Delayed Transferred Asset or Delayed Assumed Liability had been
transferred, assigned or assumed as contemplated hereby and so that all the
benefits and burdens relating to such Delayed Transferred Asset or Delayed
Assumed Liability, as the case may be, including use, risk of loss, potential
for gain, and dominion, control and command over such Delayed Transferred
Asset or Delayed Assumed Liability, as the case may be, and all costs and
expenses related thereto, shall inure from and after the Effective Time to the
SpinCo

 



-23-  Group. SpinCo and the SpinCo Group will indemnify and hold harmless the
Parent and Parent Group from and against any Liabilities arising out of or
relating to Parent or the Parent Group retaining and holding such Delayed
Transferred Asset.

(d) _Transfer of Delayed Transferred Assets and Delayed Assumed Liabilities_.
If and when the Approvals or Notifications, the absence of which caused the
deferral of transfer or assignment of any Delayed Transferred Asset or the
deferral of assumption of any Delayed Assumed Liability pursuant to  _Section
2.4(b)_, are obtained or made, and, if and when any other legal impediments
for the transfer or assignment of any Delayed Transferred Asset or the
assumption of any Delayed Assumed Liability have been removed, the transfer
or assignment of the applicable Delayed Transferred Asset or the assumption
of the applicable Delayed Assumed Liability, as the case may be, shall be
effected in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and/or the applicable
Ancillary Agreement. 

(e) _Approvals and Notifications for Retained Assets_. To the extent that the
transfer or assignment of any Retained Asset or the assumption of any
Retained Liability requires any Approvals or Notifications, the Parties shall
use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain or make such Approvals or
Notifications as soon as reasonably practicable;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, except to the extent expressly provided in this Agreement or any of the
Ancillary Agreements or as otherwise agreed between Parent and SpinCo, neither
Parent nor SpinCo shall be obligated to contribute capital or pay any
consideration in any form (including providing any letter of credit, guaranty
or other financial accommodation) to any Person in order to obtain or make
such Approvals or Notifications, other than reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses, attorneys fees and recording or similar fees.

(f) _Delayed Retained Transfers_. If and to the extent that the valid,
complete and perfected transfer or assignment to the Parent Group of any
Retained Asset or assumption by the Parent Group of any Retained Liability
would be a violation of applicable Law or require any Approval or Notification
that has not been obtained or made by the Effective Time then, unless the
Parties mutually shall otherwise determine, the transfer or assignment to the
Parent Group of such Retained Assets or the assumption by the Parent Group of
such Retained Liabilities, as the case may be, shall be automatically deemed
deferred and any such purported transfer, assignment or assumption shall be
null and void until such time as all legal impediments are removed or such
Approval or Notification has been obtained or made. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any such Retained Assets or Retained Liabilities shall continue to
constitute Retained Assets and Retained Liabilities for all other purposes of
this Agreement, and the Parties shall remain responsible and obligated with
respect to any such Transferred Assets and Assumed Liabilities under the
indemnification obligations set forth in Article IV.

 

(g) _Treatment of Delayed Retained Assets and Delayed Retained Liabilities_.
If any transfer or assignment of any Retained Asset or any assumption of any
Retained Liability intended to be transferred, assigned or assumed hereunder,
as the case may be, is not consummated on or prior to the Effective Time
whether as a result of 

 



-24-  the provisions of this _Section 2.4(g)_ or for any other reason (any such
Retained Asset, a " _Delayed Retained Asset_ " and any such Retained
Liability, a " _Delayed Retained Liability_ "), then, insofar as reasonably
possible, the member of the SpinCo Group retaining such Delayed Retained Asset
or such Delayed Retained Liability, as the case may be, shall thereafter hold
such Delayed Retained Asset or Delayed Retained Liability, as the case may
be, for the use and benefit of the member of the Parent Group entitled thereto
(at the expense of the member of the Parent Group entitled thereto). In
addition, the member of the SpinCo Group retaining such Delayed Retained
Asset or such Delayed Retained Liability shall, insofar as reasonably possible
and to the extent permitted by applicable Law, treat such Delayed Retained
Asset or Delayed Retained Liability in the ordinary course of business
in accordance with past practice. Such member of the SpinCo Group shall also
take such other actions as may be reasonably requested by the member of the
Parent Group to whom such Delayed Retained Asset is to be transferred or
assigned, or which will assume such Delayed Retained Liability, as the case
may be, in order to place such member of the Parent Group in a substantially
similar position as if such Delayed Retained Asset or Delayed Retained
Liability had been transferred, assigned or assumed as contemplated hereby
and so that all the benefits and burdens relating to such Delayed Retained
Asset or Delayed Retained Liability, as the case may be, including use, risk
of loss, potential for gain, and dominion, control and command over such
Delayed Retained Asset or Delayed Retained Liability, as the case may be, and
all costs and expenses related thereto, shall inure from and after the
Effective Time to the Parent Group. Parent and Parent Group will indemnify and
hold harmless SpinCo and SpinCo Group from and against any Liabilities
arising out of or relating to SpinCo or the Parent Group retaining and holding
such Delayed Retained Assets.

 

(h) _Transfer of Delayed Retained Assets and Delayed Retained Liabilities_. If
and when the Approvals or Notifications, the absence of which caused the
deferral of transfer or assignment of any Delayed Retained Asset or the
deferral of assumption of any Delayed Retained Liability, are obtained or
made, and, if and when any other legal impediments for the transfer
or assignment of any Delayed Retained Asset or the assumption of any Delayed
Retained Liability have been removed, the transfer or assignment of the
applicable Delayed Retained Asset or the assumption of the applicable Delayed
Retained Liability, as the case may be, shall be effected in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement and/or the applicable Ancillary Agreement.

2.5  _Release of Guarantees; Financing Matters_.

(a) On or prior to the Effective Time or as soon as practicable thereafter,
each of Parent and SpinCo shall, at the request of the other Party and with
the reasonable cooperation of such other Party and the applicable member(s) of
such Partys Group, use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) have
any member(s) of the Parent Group removed as guarantor of or obligor for any
Assumed Liability to the extent that they relate to Transferred Assets,
including the removal of any Security Interest on or in any Retained Asset
that may serve as collateral or security for any such Assumed Liability; and
(ii) have any member(s) of the SpinCo Group (including any Transferred Entity)
removed as guarantor of or obligor for any Retained Liability to the extent
that 

 



-25-  they relate to Retained Assets, including the removal of any Security
Interest on or in any Transferred Asset that may serve as collateral or
security for any such Retained Liability.

 

(b) To the extent required to obtain a release from a guarantee of:

 

(i) any member of the Parent Group (other than a Transferred Entity), SpinCo
shall execute a guarantee agreement in the form of the existing guarantee or
such other form as is agreed to by the relevant parties to such guarantee
agreement, which agreement shall include the removal of any Security Interest
on or in any Retained Asset that may serve as collateral or security for any
such Assumed Liability, except to the extent that such existing guarantee
contains representations, covenants or other terms or provisions either (A)
with which SpinCo would be reasonably unable to comply or (B) which SpinCo
would not reasonably be able to avoid breaching; and

(ii) any member of the SpinCo Group (including any Transferred
Entity), Parent shall execute a guarantee agreement in the form of the
existing guarantee or such other form as is agreed to by the relevant parties
to such guarantee agreement, which agreement shall include the removal of any
Security Interest on or in any Transferred Asset that may serve as collateral
or security for any such Retained Liability, except to the extent that such
existing guarantee contains representations, covenants or other terms or
provisions either (A) with which Parent would be reasonably unable to comply
or (B) which Parent would not reasonably be able to avoid breaching.

(c) If Parent or SpinCo is unable to obtain, or to cause to be obtained, any
such required removal or release as set forth in clauses (a) and (b) of this
_Section 2.5_, (i) the Party or the relevant member of its Group that has
assumed the Liability with respect to such guarantee shall indemnify, defend
and hold harmless the guarantor or obligor against or from any Liability
arising from or relating thereto in accordance with the provisions of _Article
IV_ and shall, as agent or subcontractor for such guarantor or obligor, pay,
perform and discharge fully all the obligations or other Liabilities of such
guarantor or obligor thereunder; and (ii) each of Parent and SpinCo, on behalf
of itself and the other members of their respective Group, agree not to renew
or extend the term of, increase any obligations under, or transfer to a Third
Party, any loan, guarantee, lease, contract or other obligation for which the
other Party or a member of its Group is or may be liable unless all
obligations of such other Party and the members of such other Partys Group
with respect thereto are thereupon terminated by documentation satisfactory in
form and substance to such other Party.

 

(d) At or prior to or at the Effective Time:

 

(i) SpinCo will enter into one or more financing arrangements and agreements
pursuant to which (i) SpinCo shall borrow a principal amount of at least one
hundred and fifty million dollars ($150,000,000) (the " _SpinCo Financing
Arrangements_ ") and (ii) SpinCo shall transfer one hundred and fifty million
dollars ($150,000,000) from the SpinCo Financing Arrangements to Parent as a
cash distribution (together, the " _SpinCo Cash Transfer_ ").

 



-26- (ii) Parent shall use the amount of cash that it receives from SpinCo pursuant
to the SpinCo Cash Transfer and the Indebtedness Payment to repay in full
Parents outstanding indebtedness under the Parent Credit Agreements
immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time. If the sum of such amounts is
less than the amount required to satisfy and pay in full the outstanding
amounts payable under the Parent Credit Agreements, then any shortfall shall
be the responsibility of SpinCo.

 

2.6 _Termination of Agreements_.

 

(a) In furtherance of the releases and other provisions of _Section 4.1_,
Parent and each member of the Parent Group, on the one hand, and SpinCo and
each member of the SpinCo Group, on the other hand, hereby terminate any and
all Contracts between or among Parent and/or any member of the Parent Group,
on the one hand, and SpinCo and/or any member of the SpinCo Group, on the
other hand, which Agreements are set forth on _Schedule 2.6_ , with such
termination to be effective as of the Effective Time. No such terminated
Contract (including any provision thereof which purports to survive
termination) shall be of any further force or effect after the Effective
Time. Each Party shall, at the reasonable request of the other Party, take, or
cause to be taken, such other actions as may be necessary to effect the
foregoing.

 

(b) All of the intercompany accounts receivable and accounts payable between
any member of the Parent Group (other than any Transferred Entity), on the
one hand, and any member of the SpinCo Group (including any Transferred
Entity), on the other hand, outstanding as of the Effective Time shall, as
promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, be repaid, settled
or otherwise eliminated by means of cash payments, a dividend or
distribution, capital contribution, a combination of the foregoing, or
otherwise as determined by Parent and SpinCo.

 

2.7 _Treatment of Shared Contracts_.

 

(a) Subject to applicable Law and without limiting the generality of the
obligations set forth in _Section 2.1_, unless the Parties otherwise agree
or the benefits of any Contract described in this _Section 2.7_ are expressly
conveyed to the applicable Party pursuant to this Agreement or an Ancillary
Agreement, any Contract, a portion of which is a Retained Contract, but the
remainder of which is a Transferred Contract (any such Contract, a " _Shared
Contract_ "), shall be assigned in relevant part to the applicable member(s)
of the applicable Group, if so assignable, or appropriately amended prior to,
on or after the Effective Time, so that each Party or the member of its Group
shall, as of the Effective Time, be entitled to the rights and benefits, and
shall assume the related portion of any Liabilities, inuring to its
respective businesses; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) in no event shall any
member of any Group be required to assign (or amend) any Shared Contract in
its entirety or to assign a portion of any Shared Contract which is
not assignable (or cannot be amended) by its terms (including any terms
imposing consents or conditions on an assignment where such consents or
conditions have not been obtained or fulfilled) and (ii) if any Shared
Contract cannot be so partially assigned by its terms or otherwise, or cannot
be amended or if such assignment or amendment would impair the benefit the
Parties thereto derive from such Shared Contract, then the Parties

 



-27-  shall, and shall cause each of the members of their respective Groups to,
take such other reasonable and permissible actions (including by providing
prompt notice to the other Party with respect to any relevant claim of
Liability or other relevant matters arising in connection with a Shared
Contract so as to allow such other Party the ability to exercise any
applicable rights under such Shared Contract) to cause a member of the SpinCo
Group or the Parent Group, as the case may be, to receive the rights and
benefits of that portion of each Shared Contract that relates to the
Transferred Business or the Retained Business, as the case may be (in each
case, to the extent so related), as if such Shared Contract had been assigned
to (or amended to allow) a member of the applicable Group pursuant to this
_Section 2.7_, and to bear the burden of the corresponding Liabilities
(including any Liabilities that may arise by reason of such arrangement), as
if such Liabilities had been assumed by a member of the applicable Group
pursuant to this _Section 2.7_.

 

(b) Each of Parent and SpinCo shall, and shall cause the members of its Group
to, (i) treat for all Tax purposes the portion of each Shared Contract
inuring to its respective businesses as Assets owned by, and/or Liabilities
of, as applicable, such Party, or the members of its Group, as applicable, not
later than the Effective Time, and (ii) neither report nor take any Tax
position (on a Tax return or otherwise) inconsistent with such treatment
(unless required by applicable Law).

 

(c) Nothing in this _Section 2.7_ shall require any member of any Group to
make any non- _de minimis_ payment (except to the extent advanced, assumed or
agreed in advance to be reimbursed by any member of the other Group), incur
any non- _de minimis_ obligation or grant any non- _de minimis_ concession for
the benefit of any member of any other Group in order to effect any
transaction contemplated by this _Section 2.7_. For purposes of this Section
2.7I, "de minimis" shall be determined in reference to customary contracts of
similar nature, character and size to the Shared Contracts and not in
reference to the value of the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement or the Distribution.

2.8  _Bank Accounts; Cash Balances_.

(a) Each Party agrees to take, or cause the members of its Group to take, at
the Effective Time (or such earlier time as the Parties may agree), all
actions necessary to amend all Contracts governing each bank and brokerage
account owned by SpinCo or any other member of the SpinCo Group (collectively,
the " _SpinCo Accounts_ ") and all Contracts governing each bank or brokerage
account owned by Parent or any other member of the Parent Group (collectively,
the " _Parent Accounts_ ") so that each such SpinCo Account and Parent
Account, if currently linked (whether by automatic withdrawal, automatic
deposit or any other authorization to transfer funds from or to, hereinafter "
_Linked_ ") to any Parent Account or SpinCo Account, respectively, is de-
Linked from such Parent Account or SpinCo Account, respectively.

(b) With respect to any outstanding checks issued or payments initiated
by Parent, SpinCo, or any of the members of their respective Groups prior to
the Effective Time, such outstanding checks and payments shall be honored
following

 



-28-  the Effective Time by the Person or Group owning the account on which the
check is drawn or from which the payment was initiated, respectively;
provided, that to the extent any such amounts are honored after the Effective
Time by a Person or Group for the benefit of the other Group, such amount
shall be reimbursed promptly (but in any event within five (5) Business Days)
following the Effective Time.

 

(c) As between Parent and SpinCo (and the members of their respective Groups),
all payments made and reimbursements received after the Effective Time by
either Party (or member of its Group) that relate to a business, Asset or
Liability of the other Party (or member of its Group), shall be held by such
Party in trust for the use and benefit of the Party entitled thereto and,
promptly following receipt by such Party of any such payment or reimbursement,
such Party shall pay over, or shall cause the applicable member of its Group
to pay over to the other Party the amount of such payment or reimbursement
without right of set-off.

2.9 _Ancillary Agreements_. Effective on or prior to the Effective Time, each
of Parent and SpinCo will, or will cause the applicable members of their
respective Groups to, execute and deliver all Ancillary Agreements to which it
is a party.

2.10  _Disclaimer of Representations and Warranties_. EACH OF PARENT (ON
BEHALF OF ITSELF AND EACH MEMBER OF THE PARENT GROUP) AND SPINCO (ON BEHALF OF
ITSELF AND EACH MEMBER OF THE SPINCO GROUP) UNDERSTANDS AND AGREES THAT,
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH HEREIN OR IN THE MERGER AGREEMENT OR ANY
ANCILLARY AGREEMENT, NO PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE MERGER AGREEMENT, ANY
ANCILLARY AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER AGREEMENT OR DOCUMENT CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT, THE MERGER AGREEMENT, ANY ANCILLARY AGREEMENT OR OTHERWISE, IS
REPRESENTING OR WARRANTING IN ANY WAY AS TO THE ASSETS, BUSINESSES OR
LIABILITIES TRANSFERRED OR ASSUMED AS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY, AS TO
ANY CONSENTS OR APPROVALS REQUIRED IN CONNECTION THEREWITH, AS TO THE
VALUE OR FREEDOM FROM ANY SECURITY INTERESTS OF, OR ANY OTHER MATTER
CONCERNING, ANY ASSETS OF SUCH PARTY, OR AS TO THE ABSENCE OF ANY DEFENSES OR
RIGHT OF SETOFF OR FREEDOM FROM COUNTERCLAIM WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM OR
OTHER ASSET, INCLUDING ANY ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, OF ANY PARTY, OR AS TO THE
LEGAL SUFFICIENCY OF ANY ASSIGNMENT, DOCUMENT OR INSTRUMENT DELIVERED
HEREUNDER TO CONVEY TITLE TO ANY ASSET OR THING OF VALUE UPON THE EXECUTION,
DELIVERY AND FILING HEREOF OR THEREOF. EXCEPT AS MAY EXPRESSLY BE SET FORTH
HEREIN, IN THE MERGER AGREEMENT OR IN ANY ANCILLARY AGREEMENT, ALL SUCH ASSETS
ARE BEING TRANSFERRED ON AN "AS IS," "WHERE IS" BASIS (AND, IN THE CASE OF ANY
REAL PROPERTY, BY MEANS OF A QUITCLAIM OR SIMILAR FORM OF DEED OR CONVEYANCE)
AND THE RESPECTIVE TRANSFEREES SHALL BEAR THE ECONOMIC AND LEGAL RISKS THAT
(I) ANY CONVEYANCE WILL PROVE TO BE INSUFFICIENT TO VEST IN THE TRANSFEREE
GOOD AND MARKETABLE TITLE, FREE AND CLEAR OF ANY SECURITY INTEREST, AND (II)
ANY NECESSARY APPROVALS OR NOTIFICATIONS ARE NOT OBTAINED OR MADE OR THAT ANY
REQUIREMENTS OF LAWS OR JUDGMENTS ARE NOT COMPLIED WITH.

 



-29- 2.11 _Financial Information Certifications_. Parents disclosure controls
and procedures and internal control over financial reporting (as each is
contemplated by the Exchange Act) are currently applicable to SpinCo as its
Subsidiary. In order to enable the principal executive officer and principal
financial officer of SpinCo to make the certifications required of them under
Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Parent, within thirty-five (35)
days of the end of any fiscal quarter during which SpinCo remains Parents
Subsidiary, shall provide SpinCo with one or more certifications with respect
to such disclosure controls and procedures, its internal control over
financial reporting and the effectiveness thereof. Such certification(s) shall
be provided by SpinCo (and not by any officer or employee in their individual
capacity).

2.12 _ATLAS Name and ATLAS Marks_.

 

(a) Effective as of the Distribution Date, SpinCo hereby grants to Parent and
each member of Parent Group a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license
to use the ATLAS Name and ATLAS Marks in connection with the Retained Business
solely to the extent and in the same manner that the Retained Business
currently uses the ATLAS Name and ATLAS Marks. The license granted under this
Section 2.12 shall expire (i) 12 months after the Distribution Date for any
pipeline markers and other equipment held by Parent or any member of the
Parent Group as of the Distribution Date and (ii) one hundred and eighty
(180) days after the Distribution Date for all other uses. These rights are
not transferable, in whole or in part, except to an acquirer of substantially
all of the interests in Parent. Promptly following the Effective Time,
Parent shall, and shall cause the other members of the Parent Group to, amend
their organization documents to remove the ATLAS NAME and ATLAS Marks.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in this Section 2.12,
each member of Parent Group may use the ATLAS Name and ATLAS Marks (i) on
internal office supplies or signage not visible to consumers or the general
public, provided that such supplies or signage are replaced promptly in the
ordinary course of business, (ii) in a neutral, non-trademark manner to
describe the historical relationship of Parent Group and SpinCo Group, or
(iii) to the extent required by Law in legal or business documents already in
existence on the Distribution Date.

Units to each Record Holder or designated transferee(s) of such Record Holder
by way of direct registration in book-entry form. SpinCo will not issue paper
unit certificates. Parent will cooperate, and will instruct the Distribution
Agent to cooperate, with SpinCo and the SpinCo Transfer Agent, and SpinCo will
cooperate, and will instruct the SpinCo Transfer Agent to cooperate, with
Parent and the Distribution Agent, in connection with all aspects of the
Distribution and all other matters relating to the issuance of the SpinCo
Common Units to be distributed to the holders of Parent Common Units in
connection with the Distribution.

(b) Subject to _Section 3.3_ and  _Section 3.4(c)_, each Record Holder (or
such holders designated transferee(s)) will be entitled to receive in the
Distribution a number of whole SpinCo Common Units equal to the number of
Parent Common Units held by such holder on the Record Date, multiplied by the
Distribution Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number.

(c) No fractional units will be distributed or credited to book-entry
accounts in connection with the Distribution, and any such fractional unit
interests to which a Record Holder would otherwise be entitled shall not
entitle such Record Holder to vote or to any other rights as a unitholder of
SpinCo. In lieu of any such fractional units, each Record Holder who, but for
the provisions of this _Section 3.4(c)_, would be entitled to receive a
fractional unit interest of a SpinCo Common Unit pursuant to the
Distribution, shall be paid cash, without any interest thereon, as hereinafter
provided. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall direct
the Distribution Agent to determine the number of whole and fractional SpinCo
Common Units allocable to each Record Holder, to aggregate all such
fractional units into whole units, and to sell the whole units obtained
thereby in the open market at the then-prevailing prices on behalf of each
Record Holder who otherwise would be entitled to receive fractional unit
interests (with the Distribution Agent, in its sole and absolute discretion,
determining when, how and through which broker-dealer and at what price to
make such sales), and to cause to be distributed to each such Record Holder,
in lieu of any fractional unit, such Record Holders or owners ratable share
of the total proceeds of such sale, after deducting any Taxes required to be
withheld and applicable transfer Taxes, and after deducting the costs and
expenses of such sale and distribution, including brokers fees and
commissions. None of the Parties or the Distribution Agent will be required to
guarantee any minimum sale price for the fractional SpinCo Common Units sold
in accordance with this _Section 3.4(c)_. None of the Parties or the
Distribution Agent will

 



-34-  be required to pay any interest on the proceeds from the sale of fractional
units. Neither the Distribution Agent nor the broker-dealers through which the
aggregated fractional shares are sold shall be Affiliates of Parent or
SpinCo. Solely for purposes of computing fractional unit interests pursuant to
this _Section 3.4(c)_ and _Section 3.4(d)_, the beneficial owner of Parent
Common Units held of record in the name of a nominee in any nominee account
shall be treated as the Record Holder with respect to such units.

(d) Any SpinCo Common Units or cash in lieu of fractional units with respect
to SpinCo Common Units that remain unclaimed by any Record Holder one hundred
and eighty (180) days after the Distribution Date shall be delivered to
SpinCo, and SpinCo shall hold such SpinCo Common Units or cash for the
account of such Record Holder, and the Parties agree that all obligations to
provide such SpinCo Common Units and cash, if any, in lieu of fractional unit
interests shall be obligations of SpinCo, subject in each case to applicable
escheat or other abandoned property Laws.

(e) Until the SpinCo Common Units are duly transferred in accordance with
this _Section 3.4_ and applicable Law, from and after the Effective Time,
SpinCo will regard the Persons entitled to receive such SpinCo Common Units as
record holders of SpinCo Common Units in accordance with the terms of the
Distribution without requiring any action on the part of such Persons. SpinCo
agrees that, subject to any transfers of such units, from and after the
Effective Time (i) each such holder will be entitled to receive all
distributions payable on, and exercise voting rights and all other rights and
privileges with respect to, the SpinCo Common Units then held by such holder,
and (ii) each such holder will be entitled, without any action on the part of
such holder, to receive evidence of ownership of the SpinCo Common Units then
held by such holder.

(c) _Obligations Not Affected_. Nothing contained in  _Section 4.1(a)_ or
_4.1(b)_ shall impair any right of any Person to enforce this Agreement, the
Merger Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or any Contracts that are specified
in _Section 2.6(b)_ or the applicable Schedules thereto as not to terminate
as of the Effective Time, in each case in accordance with its terms. Nothing
contained in _Section 4.1(a)_ or _4.1(b)_ shall release any Person from:

 

(i) any Liability provided in or resulting from any Contract among any members
of the Parent Group or the SpinCo Group that is specified in _Section

(iii) any Liability for the sale, lease, construction or receipt of goods,
property or services purchased, obtained or used in the ordinary course of

the Effective Time;

 



-36- (iv) any Liability that the Parties may have with respect to indemnification
or contribution pursuant to this Agreement, the Merger Agreement, any
Ancillary Agreement or otherwise for claims brought against the Parties by
third Persons, which Liability shall be governed by the provisions of this
_Article IV_ and, if applicable, the appropriate provisions of the Merger
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements; or

(v) any Liability the release of which would result in the release of any
Person other than a Person released pursuant to this _Section 4.1_.

In addition, nothing contained in _Section 4.1(a)_ shall release any member
of the Parent Group from honoring its existing obligations to indemnify any
director, officer or employee of SpinCo or any member of the SpinCo Group who
was a director, officer or employee of any member of the Parent Group on or
prior to the Effective Time, to the extent such director, officer or employee
becomes a named defendant in any Action with respect to which such director,
officer or employee was entitled to such indemnification pursuant to such
existing obligations under the organization documents of Parent or Parent GP;
it being understood that, if the underlying obligation giving rise to such
Action is an Assumed Liability, SpinCo shall indemnify Parent for such
Liability (including Parents costs to indemnify the director, officer or
employee) in accordance with the provisions set forth in this _Article IV_.

 

(d) _No Claims_. SpinCo shall not make, and shall not permit any member of the
SpinCo Group to make, any claim or demand, or commence any Action asserting
any claim or demand, including any claim of contribution or any
indemnification, against Parent or any other member of the Parent Group, or
any other Person released pursuant to _Section 4.1(a)_, with respect to any
Liabilities released pursuant to _Section 4.1(a)_. Parent shall not make, and
shall not permit any other member of the Parent Group to make, any claim or
demand, or commence any Action asserting any claim or demand, including any
claim of contribution or any indemnification against SpinCo or any other
member of the SpinCo Group, or any other Person released pursuant to _Section
4.1(b)_, with respect to any Liabilities released pursuant to  _Section
4.1(b)_.

(e) _Execution of Further Releases_. At any time at or after the Effective
Time, at the request of either Party, the other Party shall cause each member

provisions of this _Section 4.1_.

 

4.2 _Indemnification by SpinCo_. Except as otherwise specifically set forth in
this Agreement or in any Ancillary Agreement, to the fullest extent permitted
by Law, SpinCo shall, and shall cause the other applicable members of the
SpinCo Group to, jointly and severally, indemnify, defend and hold harmless
Parent, each member of the Parent Group and each of their respective
past, present and future directors, officers, employees and agents, in each
case in their respective capacities as such, and each of the heirs, executors,
successors and assigns of any of the foregoing (collectively, the "
_Parent Indemnitees_ "), from and against any and all Liabilities of the
Parent Indemnitees relating to, arising out of or resulting from, directly or
indirectly, any of the following items (without duplication):

 

(a) any Assumed Liability;

 



-37- (b) any failure of SpinCo, any other member of the SpinCo Group or any other
Person to pay, perform or otherwise promptly discharge any Assumed
Liabilities in accordance with their terms, whether prior to, on or after the
Effective Time;

 

(c) any breach by SpinCo or any other member of the SpinCo Group of this
Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements;

 

(d) except to the extent it relates to a Retained Liability, any guarantee,
indemnification or contribution obligation, surety bond or other credit
support Contract for the benefit of any member of the SpinCo Group by any
member of the Parent Group that survives following the Distribution; and

 

(e) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or
omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, with
respect to all information contained in the Form 10 or the Information
Statement (as amended or supplemented if SpinCo shall have furnished any
amendments or supplements thereto).

4.3 _Indemnification by Parent_. Except as otherwise specifically set forth in
this Agreement or in any Ancillary Agreement, to the fullest extent permitted
by Law, Parent shall, and shall cause the other members of the Parent Group
to, jointly and severally, indemnify, defend and hold harmless SpinCo, each
member of the SpinCo Group and each of their respective past, present and
future directors, officers, employees or agents, in each case in their
respective capacities as such, and each of the heirs, executors, successors
and assigns of any of the foregoing (collectively, the " _SpinCo Indemnitees_
"), from and against any and all Liabilities of the SpinCo Indemnitees
relating to, arising out of or resulting from, directly or indirectly, any of
the following items (without duplication):

 

(a) any Retained Liability;

 

(b) any failure of Parent, any other member of the Parent Group or any other
Person to pay, perform or otherwise promptly discharge any Retained
Liabilities in accordance with their terms after the Effective Time;

(c) any breach by Parent or any other member of the Parent Group of this
Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements after the Effective Time; and

(d) except to the extent it relates to an Assumed Liability, any guarantee,
indemnification or contribution obligation, surety bond or other credit
support Contract for the benefit of any member of the Parent Group by any
member of the SpinCo Group that survives following the Distribution. 

 



-38- 4.4 _Indemnification Obligations Net of Insurance Proceeds and Other Amounts_.

 

(a) The Parties intend that any Liability subject to indemnification,
contribution or reimbursement pursuant to this _Article IV_ will be net of
Insurance Proceeds or other amounts actually recovered (net of any out-of-
pocket costs or expenses incurred in the collection thereof) from any Person
by or on behalf of the Indemnitee in respect of any indemnifiable
Liability. Accordingly, the amount which either Party (an " _Indemnifying
Party_ ") is required to pay to any Person entitled to indemnification or
contribution hereunder (an " _Indemnitee_ ") will be reduced by any Insurance
Proceeds or other amounts actually recovered (net of any out-of-pocket costs
or expenses incurred in the collection thereof) from any Person by or on
behalf of the Indemnitee in respect of the related Liability. If an Indemnitee
receives a payment (an " _Indemnity Payment_ ") required by this Agreement
from an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Liability and subsequently
receives Insurance Proceeds or any other amounts in respect of the related
Liability, then the Indemnitee will pay to the Indemnifying Party an amount
equal to the excess of the Indemnity Payment received over the amount of the
Indemnity Payment that would have been due if the Insurance Proceeds or such
other amounts (net of any out-of-pocket costs or expenses incurred in the
collection thereof) had been received, realized or recovered before the
Indemnity Payment was made.

 

(b) The Parties agree that an insurer that would otherwise be obligated to pay
any claim shall not be relieved of the responsibility with respect thereto
or, solely by virtue of any provision contained in this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement, have any subrogation rights with respect thereto, it
being understood that no insurer or any other Third Party shall be entitled
to a "windfall" ( _i.e._ , a benefit they would not be entitled to receive in
the absence of the indemnification provisions) by virtue of the
indemnification and contribution provisions hereof. Each Party shall, and
shall cause the members of its Group to, use commercially reasonable efforts
(taking into account the probability of success on the merits and the cost of
expending such efforts, including attorneys fees and expenses) to collect or
recover any Insurance Proceeds that may be collectible or recoverable
respecting the Liabilities for which indemnification or contribution may be
available under this _Article IV_.

 

4.5 _Procedures for Indemnification of Third-Party Claims_.

 

(a) _Notice of Claims._ If, at or following the date of this Agreement, an
Indemnitee shall receive notice or otherwise learn of the assertion by a
Person (including any Governmental Authority) who is not a member of the
Parent Group or the SpinCo Group of any claim or of the commencement by any
such Person of any Action (collectively, a " _Third-Party Claim_ ") with
respect to which an Indemnifying Party may be obligated to provide
indemnification to such Indemnitee pursuant to _Section 4.2_ or _4.3_ , or
any other Section of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement,
such Indemnitee shall give such Indemnifying Party written notice thereof as
soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event within 20 days (or sooner if
the nature of the Third-Party Claim so requires) after becoming aware of such
Third-Party Claim. Any

 



-39-  such notice shall describe the Third-Party Claim in reasonable detail,
including the facts and circumstances giving rise to such claim for
indemnification, and include copies of all notices and documents (including
court papers) received by the Indemnitee relating to the Third-Party Claim.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure of an Indemnitee to provide notice
in accordance with this _Section 4.5(a)_ shall not relieve an Indemnifying
Party of its indemnification obligations under this Agreement, except to the
extent to which the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by the
Indemnitees failure to provide notice in accordance with this  _Section
4.5(a)_.

(b) _Control of Defense._ An Indemnifying Party may elect to defend (and seek
to settle or compromise), at its own expense and with its own counsel, any
Third-Party Claim; _provided_ , that, prior to the Indemnifying Party assuming
and controlling defense of such Third-Party Claim, it shall first confirm to
the Indemnitee in writing that, assuming the facts presented to the
Indemnifying Party by the Indemnitee being true, the Indemnifying Party shall
indemnify the Indemnitee for any such Damages to the extent resulting from, or
arising out of, such Third-Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the
Indemnifying Party assumes such defense and, in the course of defending such
Third-Party Claim, (i) the Indemnifying Party discovers that the facts
presented at the time the Indemnifying Party acknowledged its indemnification
obligation in respect of such Third-Party Claim were not true in all material
respects and (ii) such untruth provides a reasonable basis for asserting that
the Indemnifying Party does not have an indemnification obligation in respect
of such Third-Party Claim, then (A) the Indemnifying Party shall not be bound
by such acknowledgment, (B) the Indemnifying Party shall promptly thereafter
provide the Indemnitee written notice of its assertion that it does not have
an indemnification obligation in respect of such Third-Party Claim and (C) the
Indemnitee shall have the right to assume the defense of such Third-Party
Claim. Within thirty (30) days after the receipt of a notice from an
Indemnitee in accordance with _Section 4.5(a)_ (or sooner, if the nature of
the Third-Party Claim so requires), the Indemnifying Party shall provide
written notice to the Indemnitee indicating whether the Indemnifying Party
shall assume responsibility for defending the Third-Party Claim. If an
Indemnifying Party elects not to assume responsibility for defending any
Third-Party Claim or fails to notify an Indemnitee of its election within
thirty (30) days after receipt of the no tice from an Indemnitee as provided
in _Section 4.5(a)_, then the Indemnitee that is the subject of such Third-
Party Claim shall be entitled to continue to conduct and control the defense
of such Third-Party Claim.

 

(c) _Allocation of Defense Costs_. If an Indemnifying Party has elected to
assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim, then such Indemnifying Party shall
be solely liable for all fees and expenses incurred by it in connection with
the defense of such Third-Party Claim and shall not be entitled to seek any
indemnification or reimbursement from the Indemnitee for any such fees or
expenses incurred by the Indemnifying Party during the course of the defense
of such Third-Party Claim by such Indemnifying Party, regardless of any
subsequent decision by the Indemnifying Party to reject or otherwise abandon
its assumption of such defense. If an Indemnifying Party elects not to assume
responsibility for defending any Third-Party Claim or fails to notify an
Indemnitee of its election within thirty (30) days after receipt of a notice
from an 

 



-40-  Indemnitee as provided in _Section 4.5(a)_, and the Indemnitee conducts and
controls the defense of such Third-Party Claim and the Indemnifying Party has
an indemnification obligation with respect to such Third-Party Claim, then
the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for all reasonable fees and expenses
incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the defense of such Third-Party
Claim.

 

(d) _Right to Monitor and Participate._ An Indemnitee that does not conduct
and control the defense of any Third-Party Claim, or an Indemnifying Party
that has failed to elect to defend any Third-Party Claim as contemplated
hereby, nevertheless shall have the right to employ separate counsel
(including local counsel as necessary) of its own choosing to monitor
and participate in (but not control) the defense of any Third-Party Claim for
which it is a potential Indemnitee or Indemnifying Party, but the fees and
expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnitee or
Indemnifying Party, as the case may be, and the provisions of _Section
4.5(c)_ shall not apply to such fees and expenses. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, but subject to _Sections 6.7_ and _6.8_ , such Party shall
cooperate with the Party entitled to conduct and control the defense of such
Third-Party Claim in such defense and make available to the controlling Party,
at the non-controlling Partys expense, all witnesses, information and
materials in such Partys possession or under such Partys control relating
thereto as are reasonably required by the controlling Party. In addition to
the foregoing, if any Indemnitee shall in good faith determine that such
Indemnitee and the Indemnifying Party have actual or potential differing
defenses or conflicts of interest between them that make joint representation
inappropriate, then the Indemnitee shall have the right to employ separate
counsel (including local counsel as necessary) and to participate in (but not
control) the defense, compromise, or settlement thereof, and the Indemnifying
Party shall bear the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for all
Indemnitees.

 

(e) _No Settlement._ No Party may settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim
for which a Party is seeking to be indemnified hereunder without the prior
written consent of the other Parties, which consent may not be unreasonably
withheld, unless such settlement or compromise is solely for monetary damages,
does not involve any finding or determination of wrongdoing or violation of
Law by the other Parties and provides for a full, unconditional and
irrevocable release of the other Parties from all Liability in connection with
the Third-Party Claim.

 

4.6 _Additional Matters_.

 

(a) _Timing of Payments._ Indemnification or contribution payments in respect
of any Liabilities for which an Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification or
contribution under this _Article IV_ shall be paid reasonably promptly (but in
any event within forty-five (45) days of the final determination of the amount
that the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification or contribution under this
_Article IV_ ) by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnitee as such Liabilities
are incurred upon demand by the Indemnitee, including reasonably satisfactory
documentation setting forth the basis for the amount of such indemnification
or contribution payment, including documentation with respect to calculations
made and consideration of any Insurance Proceeds that actually reduce the
amount of such Liabilities. The indemnity and contribution provisions
contained in this

 



-41-   _Article IV_ shall remain operative and in full force and effect,
regardless of (i) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Indemnitee,
and (ii) the knowledge by the Indemnitee of Liabilities for which it might be
entitled to indemnification hereunder.

(b) _Notice of Direct Claims. _ Any claim for indemnification or contribution
under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement that does not result from a
Third-Party Claim shall be asserted by written notice given by the Indemnitee
to the applicable Indemnifying Party;  _provided_ , that the failure by an
Indemnitee to so assert any such claim shall not prejudice the ability of the
Indemnitee to do so at a later time except to the extent (if any) that the
Indemnifying Party is prejudiced thereby. Such Indemnifying Party shall have
a period of thirty (30) days after the receipt of such notice within which to
respond thereto. If such Indemnifying Party does not respond within such
thirty (30)-day period or rejects such claim in whole or in part, such
Indemnitee shall, subject to the provisions of _Article VII_ , be free to
pursue such remedies as may be available to such party as contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, as applicable, without prejudice to
its continuing rights to pursue indemnification or contribution hereunder.

(c) _Pursuit of Claims Against Third Parties. _ If (i) a Party incurs any
Liability arising out of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement; (ii) an
adequate legal or equitable remedy is not available for any reason against the
other Party to satisfy the Liability incurred by the incurring Party; and
(iii) a legal or equitable remedy may be available to the other Party against
a Third Party for such Liability, then the other Party shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the incurring Party, at the
incurring Partys expense, to permit the incurring Party to obtain the
benefits of such legal or equitable remedy against the Third Party.

 

(d) _Subrogation_. In the event of payment by or on behalf of any Indemnifying
Party to any Indemnitee in connection with any Third-Party Claim, such
Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to and shall stand in the place of such
Indemnitee as to any events or circumstances in respect of which such
Indemnitee may have any right, defense or claim relating to such Third-Party
Claim against any claimant or plaintiff asserting such Third-Party Claim or
against any other Person. Such Indemnitee shall cooperate with such
Indemnifying Party in a reasonable manner, and at the cost and expense of such
Indemnifying Party, in prosecuting any subrogated right, defense or claim.

(e) _Substitution_. In the event of an Action in which the Indemnifying Party
is not a named defendant, if either the Indemnitee or Indemnifying Party shall
so request, the Parties shall endeavor to substitute the Indemnifying Party
for the named defendant. If such substitution or addition cannot be achieved
for any reason or is not requested, the named defendant shall allow the
Indemnifying Party to manage the Action as set forth in _Section 4.5_ and
this _Section 4.6_, and the Indemnifying Party shall fully indemnify
the named defendant against all costs of defending the Action (including
court costs, sanctions imposed by a court, attorneys fees, experts fees and
all other external expenses), the costs of any judgment or settlement and the
cost of any interest or penalties relating to any judgment or settlement.

 



-42- 4.7 _Right of Contribution_.

 

(a) _Contribution._ If any right of indemnification contained in _Section
4.2_ or _Section 4.3_ is held unenforceable or is unavailable for any
reason, or is insufficient to hold harmless an Indemnitee in respect of any
Liability for which such Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification hereunder,
then the Indemnifying Party shall contribute to the amounts paid or payable
by the Indemnitees as a result of such Liability (or actions in respect
thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of
the Indemnifying Party and the members of its Group, on the one hand, and the
Indemnitees entitled to contribution, on the other hand, as well as any other
relevant equitable considerations.

 

(b) _Allocation of Relative Fault._ Solely for purposes of determining
relative fault pursuant to this  _Section 4.7_: (i) any fault associated
with the business conducted with the Delayed Transferred Assets or Delayed
Assumed Liabilities (except for the gross negligence or intentional misconduct
of a member of the Parent Group) or with the ownership, operation or
activities of the Transferred Business prior to the Effective Time shall be
deemed to be the fault of SpinCo and the other members of the SpinCo Group,
and no such fault shall be deemed to be the fault of Parent or any other
member of the Parent Group; (ii) any fault associated with the business
conducted with Delayed Retained Assets or Delayed Retained Liabilities (except
for the gross negligence or intentional misconduct of a member of the SpinCo
Group) shall be deemed to be the fault of Parent and the other members of the
Parent Group, and no such fault shall be deemed to be the fault of SpinCo or
any other member of the SpinCo Group; and (iii) any fault associated with the
ownership, operation or activities of the Retained Business prior to the
Effective Time shall be deemed to be the fault of Parent and the other members
of the Parent Group, and no such fault shall be deemed to be the fault of
SpinCo or any other member of the SpinCo Group.

4.8 _Covenant Not to Sue_. Each Party hereby covenants and agrees that none of
it, the members of such Partys Group or any Person claiming through it shall
bring suit or otherwise assert any claim against any Indemnitee, or assert a
defense against any claim asserted by any Indemnitee, before any court,
arbitrator, mediator or administrative agency anywhere in the world, alleging
that: (a) the assumption of any Assumed Liabilities by SpinCo or a member of
the SpinCo Group on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements is void or unenforceable for any reason; (b) the
retention of any Retained Liabilities by Parent or a member of the Parent
Group on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements is void or unenforceable for any reason; or (c) the
provisions of this _Article IV_ are void or unenforceable for any reason.

4.9 _Remedies Cumulative_. The remedies provided in this _Article IV_ shall
be cumulative and, subject to the provisions of _Article VIII_ , shall not
preclude assertion by any Indemnitee of any other rights or the seeking of any
and all other remedies against any Indemnifying Party.

 

4.10 _Survival of Indemnities_. The rights and obligations of each of Parent
and each member of the Parent Group, SpinCo and each member of the Spinco
Group and their

 



-43-  respective Indemnitees under this _Article IV_ shall survive (a) the sale or
other transfer by either Party or any member of its Group of any Assets or
businesses or the assignment by it of any liabilities; or (b) any merger,
consolidation, business combination, sale of all or substantially all of its
Assets, restructuring, recapitalization, reorganization or similar transaction
involving either Party or any of the members of its Group.

ARTICLE V

 

CERTAIN OTHER MATTERS

5.1  _Late Payments_. Except as expressly provided to the contrary in this
Agreement or in any Ancillary Agreement, any amount not paid when due pursuant
to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement (and any amounts billed or
otherwise invoiced or demanded and properly payable that are not paid within
thirty (30) days of such bill, invoice or other demand) shall accrue interest
at a rate per annum equal to Prime Rate plus two (2%) percent.

 

ARTICLE VI

EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION; CONFIDENTIALITY

6.1 _Agreement for Exchange of Information_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section 6.9_ and any other applicable confidentiality
obligations, each of Parent and SpinCo, on behalf of itself and each member
of its Group, agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide or make
available, or cause to be provided or made available, to the other Party and
the members of such other Partys Group, at any time before, on or after the
Effective Time, as soon as reasonably practicable after written request
therefor, any information (or a copy thereof) in the possession or under the
control of such Party or its Group which the requesting Party or its Group to
the extent that (i) such information relates to the Transferred Business, or
any Transferred Asset or Assumed Liability, if SpinCo is the requesting Party,
or to the Retained Business, or any Retained Asset or Retained Liability, if
Parent is the requesting Party; (ii) such information is required by the
requesting Party to comply with its obligations under this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement; or (iii) such information is required by the requesting
Party to comply with any obligation imposed by any Governmental Authority;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, in the event that the Party to whom the request
has been made determines that any such provision of information could violate
any Law or Contract, or waive any privilege available under applicable Law,
including any attorney-client privilege, then the Parties shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to permit compliance with such obligations to
the extent and in a manner that avoids any such harm or consequence. The
Party providing information pursuant to this _Section 6.1_ shall only be
obligated to provide such information in the form, condition and format in
which it then exists, and in no event shall such Party be required to perform
any improvement, modification, conversion, updating or reformatting of any
such information, and nothing in this _Section 6.1_ shall expand the
obligations of a Party under _Section 6.4_.

 



-44- (b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, until the [first
SpinCo fiscal year end] occurring after the Effective Time (and for a
reasonable period of time afterwards as required for each Party to prepare
consolidated financial statements or complete a financial statement audit for
the fiscal year during which the Distribution Date occurs), each Party shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the other Partys
information requests to enable (i) the other Party to meet its timetable for
dissemination of its earnings releases, financial statements and managements
assessment of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures and
its internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Items 307 and
308, respectively, of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Exchange Act; and
(ii) the other Partys accountants to timely complete their review of the
quarterly financial statements and audit of the annual financial statements,
including, to the extent applicable to such Party, its auditors audit of its
internal control over financial reporting and managements assessment thereof
in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the SECs
and Public Company Accounting Oversight Boards rules and auditing standards
thereunder and any other applicable Laws.

6.2 _Ownership of Information_. The provision of any information pursuant to
_Section 6.1_ or _Section 6.7_ shall not affect the ownership of such
information (which shall be determined solely in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements), or constitute a grant of rights
in or to any such information.

6.3 _Compensation for Providing Information_. The Party
requesting information agrees to reimburse the other Party for the reasonable
out-of-pocket costs, if any, of copying, and transporting such information.

 

6.4 _Record Retention_. To facilitate the possible exchange of information
pursuant to this _Article VI_ and other provisions of this Agreement after
the Effective Time, the Parties agree to use their commercially reasonable
efforts to retain all information in their respective possession or control on
the Effective Time in accordance with the policies of Parent as in effect on
the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of any
information relating to Taxes, employee benefits or Environmental Liabilities,
such retention period shall be extended to the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations (giving effect to any extensions thereof).

6.5 _Limitations of Liability_. Neither Party shall have any Liability to
the other Party in the event that any information exchanged or provided
pursuant to this Agreement is found to be inaccurate in the absence of gross
negligence or willful misconduct by the Party providing such information.
Neither Party shall have any Liability to any other Party if any information
is destroyed after commercially reasonable efforts by such Party to comply
with the provisions of _Section 6.4_.

 

6.6 _Other Agreements Providing for Exchange of Information_.

 

(a) The rights and obligations granted under this _Article VI_ are subject to
any specific limitations, qualifications or additional provisions on the
sharing, exchange, retention or confidential treatment of information set
forth in any Ancillary Agreement.

 



-45- (b) Any party that receives, pursuant to request for information in
accordance with this _Article VI_ , Tangible Information that is not relevant
to its request shall (i) return it to the providing Party or, at the providing
Partys request, destroy such Tangible Information; and (ii) deliver to
the providing Party written confirmation that such Tangible Information was
returned or destroyed, as the case may be, which confirmation shall be signed
by an authorized representative of the requesting Party.

 

6.7 _Production of Witnesses; Records; Cooperation_.

 

(a) After the Effective Time, each Party shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to make available to the other Party, upon written request, the
former, current and future directors, officers, employees, other personnel and
agents of the members of its respective Group as witnesses and any books,
records or other documents within its control or which it otherwise has the
ability to make available without undue burden, to the extent that any such
Person (giving consideration to business demands of such directors, officers,
employees, other personnel and agents) or books, records or other documents
may reasonably be required in connection with any Action in which the
requesting Party (or member of its Group) may from time to time be involved,
regardless of whether such Action is a matter with respect to which
indemnification may be sought hereunder. The requesting Party shall bear all
costs and expenses in connection therewith.

(b) If an Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or to seek to compromise or
settle any Third-Party Claim, the other Party shall make available to such
Indemnifying Party, upon written request, the former, current and future
directors, officers, employees, other personnel and agents of the members of
its respective Group as witnesses and any books, records or other documents
within its control or which it otherwise has the ability to make available
without undue burden, to the extent that any such Person
(giving consideration to business demands of such directors, officers,
employees, other personnel and agents) or books, records or other documents
may reasonably be required in connection with such defense, settlement or
compromise, or such prosecution, evaluation or pursuit, as the case may be,
and shall otherwise cooperate in such defense, settlement or compromise, or
such prosecution, evaluation or pursuit, as the case may be.

 

(c) Without limiting the foregoing, the Parties shall cooperate and consult to
the extent reasonably necessary with respect to any Actions.

(d) Without limiting any provision of this _Section 6.7_, each of the Parties
agrees to cooperate, and to cause each member of its respective Group to
cooperate, with each other in the defense of any infringement or similar claim
with respect any Intellectual Property and shall not claim to acknowledge, or
permit any member of its respective Group to claim to acknowledge, the
validity or infringing use of any Intellectual Property of a third Person in a
manner that would hamper or undermine the defense of such infringement or
similar claim.

 



-46- (e) The obligation of the Parties to provide witnesses pursuant to this 
_Section 6.7_ is intended to be interpreted in a manner so as to facilitate
cooperation and shall include the obligation to provide as witnesses inventors
and other officers without regard to whether the witness or the employer of
the witness could assert a possible business conflict (subject to the
exception set forth in the first sentence of _Section 6.7(a)_).

 

6.8 _Privileged Matters_.

 

(a) The Parties recognize that legal and other professional services that have
been and will be provided prior to the Effective Time have been and will be
rendered for the collective benefit of each of the members of the Parent Group
and the SpinCo Group, and that each of the members of the Parent Group and the
SpinCo Group should be deemed to be the client with respect to such services
for the purposes of asserting all privileges which may be asserted under
applicable Law in connection therewith. The Parties recognize that legal and
other professional services will be provided following the Effective Time,
which services will be rendered solely for the benefit of the Parent Group or
the SpinCo Group, as the case may be.

(b) The Parties agree as follows:

(i) Parent shall be entitled, in perpetuity, to control the assertion or
waiver of all privileges and immunities in connection with any Privileged
Information that relates solely to the Retained Business and not to the
Transferred Business, whether or not the Privileged Information is in the
possession or under the control of any member of the Parent Group or any
member of the SpinCo Group. Parent shall also be entitled, in perpetuity, to
control the assertion or waiver of all privileges and immunities in connection
with any Privileged Information that relates solely to any Retained
Liabilities resulting from any Actions that are now pending or may be asserted
in the future, whether or not the Privileged Information is in the possession
or under the control of any member of the Parent Group or any member of the
SpinCo Group; and

(ii) SpinCo shall be entitled, in perpetuity, to control the assertion or
waiver of all privileges and immunities in connection with any Privileged
Information that relates solely to the Transferred Business and not to the
Retained Business, whether or not the Privileged Information is in the
possession or under the control of any member of the SpinCo Group or any
member of the Parent Group. SpinCo shall also be entitled, in perpetuity, to
control the assertion or waiver of all privileges and immunities in connection
with any Privileged Information that relates solely to any
Assumed Liabilities resulting from any Actions that are now pending or may be
asserted in the future, whether or not the privileged Information is in the
possession or under the control of any member of the SpinCo Group or any
member of the Parent Group. 

(iii) If the Parties do not agree as to whether certain information is
Privileged Information, then such information shall be treated as Privileged
Information, and the Party that believes that such information is Privileged
Information shall be entitled to control the assertion or waiver of all
privileges and immunities in connection 

 



-47-  with any such information unless the Parties otherwise agree. The Parties
shall use the procedures set forth in _Article VII_ to resolve any disputes as
to whether any information relates solely to the Retained Business, solely to
the Transferred Business, or to both the Retained Business and the Transferred
Business.

 

(c) Subject to the remaining provisions of this _Section 6.8_, the Parties
agree that they shall have a shared privilege or immunity with respect to all
privileges and immunities not allocated pursuant to _Section 6.8(b)_ and all
privileges and immunities relating to any Actions or other matters that
involve both Parties (or one or more members of their respective Groups) and
in respect of which both Parties have Liabilities under this Agreement, and
that no such shared privilege or immunity may be waived by either Party
without the consent of the other Party.

 

(d) If any Dispute arises between the Parties or any members of their
respective Group regarding whether a privilege or immunity should be waived
to protect or advance the interests of either Party and/or any member of their
respective Group, each Party agrees that it shall (i) negotiate with the other
Party in good faith; (ii) endeavor to minimize any prejudice to the rights of
the other Party; and (iii) not unreasonably withhold consent to any request
for waiver by the other Party. Further, each Party specifically agrees that it
shall not withhold its consent to the waiver of a privilege or immunity for
any purpose except in good faith to protect its own legitimate interests.

(e) In the event of any adversarial Action or Dispute between Parent and
SpinCo, or any members of their respective Groups, either Party may waive a
privilege in which the other Party or member of such other Partys Group has a
shared privilege, without obtaining consent pursuant to _Section 6.8(c)_;
_provided_ , that such waiver of a shared privilege shall be effective only as
to the use of information with respect to the Action between the Parties
and/or the applicable members of their respective Groups, and shall not
operate as a waiver of the shared privilege with respect to any Third Party.

(f) Upon receipt by either Party, or by any member of its respective Group,
of any subpoena, discovery or other request that may reasonably be expected to
result in the production or disclosure of Privileged Information subject to a
shared privilege or immunity or as to which another Party has the sole right
hereunder to assert a privilege or immunity, or if either Party obtains
knowledge that any of its, or any member of its respective Groups, current or
former directors, officers, agents or employees have received any subpoena,
discovery or other requests that may reasonably be expected to result in the
production or disclosure of such Privileged Information, such Party shall
promptly notify the other Party of the existence of the request (which notice
shall be delivered to such other Party no later than five (5) business days
following the receipt of any such subpoena, discovery or other request) and
shall provide the other Party a reasonable opportunity to review
the Privileged Information and to assert any rights it or they may have under
this _Section 6.8_ or otherwise, to prevent the production or disclosure of
such Privileged Information.

 



-48- (g) Any furnishing of, or access or transfer of, any information pursuant to
this Agreement is made in reliance on the agreement of Parent and SpinCo set
forth in this _Section 6.8_ and in _Section 6.9_ to maintain the
confidentiality of Privileged Information and to assert and maintain all
applicable privileges and immunities. The Parties agree that their respective
rights to any access to information, witnesses and other Persons, the
furnishing of notices and documents and other cooperative efforts between the
Parties contemplated by this Agreement, and the transfer of Privileged
Information between the Parties and members of their respective Groups
pursuant to this Agreement, shall not be deemed a waiver of any privilege that
has been or may be asserted under this Agreement or otherwise.

(h) In connection with any matter contemplated by _Section 6.7_ or this
_Section 6.8_, the Parties agree to, and to cause the applicable members of
their Group to, use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain their
respective separate and joint privileges and immunities, including by
executing joint defense and/or common interest agreements where necessary or
useful for this purpose.

6.9 _Confidentiality_.

 

(a) _Confidentiality._ Subject to _Section 6.10_, from and after the
Effective Time until the five (5) year anniversary of the Effective Time,
each of Parent and SpinCo, on behalf of itself and each member of its
respective Group, agrees to hold, and to cause its respective Representatives
to hold, in strict confidence, with at least the same degree of care that
applies to Parents confidential and proprietary information pursuant to
policies in effect as of the Effective Time, all confidential and proprietary
information concerning the other Party or any member of the other
Partys Group or their respective businesses that is either in its possession
(including confidential and proprietary information in its possession prior to
the date hereof) or furnished by any such other Party or any member of such
Partys Group or their respective Representatives at any time pursuant to
this Agreement, the Merger Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or otherwise,
and shall not use any such confidential and proprietary information other than
for such purposes as shall be expressly permitted hereunder or thereunder,
except, in each case, to the extent that such confidential and proprietary
information has been (i) in the public domain or generally available to the
public, other than as a result of a disclosure by such Party or any member of
such Partys Group or any of their respective Representatives in violation of
this Agreement, (ii) later lawfully acquired from other sources by such Party
(or any member of such Partys Group) which sources are not themselves bound
by a confidentiality obligation or other contractual, legal or fiduciary
obligation of confidentiality with respect to such confidential and
proprietary information, or (iii) independently developed or
generated without reference to or use of any proprietary or confidential
information of the other Party or any member of such Partys Group. If any
confidential and proprietary information of one Party or any member of its
Group is disclosed to the other Party or any member of such other Partys
Group in connection with providing services to such first Party or any member
of such first Partys Group under this Agreement, the Merger Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement, then such disclosed confidential and proprietary
information shall be used only as required to perform such services.

 



-49- (b) _No Release; Return or Destruction_. Each Party agrees not to release
or disclose, or permit to be released or disclosed, any information addressed
in _Section 6.9(a)_ to any other Person, except its Representatives who need
to know such information in their capacities as such (who shall be advised of
their obligations hereunder with respect to such information), and except in
compliance with _Section 6.10_. Without limiting the foregoing, when any such
information is no longer needed for the purposes contemplated by this
Agreement, the Merger Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, each Party will
promptly after request of the other Party either return to the other Party all
such information in a tangible form (including all copies thereof and all
notes, extracts or summaries based thereon) or notify the other Party in
writing that it has destroyed such information (and such copies thereof and
such notes, extracts or summaries based thereon).

 

(c) _Third-Party Information; Privacy or Data Protection Laws._ Each Party
acknowledges that it and members of its Group may presently have and,
following the Effective Time, may gain access to or possession of confidential
or proprietary information of, or personal information relating to, Third
Parties (i) that was received under confidentiality or non-disclosure
Contracts entered into between such Third Parties, on the one hand, and the
other Party or members of such Partys Group, on the other hand, prior to the
Effective Time; or (ii) that, as between the two Parties, was originally
collected by the other Party or members of such Partys Group and that may be
subject to and protected by privacy, data protection or other applicable Laws.
Each Party agrees that it shall hold, protect and use, and shall cause
the members of its Group and its and their respective Representatives to
hold, protect and use, in strict confidence the confidential and proprietary
information of, or personal information relating to, Third Parties in
accordance with privacy, data protection or other applicable Laws and the
terms of any Contracts that were either entered into before the Effective Time
or affirmative commitments or representations that were made before the
Effective Time by, between or among the other Party or members of the other
Partys Group, on the one hand, and such Third Parties, on the other hand.

6.10 _Protective Arrangements_. In the event that a Party or any member of
its Group either determines on the advice of its counsel that it is required
to disclose any information pursuant to applicable Law or receives any request
or demand under lawful process or from any Governmental Authority to disclose
or provide information of the other Party (or any member of the other Partys
Group) that is subject to the confidentiality provisions hereof, such Party
shall notify the other Party (to the extent legally permitted) as promptly as
practicable under the circumstances prior to disclosing or providing such
information and shall cooperate, at the expense of the other Party, in seeking
any appropriate protective order requested by the other Party. In the event
that such other Party fails to receive such appropriate protective order in a
timely manner and the Party receiving the request or demand reasonably
determines that its failure to disclose or provide such information shall
actually prejudice the Party receiving the request or demand, then the Party
that received such request or demand may thereafter disclose or provide
information to the extent required by such Law (as so advised by its counsel)
or by lawful process or such Governmental Authority, and the disclosing Party
shall promptly provide the other Party with a copy of the information so
disclosed, in the same form and format so disclosed, together with a list of
all Persons to whom such information was disclosed, in each case to the
extent legally permitted.

 



-50- ARTICLE VII

 

DISPUTE RESOLUTION

7.1  _Good-Faith Negotiation_. Subject to _Section 7.4_, either Party
seeking resolution of any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or Ancillary Agreement (including regarding whether
any Assets are Transferred Assets, any Assets are Retained Assets, any
Liabilities are Assumed Liabilities, any Liabilities are Retained Liabilities
or the validity, interpretation, breach or termination of this Agreement or
any Ancillary Agreement) (a " _Dispute_ "), shall provide written notice
thereof to the other Party (the " _Initial Notice_ "), and within thirty (30)
days of the delivery of the Initial Notice, the Parties shall attempt in good
faith to negotiate a resolution of the Dispute. The negotiations shall be
conducted by executives who hold, at a minimum, the title of senior vice
president and who have authority to settle the Dispute. All such negotiations
shall be confidential and shall be treated as compromise and settlement
negotiations for purposes of applicable rules of evidence. If the Parties are
unable for any reason to resolve a Dispute within thirty (30) days after the
delivery of such notice or if a Party reasonably concludes that the other
Party is not willing to negotiate as contemplated by this _Section 7.1_, the
Dispute shall be submitted to mediation in accordance with _Section 7.2_.

 

7.2 _Mediation_. Any Dispute not resolved pursuant to _Section 7.1_ shall, at
the written request of a Party (a " _Mediation Request_ "), be submitted to
nonbinding mediation in accordance with the then current International
Institute for Conflict Prevention and Resolution Mediation Procedure (the "
_CPR Mediation Procedure_ "), except as modified herein. The mediation shall
be held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania or such other place as the Parties may
mutually agree in writing. The Parties shall have twenty (20) days from
receipt by a Party of a Mediation Request to agree on a mediator. If no
mediator has been agreed upon by the Parties within twenty (20) days of
receipt by a party of a Mediation Request, then a Party may request (on
written notice to the other Party), that CPR appoint a mediator in
accordance with the CPR Mediation Procedure. All mediation pursuant to this
clause shall be confidential and shall be treated as compromise and settlement
negotiations for purposes of applicable rules of evidence, and no oral or
documentary representations made by the Parties during such mediation shall
be admissible for any purpose in any subsequent proceedings. No Party shall
disclose or permit the disclosure of any information about the evidence
adduced or the documents produced by the other Party in the mediation
proceedings or about the existence, contents or results of the mediation
without the prior written consent of such other Party, except in the course of
a judicial or regulatory proceeding or as may be required by Law or requested
by a Governmental Authority or securities exchange. Before making any
disclosure permitted by the preceding sentence, the Party intending to make
such disclosure shall, to the extent reasonably practicable, give the other
Party reasonable written notice of the intended disclosure and afford the
other Party a reasonable opportunity to protect its interests. If the Dispute
has not been resolved within sixty (60) days of the appointment of a mediator,
or within ninety (90) days after receipt by a Party of a Mediation Request
(whichever occurs sooner), or within such longer period as the Parties may
agree to in writing, then the Dispute shall be submitted to binding
arbitration in accordance with _Section 7.3_.

 



-51- 7.3 _Arbitration_.

 

(a) In the event that a Dispute has not been resolved within sixty (60) days
of the appointment of a mediator in accordance with _Section 7.2_, or within
ninety (90) days after receipt by a Party of a Mediation Request (whichever
occurs sooner), or within such longer period as the Parties may agree to in
writing, then such Dispute shall, upon the written request of a Party (the "
_Arbitration Request_ ") be submitted to be finally resolved by binding
arbitration pursuant to the then current International Institute for Conflict
Prevention and Resolution Arbitration Procedure (" _CPR Arbitration
Procedure_ "). The arbitration shall be held in the same location as the
mediation pursuant to _Section 7.2_. Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties
in writing, any Dispute to be decided pursuant to this  _Section 7.3_ will
be decided (i) before a sole arbitrator if the amount in dispute, inclusive of
all claims and counterclaims, totals less than $2 million; or (ii) by a panel
of three (3) arbitrators if the amount in dispute, inclusive of all claims
and counterclaims, totals $2 million or more.

(b) The panel of three (3) arbitrators will be chosen as follows: (i) within
fifteen (15) days from the date of the receipt of the Arbitration Request,
each Party will name an arbitrator; and (ii) the two (2) Party-appointed
arbitrators will thereafter, within thirty (30) days from the date on which
the second of the two (2) arbitrators was named, name a third, independent
arbitrator who will act as chairperson of the arbitral tribunal. In the event
that either Party fails to name an arbitrator within fifteen (15) days from
the date of receipt of the Arbitration Request, then upon written application
by either Party, that arbitrator shall be appointed pursuant to the CPR
Arbitration Procedure. In the event that the two (2) Party-appointed
arbitrators fail to appoint the third, then the third, independent arbitrator
will be appointed pursuant to the CPR Arbitration Procedure. If the
arbitration will be before a sole independent arbitrator, then the
sole independent arbitrator will be appointed by agreement of the Parties
within fifteen (15) days of the date of receipt of the Arbitration Request. If
the Parties cannot agree to a sole independent arbitrator, then upon written
application by either Party, the sole independent arbitrator will be
appointed pursuant to the CPR Arbitration Procedure.

(c) The arbitrator(s) will have the right to award, on an interim basis, or
include in the final award, any relief which it deems proper in the
circumstances, including money damages (with interest on unpaid amounts from
the due date), injunctive relief (including specific performance) and
attorneys fees and costs; _provided_ , that the arbitrator(s) will not award
any relief not specifically requested by the parties and, in any event, will
not award any indirect, punitive, exemplary, remote, speculative or similar
damages in excess of compensatory damages of the other arising in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby (other than any such Liability with
respect to a Third-Party Claim). Upon selection of the arbitrator(s)
following any grant of interim relief by a special arbitrator or court
pursuant to _Section 7.4_, the arbitrator(s) may affirm or disaffirm that
relief, and the parties will seek modification or rescission of the
order entered by the court as necessary to accord with the decision of the
arbitrator(s). The award of the arbitrator(s) shall be final and binding on
the Parties, and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. The
initiation of mediation or arbitration pursuant to this _Article VII_ will
toll the applicable statute of limitations for the duration of any such
proceedings.

 



-52- 7.4 _Litigation and Unilateral Commencement of Arbitration_. Notwithstanding
the foregoing provisions of this _Article VII_, (a) a Party may seek
preliminary provisional or injunctive judicial relief with respect to a
Dispute without first complying with the procedures set forth in _Section
7.1_,  _Section 7.2_ and _Section 7.3_ if such Action is reasonably
necessary to avoid irreparable damage and (b) either Party may initiate
arbitration before the expiration of the periods specified in _Section 7.2_
and  _Section 7.3_ if (i) such Party has submitted a Mediation Request or
Arbitration Request, as applicable, and the other party has failed, within the
applicable periods set forth in _Section 7.3_ to agree upon a date for
the first mediation session to take place within thirty (30) days after the
appointment of such mediator or such longer period as the Parties may agree to
in writing or (ii) such Party has failed to comply with _Section 7.3_ in
good faith with respect to commencement and engagement in arbitration. In
such event, the other Party may commence and prosecute such arbitration
unilaterally in accordance with the CPR Arbitration Procedure.

 

7.5 _Conduct During Dispute Resolution Process_. Unless otherwise agreed in
writing, the Parties shall, and shall cause their respective members of their
Group to, continue to honor all commitments under this Agreement, the Merger
Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement to the extent required by such
agreements during the course of dispute resolution pursuant to the provisions
of this  _Article VII_, unless such commitments are the specific subject of
the Dispute at issue.

ARTICLE VIII

 

FURTHER ASSURANCES AND ADDITIONAL COVENANTS

 

8.1 _Further Assurances_.

 

(a) In addition to the actions specifically provided for elsewhere in this
Agreement, the Merger Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, each of the
Parties shall use its reasonable best efforts, prior to, on and after the
Effective Time, to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or
cause to be done, all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable Laws, regulations and agreements to consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements.

 

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, prior to, on and after the Effective Time,
each Party hereto shall cooperate with the other Party, and without any
further consideration, but at the expense of the requesting Party, to execute
and deliver, or use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be executed and
delivered, all instruments, including instruments of conveyance, assignment
and transfer, and to make all filings with, and to obtain all Approvals or
Notifications of, any Governmental Authority or any other Person under any
Permit or Contract (including any consents or Governmental Approvals), and to
take all such other actions as such Party may reasonably be requested to take
by the other Party from time to time, consistent with the terms of this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, in order to effectuate the provisions
and purposes of this 

 



-53-  Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and the transfers of the Transferred
Assets and the Retained Assets and the assignment and assumption of the
Assumed Liabilities and the Retained Liabilities and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. Without limiting the foregoing, each Party
will, at the reasonable request, cost and expense of the other Party, take
such other actions as may be reasonably necessary to vest in such other Party
good and marketable title to the Assets allocated to such Party under this
Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements, free and clear of any Security
Interest, if and to the extent it is practicable to do so.

 

(c) On or prior to the Effective Time, Parent and SpinCo in their respective
capacities as direct and indirect equityholders of the members of their
Groups, shall each ratify any actions which are reasonably necessary or
desirable to be taken by Parent, SpinCo , for themselves and for and on behalf
of all members of their respective Groups, as the case may be, to
effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements.

8.2 _Tax Matters._

 

(a) _Tax Cooperation_. The Parties shall cooperate as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the filing of Tax
returns and any Tax proceeding with respect to Taxes imposed on or with
respect to the operations or activities of the Parent Group and the SpinCo
Group. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other
Partys request) the provision of records and information which are reasonably
relevant to any such Tax return or Tax proceeding and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information
and explanation of any material provided hereunder.

(b) _Treatment of Payments for Tax Purposes_. For all Tax purposes, the
Parties agree to treat (a) any payment required by this Agreement (other than
payments with respect to interest accruing after the Effective Time) as either
a contribution by Parent to SpinCo or a distribution by SpinCo to Parent, as
the case may be, occurring immediately prior to the Effective Time or as a
payment of an Assumed Liability or a Retained Liability; and (b) any payment
of interest as taxable or deductible, as the case may be, to the Party
entitled under this Agreement to retain such payment or required under this
Agreement to make such payment, in either case except as otherwise required by
applicable Law.

 

8.3 _Post-Effective Time Conduct_. The Parties acknowledge that, after the
Effective Time, each Party shall be independent of the other Party, with
responsibility for its own actions and inactions and its own Liabilities
relating to, arising out of or resulting from the conduct of its business,
operations and activities following the Effective Time, except as may
otherwise be provided in any Ancillary Agreement, and each Party shall
(except as otherwise provided in _Article IV_ ) use commercially reasonable
efforts to prevent such Liabilities from being inappropriately borne by the
other Party.

 

8.4 _Successors_. For a period of three years following the Effective Date, if
SpinCo or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges

(a) This Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same
agreement, and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other Party.

 

(b) This Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and the Exhibits, Schedules and
appendices hereto and thereto contain the entire agreement between the
Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, supersede all previous

and conversations with respect to such subject matter, and there are
no agreements or understandings between the Parties other than those set
forth or referred to herein or therein.

(c) Parent represents on behalf of itself and each other member of the Parent
Group, and SpinCo represents on behalf of itself and each other member of the
SpinCo Group, as follows:

 

(i) each such Person has the requisite limited partnership, company or other
power and authority and has taken all corporate or other action necessary in
order to execute, deliver and perform this Agreement and each Ancillary
Agreement to which it is a party and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby; and

Ancillary Agreement. Each Party expressly adopts and confirms each such
facsimile, stamp or mechanical signature (regardless of whether delivered in
person, by mail, by courier, by facsimile or by email in portable document
format (PDF)) made in its respective name as if it were a manual signature
delivered in person, agrees that it will not assert that any such signature or
delivery is not adequate to bind such Party to the same extent as if it were
signed manually and delivered in person and agrees that, at the

reasonably practicable cause each such Ancillary Agreement to be manually
executed (any such execution to be as of the date of the initial date thereof)
and delivered in person, by mail or by courier.

10.2 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. This Agreement (and
any claims or disputes arising out of or related hereto or to the
transactions

Group to irrevocably) (a) consent and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of
federal and state courts located in Delaware, (b) waive any objection to that
choice of forum based on venue or to the effect that the forum is not

thereto, as applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such consent shall

Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements (except as may be otherwise provided in
any such Ancillary Agreement) in whole ( _i.e._ , the assignment of a Partys
rights and obligations under this Agreement and all Ancillary Agreements all
at the same time) in connection with a change of control of a Party so long as
the resulting, surviving or transferee Person assumes all the obligations of
the relevant party thereto by operation of Law or pursuant to an agreement in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the other Party, provided that
the assigning Party remains responsible in full for all of its obligations
hereto unless otherwise agreed in writing by all of the parties hereto.
Nothing herein is intended to, or shall be construed to, prohibit either Party
or any member of its Group from being party to or undertaking a change

10.6 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement or the application thereof to any Person or circumstance is
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or
unenforceable, the remaining provisions hereof or thereof, or the application
of such provision to Persons or circumstances or in jurisdictions other than
those as to which it has been held invalid or unenforceable, shall remain in
full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated
thereby. Upon such determination, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith in
an effort to agree upon such a suitable and equitable provision to effect the
original intent of the Parties.

10.7 _Force Majeure_. No Party shall be deemed to be in default of this
Agreement or, unless otherwise expressly provided therein, any Ancillary
Agreement for any delay or failure to fulfill any obligation (other than a
payment obligation) hereunder or thereunder so long as and to the extent to
which any delay or failure in the fulfillment of such obligation is prevented,
frustrated, hindered or delayed as a consequence of circumstances of Force
Majeure. In the event of any such excused delay, the time for performance of
such obligations (other than a payment obligation) shall be extended for a
period equal to the time lost by reason of the delay. A Party claiming the
benefit of this provision shall, as soon as reasonably practicable after the
occurrence of any such event, (a) provide written notice to the other Party
of the nature and extent of any such Force Majeure condition; and (b) use
commercially reasonable efforts to remove any such causes and resume
performance under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, as applicable,
as soon as reasonably practicable.

 



-58- 10.8 _No Set-Off_. Except as set forth in any Ancillary Agreement or as
otherwise mutually agreed to in writing by the Parties, neither Party nor any
member of such Partys group shall have any right of set-off or other similar

any of the other transactions contemplated hereby or under any Ancillary
Agreement and prior to making any filings with any Governmental
Authority with respect thereto.

10.10 _Expenses_.

 

(a) _Expenses Incurred on or Prior to the Effective Time_. Except as otherwise
expressly set forth in this Agreement, the Merger Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement, or as otherwise agreed to in writing by the Parties, all costs and
expenses incurred or accrued on or prior to the Effective Time in connection
with the preparation, execution, delivery and implementation of this
Agreement and any Ancillary Agreement, the Separation, the Registration
Statement, the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the Distribution and the

extent not fully paid and discharged prior to the Effective Time, be charged
to and paid by SpinCo.

 

(b) _Expenses Incurred or Accrued After the Effective Time_. Except as
otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement,
or as otherwise agreed to in writing by the Parties, each Party shall bear its
own costs and expenses incurred or accrued after the Effective Time.

the Separation and the Distribution and shall remain in full force and effect.

10.13  _Waivers of Default_. Waiver by a Party of any default by the other
Party of any provision of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement shall not
be deemed a waiver by the waiving Party of any subsequent or other default,
nor shall it prejudice the rights of the other Party. No failure or delay by
a Party in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement or
any Ancillary Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall a single
or partial exercise thereof prejudice any other or further exercise thereof
or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

 



-59- 10.14 _Specific Performance_. Subject to the provisions of _Article VII_ , in
the event of any actual or threatened default in, or breach of, any of the
terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement,
the Party or Parties who are, or are to be, thereby aggrieved shall have the
right to specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief in
respect of its or their rights under this Agreement or such Ancillary
Agreement, in addition to any and all other rights and remedies at law or in
equity, and all such rights and remedies shall be cumulative. The Parties
agree that the remedies at law for any breach or threatened breach, including
monetary damages, are inadequate compensation for any loss and that any
defense in any Action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be
adequate is waived. Any requirements for the securing or posting of any bond
with such remedy are waived by each of the Parties.

 

10.15 _Amendments_. No provisions of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement
shall be deemed waived, amended, supplemented or modified by a Party, unless
such waiver, amendment, supplement or modification is in writing and signed by
the authorized representative of the Party against whom it is sought to
enforce such waiver, amendment, supplement or modification, and, prior to
the Effective Time, no Party shall, without the prior written consent of
TRGP, make any amendment, waiver (including any related determination under
_Section 3.3(b)_), supplement or modification of this Agreement in a manner
that is materially adverse to Parent, Parent GP, TRGP or any of TRGPs
Affiliates or that would prevent or materially impede consummation of the
Merger. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, TRGP shall
be an express third party beneficiary of, and shall have the right to
enforce, Section 9.1 and this Section 10.15.

agreement contemplated herein shall be deemed to refer to this Agreement or
such other agreement as of the date on which it is executed and as it may be
amended, modified or supplemented thereafter, unless otherwise specified.

 



-60- 10.17 _Limitations of Liability_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, neither SpinCo or any member of the SpinCo Group, on the one
hand, nor Parent or any member of the Parent Group, on the other hand, shall
be liable under this Agreement to the other for any punitive, exemplary,
special or similar damages in excess of compensatory damages of the other
arising in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (other than

Parent Group. SpinCo will cause to be performed, and hereby guarantees the

of the other members of its Group not to take any action or fail to take any
such action inconsistent with such Partys obligations under this Agreement,
any Ancillary Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

Unit Option and the denominator of which is the Aggregate SpinCo Unit Option
Consideration (such product, the " _Partial SpinCo Unit Option Cash Payment_
"); and (B) a number of SpinCo Common Units equal to the quotient of (I) the
