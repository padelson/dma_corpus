decision of the Auditors shall be solely based on (i) whether such item
objected to was prepared in accordance with the guidelines set forth in this

Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet and Preliminary Working Capital
Determination as agreed by Buyer and the Stockholder Representative or as

party.

Interests by wire transfer of immediately available funds a dollar amount
equal to the amount by which such excess exceeds $500,000, and (ii) if the
Cash and Cash Equivalents portion of the Closing Date Working Capital (as

such excess; and

Buyer by wire transfer of immediately available funds a dollar amount equal to
the amount of such excess.

  

  

Section 2.5 Options. As reflected in each Optionholder's Percentage Interest
set forth on Exhibit D, each Optionholder shall receive at the Closing, in
consideration of the cancellation of each Option held by such Optionholder, an
amount of the Closing Payment that is equal to the amount such Optionholder
would receive (on a per Option basis) if such Option was a Share, minus the
applicable exercise price of such Option; provided, however, that any Option
with respect to which the amount the applicable Optionholder would receive (on
a per Option basis) if such Option was a Share is less than the applicable
exercise price of such Option shall be cancelled and the applicable
Optionholder shall receive no payment therefor; provided further, however,
that amounts representing any applicable withholding for Taxes on the payments
made pursuant to this Section 2.5 shall not be paid to the applicable
Optionholder but instead shall be paid to the Company for the purpose of
making the required withholding payments to the appropriate Governmental
Bodies. At the Closing, the Options and any agreements providing therefor
shall terminate automatically without any action by the parties thereto and
shall thereafter be deemed null and void in all respects.

(a) Liability for Taxes.

  

  

(i) Sellers shall be liable for and pay, and pursuant to Article VIII (and
subject to the limitations thereof), each Seller agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless each Buyer Group Member from and against, any Taxes imposed on any of
the Acquired Companies for any taxable year or period that ends on or before
the Closing Date and, with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of such
Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date; provided, however,

harmless any Buyer Group Member from and against, (A) any Taxes shown as a
liability or reserve on the Closing Date Balance Sheet and included in the
Closing Date Working Capital, (B) any Taxes imposed on any of the Acquired
Companies or for which any of the Acquired Companies may otherwise be liable
as a result of transactions occurring on the Closing Date that are properly
allocable to the portion of the Closing Date after the Closing, (C) any Taxes

or any similar provisions of U.S. state, local or non-U.S. law as a result of
the purchase of the Shares or that result from Buyer, any Affiliate of Buyer,

notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any Taxes resulting from a
sale of any of the Acquired Companies by Buyer (Taxes described in this
proviso, hereinafter "Excluded Taxes"). Sellers shall be entitled to any

Returns (including amended Tax Returns) or other documents claiming any
refunds to which Sellers are entitled pursuant to the preceding sentence.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

43  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(ii) Buyer shall be liable for and pay, and pursuant to Article VIII (and
subject to the limitations thereof) shall indemnify and hold harmless each
Seller Group Member from and against, (A) any and all Taxes imposed on any of
the Acquired Companies, or for which any of the Acquired Companies may

Closing Date and, with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of such
Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date and (B) Excluded Taxes.
Except as otherwise provided herein, Buyer shall be entitled to any refund of
(or credit for) (x) Taxes described in clause (A) and (y) Excluded Taxes.

  

  

(iii) For purposes of Sections 7.1(a)(i) and (a)(ii), whenever it is necessary
to determine the liability for Taxes of the Acquired Companies for a Straddle
Period, the determination of such Taxes for the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on and including, and the portion of the Straddle Period beginning
after, the Closing Date shall be determined by assuming that the Straddle
Period consisted of two taxable years or periods, one which ended at the close
of the Closing Date and the other which began at the beginning of the day
following the Closing Date, and items of income, gain, deduction, loss or
credit of the Acquired Companies or with respect to the Shares for the
Straddle Period shall be allocated between such two taxable years or periods
on a "closing of the books basis" by assuming that the books of the Acquired
Companies were closed at the close of the Closing Date; provided, however,
that (x) transactions occurring on the Closing Date that are properly
allocable to the portion of the Closing Date after the Closing shall be
allocated to the taxable year or period that is deemed to begin at the
beginning of the day following the Closing Date and (y) exemptions, allowances
or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis, such as the deduction
for depreciation, shall be apportioned between such two taxable years or
periods on a daily basis.

one half of any real property transfer or gains Tax, sales Tax, use Tax, stamp
Tax, stock transfer Tax, or other similar Tax imposed on the transactions

(v) Any and all deductions related to (A) any bonuses paid on or prior to the
Closing Date by the Acquired Companies in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, (B) expenses with respect to Indebtedness being paid in
connection with the Closing, (C) all transaction expenses and payments that
are deductible for Tax purposes, including Transaction Expenses and other fees
and expenses of legal counsel, accountants, investment bankers and the
Stockholder Representative, (D) the transactions contemplated by Section 2.5,
(E) any disbursement of all or any portion of the Escrow Fund to Sellers in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement and (F) any disbursement of all or any
portion of the Expense Reserve to Sellers in accordance with Section 9.5 (such
deductions described in clauses (A) through (F), the "Transaction Tax
Deductions") shall be claimed in a taxable period (or portion of any Straddle
Period) ending on or prior to the Closing Date, except as otherwise required
by Requirements of Law. To the extent the Transaction Tax Deductions are not
fully utilized in such period, the Company shall elect to carry back any item
of loss, deduction, or credit from any Transaction Tax Deductions to prior
taxable years to the fullest extent permitted by Requirements of Law.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

44  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(vi) To the extent it is established in accordance with the procedures set
forth in this Section 7.1(a)(vi) that any Transaction Tax Deduction (including
a Transaction Tax Deduction included in a net operating loss carryforward)
results in a reduction of the federal, state or local income, franchise or
similar Taxes of the Acquired Companies, Buyer or any Affiliate or successor
thereof for any taxable year or period beginning after the Closing Date or for
the portion of any Straddle Period that begins after the Closing Date (each
such reduction, a "Tax Reduction"), then Buyer shall pay to Sellers an amount
equal to such Tax Reduction. For purposes of this Section 7.1(a)(vi), the
amount of any Tax Reduction shall be determined after taking into account all
other applicable items of income, gain, deduction or loss (or any other Tax
attributes) of the Acquired Companies, any Subsidiary of Buyer or any
Affiliate of Buyer. Buyer shall be required to claim, and to cause the
Acquired Companies, any Subsidiary of Buyer, any Affiliate of Buyer or
successor to claim, a deduction or similar Tax item (and to claim no income,
gain or similar Tax item) with respect to a Transaction Tax Deduction unless
there is no reasonable basis for doing so under the standards of Section 6662
of the Code. Any dispute regarding whether the standard set forth in the
preceding sentence is met, or regarding the calculation of the Tax Reduction,
shall be referred to the Auditor for final resolution in accordance with the
provisions of Sections 2.3(b) and 2.3(c). Payment of any Tax Reduction shall
be made (A) at the due date for filing the Tax Return (after taking into
account extensions) for the taxable year or period in which the Tax Reduction
in question occurs, in the event and to the extent that such Tax Reduction
reduces the tax required to be paid by the Acquired Companies with the filing
of such Tax Return for such year or period, together with interest on the
amount of such payment computed at the applicable federal rate (determined
under Section 1274 of the Code) from the due date for filing such Tax Return
(without taking into account extensions) through the date of payment, or (B)
at the time Buyer or the Acquired Companies receive the economic benefit of
such Tax Reduction through receipt of any actual tax refund or use of a net
operating loss resulting from such Tax Reduction, in the event and to the
extent that such Tax Reduction results in an actual tax refund or reduces
taxable income for such year or period below zero, as the case may be. Sellers
shall refund to Buyer any Tax Reduction to the extent it has been paid by
Buyer to Sellers but is subsequently recaptured by Buyer (other than as a
result of an audit, written inquiry, claim or demand by a taxing authority for
which indemnification is provided under Section 7.1(a)(i) including, for
example, by reason of any carry back of losses). To the extent that, after any
such recapture, the relevant Transaction Tax Deduction subsequently produces a
Tax Reduction (established in accordance with the above procedures), such Tax
Reduction shall be governed by this Section 7.1(a)(vi).

  

  

(vii) All Tax sharing agreements or similar agreements with respect to or
involving the Acquired Companies shall be terminated as of the Closing Date
and, after the Closing Date, the Acquired Companies shall not be bound thereby
or have any liability thereunder.

  

 

  

 

 

 

  

 

45  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Tax Returns.

  

  

(i) Buyer shall timely file or cause to be timely filed when due (taking into
account all extensions properly obtained) all Tax Returns that are required to
be filed by or with respect to the Acquired Companies after the Closing Date,
and Buyer shall remit, or cause to be remitted, any Taxes due in respect of
such Tax Returns (subject to reimbursement for Sellers' obligation to pay
Taxes for any Straddle Period pursuant to Section 7.1(a)). With respect to Tax
Returns to be filed by Buyer pursuant to the preceding sentence that relate to
taxable years or periods ending on or before the Closing Date and any Straddle
Period, (x) Buyer shall cause the Acquired Companies to engage and direct
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to prepare such Tax Returns in a manner consistent
with past practice, pursuant to which no position shall be taken, election
made or method adopted that is inconsistent with positions taken, elections
made or methods used in prior periods in filing such Tax Returns (including
any such position, election or method which would have the effect of
accelerating income to periods for which Sellers are liable or deferring
deductions to periods for which Buyer is liable), and (y) Buyer shall cause
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to submit such Tax Returns to both Buyer and the
Stockholder Representative not later than thirty (30) days prior to the due
date for filing such Tax Returns (or, if such due date is within forty-five
(45) days following the Closing Date, as promptly as practicable following the
Closing Date) for review and approval by Buyer and the Stockholder
Representative, which approval may not be unreasonably withheld, but may in
all cases be withheld if such Tax Returns were not prepared in accordance with
clause (x) of this sentence. Sellers, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other
hand, shall pay the other party for the Taxes for which Sellers or Buyer,
respectively, are or is liable pursuant to Section 7.1(a) but which are
payable with any Tax Return to be filed by the other party pursuant to this
Section 7.1(b) upon the written request of the party entitled to payment,
setting forth in detail the computation of the amount owed by Sellers or
Buyer, as the case may be, but in no event earlier than ten (10) Business Days
prior to the due date for paying such Taxes.

  

  

(ii) None of Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer shall (or shall cause or permit
the Acquired Companies to) file, amend, re-file or otherwise modify (or grant
an extension of any statute of limitation with respect to) any Tax Return
relating in whole or in part to the Acquired Companies with respect to any
taxable year or period ending on or before the Closing Date (or with respect
to any Straddle Period) without the prior written consent of the Stockholder
Representative.

  

  

(iii) Immediately after the Closing Date, Buyer and the Stockholder
Representative shall take the actions set forth on Schedule 7.1(b)(iii) with
respect to the sales or use Tax Returns specified therein.

  

  

(c) Contest Provisions.

  

  

(i) Buyer shall promptly notify the Stockholder Representative in writing upon
receipt by Buyer, any of its Affiliates or any of the Acquired Companies of
notice of any pending or threatened federal, state, local or foreign Tax
audits, examinations or assessments which might affect the Tax liabilities for
which Sellers may be liable pursuant to this Section 7.1; provided, however,
that the failure to give notice as provided in this Section 7.1(c)(i) shall
not affect Buyer's right to indemnification under this Agreement except to the
extent Sellers shall have been prejudiced by such failure.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

46  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(ii) The Stockholder Representative shall have the sole right to represent the
Acquired Companies' interests in any Tax audit or administrative or court
proceeding relating to taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date or
otherwise relating to Taxes for which Sellers may be liable pursuant to this
Section 7.1, and to employ counsel of its choice at its expense. In the case
of a Straddle Period, the Stockholder Representative shall be entitled to
participate at its expense in any Tax audit or administrative or court
proceeding relating (in whole or in part) to Taxes attributable to the portion
of such Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date and, with the
written consent of Buyer, and at Sellers' sole expense, may assume the entire
control of such audit or proceeding. None of Buyer, any of its Affiliates or
any of the Acquired Companies, on the one hand, or the Stockholder
Representative or any Seller, on the other hand, may settle any Tax claim for
any Taxes for which Sellers may be liable pursuant to Section 7.1(a), without
the prior written consent of the Stockholder Representative or Buyer,
respectively, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

  

  

(d) Assistance and Cooperation. After the Closing Date, Sellers and Buyer
shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates to):

  

  

(i) assist the other party in preparing any Tax Returns which such other party
is responsible for preparing and filing in accordance with Section 7.1(b);

  

  

(ii) cooperate fully in preparing for any audits of, or disputes with taxing
authorities regarding, any Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies;

  

  

(iii) make available to the other and to any taxing authority as reasonably
requested all information, records, and documents relating to Taxes of the
Acquired Companies;

  

  

(iv) provide timely notice to the other in writing of any pending or
threatened Tax audits or assessments of the Acquired Companies for taxable
periods for which the other may have a liability under this Section 7.1;

  

  

(v) furnish the other with copies of all correspondence received from any
taxing authority in connection with any Tax audit or information request with
respect to any such taxable period;

  

  

(vi) timely sign and deliver such certificates or forms as may be necessary or
appropriate to establish an exemption from (or otherwise reduce), or file Tax
Returns or other reports with respect to, Taxes described in Section
7.1(a)(iv) (relating to sales, transfer and similar Taxes); and

  

  

(vii) timely provide to the other powers of attorney or similar authorizations
necessary to carry out the purposes of this Section 7.1.

managers or employees of any of the Acquired Companies (or their respective
predecessors), as provided in (i) the Organizational Documents of any of the
Acquired Companies in effect on the date hereof or (ii) any Contract providing
for indemnification by any of the Acquired Companies of any such Person in

(b) On or prior to the Closing Date, Sellers shall have arranged and paid for
an irrevocable "directors and officers" tail insurance policy that provides
coverage for six (6) years following the Closing Date on terms identical to
existing coverage maintained by the Acquired Companies. Sellers shall also
have arranged and paid for similar irrevocable "fiduciary liability" and
"employment practices liability" tail insurance policies for six (6) years
following the Closing Date on terms substantially identical to existing
coverage maintained by the Acquired Companies. Buyer and its Affiliates shall
not cancel such tail insurance policies during such six (6)-year period.

  

  

(c) Buyer hereby agrees and acknowledges that this Section 7.2 shall be
binding on Buyer's successors and assigns.

goodwill of the Business, and as a material inducement to Buyer to enter into
this Agreement, for a period of five (5) years commencing on the Closing Date,
none of RT Partners, RT Investors, Daniel Bowen or Gregory Pritchard (the

(ii) solicit, entice, encourage or influence, or attempt to solicit, entice,
encourage or influence, any employee, consultant or independent contractor of
any Acquired Company (collectively, the "Specified Employees") to resign or
leave the employ of such Acquired Company, or otherwise hire, employ, engage
or contract with any Specified Employee to perform services other than for the
benefit of any Acquired Company; or

  

  

(iii) solicit, entice, encourage or influence, or attempt to solicit, entice,
encourage or influence, any customer of any Acquired Company as of the Closing
Date to alter, reduce or terminate its business relationship with any of the
Acquired Companies.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

48  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) In order for Buyer to protect and preserve the going concern value and
goodwill of the Business, and as a material inducement to Buyer to enter into
this Agreement, for a period of five (5) years commencing on the Closing Date,
neither RT Partners nor RT Investors shall, directly or indirectly (whether by
itself, through an Affiliate or in partnership or conjunction with, or as a
member, owner, consultant or agent of, any other Person), acquire or invest in
the companies set forth on Schedule 7.3(b) or the businesses operated thereby
as of the date hereof.

Affiliates from (A) advertising job openings by use of newspapers, magazines,
the Internet and other media not directed at individual Specified Employees,

expiration of such six (6)-month period (other than that permitted by clause
(A) of the foregoing), or (C) holding a passive investment of not more than
five percent (5%) of the outstanding securities of any class of any securities
of a company that is engaged in Competing Business Activities (whether
publicly traded or privately held), and (ii) nothing in Section 7.3(a) shall
preclude, prohibit or restrict any Restricted Party or any of its Affiliates
from acquiring, and following such acquisition, actively engaging in any
business that has a subsidiary, division, group, franchise or segment that is
engaged in Competing Business Activities (an "Acquired Business"), so long as
for the most recent fiscal year ending prior to the date of such acquisition,
the revenues derived from the Competing Business Activities were less than

Business.

  


 

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, in
the event of a breach of any of the provisions of Section 7.3(a) or Section
7.3(b) (the "Restrictive Covenants") by any Restricted Party:

  

  

(i) Buyer shall have the right and remedy, without regard to any other
available remedy, to (A) have the Restrictive Covenants specifically enforced
by any court of competent jurisdiction and (B) have issued an injunction
restraining any such breach without posting of a bond; it being understood and
agreed that any breach of any of the Restrictive Covenants would cause
irreparable and material Losses to Buyer and its Affiliates, the amount of
which cannot be readily determined and as to which neither Buyer nor any of
its Affiliates will have any adequate remedy at law or in damages; and

  

  

(ii) it is the desire and intent of Buyer and the Restricted Parties that the
Restrictive Covenants be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under
applicable Requirements of Law, Orders and public policies applied in each
jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought and if any Restrictive Covenant
shall be adjudicated finally to be invalid or unenforceable, such Restrictive
Covenant shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary in order that such
provision be valid and enforceable, the remainder of such Restrictive Covenant
shall not thereby be affected and shall be given full effect without regard to
invalid portions and such amendment shall apply only with respect to the
operation of the Restrictive Covenant in the particular jurisdiction in which
such adjudication is made.

Section 8.3 Claims Procedures.

  

  

(a) Subject to Section 8.4 with respect to Third Person Claims, any party
hereto seeking indemnification hereunder (the "Indemnified Party") shall
deliver to the party obligated to provide indemnification to such Indemnified
Party (the "Indemnitor") a notice (a "Claim Notice"), which shall be delivered
promptly after the Indemnified Party acquires actual knowledge of the basis
for a claim for indemnification hereunder and which shall describe in
reasonable detail the facts giving rise to such claim, and shall include in
such Claim Notice (if then known) the amount, or the method of computation of
the amount, of such claim and a reference to the provision of this Agreement
or any other agreement, document or instrument executed hereunder or in
connection herewith upon which such claim is based; provided, however, that
the failure or delay of the Indemnified Party to provide a Claim Notice
promptly to the Indemnitor shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations
hereunder except to the extent Sellers shall have been prejudiced by such
failure.

  

  

(b) After the timely delivery of any Claim Notice pursuant to Section 8.3(a),
the amount of indemnification to which an Indemnified Party shall be entitled
under this Article VIII shall be determined (i) by the written agreement
between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor, (ii) by a final judgment or
decree of any court of competent jurisdiction or (iii) by any other means to
which the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor shall agree. The judgment or
decree of a court shall be deemed final when the time for appeal, if any,
shall have expired and no appeal shall have been taken or when all appeals
taken shall have been finally determined. The Indemnified Party shall have the
burden of proof in establishing the amount of Losses and Expenses suffered by
it.

  

  

Section 8.4 Third Person Claims.

  

  

(a) Any party seeking indemnification provided for under this Agreement in
respect of, arising out of or involving a claim or demand made by any third
Person against the Indemnified Party (a "Third Person Claim") shall notify the
Indemnitor in writing, and in reasonable detail, of the Third Person Claim
within ten (10) Business Days (or reasonably more promptly dependent upon the
circumstances) after receipt by such Indemnified Party of written notice of
the Third Person claim. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the
Indemnitor, within five (5) Business Days after the Indemnified Party's
receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers)
received by the Indemnitor relating to the Third Person Claim. Any notice of a
claim by reason of any of the representations, warranties or covenants
contained in this Agreement shall refer to the provision of this Agreement
upon which such claim is based and describe in reasonable detail (to the
extent known) the facts giving rise to an alleged basis for the claim and the
amount of the liability asserted against the Indemnitor by reason of the Third
Person Claim; provided, however, that the failure or delay of the Indemnified
Party to give notice to the Indemnitor as provided in this Section 8.4 shall
not relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder except to the extent
the Indemnitor shall have been prejudiced by such failure.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

52  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) In the event of the initiation of a Third Person Claim, the Indemnitor
shall have the sole and absolute right after the receipt of notice, at its
option and at its own expense, to be represented by counsel of its choice,
which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party, and to
control, defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any
proceeding, claim, or demand which relates to any loss, liability or damage
indemnified against hereunder; provided, however, that the Indemnified Party
may participate in any such proceeding with counsel of its choice and at its
expense; provided, however, that the Indemnitor shall not be entitled to
assume or continue control of the defense of any Third Person Claim if (i) the
Third Person Claim relates to or arises in connection with any criminal
Proceeding or (ii) the Third Person Claim seeks an injunction or equitable
relief against any Indemnified Party. The parties hereto agree to cooperate
fully with each other in connection with the defense, negotiation or
settlement of any Third Person Claim. To the extent the Indemnitor elects not
to or fails to defend such Third Person Claim and the Indemnified Party
defends against or otherwise deals therewith, the Indemnified Party may retain
counsel at the expense of the Indemnitor, which counsel shall be reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnitor, and control the defense of such proceeding.
Neither the Indemnitor nor the Indemnified Party may settle any such
proceeding which settlement obligates the other party to pay money, to perform
obligations or to admit liability, or which fails to fully and unconditionally
release the other party from liability, without the consent of the other
party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  

  

(c) To the extent of any inconsistency between this Section 8.4 and Section
7.1(c) (relating to Tax contests), the provisions of Section 7.1(c) shall
control with respect to Tax contests.

  

  

Section 8.5 Determination of Indemnification Amounts.

  

  

(a) Without limiting the effect of any other limitation contained in this
Article VIII, for purposes of computing the amount of any and all Losses and
Expenses recoverable under this Article VIII, there shall be deducted (i) an
amount equal to the amount of any Tax Benefit realized by the Indemnified
Party or any of its Affiliates in connection with such Losses and Expenses or
any of the circumstances giving rise thereto and (ii) an amount equal to the
amount of any insurance proceeds, indemnification payments, contribution
payments or reimbursements actually received (net of costs of enforcement,
deductibles and retro-premium adjustments) by the Indemnified Party or any of
its Affiliates in connection with such Losses or Expenses or any of the
circumstances giving rise thereto (it being understood that the Indemnified
Party and any of its Affiliates shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain such Tax Benefits, proceeds, payments or reimbursements). The
calculation of Losses and Expenses shall not include losses arising because of
a change after the Closing in applicable Requirements of Law or accounting
principle. For purposes hereof, "Tax Benefit" shall mean any refund or credit
of Taxes to be paid or reduction in the amount of Taxes which otherwise would
be owed by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates, as applicable, in each
case computed at the highest marginal tax rates applicable to the recipient of
such benefit.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

53  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Any indemnification payment under this Agreement shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes.

  

  

(c) In any case where an Indemnified Party recovers from third Persons any
amount in respect of a matter with respect to which an Indemnitor has
indemnified it pursuant to this Article VIII, such Indemnified Party shall
promptly pay over to the Indemnitor the amount, if any, by which (x) the
aggregate amount recovered from the Indemnitor and from third Persons (after
deducting therefrom the full amount of the expenses incurred by it in
procuring such recovery) exceeds (y) the amount of Losses and Expenses
incurred by the Indemnified Party, but not in excess of the sum of (i) any
amount previously so paid by the Indemnitor to or on behalf of the Indemnified
Party in respect of such matter and (ii) any amount expended by the Indemnitor
in pursuing or defending any claim arising out of such matter.

  

  

(d) Each of the parties agrees to take all reasonable steps to mitigate their
respective Losses and Expenses upon and after becoming aware of any event or
condition which could reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses and
Expenses that are indemnifiable hereunder.

  

  

Section 8.6 Exclusive Remedy. Each Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the
other hand, acknowledges and agrees that, from and after the Closing, except
in the case of fraud and except for the equitable remedies expressly
contemplated in Sections 7.3 and 10.15, its sole and exclusive remedy against
the other party and its respective Affiliates, including for the Losses and
Expenses of any Buyer Group Member or Seller Group Member, as applicable,
relating (directly or indirectly) to the subject matter of this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby, regardless of whether such claims arise
in contract, tort, breach of warranty or any other legal or equitable theory,
shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article
VIII. Buyer hereby agrees and acknowledges that the Escrow Fund shall be the
sole source of recovery for any indemnification claim by Buyer Group Members
under Section 8.1(b), except in respect of fraud by any Seller.

  

  

ARTICLE IX

  

  

STOCKHOLDER REPRESENTATIVE

  

  

Section 9.1 Appointment of Stockholder Representative.

  

  

(a) Each Seller hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints RT Partners as the
representative of Sellers (the "Stockholder Representative") to act as such
Seller's true and lawful attorney-in-fact and agent and authorizes the
Stockholder Representative acting for such Seller and in such Seller's name,
place and stead, in any and all capacities to do and perform every act and
thing required or permitted to be done in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (other than with respect to Section 7.3), as
fully to all intents and purposes as such Seller might or could do in person,
including as follows:

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

54  

  

 

 

 

  

(i) to take any and all action on behalf of Sellers from time to time as the
Stockholder Representative may deem necessary or desirable to fulfill the
interests and purposes of this Section 9.1 and to engage agents and
representatives (including accountants and legal counsel) to assist in
connection therewith;

  

  

(ii) to take any and all action on behalf of Sellers from time to time as the
Stockholder Representative may deem necessary or desirable to make or enter
into any waiver, amendment, agreement, certificate or other document
contemplated hereunder;

  

  

(iii) to deliver all notices required to be delivered by Sellers;

  

  

(iv) to receive all notices required to be delivered to Sellers;

  

  

(v) to seek indemnification from Buyer under Article VIII, including the right
to prosecute, defend, settle, compromise or take any other action with respect
to any claim related thereto; and

  

  

(vi) to execute the Escrow Agreement and make all decisions required or
allowed to be made by the Stockholder Representative pursuant to the
provisions thereof (including the right to defend, settle, compromise or take
any other action on behalf of Sellers with respect to any matter for which any
Buyer Group Member seeks indemnification under Article VIII).

  

  

(b) Each Seller grants unto said attorney-in-fact and agent full power and
authority to do and perform each and every act and thing necessary or
desirable to be done in connection with the matters described above, as fully
to effect all intents and purposes as such Seller might or could do in person,
hereby ratifying and confirming all that the Stockholder Representative may
lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue hereof. Each Seller further
acknowledges and agrees that, upon execution of this Agreement, with respect
to any delivery by the Stockholder Representative of any waiver, amendment,
agreement, certificate or other documents executed by the Stockholder
Representative pursuant to this Agreement, such Seller shall be bound by such
documents as fully as if such Seller had executed and delivered such documents
itself.

  

  

Section 9.2 Actions by Sellers. Each Seller agrees that, notwithstanding
Section 9.1, at the request of the Stockholder Representative, such Seller
shall take all actions necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby (including delivery of such Seller's Shares and acceptance
of the Purchase Price therefor) individually on such Seller's own behalf, and
delivery of any other documents required of Sellers pursuant to the terms
hereof.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

55  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 9.3 Liability of Seller Representative. The Stockholder Representative
shall not have by reason of this Agreement a fiduciary relationship in respect
of any Seller. The Stockholder Representative shall not be liable to any
Seller for any action taken or omitted by it hereunder or under any other
document contemplated hereby, or in connection therewith, except that the
Stockholder Representative shall not be relieved of any liability imposed by
Requirements of Law for gross negligence or willful misconduct. The
Stockholder Representative shall not be liable to any Seller for any
apportionment or distribution of payments made by it in good faith, and if any
such apportionment or distribution is subsequently determined to have been
made in error, the sole recourse of any Seller to which payment was due, but
not made, shall be to recover from the other Sellers any payment in excess of
the amount to which they are determined to have been entitled. The Stockholder
Representative shall not be required to make any inquiry concerning either the
performance or observance of any of the terms, provisions or conditions of
this Agreement. Each Seller acknowledges and agrees that the Stockholder
Representative shall not be obligated to take any actions and shall be
entitled to take such actions as the Stockholder Representative deems
appropriate in its sole discretion. Each Seller further agrees to indemnify
and hold the Stockholder Representative harmless from and against any loss,
liability or expense arising in connection with any act or omission as the
Stockholder Representative, except for any liability imposed by Requirements
of Law for gross negligence or willful misconduct.

  

  

Section 9.4 Reliance by Buyer. Each Seller agrees that Buyer shall be entitled
to unconditionally assume that any action taken or omitted, or any document
executed by, RT Partners purporting to act as the Stockholder Representative
under or pursuant to this Agreement or any Seller Ancillary Agreement or in
connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
Seller Ancillary Agreement has been unconditionally authorized by Sellers to
be taken, omitted to be taken, or executed on their behalf so that they will
be legally bound thereby, and each Seller agrees not to institute any claim,
lawsuit, arbitration or other proceeding against Buyer alleging that RT
Partners did not have the authority to act as the Stockholder Representative
on behalf of Sellers in connection with any such action, omission or
execution. No modification or revocation of the power of attorney granted by
Sellers herein to RT Partners to serve as the Stockholder Representative shall
be effective as against Buyer until Buyer has received a document signed by
each Seller effecting said modification or revocation.

  

  

Section 9.5 Expense Reserve. Each Seller hereby acknowledges and agrees that
$3,000,000 (the "Expense Reserve") shall be withheld and paid directly to an
account maintained by the Stockholder Representative (or a financial
institution selected by the Stockholder Representative) as a fund for the fees
and expenses (including any legal fees and expenses) of, and other amounts
payable by, the Stockholder Representative in connection with this Agreement.
Any balance of the Expense Reserve not utilized for such purposes shall be
paid, when deemed appropriate by the Stockholder Representative in its sole
discretion, to Sellers in accordance with their Percentage Interests by the
Stockholder Representative. In the event that the Expense Reserve shall be
insufficient to satisfy the fees and expenses of, and other amounts payable
by, the Stockholder Representative, and in the event there are any remaining
funds in the Escrow Fund to be distributed to Sellers immediately prior to the
final distribution from the Escrow Fund to Sellers pursuant to the terms of
the Escrow Agreement, the Stockholder Representative shall be entitled to
recover any such expenses from the Escrow Fund to the extent of such funds
prior to such distribution of funds to Sellers. The Stockholder Representative
shall also be entitled to recover any remaining expenses or other amounts
directly from Sellers, and, for the avoidance of doubt, the Stockholder
Representative shall not have any obligation to personally advance funds in
connection with the performance of any of its duties under this Agreement.

GENERAL PROVISIONS

  

  

Section 10.1 Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants. All
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement shall, in each
case, survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, but shall terminate upon the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the
Closing Date. All covenants and other agreements contained in this Agreement
shall survive until performed in accordance with their respective terms.

  

  

Section 10.2 Confidential Nature of Information. For a period of five (5)
years commencing on the Closing Date, Sellers shall not, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, use, disclose or make
available to any Person other than Buyer any confidential information relating
to the Business or any Acquired Company acquired prior to the Closing Date
(including confidential information relating to the customers and suppliers of
the Acquired Companies). This Section 10.2 shall not, however, prohibit a
Seller and its Affiliates from using or disclosing confidential information
(i) that is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a
result of a breach of a confidentiality obligation of Sellers or their
Affiliates, (ii) with the prior written consent of Purchaser, (iii) required
by such Seller to perform, comply with or enforce the terms of this Agreement
or any Ancillary Agreement or (iv) to the extent required by a Requirement of
Law or request of a Governmental Body, provided, in the case of clause (iv),
that to the extent practicable or lawful such Seller gives reasonable prior
notice of the proposed disclosure to Buyer and Buyer has a reasonable
opportunity to contest the same.

  

  

Section 10.3 No Public Announcement. Neither Buyer nor Sellers shall, without
the approval of the others (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), make or cause to be made any press release or other
public announcement concerning the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except as and to the extent that any such party shall be so
obligated by applicable Requirements of Law, in which case the other party
shall be advised and the parties shall use their reasonable efforts to cause a
mutually agreeable release or announcement to be issued. Sellers acknowledge,
and have been so advised, that Buyer Parent will be required to file this
Agreement with the Securities and Exchange Commission as a "material
contract".

  

  

Section 10.4 Notices. All notices or other communications required or
permitted hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given or made when
delivered personally, sent by registered or certified mail (postage prepaid,
return receipt requested), or sent by an internationally recognized overnight
courier service, addressed as follows:

or to such other Person or address or facsimile number as such party may
indicate by written notice delivered to the other parties hereto.

  

  

Section 10.5 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns; provided, however, that no party to this Agreement may
assign its rights or delegate its obligations under this Agreement without the
express prior written consent of the other parties to this Agreement.

  

  

Section 10.6 Access to Records after Closing. Subject to Section 10.2, for a
period of six years after the Closing Date, the Stockholder Representative and
its representatives shall have reasonable access to all of the books and
records of the Acquired Companies to the extent that such access may
reasonably be required by the Stockholder Representative (on its own behalf or
on behalf of any other Seller) in connection with any legitimate matter
relating to or affected by the operations of the Acquired Companies on or
prior to the Closing Date; provided, however, that Buyer shall not be required
to violate any obligation of confidentiality to which Buyer or any Acquired
Company is subject or to waive any privilege which any of them may possess in
discharging its obligations pursuant to this Section 10.6; provided further,
however, that in any such case, Buyer shall, and shall cause any applicable
Acquired Company to, reasonably cooperate with the Stockholder Representative
to seek an appropriate remedy to permit the access contemplated hereby. Such
access shall be afforded by Buyer upon receipt of reasonable advance notice
and during normal business hours; provided, however, that the Stockholder
Representative acknowledges and agrees that such access shall not interfere
unreasonably with the operations of the Acquired Companies or Buyer. The
Stockholder Representative shall be solely responsible for any costs or
expenses incurred by it pursuant to this Section 10.6. If Buyer or the
Acquired Companies shall desire to dispose of any of such books and records
prior to the expiration of such six-year period, Buyer shall, prior to such
disposition, give the Stockholder Representative a reasonable opportunity, at
the Stockholder Representative's expense, to segregate and remove such books
and records as the Stockholder Representative may select.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

58  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 10.7 Entire Agreement; Amendments. This Agreement, the Exhibits and
Schedules referred to herein and the documents delivered pursuant hereto
contain the entire understanding of the parties hereto with regard to the
subject matter contained herein or therein, and supersede all other prior
representations, warranties, agreements, understandings or letters of intent
between or among any of the parties hereto. This Agreement shall not be
amended, modified or supplemented except by a written instrument signed by
Buyer and the Stockholder Representative (on behalf of Sellers).

  

  

Section 10.8 Interpretation. Disclosure of any fact or item in any Schedule
hereto referenced by a particular section in this Agreement shall be deemed to
have been disclosed with respect to every other section in this Agreement so
long as the applicability of such matter to such section is reasonably
apparent on the face of such disclosure. Neither the specification of any
dollar amount in any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement
nor the inclusion of any specific item in any Schedule hereto is intended to
imply that such amount, or higher or lower amounts, or the item so included or
other items, are or are not material, and no party shall use the fact of the
setting forth of any such amount or the inclusion of any such item in any
dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation, item
or matter not described herein or included in any Schedule is or is not
material for purposes of this Agreement. Unless this Agreement specifically
provides otherwise, neither the specification of any item or matter in any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of
any specific item in any Schedule hereto is intended to imply that such item
or matter, or other items or matters, are or are not in the ordinary course of
business, and no party shall use the fact of the setting forth or the
inclusion of any such item or matter in any dispute or controversy between the
parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein or
included in any Schedule is or is not in the ordinary course of business for
purposes of this Agreement. The fact that a document or other information has
been made available to Buyer on the Data Site shall not constitute disclosure
of any item or matter that is required to be included in any Schedule hereto.

  

  

Section 10.9 Waivers. Any term or provision of this Agreement may be waived,
or the time for its performance may be extended, by the party or parties
entitled to the benefit thereof. Any such waiver shall be validly and
sufficiently authorized for the purposes of this Agreement if, as to any
party, it is authorized in writing by an authorized representative of such
party. The failure of any party hereto to enforce at any time any provision of
this Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver of such provision, nor in
any way to affect the validity of this Agreement or any part hereof or the
right of any party thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. No
waiver of any breach of this Agreement shall constitute a continuing waiver or
shall be held to constitute a waiver of any other or subsequent breach.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

59  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 10.10 Expenses. Except as expressly set forth herein, and except for
the filing fee under the HSR Act (one half of which shall be reimbursed by
Sellers to Buyer, which amount shall be reflected in Exhibit C), each party
hereto will pay all costs and expenses incident to its negotiation and
preparation of this Agreement and to its performance and compliance with all
agreements and conditions contained herein on its part to be performed or
complied with, including the fees, expenses and disbursements of its counsel
and independent public accountants.

  

  

Section 10.11 Partial Invalidity. Wherever possible, each provision hereof
shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable law, but in case any one or more of the provisions contained herein
shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent, but only to the
extent, of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without
invalidating the remainder of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision
or provisions or any other provisions hereof, unless such a construction would
be unreasonable.

  

  

Section 10.12 Execution in Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts, each of which shall be considered an original instrument, but
all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and shall become
binding when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties
hereto and delivered to Sellers and Buyer.

  

  

Section 10.13 Further Assurances. Each of the parties hereto agrees to use its
reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all action, to do or
cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other party in doing,
all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and
regulations or otherwise to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the execution and delivery of such instruments, and the
taking of such other actions as the other party hereto may reasonably require
in order to carry out the intent of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 10.14 Disclaimer of Warranties. Buyer acknowledges that it has
conducted to its satisfaction an independent investigation and verification of
the financial condition, results of operations, assets, liabilities,
properties and projected operations of the Acquired Companies and, in making
its determination to proceed with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, Buyer has relied on the results of its own independent
investigation and verification and the representations and warranties of each
Seller expressly and specifically set forth in Articles IV and V, as qualified
by the Schedules. Sellers make no representations or warranties with respect
to any projections, forecasts or forward-looking information provided to
Buyer. EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES IN THIS AGREEMENT, EACH
SELLER IS SELLING THE SHARES (AND THE BUSINESS AND ASSETS OF THE ACQUIRED
COMPANIES REPRESENTED THEREBY) ON AN "AS IS, WHERE IS" BASIS AND EACH SELLER
DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS AND GUARANTIES, WHETHER
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AND NO SELLER MAKES ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY AS TO
MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NO IMPLIED
WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

60  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 10.15 Enforcement.

  

  

(a) Each of the parties hereto agrees that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement to be performed by
Buyer or Sellers were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached. Accordingly, Buyer and each Seller, as applicable,
shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, including an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by the other
parties, as applicable, and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions
of this Agreement in any state or federal court in the State of New York, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at law
or in equity. Buyer and each Seller hereby further waive (i) any defense in
any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate and
(ii) any Requirements of Law to post security as a prerequisite to obtaining
equitable relief.

  

  

(b) Each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting of
an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief when expressly
available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement on the basis that the other
parties have an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is
not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. Any party seeking
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement when
expressly available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement when expressly
available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall not be required to
provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or
injunction. Each of the parties hereto further agrees that the seeking of the
remedies pursuant to Section 10.15(a) shall not constitute a waiver by any
party seeking such remedies of its right to seek any other form of relief that
may be available to it under this Agreement or otherwise.

  

  

Section 10.16 Non-Recourse. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or
in any other documents delivered pursuant hereto, (i) this Agreement may only
be enforced against, and any Proceeding based upon, arising out of or related
to a breach of this Agreement by Sellers may only be made against, Sellers,
(ii) none of any Seller's Affiliates or such Seller's (in the case of any such
Seller which is not a natural person) or its Affiliates' respective current,
former or future directors, officers, employees, agents, partners, managers,
members, stockholders, assignees, or representatives (collectively, the
"Seller Related Parties") shall have any liability for any liabilities of the
parties hereto for any such Proceeding (whether in tort, contract or
otherwise) for breach of this Agreement or in respect of any oral
representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith, and (iii)
Buyer shall have no rights of recovery in respect of this Agreement against
any Seller Related Party, whether by or through attempted piercing of the
corporate veil, by or through any Proceeding (whether in tort, contract or
otherwise) by or on behalf of a Seller against any Seller Related Party, by
the enforcement of any judgment, fine or penalty or by virtue of any statute,
regulation or other applicable Requirements of Law, or otherwise.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

61  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 10.17 Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
internal Requirements of Law (without regard to principles of conflicts of
law) of the State of New York. By the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, Buyer and Sellers submit to the personal jurisdiction of any state
or federal court in the State of New York in any suit or proceeding arising
out of or relating to this Agreement. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING
OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

  

  

Section 10.18 Certain Matters regarding Representation of the Company and
Certain Sellers.

  

  

(a) Sidley Austin LLP ("Sidley") has acted as counsel for the Company, RT
Partners and RT Investors (the "Clients") in connection with this Agreement,
the Buyer Ancillary Agreements and the Seller Ancillary Agreements and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (the "Transaction Engagement")
and in that connection not as counsel for any other Person, including Buyer or
its Affiliates. Only the Clients shall be considered clients of Sidley in the
Transaction Engagement. The parties hereto acknowledge the community of
interest between the Clients and certain Sellers which are not Clients in
light of the fact that Sellers hold all of the equity of the Company.
Accordingly, notwithstanding that the Clients are or were clients in the
Transaction Engagement, upon and after the Closing, all communications between
Sellers, the Seller Representative or the Company and Sidley in the course of
the Transaction Engagement shall be deemed to be attorney-client confidences
that belong solely to Sellers and the Seller Representative and not the
Company. Buyer shall not have access to any such communications, or to the
files of Sidley relating to the Transaction Engagement, whether or not the
Closing shall have occurred. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
notwithstanding that the Company is or was a client in the Transaction
Engagement, upon and after the Closing, (i) Sellers and the Seller
Representative shall be the sole holders of the attorney-client privilege with
respect to the Transaction Engagement, and none of the Company, Buyer or any
of their respective Affiliates shall be a holder thereof, (ii) to the extent
that files of Sidley in respect of the Transaction Engagement constitute
property of the Clients, including the Company, only the Sellers or the Seller
Representative shall hold such property rights, and (iii) Sidley shall have no
duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such attorney-client communications
or files to the Company, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates by reason
of any attorney-client relationship between Sidley and the Company or
otherwise.

  

  

(b) If Sellers or the Seller Representative so desire, and without the need
for any consent or waiver by the Company or Buyer, Sidley shall be permitted
to represent Sellers or the Seller Representative after the Closing in
connection with any matter, including anything related to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Buyer Ancillary Agreements and the Seller
Ancillary Agreements or any disagreement or dispute relating thereto. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, after the Closing, Sidley
shall be permitted to represent Sellers or the Seller Representative, any of
their Affiliates or representatives, or any one or more of them, in connection
with any negotiation, transaction or dispute (whereas "dispute" includes
litigation, arbitration or other adversarial proceedings) with Buyer, the
Company or any of their Affiliates or representatives under or relating to
this Agreement, the Buyer Ancillary Agreements and the Seller Ancillary
Agreements, any transaction contemplated by this Agreement, the Buyer
Ancillary Agreements or the Seller Ancillary Agreements, and any related
matter, such as claims for indemnification and disputes involving non-
solicitation or other agreements entered into in connection with this
Agreement, the Buyer Ancillary Agreements or the Seller Ancillary Agreements.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

62  

  

 

 

 

  

(c) Upon and after the Closing, the Company shall cease to have any attorney-
client relationship with Sidley, unless Sidley is specifically engaged in
writing by the Company to represent the Company after the Closing and either
such engagement involves no conflict of interest with respect to Sellers or
the Seller Representative or Sellers or the Seller Representative, as
applicable, consent in writing at the time to such engagement. Any such
representation of the Company by Sidley after the Closing shall not affect the
provisions of this Section 10.18(c). For example, and not by way of
limitation, even if Sidley is representing the Company after the Closing,
Sidley shall be permitted simultaneously to represent Sellers or the Seller
Representative in any matter, including any disagreement or dispute relating
thereto.

  

  

(d) Sellers (on behalf of themselves and the Company), the Seller
Representative and Buyer consent to the foregoing arrangements and waive any
actual or potential conflict of interest that may be involved in connection
with any representation by Sidley permitted hereunder.
