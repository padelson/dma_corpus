1 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
covenants, representations, warranties, and agreements contained herein, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE I - THE MERGER

1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL,
at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall merge with and into Seller. Seller
shall continue as the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ")
in the Merger and shall continue its corporate existence under the laws of the
State of Delaware. Upon consummation of the Merger, the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall terminate.

 

1.2 _Effective Time_. The Merger shall become effective as set forth in the
certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), executed in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL, which shall be filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on or before the Closing Date.
The term " _Effective Time_ " shall be the date and time when the Merger
becomes effective as set forth in the Certificate of Merger.

1.3 _Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at the offices of
Goodwin Procter LLP, Exchange Place, Boston, Massachusetts, unless another
place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto, at 10:00 a.m., local
time, on a date (the " _Closing Date_ ") specified by the parties, which shall
be the final Business Day of the calendar month in which the satisfaction or
waiver (subject to applicable Law) of the latest to occur of the conditions
set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that relate to action to
be taken at the Closing, but subject to satisfaction of such conditions at the
Closing) occurs, unless this Agreement has been theretofore terminated
pursuant to its terms or unless extended by mutual agreement of the parties.

1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger
shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and in the appropriate
provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject thereto, at the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
possess all the rights, privileges, powers and franchises, and be subject to
all of the restrictions, disabilities, and duties of Seller and Merger Sub, as
provided under Section 259 of the DGCL. 

1.5 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. At the Effective Time, the
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Seller (the " _Seller
Charter_ "), as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
amended to be identical to the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub (the
" _Merger Sub Charter_ "), as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time (which shall contain such provisions as are necessary to give full effect
to the exculpation, reimbursement, advancement of expenses, contribution and
indemnification provided for in Section 6.7 hereof), except the name of
Seller as the Surviving Corporation shall be Apache Design Solutions, Inc. and
the provisions of the Merger Sub Charter relating to the

 



2  incorporator of the Merger Sub shall be omitted, and as so amended shall be
the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended as provided and in accordance with the DGCL (the " _Surviving
Corporation Charter_ "). From and after the Effective Time, the Bylaws of
Seller (the " _Seller Bylaws_ "), as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be amended and restated to be identical to the Bylaws
of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (which
shall contain such provisions as are necessary to give full effect to the
exculpation, reimbursement, advancement of expenses, contribution
and indemnification provided for in Section 6.7 hereof), and as so amended
shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter amended as
provided therein and in accordance with applicable Law (the " _Surviving
Corporation Bylaws_ ").

1.6 ___Directors and Officers_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the directors of the Surviving
Corporation shall be James E. Cashman III, Dr. Andrew T. Yang, Emily Chang,
Maria T. Shields, Sheila DiNardo and Lee Detwiler, until their successors are
duly elected, appointed or qualified or until their earlier death,
resignation, or removal in accordance with the Surviving Corporation Charter
and the Surviving Corporation Bylaws.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the officers of Seller at the Effective
Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, until their

ARTICLE II - EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE SELLER CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF
SHARES

 

2.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of any party hereto or of the
holder of any shares of the capital stock of Seller or capital stock of Merger
Sub:

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of the common stock of Merger
Sub, par value $0.0001 per share (the " _Merger Sub Common Stock_ "), issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into one validly issued, fully paid, and nonassessable share of common stock,
$0.0001 par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

(b)  _Cancellation of Certain Stock_. All shares of common stock, $0.0001 par
value per share, of Seller (" _Seller Common Stock_ "), Series A Preferred
Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of Seller (" _Seller Series A Stock_ ")
and Series B Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of Seller ("
_Seller Series B Stock_ "), and, together with Seller Common Stock and Seller
Series A Stock, " _Seller Stock_ ") that are owned by Seller or any wholly
owned Subsidiary of Seller and any shares of Seller Common Stock owned by
Buyer, Merger Sub, or any other wholly owned Subsidiary of Buyer immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist
and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(c) _Conversion of Seller Stock_. Subject to Section 2.9, other than
Dissenting Shares, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of the

 



3  Buyer, the Seller or the Seller Stockholders, each share of Seller Stock
shall be converted into a right to receive a portion of the Merger
Consideration in accordance with this Agreement, and the Merger Consideration
shall be allocated among, and payment shall be paid by Buyer through the
Payment Agent to, the Seller Stockholders in accordance with Section 2.2. As
of the Effective Time, all shares of Seller Stock shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist,
and each holder of a certificate representing any such shares of Seller Stock
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the applicable Merger Consideration, pursuant to this Section 2.1(c),
subject to the provisions of this Agreement. From and after the Effective Time
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Seller Stock which were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, stock certificates of Seller are presented to the Surviving Corporation
or the Payment Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this Article 2.

(d) Seller Stock Options and Related Matters.

 

(i) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, but in any
event prior to the Closing Date, the Board of Directors of Seller (or, if
appropriate, any committee administering the Seller Stock Option Plans) shall
adopt such resolutions or use its reasonable best effort to take such other
actions as are required to provide for the conversion of each Seller Stock
Option as provided in this Section 2.1(d).

(ii) At the Effective Time, each Seller Stock Option that is outstanding,
unexercised, vested and exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time,
after giving effect to any acceleration of vesting applicable to such Seller
Stock Option in connection with the Merger (" _Vested Options_ "), shall be
cancelled in exchange for the right to receive a portion of the Merger
Consideration from Buyer as set forth in Section 2.2(c)(iv). On and after the
Effective Time, the Vested Options shall terminate and cease to
be outstanding. All amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.1(d)(ii) shall
be subject to any required tax withholding.

(iii) At the Effective Time, each Seller Stock Option that is outstanding,
unexercised and not vested and exercisable immediately prior to the Effective
Time, after giving effect to any acceleration of vesting applicable to such
Seller Stock Option in connection with the Merger (" _Assumed Options_ "),
shall be converted into and become an option to purchase shares of common
stock, par value $.01 per share (" _Buyer Common Stock_ ") of Buyer as
provided below in this Section 2.1(d)(iii), and Buyer shall assume such
Assumed Option in accordance with this Section 2.1(d)(iii) and the terms (as
in effect as of the date of this Agreement) of the Seller Stock Option Plans
and/or the seller option agreement by which such Assumed Option is evidenced.
All rights to purchase Seller Common Stock under Assumed Options shall,
effective as of the Effective Time, thereupon be converted into rights
to purchase Buyer Common Stock. Accordingly, from and after the Effective
Time: (A) each Assumed Option may be exercised solely for Buyer Common Stock;
(B) the number of shares of Buyer 

 



4  Common Stock subject to each Assumed Option shall be determined by
multiplying the number of shares of Seller Common Stock that were subject to
such Assumed Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange
Ratio, and rounding the resulting number down to the nearest whole number of
shares of Buyer Common Stock; (C) the per share exercise price for the Buyer
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each Assumed Option shall be
determined by dividing the per share exercise price of Seller Common Stock
subject to such Assumed Option, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, by the Exchange Ratio, and rounding the resulting exercise
price up to the nearest whole cent; and (D) any restriction on the exercise
of any Assumed Option shall continue in full force and effect and the term,
exercisability, vesting schedule (including acceleration of vesting agreements
in existence) and other provisions of such Assumed Option shall otherwise
remain unchanged as a result of the conversion of such Assumed Option or
otherwise. Buyer shall file with the SEC, no later than thirty (30) days after
the Closing, a registration statement on Form S 8 (or any successor form),
relating to the shares of Buyer Common Stock issuable with respect to the
Assumed Options.

 

2.2 ___Merger Consideration_.

(a) The aggregate consideration (collectively, the " _Merger Consideration_ ")
to be paid by Buyer to the Seller Securityholders is: (a) $275,000,000 minus
(b) the amount of Seller Transaction Expenses plus or minus (c) the amount of
the Net Cash Balance, if any, as determined pursuant to Section 2.4 minus (d)
the amount of Final Indebtedness of Seller and its Subsidiaries outstanding as
of Closing plus (e) if and when earned, the amount of any Contingent Payments
pursuant to Section 2.6.

(b) Immediately following the Effective Time, Buyer shall pay the following
amounts by wire transfer of immediately available funds: (i) the amount of
Seller Transaction Expenses outstanding at Closing shall be paid to the
parties designated on the Seller Schedule and (ii) an amount equal to (A)
$275,000,000 minus (B) the amount payable pursuant to clause (i) of this
Section 2.2(b) plus (C) the Preliminary Net Cash Surplus, if any, minus (D)
the Preliminary Net Cash Deficit, if any, minus (E) the amount of Estimated
Indebtedness (such amount pursuant to this clause (ii), the " _Initial Merger
Consideration_ ") of which (W) $15,000,000 shall be paid to and deposited with
the Escrow Agent pursuant to Section 2.3 (the " _General Escrow Amount_ "),
(X) $2,000,000 shall be paid to and deposited with the Escrow Agent solely to
secure the payment obligations of the Sellers, if any, pursuant to Section 2.4
(the " _Net Cash Escrow Amount_ "), (Y) $3,500,000 shall be paid to and
deposited with the Escrow Agent solely to secure the payment obligations of
the Sellers pursuant to Section 6.13 (the " _Tax Escrow Amount_ ") and (Z)
$500,000 shall be paid and deposited with an account to be designated by the
Securityholders Representative to fund the costs and expenses of the
Securityholders Representative pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement (the " _Securityholders  Representative Expense
Fund_"). The remainder of the Initial Merger Consideration shall be paid to
the Payment Agent for subsequent payment to the Seller Securityholders
pursuant to Section 2.2(c), subject to the procedures set forth in Section
2.7 and the Payment Agent Agreement (such remainder, the " _Closing Payment_
").

 



5 (c) The Closing Payment shall be paid to the Seller Securityholders following
Closing by the Payment Agent pursuant to Section 2.7 and the Payment Agent
Agreement as follows:

(i) The holders of Seller Common Stock and Seller Preferred Stock, on an as-
converted basis, shall be entitled to an amount per share of Seller Common
Stock outstanding, on an as-converted basis, and held by such holder as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time equal to the difference of (A) the
quotient of (1) the sum of (a) the Initial Merger Consideration plus (b) the
Aggregate Vested Option Exercise Price divided by (2) the sum of (a) the
number of outstanding shares of Seller Stock, on an as-converted basis, as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time plus (b) the number of shares subject
to outstanding Vested Options, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
(such amount in clause (A), the " _Initial Per Common Share Payment_ ") minus
(B) the product of (1) the sum of (A) the General Escrow Amount, (B) the Net
Cash Escrow Amount, (C) the Tax Escrow Amount and (D) the
Securityholders Representative Expense Fund multiplied by (2) the quotient
of (a) Initial Per Common Share Payment divided by (b) the sum of (1) the
Initial Merger Consideration plus (2) the Aggregate Vested Option Exercise
Price (such amount in clause (B), the " _Escrow Per Common Share Payment_ ");
and

(ii) The holders of Vested Options shall be paid an amount per share of
Seller Common Stock subject to holders Vested Options equal to the difference
of (A) the difference of (1) the Initial Per Common Share Payment minus (2)
the per share exercise price for such option (the " _Initial Per Vested
Option Amount_ ") minus (B) the product of (1) the sum of (A) the General
Escrow Amount, (B) the Net Cash Escrow Amount, (C) the Tax Escrow Amount and
(D) the Securityholders Representative Expense Fund multiplied by (2) the
quotient of (a) the Initial Per Common Share Payment divided by (b) the sum of
(1) the Initial Merger Consideration plus (2) the Aggregate Vested
Option Exercise Price (such amount in clause (B), the " _Escrow Per Vested
Option Payment_ ").

(d) Upon the release of the General Escrow Amount, the Net Cash Escrow
Amount, the Tax Escrow Amount or the Securityholders Representative Expense
Fund pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, each
Seller Securityholder will receive an amount in cash for each share of Seller
Common Stock, each share of Seller Preferred Stock, on an as-converted basis,
and each Vested Option held by such Seller Securityholder equal to the Escrow
Per Common Share Payment or the Escrow Per Vested Option Payment,
respectively; _provided, however,_ that all or a portion of such distribution
may be delayed (other than the Securityholders Representative Expense Fund),
and the amount of the Escrow Per Common Share Payment or the Escrow
Per Vested Option Payment, as applicable, may be reduced, pursuant to the
provisions of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

 

(e) All additional Merger Consideration shall be payable to the Seller
Stockholders, on an as-converted basis, and the holders of Vested Options, on
a fully exercised basis, in an amount per share of Seller Common Stock equal
to the quotient of (A) the amount of such additional Merger Consideration
divided by (B) the sum of (1) the number of outstanding 

 



6  shares of Seller Stock, on an as converted basis, as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time plus (2) the number of shares of Seller Common Stock
subject to all outstanding Vested Options as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

2.3 _Escrow; General Escrow Amount; Net Cash Escrow Amount; Tax
Escrow Amount; Securityholders  Representative Expense Fund_.

(a) Immediately following the Effective Time, Buyer shall deposit with
Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (the " _Escrow Agent_ ") (i) the General

separate interest-bearing escrow (the " _Net Cash Escrow Account_ ") and (iii)

allocable to the Seller Securityholders as set forth on the Final Conversion

7 2.4 _Merger Consideration Adjustments._

 

(a) For the purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Net Cash Balance_ " means
the difference of (A) the aggregate amount of cash and cash equivalents of
Seller and its Subsidiaries minus (B) the aggregate amount of accounts payable
and accrued expenses of Seller and its Subsidiaries (other than the Seller
Transaction Expenses), calculated in accordance with GAAP and consistent with
Sellers past practices; _provided_ that for purposes of the foregoing current
Tax liabilities as of the Closing shall be included as accrued expenses of
Seller, current Tax assets as of the Closing shall be included as cash and
cash equivalents of Seller and deferred Tax liabilities and deferred Tax
assets shall not be taken into account in such calculation.

(b) Not less than three (3) Business Days before the Closing Date, Seller
shall deliver to Buyer an estimate of Net Cash Balance as of the Closing Date
(the " _Preliminary Net Cash Balance_ "), and which shall be reasonably
acceptable to Buyer, as part of the Seller Schedule.

(c) At the Closing: 

(i) if the Preliminary Net Cash Balance is negative, Buyer shall reduce the
Closing Payment by an amount equal to the absolute value of the Preliminary
Net Cash Balance (the " _Preliminary Net Cash Deficit_ "); and

(ii) if the Preliminary Net Cash Balance is positive, Buyer shall increase the
Closing Payment by an amount equal to the absolute value of the Preliminary
Net Cash Balance (the " _Preliminary Net Cash Surplus_ ").

(d) Within seventy-five (75) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver
to the Securityholders Representative and the former Chief Financial Officer
of the Seller a statement (" _Buyer s Statement_") setting forth Buyers
determination of the Net Cash Balance as of the Closing Date, the amount
of Final Seller Transaction Expenses and the amount of Final Indebtedness
each as of the Closing Date, such determination to be made in accordance with
GAAP. Within forty five (45) days of receipt of Buyers Statement, Buyer and
the Securityholders Representative will either agree to accept the
calculation of Net Cash Balance, Final Seller Transaction Expenses and Final
Indebtedness as set forth on Buyers Statement or shall submit any dispute to
an Arbitrating Accountant in accordance with Section 2.5 below. Once accepted
by the parties or on the issuance of a determination by the independent
accountant, the Net Cash Balance, Final Seller Transaction Expenses and Final
Indebtedness will be deemed final and binding on the parties.

(e) Within five (5) Business Days after the Net Cash Balance, Final Seller
Transaction Expenses and Final Indebtedness are deemed final as set forth in
Section 2.4(d):

(i) if the Net Cash Balance is less than the Preliminary Net Cash Balance,
Buyer shall deduct from the Net Cash Escrow Account an amount equal to the
Preliminary Net Cash Balance minus the Net Cash Balance;

 

(ii) if the Net Cash Balance is more than the Preliminary Net Cash Balance,
Buyer shall pay to the Payment Agent an amount equal to the Net Cash Balance
minus the Preliminary Net Cash Balance to be distributed to the Seller
Stockholders and holders of Vested Options as if it were additional Merger
Consideration;

 



8 (iii) If the Seller Transaction Expense Adjustment is positive, the
Buyer shall deduct from the Net Cash Escrow Account, an amount equal to the
Seller Transaction Expense Adjustment;

 

(iv) If the Seller Transaction Expense Adjustment is negative, Buyer shall pay
to the Payment Agent an amount equal to the Seller Transaction Expense
Adjustment minus the amount to be distributed to the Seller Stockholders and
holders of Vested Options as if it were additional Merger Consideration.

 

(v) If the Indebtedness Adjustment is positive, Buyer shall deduct from the
Net Cash Escrow Account, an amount equal to the Indebtedness Adjustment;

(vi) If the Indebtedness Adjustment is negative, Buyer shall pay to the
Payment Agent an amount equal to the Indebtedness Adjustment minus the amount
to be distributed to the Seller Stockholders and holders of Vested Options as
if it were additional Merger Consideration.

In the event that Buyer is entitled to deduct amounts from the Net Cash Escrow
Account and the Buyer is required to make additional payments to the Seller
Stockholders and holders of Vested Options pursuant to this Section 2.4(e),
the amounts shall be offset against each other, and the net amount shall
either be deducted from the Net Cash Escrow Account or be paid to the Seller
Stockholders and holders of Vested Options depending upon which amount is
greater.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, subject to the
limitations in Article IX, in the event that Buyer is entitled to deduct
amounts from the Net Cash Escrow Account pursuant to this Section 2.4 in
excess of the Net Cash Escrow Account, Buyer shall be entitled to deduct the
entire Net Cash Escrow Amount from the Net Cash Escrow Account, and any
additional owed amounts shall be deducted from the General Escrow Amount, and,
after the General Escrow Amount has been exhausted, Buyer and the other Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to any further amounts from any
other source pursuant to this Agreement.

2.5 _Submission of Dispute to an Independent Accountant_. Disputes
with respect to Buyers Statement shall be resolved as follows, subject to
Article IX:

(a) The Securityholders Representative shall have sixty (60) days after
receipt of Buyers Statement (the " _Dispute Period_ ") to deliver to Buyer a
written notice (a " _Dispute Notice_ ") disputing any of the elements of or
amounts reflected in the calculations of the Net Cash Balance, Final Seller
Transaction Expenses and Final Indebtedness as reflected on Buyers Statement,
with specific reference to those items, amounts or calculations which the
Securityholders Representative disputes and setting forth the
Securityholders Representatives calculation of the Net Cash Balance, Final
Seller Transaction Expenses and Final Indebtedness (the " _Disputed Items_ ").
If Buyer does not receive a Dispute Notice within the Dispute Period, Buyers
Statement shall be deemed to have been accepted and agreed to by the
Securityholders

 



9  Representative in the form in which it was delivered to the Securityholders
Representative, and shall be final and binding upon the parties hereto. Any
Dispute Notice sent to Buyer by the Securityholders Representative within
the Dispute Period shall set forth in reasonable detail the elements and
calculations with which the Securityholders Representative disagree. The
Securityholders Representative shall not amend, supplement or modify a
Dispute Notice that has been delivered to Buyer after the end of the sixty
(60) day period following delivery of the Buyers Statement to the
Securityholders Representative. Any elements or calculations contained in
Buyers Statement which are not disputed in the Dispute Notice shall be deemed
to be accepted by the Securityholders Representative. For thirty (30) days
after delivery of any such Dispute Notice, Buyer and the Securityholders
Representative shall attempt to resolve such dispute and agree in writing upon
the Net Cash Balance, Final Seller Transaction Expenses and Final
Indebtedness.

 

(b) If Buyer and the Securityholders Representative are unable to resolve the
Disputed Items within the thirty (30) day period after Buyers receipt of a
Dispute Notice, the Securityholders Representative and Buyer shall jointly
engage Ernst and Young LLP as arbitrator (the " _Arbitrating Accountant_ "). If
Ernst and Young LLP is unable or unwilling to serve as Arbitrating Accountant,
the Arbitrating Accountant shall be a nationally recognized accounting firm
selected promptly by agreement of Buyer and the Securityholders
Representative or, if they are unable to agree, by lot conducted jointly by
Buyers accountant and the Securityholders Representatives accountant (or an
accountant selected by the Securityholders Representative) from among the
remaining "Big Four" nationally-recognized accounting firms or any other
mutually acceptable nationally-recognized accounting firm. Any Disputed Item
shall only be deemed resolved if such resolution is set forth in a writing
signed by Buyer and the Securityholders Representative and no other
communication, oral or written, including by electronic mail, shall establish
any such resolution. Neither Buyer nor the Securityholders Representative
shall engage in any communication of any kind, whether oral or written, with
the Arbitrating Accountant except in the presence (in person or
telephonically) of the other such party, or, in the case of written
communications (including electronic mail), without such other party
simultaneously receiving a copy of any such communications. The Arbitrating
Accountants sole function shall be to arbitrate each Disputed Item in
accordance with the requirements and principles of Section 2.4. The
Arbitrating Accountant shall allow Buyer and the Securityholders
Representative to present their respective positions regarding the Disputed
Items and shall thereafter as promptly as possible provide the parties hereto
a written determination of each Disputed Item, and such written determination
shall be final and binding upon the parties hereto, and judgment may be
entered on the award. The Arbitrating Accountant may, at its discretion,
conduct a conference concerning the Disputed Items, at which conference each
party shall have the right to present additional documents, materials and
other information and to have present its advisors, counsel and accountants.
In connection with such process, there shall be no other hearings or any oral
examinations, testimony, depositions, discovery or other similar proceedings.
The Arbitrating Accountant shall address only the issues in dispute, shall
make its decision solely on the basis of the evidence and position papers
presented to it, and may not assign a value to any Disputed Item greater than
the greatest value for such Disputed Item claimed by a party or less than the
smallest value for such Disputed Item claimed by a party. The Arbitrating
Accountant shall promptly, and in any event within sixty (60) calendar days
after the date of its appointment, render its decision on the question in
writing and finalize the Net Cash Balance, Final Seller Transaction Expenses
and Final Indebtedness. The Securityholders 

 



10  Representative and Buyer shall pay the portion of the fees and costs of the
Arbitrating Accountant (" _Arbitration Costs_ "), if any, determined by
multiplying the amount of the Arbitration Costs by a fraction the numerator
of which is (with respect to each party) (A) the positive difference between
(1) the aggregate amount payable pursuant to Section 2.4(e) based on the
submissions by such party to the Arbitrating Accountant on Buyers Statement
or the Dispute Notice, as applicable and (2) the determination of the actual
aggregate amount payable pursuant to Section 2.4(e) based on the
determinations of the Net Cash Balance, Final Seller Transaction Expenses and
Final Indebtedness made by the Arbitrating Accountant and the denominator of
which is (B) the aggregate difference between each partys submission of the
amount payable pursuant to Section 2.4(e) based on such partys submission of
Net Cash Balance, Final Seller Transaction Expenses and Final Indebtedness as
set forth on Buyers Statement or the Dispute Notice, as applicable. Upon
final resolution of Net Cash Balance, Final Seller Transaction Expenses,
Final Indebtedness and each Disputed Item, Buyers Statement shall be revised
to reflect such resolution and the Arbitrating Accountants determination
shall become binding on all parties.

 

2.6 _Contingent Payments_. In the event that Dr. Andrew T. Yang remains an
employee of Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any of Buyers Subsidiaries
on each of the first (1st), second (2nd) and third (3rd) anniversaries of the
Closing Date (each an " _Anniversary Date_ "), within five (5) Business Days
following each such Anniversary Date, Buyer shall pay to the Payment Agent an
amount equal to $4,000,000 to be distributed by the Payment Agent to the
Seller Stockholders and holders of Vested Options as additional Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.2(e) (each such payment a " _Contingent
Payment_ " and together, the " _Contingent Payments_ "). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that Dr. Andrew T. Yangs employment with Buyer,
the Surviving Corporation or any of Buyers Subsidiaries is terminated by
Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any of Buyers Subsidiaries, as
applicable, other than for Cause (as defined in Dr. Andrew T. Yangs offer
letter with Seller, dated as of April 14, 2011), or upon his death or
disability in any event at any time prior to the third Anniversary Date, the
Buyer shall pay to the Payment Agent the amount of each subsequent Contingent
Payment on each subsequent Anniversary Date that occurs after such a
termination of employment or death or disability for distribution by the
Payment Agent to the Seller Stockholders and holders of Vested Options as
additional Merger Consideration. Once paid, any amounts paid under this
Section 2.6 shall not be subject to recapture by any party nor shall any such
amount to be paid be offset against any claims for indemnification under this
Agreement.

 

2.7 _Payment and Surrender of Evidence of Seller Securities; Payment Fund._

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Buyer or Merger Sub shall designate Deutsche
Bank Trust Company Americas or such other bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to Seller to act as payment agent in connection with the Merger
(the " _Payment Agent_ "). Subject to the terms of Section 2.3 and Section 2.8
hereof, at or prior to the Effective Time, Buyer will provide to and shall
deposit in trust with, the Payment Agent, an amount in cash equal to the
aggregate amount of Initial Merger Consideration payable to Seller
Securityholders under this Agreement. Until used for that purpose, the funds
shall be invested by the Payment Agent, as directed by Buyer, and in
accordance with a Payment Agent Agreement between Buyer and the Payment Agent,
in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or obligations
of an agency of the United States of America which are backed by the full
faith and credit of the United States of America or in deposit accounts or
certificates of deposit with commercial banks.

 



11 (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof but in any event
prior to the Effective Time, Buyer shall cause to be mailed or otherwise made
available to each holder of record of outstanding Seller Securities that will
be converted pursuant to Section 2.1 into the right to receive Merger
Consideration, and who has signed a written stockholder consent or joinder
and waiver agreement as part of the Stockholders Consent, a letter of
transmittal in the form to be provided by Buyer (a " _Letter of Transmittal_
"), such other documents as may reasonably be required by Buyer (including
any required Form W-8 or W-9) and instructions for use in effecting such
holders delivery of all Seller Stock and vested Seller Stock Options held by
such holder to the Payment Agent in exchange for the right to receive the
Merger Consideration in respect thereof as contemplated in Section 2.1.
Promptly after the Effective Time, Buyer shall cause to be mailed or otherwise
made available to each holder of record of outstanding Seller Securities, and
who has not, immediately following the Effective Time, signed a written
stockholder consent or joinder and waiver agreement as part of the
Stockholders Consent, such other documents as may reasonably be required by
Buyer (including any required Form W-8 or W-9) and instructions for use in
effecting such holders delivery of such Seller Securities to the Payment
Agent in exchange for the Merger Consideration in respect thereof as
contemplated in Section 2.1. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Article II, from and after the Effective Time each certificate or other
evidence that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented a Seller
Security shall be deemed to represent only the right to receive its portion
of the Merger Consideration determined pursuant to this Agreement then due and
shall not evidence any interest in, or any right to exercise the rights of a
stockholder or other security holder of Buyer or the Surviving Corporation or
any other rights. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any surrendered certificate,
notice of option grant or other evidence of ownership of a Seller Security
that represents Dissenting Shares shall be returned to the
Person surrendering such certificate or other evidence unless such Person
waives all dissenters rights at or prior to such time. If the Merger
Consideration is to be paid to a person other than the one in whose name such
certificate or other evidence surrendered in exchange therefor is registered,
it shall be a condition to such payment that such certificate or other
evidence be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of
transfer) and accompanied by evidence that any applicable stock or other
security transfer taxes and other applicable taxes have been paid or provided
for.

(c) The Payment Agent and Buyer, as the case may be, shall not be obligated
to deliver cash to which a holder of Seller Securities would otherwise be
entitled as a result of the Merger until such holder surrenders the
certificate or certificates or notice of option grants or other evidence of
ownership, as the case may be, representing the shares of Seller Securities
for exchange as provided in this Section 2.7, or, executes an appropriate
affidavit of loss and indemnity agreement (without a bond requirement
posting).

(d) Attached as Schedule 2.7(d) is a schedule (the " _Preliminary Conversion
Schedule_ ") showing as of the date hereof (i) the name of each Seller
Stockholder and the number, class and series of shares of Seller Stock held by
each such Seller Stockholder; (ii) the name of each holder of Vested Options
and the number of shares of Seller Common Stock subject to each Vested Option
held by each such holder of Vested Options and the exercise price per share;
and (iii) a calculation of (A) the aggregate amount of Initial Per Common
Share 

 



12  Payments and Escrow Per Common Share Payments (assuming no claims for
Damages) payable to each Seller Securityholder pursuant to Section 2.2 and (B)
the aggregate amount of Initial Per Vested Option Amounts and Escrow Per
Vested Option Payments payable to each holder of Vested Options in respect of
all Vested Options held by such holder. No later than two (2) Business Days
prior to the expected Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a schedule
(the " _Final Conversion Schedule_ ") showing, as of the Closing Date, (i) the
name of each Seller Stockholder and the number, class and series of shares of
Seller Stock held by each such Seller Stockholder; (ii) the name of each
holder of Vested Options and the number of shares of Seller Common Stock
subject to each Vested Option held by each such holder of Vested Options and
the exercise price per share; (iii) a calculation of (A) the aggregate amount
of Initial Per Common Share Payments and Escrow Per Common Share Payments
(assuming no claims for Damages) payable to each Seller Securityholder
pursuant to Section 2.2 and (B) the aggregate amount of Initial Per Vested
Option Amounts and Escrow Per Vested Option Payments payable to each holder of
Vested Options in respect of all Vested Options held by such holder and (iv)
the amounts to be withheld from the Merger Consideration to which each
Seller Securityholder is entitled, including the type and amount of each Tax
to be withheld from each Seller Securityholder. The chief executive officer
and the chief financial officer of Seller shall certify that the Final
Conversion Schedule correctly reflects the calculations required to be made
pursuant to this Agreement, and Seller shall deliver the Final Conversion
Schedule together with such certification to Buyer at Closing.

 

(e) At any time which is more than twelve (12) months after the Effective
Time, Buyer shall be entitled to require the Payment Agent to deliver to it
any funds which had been deposited with the Payment Agent and have not been
disbursed in accordance with this Article II (including, without limitation,
interest and other income received by the Payment Agent in respect of the
funds made available to it), and after the funds have been delivered to
Buyer, Seller Securityholders entitled to payment in accordance with this
Article II shall be entitled to look solely to Buyer (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar applicable Laws) for payment of the Merger
Consideration upon surrender of the certificates or other evidence of
ownership of a Seller Security held by them, without any interest thereon. Any
Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed as of a date which is immediately
prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become
property of any government entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, become the property of Buyer free and clear of any claims or interest
of any person previously entitled thereto.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article II, none of the
Payment Agent, Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any party hereto or agent
thereof shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash delivered to a
public official as required by any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

 

2.8 _Appraisal Rights._

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any shares
(the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") of the Seller Common Stock that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by
Seller Stockholders who, in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL or Chapter
13 of the California Corporations Code (the " _Appraisal Rights Provisions_
"), (i) have not voted in favor of adopting this Agreement, (ii)

 



13  shall have demanded properly in writing appraisal for such shares, (iii)
have otherwise complied in all respects with the Appraisal Rights Provisions,
and (iv) have not effectively withdrawn, lost, or failed to perfect their
rights to appraisal (the " _Dissenting Stockholders_ "), will not be converted
into Merger Consideration, but at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, shall be cancelled
and shall cease to exist and shall represent the right to receive only those
rights provided under the Appraisal Rights Provisions.

(b) Seller shall give Buyer and Merger Sub prompt notice of any demands
received by Seller for the exercise of appraisal rights with respect to shares
of Seller Stock and Buyer shall have the right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Seller shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer
to settle, any such demands.

2.9 _Performance Awards_. In connection with the Merger, not more than
five (5) Business Days prior to and effective on the Closing Date, Buyer and
Buyers Board of Directors or designated committee shall grant to the
employees of Seller or its Subsidiaries listed on Schedule 2.9 hereto, awards
of restricted stock units with respect to Buyer Common Stock, each such award
to cover a number of shares of Buyer Common Stock determined by dividing (i)
the value set forth opposite the employees name on Schedule 2.9 (which shall
be in preliminary form on the date of this Agreement and in final form prior
to Closing) (the aggregate value of all such awards to equal $13 million) by
(ii) the volume weighted-average closing price per share of Buyer Common Stock
on Nasdaq for the fifteen (15) trading days prior to the Closing Date, and
each such award to vest and be paid in accordance with the achievement by the
Surviving Corporation of certain non-GAAP revenue and operating income
criteria for each of the three (3) full fiscal year periods beginning on
January 1, 2012, as mutually agreed to by Buyer and Sellers Chief Executive
Officer prior to Closing in accordance with and subject to the terms and
conditions of Buyers Fourth Amended and Restated 1996 Stock Option and
Incentive Plan and the applicable award agreement (the " _Performance Awards_
"). To be eligible for such awards, each employee must enter into an IP
Protection Agreement. Except as set forth above or in an offer letter
executed in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, the other
terms and conditions of the Performance Awards shall be the same as the
standard terms and conditions applicable to grants of restricted stock units
made by Buyer to its employees.

2.10 _Employee Incentive Bonus_. In each of the three (3) full fiscal years
beginning on January 1, 2012, the Seller Continuing Employees shall be
eligible to receive an annual incentive bonus (the " _Employee Incentive
Bonus_ "), based on the achievement by the Surviving Corporation of certain
non-GAAP revenue, operating income and technology milestone criteria, as
mutually agreed to by Buyer and the Sellers Chief Executive Officer prior to
Closing, and as subsequently modified by the Buyer and Dr. Yang, in an
aggregate amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the aggregate base salaries of
such Seller Continuing Employees who are then employed by Buyer, the Surviving
Corporation or one of their Subsidiaries for such fiscal year. The individual
amounts of the Employee Incentive Bonus for each Seller Continuing Employee
shall be mutually agreed to by Buyers and Sellers Chief Executive Officers.
The final aggregate amount of such Employee Incentive Bonuses is subject to
approval by the Buyers Board of Directors or a committee thereof. Except as
set forth in an offer letter executed in

 



14  connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, the payment of an
Employee Incentive Bonus to any Seller Continuing Employee shall be subject to
the same terms and conditions as incentive bonuses are payable to Buyers
employees.

2.11 _Withholding Rights_. Buyer, Seller and the Surviving Corporation shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement such amounts as are required to deduct and withheld under the
Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Taxing
Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the persons receiving the amounts otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

ARTICLE III - REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER

Except as set forth in the disclosure schedules delivered concurrently with
the execution of this Agreement to Buyer and Merger Sub (the " _Seller
Disclosure Schedule_ "), which shall identify any exceptions to the
representations, warranties and covenants contained in this Agreement (with
specific reference to the particular Section or subsection to which such
information relates; provided that an item disclosed in any Section or
subsection shall be deemed to have been disclosed for each other Section or
subsection of this Agreement to the extent the relevance is
reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure), Seller hereby represents
and warrants to Buyer and Merger Sub as follows:

3.1  _Corporate Organization._

(a) Seller is a corporation, duly organized, validly existing, and in good

requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease, or operate all of its

conducted. Seller is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in
corporate good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the
business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and
assets owned, leased, or operated by it makes such licensing or qualification
necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified and in
corporate good standing would not, either individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Seller Material Adverse Effect. The Seller
Charter and the Seller Bylaws, copies of which have previously been made
available to Buyer and Merger Sub, are true, correct, and complete copies of
such documents as currently in effect.

 

(b) Each of Sellers Subsidiaries is a corporation or legal entity, validly
existing and, if applicable, in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its organization. Each of Sellers Subsidiaries has all
requisite corporate power or other power and authority to own, lease, or
operate all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is
now being conducted. Each of Sellers Subsidiaries is duly licensed or
qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the
business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and
assets owned, leased, or operated by it makes such licensing or qualification
necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified and in good
standing would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Seller Material Adverse Effect.

 



15 (c) The Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws or equivalent organizational
documents of each of Sellers Subsidiaries that currently have operations,
copies of which have previously been made available to Buyer and Merger Sub,
are true, correct, and complete copies of such documents as currently in

3.12 _Employee Benefit Programs._  

(a) The Employee Programs maintained by Seller or an ERISA Affiliate or with
respect to which Seller or an ERISA Affiliate has or may have liabilities are
referred to herein as the " _Seller Employee Programs_ ". Section 3.12(a) of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of each Seller Employee
Program.

 

(b) Each Seller Employee Program which is intended to qualify under Section
401(a) or 501(c)(9) of the Code has received a favorable determination or
approval letter from the IRS regarding its qualification under such section
and has, to the Knowledge of Seller, been qualified under the applicable
section of the Code from the effective date of such Seller Employee Program
through and including the Closing Date (or, if earlier, the date that all of
such Seller Employee Programs assets were distributed). To the Knowledge of
Seller, no event or omission has occurred which would cause any Seller
Employee Program to lose its qualification or otherwise fail to satisfy the
relevant requirements to provide tax-favored benefits under the applicable
Code Section (including without limitation Code Sections 105, 125, 401(a) and
501(c)(9)). No partial termination (within the meaning of Section 411(d)(3)
of the Code) has occurred with respect to any Employee Program.

(c) Neither Seller nor any ERISA Affiliate knows of any failure of any party
to comply in all material respects with any laws applicable with respect to
the Seller Employee Programs. With respect to any Seller Employee Program,
there has been no (i) "prohibited transaction," as defined in Section 406 of
ERISA or Code Section 4975, (ii) failure to comply with any provision of
ERISA, other applicable Law, or any agreement, or (iii) non deductible
contribution, which, in the case of any of (i), (ii), or (iii), would subject
Seller or any ERISA Affiliate to material liability either directly or
indirectly (including, without limitation, through any obligation of
indemnification or contribution) for any damages, penalties, or taxes, or any
other loss or expense. No litigation or governmental administrative proceeding
(or investigation) or other proceeding (other than those relating to routine
claims for benefits) is pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened
with respect to any such Seller Employee Program. All payments and/or
contributions required to have been made (under the provisions of any
agreements or other governing documents or applicable Law) with respect to all
Seller Employee Programs, for all periods prior to the Closing Date in all
material respects, either have been made or have been accrued.

(d) Neither Seller nor any ERISA Affiliate has within the past six years
maintained an Employee Program subject to Title IV of ERISA, Section 412 of
the Code, Section 302 of ERISA or a Multiemployer Plan. None of the Seller
Employee Programs has ever in the past six years provided health care or any
other non-pension benefits to any employees after their employment is
terminated (other than as required by part 6 of subtitle B of title I of ERISA
or state continuation laws or benefits in the nature of severance pay
pursuant to an employment, severance or similar agreement) or has ever been
promised to provide such post-termination benefits.

fidelity bond) related to such Seller Employee Program; (vii) any registration
statement or other filing made pursuant to any federal or state securities law
and (viii) all material correspondence to and from any state or federal
agency within the last three years with respect to such Seller Employee
Program.

(f) Each Seller Employee Program may be amended, terminated, or otherwise
modified by Seller in accordance with its terms.

(g) Except as set forth in Section 3.12(g) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,
neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any employment or
consulting agreements with any current or former manager, director, officer,
or employee which required payment of cash compensation in the calendar year

of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (B) providing any term
of employment or compensation guarantee, or (C) severance benefits after the
termination of employment of such director or employee; or (ii) agreement or
plan binding Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, including any stock option
plan, stock appreciation right plan, restricted stock plan, stock purchase
plan, or severance benefit plan, any of the benefits of which shall be
increased, or the vesting of the benefits of which shall be accelerated, by
the occurrence of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the value of any of the benefits of which shall be calculated on the basis of
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(i) Each Employee Program that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan"
within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code has been operated and

Buyer shall use their reasonable best efforts to:

 

(i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and
to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things
necessary, proper, or advisable to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated hereby (including, without limitation, the Merger)
as promptly as practicable;

 

(ii) as promptly as practicable, obtain from any Governmental Authority or any
other third party any consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals,
authorizations, or orders required to be obtained or made by Seller or Buyer
or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the authorization,
execution, and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (including, without limitation, the Merger);

(iii) as promptly as practicable, make all necessary filings, and thereafter
make any other required submissions, with respect to this Agreement and the
Merger required under (A) the Exchange Act and any other applicable federal or
state securities laws, (B) the HSR Act and any related governmental request
thereunder, and (C) any other applicable Law; and

 



46 (iv) execute or deliver any additional instruments necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the
purposes of, this Agreement (including, without limitation, the Merger).

Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with each other in connection with the
making of all such filings, including providing copies of all such documents
to the non-filing party and its advisors prior to filing and, if requested,
accepting reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested in connection
therewith. Seller and Buyer shall use their respective reasonable best efforts
to furnish to each other all information required for any application or other
filing to be made pursuant to the rules and regulations of any applicable Law
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, Buyer and Seller agree that nothing contained in this
Section 6.3(a) shall modify or affect their respective rights and
responsibilities under Section 6.2(b).

(b) During the Pre-Closing Period, Seller and Buyer shall use reasonable best
efforts to obtain the authorizations, consents, orders and approvals and to
make filings from or with any Governmental Authority or other third party
necessary for their execution and delivery of, and the performance of
their respective obligations pursuant to, this Agreement. The parties hereto
will not take any action that will have the effect of delaying, impairing or
impeding the receipt of any required approvals and shall promptly respond to
any requests for additional information from any Governmental Authority. Each
of Seller and Buyer hereby covenants and agrees to use its reasonable best
efforts to secure termination of any waiting periods under the HSR Act and any
other federal, state or foreign law, regulation, or decree designed to
prohibit, restrict, or regulate actions for the purpose or effect of
monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively, " _Antitrust Laws_ ") and
to obtain the approval of the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust
Division of the United States Department of Justice or any other applicable
Governmental Authority, for the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall require Buyer or
Seller, in connection with the receipt of any regulatory approval, to divest,
sell, lease, license, hold separate, restrict or otherwise dispose of, or
agree to divest, sell, lease, license, hold separate, restrict or otherwise
dispose of any business whatsoever conducted by or proposed to be conducted
by or any assets whatsoever of Buyer, Seller or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, or to litigate or formally contest any proceedings relating to
any regulatory approval process in connection with the Merger.

(c) During the Pre-Closing Period, Buyer and Seller will (i) promptly notify
the other party of any written or oral communication to that party or its
Affiliates from any Governmental Authority and, subject to applicable Law
(including Regulations, codes, plans, Orders and charges thereunder), permit
the other party to review in advance any proposed written communication to
any Governmental Authority, in each case concerning the review, clearance or
approval of any of the transactions contemplated hereby under the HSR Act or
any similar applicable foreign Laws; (ii) not agree to participate, or to
permit its Affiliates to participate, in any substantive meeting or discussion
with any Governmental Authority in respect of any filings, investigation or
inquiry concerning the review, clearance or approval of any of the 

 



47  transactions contemplated hereby under the HSR Act or any similar applicable
foreign Laws unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other party or its
counsel the opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting; _provided_
that if the Governmental Authority or applicable Law (including Regulations,
codes, plans, Orders and charges thereunder) does not permit such
participation by the other party or its counsel, or if Buyers and Sellers
respective counsels both agree in good faith that participation of Seller or
Sellers counsel would not be advisable, Buyer meeting with such Governmental
Authority may proceed without the participation of Seller or its counsel; and
(iii) furnish the other party with copies of all correspondence, filings, and
communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) drafted by
or in conjunction with outside counsel between it and its Affiliates and its
respective Representatives on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or
members of such Governmental Authoritys staff on the other hand, concerning
the review, clearance or approval of any of the transactions contemplated
hereby under the HSR Act or any similar applicable foreign Law, except to the
extent prohibited by applicable Law (including Regulations, codes, plans,
Orders and charges thereunder) or the instructions of such Governmental
Authority.

(d) During the Pre-Closing Period, Buyer and Seller shall furnish to each
other all information required for any application or other filing under the
rules and regulations of any applicable Law in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(e) Buyer shall pay all filing and related fees in connection with any such
filings that must be paid to any Governmental Authorities by any of the
parties.

(f) During the Pre-Closing Period, each of Seller and Buyer shall give (or
shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to give) any notices to third
parties, and use, and cause their respective Subsidiaries to use, their
reasonable best efforts to obtain any third party consents required in
connection with the Merger that are (i) necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) disclosed or required to be disclosed
in the Seller Disclosure Schedule or the Buyer Disclosure Schedule, as the
case may be, or (iii) required to prevent the occurrence of an event that is
reasonably likely to have a Seller Material Adverse Effect prior to or after
the Effective Time, it being understood that neither Seller nor Buyer shall be
required to make any payments in connection with the fulfillment of its
obligations under this Section 6.3.

6.4 _No Solicitation of Transactions; Acquisition Proposals._

 

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, Seller agrees that, except as permitted by
this Section 6.4, neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of the
officers and directors of it or its Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall
instruct and cause its and its Subsidiaries Representatives not to, directly
or indirectly:

 

(i) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage any inquiries or the making of
any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to
lead to, any Acquisition Proposal;

 



48 (ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions
or negotiations regarding, or provide any non-public information or data to
any Person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal; or

(iii) otherwise facilitate any effort or attempt to make an Acquisition
Proposal.

 

(b) During the Pre-Closing Period, as promptly as practicable, and in any
event within twenty-four (24) hours, after any officer or director of Seller
receives any Acquisition Proposal, Seller shall provide Buyer with oral and
written notice of the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition
Proposal, request or inquiry, including (i) the identity of the Person
or group making any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, (ii) a
copy of all written materials provided by such Person in connection with such
Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry and (iii) a written summary, if it is
not in writing, of any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry. After
receipt of the Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, during the Pre-
Closing Period, Seller shall continue to keep Buyer promptly informed (in any
event on a daily basis) of the status and details of any such Acquisition
Proposal, request or inquiry (including, but not limited to, notice of all
material amendments or developments with respect thereto). During the Pre-
Closing Period, Seller shall provide Buyer with two (2) Business Days prior
notice (or such lesser prior notice as is provided to the members of Board of
Directors of Seller) of any meeting of the Board of Directors of Seller at
which such Board of Directors of Seller is reasonably expected to discuss any
Acquisition Proposal or any Change of Recommendation.

(c) If, prior to the time Stockholders Consent is obtained and during the
Pre-Closing Period, Seller receives from a Person a bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal, Seller may (A) provide information in response to a
request therefor by such Person if Seller receives from the Person so
requesting such information an executed confidentiality agreement on terms no
more favorable to such Person as the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement;
provided that, contemporaneously with furnishing any such non-public
information to such Person, Seller furnishes to Buyer all such non-public
information not previously provided to Buyer or (B) engage in discussions or
negotiations with such Person, if prior to taking any action described in
clause (A) or (B) above, the Board of Directors of Seller, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, determines in good
faith that the failure to take any action described in clause (A) or (B) above
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law,
and the Board of Directors of Seller believes in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisors, that
the Acquisition Proposal in respect of which such action is to be taken, if
consummated, is or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior
Proposal.

(d) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Board of Directors of Seller and each
committee thereof shall not:

(i) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to
withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify or make any statement with the
substantive effect of withholding, withdrawing, qualifying or modifying), in a
manner adverse to Buyer (any such action, a " _Change of Recommendation_ "),
the Seller Recommendation unless the Board of Directors of Seller is entitled
to take the actions specified under Section 6.4(e);

 



49 (ii) approve, recommend or declare advisable (publicly or otherwise)
an Acquisition Proposal unless the Board of Directors has made a Change of
Recommendation; or

(iii) except as expressly permitted by, and after compliance with, Section
8.1(d), cause or permit Seller to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum
of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger
agreement or other agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement entered
into in compliance with Section 6.4(c)) relating to any Acquisition Proposal.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
prior to the receipt of the Stockholders Consent, the Board of Directors of
Seller may, in response to a Superior Proposal that did not result from a
breach by Seller of this Section 6.4, withhold, withdraw or modify its
recommendation with respect to the Seller Recommendation or approve
or recommend any Acquisition Proposal if the Board of Directors of Seller
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations
under applicable Law, but only on or after the seventh (7th) Business Day
following Buyers receipt of written notice advising Buyer that the Board of
Directors of Seller desires to withhold, withdraw or modify the recommendation
due to the existence of a Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms
and conditions of such Superior Proposal (including any material changes) and
identifying the person making such Superior Proposal. Such seven (7) Business
Day period shall be required for each and every Superior Proposal or material
modification thereto, as applicable.

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 6.4 shall be deemed to prohibit Seller
from complying with its disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state Law
with regard to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided, however,_ that if such
disclosure has the substantive effect of withdrawing or adversely modifying
the Seller Recommendation in any respect, such disclosure shall be deemed to
be a Change of Recommendation and Buyer shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement as set forth in Section 8.1(e).

 

(g) Seller agrees that it will immediately cease and cause to be terminated
any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties
conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. Seller agrees
that it will take the necessary steps to promptly inform the individuals or
entities referred to in the first sentence hereof of the obligations
undertaken in this Section 6.4 and in the Confidentiality Agreement.

6.5 _Access to Information_.

 

(a) Upon reasonable prior notice during the Pre-Closing Period and subject to
applicable Laws relating to the premerger exchange of information, Seller,
shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers,
employees, accountants, counsel, and other Representatives of Buyer,
reasonable access without undue interruption, during normal business 

 



50  hours during the period from the date of this Agreement until the Effective
Time or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 8.1, to all of its properties, books, contracts, commitments, and
records (other than confidential information contained in personnel files to
the extent the disclosure of such information is prohibited by privacy laws or
other confidential information per the terms of nondisclosure or similar
agreements). Upon reasonable prior notice during the Pre-Closing Period and
subject to applicable Laws relating to the premerger exchange of information,
Seller also shall provide Buyer with reasonable access to Sellers officers,
employees, agents, customers and suppliers. Neither Seller nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information
where such access or disclosure would contravene any Law, rule, regulation,
order, judgment, decree, or binding agreement entered into prior to the date
of this Agreement or would reasonably be expected to violate or result in a
loss or impairment of any attorney-client or work product privilege or would
violate or prejudice the rights of third parties. The parties hereto will use
commercially reasonably efforts to make appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding
sentence apply. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall not, without the
consent of Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), contact any customers, suppliers or key Seller
Employees.

 

(b) With respect to all information furnished by one party to the other party
or its Representatives under this Agreement, the parties shall comply with,
and shall cause their respective Representatives to comply with, all of their
respective obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Section 6.5, Seller shall not be
obligated, and shall not be obligated to cause any of its Subsidiaries, to
afford to Buyer or its Representatives any access to any of its properties,
books, contracts, commitments, and records relating to, or in respect of,
competitively sensitive information, the sharing of which would violate
applicable Laws relating to the premerger exchange of information.

 

6.6 _Employment and Benefit Matters_.

(a) _Benefits_. From the Effective Time through December 31, 2011, Seller
Employees will be entitled to participate in the Seller Employee Programs
(other than Seller equity-based plans) on the same terms as those in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Following January 1, 2012, the
employees of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries who were employed
by the Seller or its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time and who remain
employed on or after January 1, 2012 (the " _Surviving Corporation Employees_
") will be entitled to participate in either (i) the Seller Employee Programs
(other than Seller equity-based plans) on the same terms, or terms which in
the aggregate provide substantially comparable benefits, as those in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) the employee benefit plans of
Buyer and its Subsidiaries on the same terms as similarly-situated employees
of Buyer and its Subsidiaries or (iii) a combination of (i) and (ii), and in
each case in the discretion of Buyer, and Buyer may terminate any of the
Seller Employee Programs or merge any of the Seller Employee Programs
with Buyers employee benefit plans as Buyer deems appropriate, in each case
subject to the terms of such Seller Employee Program and this Agreement.
Subject to the requirements of applicable Law and unless such recognition of
service would result in a duplication of benefits, Buyer shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation or another Affiliate of Buyer to, treat, and
cause the applicable benefit plans to treat, the service of Surviving
Corporation 

 



51  Employees with Seller or its Subsidiaries attributable to any period before
the Effective Time as service rendered to Buyer or the Surviving Corporation
for all purposes, including, but not limited to, eligibility to participate,
vesting, including, but not limited to, applicability of any minimum waiting
periods for participation, excluding for these purposes benefit accrual under
any defined benefit plan. Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer shall not,
and shall cause the Surviving Corporation not to, treat any Surviving
Corporation Employee as a "new" employee for purposes of any exclusions under
any health or similar plan of Buyer or the Surviving Corporation for a pre-
existing medical condition, except to the extent such exclusions were
applicable under a Seller Employee Program immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

(b) _"At Will" Employment_. The Seller Employees who remain employed after the
Effective Time shall be considered to be employed by Buyer "at will" and
nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to limit the ability of Buyer or
the Surviving Corporation to terminate the employment of any such Seller
Employee at any time. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Buyer shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or relevant
Subsidiary or another Affiliate of Buyer to, assume and honor in accordance
with their terms all deferred compensation plans, agreements and arrangements,
severance and separation pay plans, agreements and arrangements, and written
employment, severance, retention, incentive, change in control and termination
agreements (including any change in control provisions therein) set forth in
Section 6.6(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule applicable to employees
of Seller or a Seller Subsidiary, in the same manner and to the same extent
that Seller or a Seller Subsidiary would be required to perform and honor such
plans, agreements and arrangements if the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement had not been consummated.

(c) _Continuation of Employment_. No provision of this Section 6.6 shall
create any third-party beneficiary rights in any employee or former employee
(including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) of Seller or any Subsidiary
of Seller in respect of continued employment (or resumed employment) with
Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any of Buyers Subsidiaries and no
provision of this Section 6.6 shall create such rights in any such persons in
respect of any benefits that may be provided, directly or indirectly, under
any employee program or any plan or arrangement that may be established by
Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries. No provision of this Agreement shall
constitute a limitation on the rights to amend, modify or terminate after the
Effective Time any such plans or arrangements of Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries, provided such amendment, modification or termination is
effected in accordance with applicable Law and such underlying plan or
arrangement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer agrees that during the
calendar year ending December 31, 2011 it will not decrease the amount of
base salary payable to any Seller Employee and will not amend or decrease the
amounts payable to any Seller Employee under Sellers 2011 Executive Bonus
Program, 2011 Sales Compensation Policy, 2011 AE Compensation Policy and all
other compensation plans set forth on Schedule 6.6(c), so long as such Seller
Employee remains employed by Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Subsidiaries during such period.

 

6.7 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) Buyer and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification,
reimbursement, contribution, advancement of expenses or exculpation
now existing in favor of, and all limitations on the personal liability of
each present and former director, officer,

 



52  employee, fiduciary, or agent of Seller and its Subsidiaries and all other
covered persons provided for in the respective organizational documents, in
effect as of the date hereof, shall continue to be honored and in full force
and effect for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time (and if any
statute is amended to provide for benefits that are more favourable to such
Persons, then such Persons shall be entitled to the benefits of such
amendment); _provided, however,_ that all rights to indemnification,
reimbursement, contribution, advancement of expenses or exculpation in respect
of any claims asserted or made within such period shall continue until
the disposition of such claim. During such period, Buyer shall not directly
or indirectly through the Surviving Corporation or otherwise, amend, repeal or
otherwise modify such provisions for indemnification, reimbursement,
contribution, advancement of expenses or exculpation in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who at any time at or
prior to the Effective Time was a director, officer, employee, fiduciary, or
agent of Seller and its Subsidiaries or any other covered person in respect
of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including, without limitation, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), unless such modification is required by law. In addition, from
and after the Effective Time, Buyer and Surviving Corporation shall indemnify
and hold harmless the present and former officers and directors of Seller and
its Subsidiaries and all other covered persons pursuant to, and otherwise
comply with, the terms of the written indemnification agreements between
Seller and/or one or more of its Subsidiaries and such officers and directors
and listed in Section 6.7 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule.

 

(b) The certificates of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational
documents of the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries shall
contain the provisions with respect to indemnification, reimbursement,
advancement of expenses, contribution and exculpation from liability set forth
in the Sellers Certificate of Incorporation and the Sellers Bylaws or
other organizational documents or such Subsidiarys organizational documents,
as the case may be, on the date of this Agreement, which provisions shall not
be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years after the
Closing in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of
any covered person, except as required by Law (and if any statute is amended
to provide for benefits that are more favourable to the covered persons, then
each covered person shall be entitled to the benefits of such amendment).

(c) At or prior to the Effective Time, Seller shall purchase a
"tail" directors and officers liability insurance policy (which by its
terms shall survive the Merger) for its directors and officers, which shall
provide such directors and officers with coverage for six (6) years following
the Effective Time of not less than the existing coverage under, and have
other terms not materially less favorable on the whole to, the insured persons
than the directors and officers liability insurance coverage presently
maintained by Seller. Buyer shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, maintain such policy in full force and effect, and continue to honor the
obligations thereunder.

(d) If Buyer, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation merges into,
consolidates with or transfers all or substantially all of its assets to
another Person or liquidates, dissolves or winds up its operations, then and
in each such case, Buyer, Merger Sub and/or the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, shall make proper provision so that the surviving or resulting
entity or the transferee in such transaction assumes the obligations
of Buyer, Merger Sub and/or the Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.7.

 



53 (e) The obligations under this Section 6.7 shall not be terminated or modified
in such a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee to whom this Section
6.7 applies without the consent of such affected indemnitee (it being
expressly agreed that the indemnitees to whom this Section 6.7 applies shall
be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.7 and shall be entitled to
enforce the covenants contained herein).

(f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the obligations of Buyer
and the Surviving Corporation or its successor pursuant to this Section 6.7
(i) shall be subject to any express limitation imposed by applicable law and
(ii) shall not be deemed to release any Seller Stockholder from his or her
obligations as an Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Agreement, nor shall
such Seller Stockholder have any right of contribution, indemnification, or
advancement or reimbursement of expenses from the Surviving Corporation or
its successor or Buyer or any of their respective Subsidiaries with respect to
any Damages claimed by any of the Buyer Indemnified Parties against such
Seller Stockholder in his or her capacity as an Indemnifying Party pursuant
to Article IX of this Agreement.

6.8 _Publicity_. Except with respect to any action taken pursuant to, and in
accordance with, Section 6.4, so long as this Agreement is in effect, neither
Buyer nor Seller shall, or shall permit any of its respective Subsidiaries to,
issue or cause the publication of any press release or other
public announcement with respect to, or otherwise make any public statement
concerning, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the
consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, except as may be required by applicable Law or the
applicable rules of any stock exchange, in which case the party required to
make the release or announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to
allow the other parties reasonable time to comment on such release or
announcement in advance of such issuance. Upon the execution of this Agreement
and at the Closing, Buyer and Seller shall issue a mutually agreed upon press
release announcing the transactions contemplated hereby.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.8, Seller and its
Representatives shall be permitted to make statements or communications to the
holders of Seller Securities or to members of the board of directors of the
Seller or advisors with a need to know the information contained in such
statements or communications without the consent of Buyer, and to
counterparties to contracts, customers of the Seller and its Subsidiaries and
suppliers of the Seller and its Subsidiaries with a need to know the
information contained in such statements or communications after reasonable
consultation with Buyer and with the consent of Buyer, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

6.9 _Notification of Certain Events_. During the Pre-Closing Period, each of
Seller and Buyer will give prompt notice to the other of (i) any notice or
other communication from any person alleging that the consent of such person
is or may be required in connection with the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) any notice or other
communication from any Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger or
any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (iii) any
litigation relating to, involving or otherwise affecting Seller, Buyer, Merger
Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries that relates to the Merger or any
of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. During the Pre-
Closing Period, Seller shall give prompt written notice to Buyer of the
occurrence of any event that is likely to cause any representation or
warranty made by it contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate at
or prior to Closing, or any failure of Seller to comply with or satisfy

 



54  any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
under this Agreement; _provided, however,_ that no such notification shall
affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the
parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this
Agreement. During the Pre-Closing Period, Buyer shall give prompt written
notice to Seller of any representation or warranty made by it or Merger Sub
contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect, or any failure of Buyer or Merger Sub to comply with or satisfy in
any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with
or satisfied by it under this Agreement; _provided, however,_ that no such
notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties
under this Agreement.

 

6.10 _Takeover Statutes_. During the Pre-Closing Period, if any anti-takeover,
control share acquisition, fair price, moratorium or other similar statute is
or may become applicable to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, each of Buyer and Seller and their respective Boards of
Directors shall grant such approvals and take such lawful actions as are
necessary to ensure that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to
eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute and any
regulations promulgated thereunder on such transactions.

6.11 _Continuation of Employment Letters_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Buyer shall request that each of the employees of
Seller or its Subsidiaries mutually agreed upon by Buyers and Sellers Chief
Executive Officers prior to Closing sign a continuation of employment letter,
in a form substantially similar to the Key Employee Letters and reasonably
acceptable to Buyer indicating their intent to remain employed by the
Surviving Corporation and outlining the expected terms of such employment
arrangements. During the Pre-Closing Period, Seller shall use its commercially
reasonable best efforts to assist Buyer in obtaining executed copies of
such letters, and any restrictive covenant and assignment agreement that the
Buyer determines is reasonably necessary and lawful to protect its interests,
from such employees prior to Closing. Between the signing of this Agreement
and the Closing Date, Buyer and Seller shall cooperate in good faith to
satisfy any obligation under any labor law that covers employees of Seller or
its Subsidiaries who are located outside the United States and is triggered by
the signing of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

(b) Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement (including, without
limitation, the final sentence of Section 6.6(c)), applicable Law, and
continuation of employment letters, offer letters and agreements in effect
following the Closing, Buyer and its Subsidiaries shall have the right to
determine the compensation and employee benefits of the employees of Seller
and its Subsidiaries following the Closing. Notwithstanding anything contained
in this Agreement, but subject to applicable Laws, continuation of employment
letters, offer letters and agreements in effect following the Closing, Buyer
and its Subsidiaries shall have the right to terminate the employment of the
employees of Seller and its Subsidiaries after the Closing.

 

6.12 _Other Actions by the Parties_. During the Pre-Closing Period, Buyer and
Seller, at the request of the other party, shall execute and deliver such
other instruments and do and perform such other acts and things as may be
reasonably necessary or desirable for effecting

 



55  completely the consummation of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (including all action reasonably necessary to seek and
obtain any and all approvals of any Governmental Authority or other Person
required in connection with the Merger; _provided, however,_ that neither
Buyer nor (unless approved and so directed by Buyer in advance) Seller shall
be obligated to make or consent to any divestiture or operational limitation
or activity in connection therewith, or any waiver or modification of any
right, or any payment of money or grant of any other commercial concession as
a condition to obtaining any such approval). During the Pre-Closing Period,
each party agrees to use commercially reasonable best efforts to cause the
conditions set forth in Article VII to be satisfied, where the satisfaction of
such conditions depends on action or forbearance from action by such party.

 

6.13 _Taxes_.

(a) The Seller Securityholders, severally and not jointly, as set forth in,
and subject to Article IX, and in accordance with their pro rata share of the
Merger Consideration in relation to all other Seller Securityholders as set
forth on Schedule 9.2, will indemnify and hold the Buyer Indemnified Parties
harmless against any Damages asserted against, resulting to, imposed upon or
incurred by any such Buyer Indemnified Party, directly or indirectly, by
reason of, resulting from or attributable to (i) any breach of the
representations and warranties of Seller contained in Section 3.11, (ii) any
Taxes payable with respect to Seller or any of its Subsidiaries for any Pre-
Closing Period, (iii) any Taxes of any member of an affiliated, consolidated,
combined or unitary group of which Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (or any
predecessor of any of the foregoing) is or was a member prior to the Closing
Date, including pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any
analogous or similar state, local or foreign Law or regulation, which Taxes
relate to an event or transaction occurring before the Closing, and (iv) any
Taxes of any Person (other than Seller or any of its Subsidiaries) imposed on
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries as a transferee or successor by contract or
pursuant to any Law, rule, or regulation (other than customary contracts or
agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business and any lending
agreements the principal purpose of each of which is not with respect to
Taxes), which Taxes relate to an event or transaction occurring before the
Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of clauses (i), (ii),
(iii) or (iv) above, the Seller Securityholders shall be liable only to the
extent that such Taxes exceed the amount, if any, taken into account in
determining the Net Cash Balance. Any amounts for which Buyer is entitled to
reimbursement pursuant to this Section 6.13(a) shall first be deducted from
the Tax Escrow Amount and shall then be deducted from the General Escrow
Amount and otherwise be subject to the provisions of Article IX. For
the avoidance of doubt, none of the disclosures set forth in Section 3.11 of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule shall modify or limit the obligations of the
Seller Securityholders under this Section 6.13 except with regard to
clause (i) above.

(b) In order to apportion appropriately any Taxes relating to the portion of a
taxable period beginning on or before the Closing Date but ending after the
Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), the portion of any Taxes that are
allocable to the Pre-Closing Period shall be: (A) in the case of Taxes that
are imposed on a periodic basis (and not based on invoices, receipts, sales
or payments), deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire period
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar
days in the Straddle Period ending on (and including) the Closing Date and
the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire relevant
Straddle Period, and (B) in the case of Taxes not described in (A) (such as

 



56  taxes that are either (x) income Taxes, or (y) imposed in connection with
any sale or other transfer or assignment of property (real or personal,
tangible or intangible)), deemed equal to the amount that would be payable if
the Taxable year or period ended and the books closed at the close of the
Closing Date.

 

(c) Tax Returns

(i) All Tax Returns of each of Seller and each of its Subsidiaries required to
be filed between the date hereof and the Closing Date (i) will be filed (or
will be caused to be filed) by Seller when due (after taking into account
timely filed extensions) in accordance with all applicable Laws, (ii) will be
prepared (or will be caused to be prepared) on a basis consistent with the
most recent Tax Returns of each of Seller and each of its Subsidiaries unless
there is no reasonable basis for such position and (iii) as of the time of
filing, will be complete and accurate in all material respects. Buyer shall be
permitted to review and comment on each such income Tax Return prior to the
filing for at least seven (7) calendar days prior to the due date thereof.
Seller shall consider in good faith any reasonable comments of Buyer on such
Tax Returns. Seller shall pay, or cause to be paid, all Taxes with respect to
such Tax Returns.

(ii) All Tax Returns of each of Seller and each of its Subsidiaries required
to be filed after the Closing Date for any taxable period or portion thereof
ending on or prior to the Closing Date (A) will be filed (or will be caused to
be filed) by Buyer when due (after taking into account timely filed
extensions) in accordance with all applicable Laws and (B) will be prepared
(or will be caused to be prepared) on a basis consistent with the most recent
Tax Returns of each of Seller and its Subsidiaries so long as there is a
reasonable basis for the positions taken on such Tax Returns. With respect to
any such income Tax Returns that could result in an indemnification obligation
by the Seller Securityholders, at least fifteen (15) days prior to the due
date therefor, Buyer shall provide such Tax Return to the Securityholders
Representative for the Securityholders Representatives review and Buyer
shall consider in good faith any reasonable comments of the Securityholders
Representative with respect to such Tax Returns.

 

(iii) Each of Buyer, Seller, each of its Subsidiaries and the Securityholders
Representative shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns
pursuant to Section 6.13(a), and any audit, litigation or other proceeding
with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon
the other partys request) the provision of records and information that are
reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. Each of Buyer, Seller and each of its Subsidiaries agrees (A) to
retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to Seller
and each of its Subsidiaries relating to any taxable period beginning before
the Closing Date for a period of seven (7) years

 



57  following the date hereof (and, to the extent notified by Buyer or the
Securityholders Representative, subject to any extensions thereof), and to
abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any taxing
authority, and (B) to give the other party reasonable written notice prior to
transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the
other party so requests, each of Buyer, Seller and each of its Subsidiaries,
as the case may be, shall allow the other party to take possession of such
books and records.

 

(iv) Each of Buyer, Seller, each of its Subsidiaries and the Securityholders
Representative agrees upon request, to use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain any certificate or other document from any Governmental Authority or
any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax
that could be imposed (including, but not limited to, with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby) upon Seller or any of its Subsidiaries.

(v) Each of Buyer, Seller and each of its Subsidiaries agrees, upon request,
to provide the other party with all information that either party may be
required to report pursuant to Sections 6043 or 6043A of the Code or Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder. 

(d) All Tax sharing agreements or similar agreements with respect to or
involving Seller or any of its Subsidiaries shall be terminated as of the
Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, neither Seller nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder.

(e) All sales and transfer taxes, recording charges and similar taxes, fees or
charges imposed as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(collectively, the " _Transfer Taxes_ "), together with any interest,
penalties or additions to such Transfer Taxes, shall be paid one-half by
Seller Securityholders and one-half by Buyer (on behalf of the Seller
Securityholders). The Securityholders Representative and Buyer shall
cooperate in timely making all filings, returns, reports and forms as
necessary or appropriate to comply with the provisions of all applicable Laws
in connection with the payment of such Transfer Taxes, and shall cooperate in
good faith to minimize, to the fullest extent possible under such Laws, the
amount of any such Transfer Taxes payable in connection therewith.

(f) Except to the extent taken into account in the determination of the Net
Cash Balance, Buyer shall offset any refunds of Taxes of Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries with respect to the current taxable period or portions thereof
ending on or prior to the Closing Date (which for the avoidance of doubt,
shall exclude carrybacks of any loss or deduction generated in a period after
the Closing Date to any taxable period ending prior to the Closing Date)
against the amount of any Damages to be paid to any Buyer Indemnified Party
pursuant to this Section 6.13.

6.14  _Section 280G of the Code_. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall have
used commercially reasonable efforts to seek the approval of the Seller
Stockholders that complies with the requirements of Section 280G(b)(5) of the

58  thereunder, with respect to payments and benefits that may be made or
provided to any Person who, with respect to Seller, is a "disqualified
individual" (as such term is defined for purposes of Section 280G of the
Code) if such payments could reasonably be expected to result in the
imposition of any excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code (such
vote, the " _Requisite Section 280G Approval_"). The taking of any such vote
to obtain such Requisite Section 280G Approval, including all materials and
information that are provided to the Seller Stockholders in connection with
such vote, shall comply with applicable Laws and organizational documents of
Seller. Copies of such materials will be provided to Buyer in advance of
distribution to the Seller Stockholders, and Buyer will be provided with a
reasonable opportunity to comment thereon.

 

6.15 _Termination of Arrangements and Agreements_.

Seller shall terminate all Seller Contracts listed on Schedule 6.15 on or
prior to the Closing, including sending all required notices, such that each
such Seller Contract shall be of no further force or effect immediately
following the Closing, in each case without any remaining liability of any
kind on the part of Seller, any of its Subsidiaries or Buyer as a result of or
in connection with such termination or such Seller Contract.

 

Buyer shall not have any liability to Seller, any Seller Securityholder or any
other Person for any liabilities resulting from Seller seeking to obtain such
terminations.

Any liabilities of any kind on the part of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries
that arise in connection with the performance by Seller of this Section 6.15
shall be included as Seller Transaction Expenses (whether matured or unmatured
and whether or not yet due and payable), except to the extent released or
fully satisfied on or before Closing without any further liability on the
part of Seller, any of its Subsidiaries or Buyer.

6.16 _FIRPTA Compliance_. On the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer

and its Subsidiaries, respectively, to execute a resignation letter in the

6.18 _Joinder and Waiver Agreement_. Seller shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Joinder and Waiver Agreement to be executed
on or prior to the Closing Date by all the Seller Securityholders that have
not executed the Stockholder Consent.

6.19 _Termination of Section 401(k) Plans_. Unless, at least ten (10)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Buyer provides written notice to
Seller to the contrary, effective as of no later than the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date, each of Seller and any ERISA Affiliate shall
terminate any and all Seller Employee Programs intended to include a Code
Section 401(k) arrangement (each, a " _401(k) Plan_ ") and shall cause any
professional employer organization or co-employer organization to terminate
the participation of each Seller Employee

 



59  in any 401(k) Plan maintained by such organization. Unless Buyer provides
written notice to Seller as contemplated in the foregoing sentence, no later
than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall provide
Buyer with evidence that each 401(k) Plan has been terminated and the
participation of each Seller Employee in each 401(k) Plan has been terminated,
as applicable, (effective as of no later than the day immediately preceding
the Closing Date) pursuant to resolutions of the Board of Directors of Seller,
such ERISA Affiliate or organization, as the case may be. The form and
substance of such resolutions shall be subject to review and approval of Buyer
(which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
In the event that termination of a 401(k) Plan would reasonably be anticipated
to trigger liquidation charges, surrender charges or other fees then such
charges or fees shall be included in Seller Transaction Expenses and shall be
the responsibility of Seller, and Seller shall take such actions as are
necessary to reasonably estimate the amount of such charges or fees and
provide such estimate in writing to Buyer no later than two (2) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date.

6.20 _Proprietary Information Agreements_. From the date hereof until the
Closing Date, Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause

into and execute a proprietary information agreement with Seller in a
form reasonably satisfactory to Buyer.

(d) by Seller, if Buyer or Merger Sub shall have breached in any material
respect any of their representations, warranties, covenants or other

COVENANTS; INDEMNIFICATION

9.1 _Survival._

(a) From and after the Closing, all representations, warranties, covenants,
and agreements of the Seller, Buyer and Merger Sub made in this Agreement, in
the Seller Disclosure Schedule delivered to Buyer, in the Buyer Disclosure
Schedule delivered to Seller and all certificates executed and delivered in
connection with Sections 7.2(a), 7.2(b), 7.3(a) and 7.3(b) hereof (i) shall be
deemed to be material and to have been relied upon by the party or parties to
whom they are made, and shall survive the Closing regardless of any
investigation on the part of such party or its representatives, with each
party reserving all of its rights hereunder in connection with any breach or
alleged breach pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and (ii) shall bind
the parties successors and assigns (including, without limitation, any
successor to Buyer or Seller by way of acquisition, merger or otherwise),
whether so expressed or not, and, except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, all such representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
shall inure to the benefit of the parties (subject to Section 11.9 below) and
their respective successors and assigns, whether so expressed or not.

(b) Notwithstanding Section 9.1(a), from and after the Closing, the
representations and warranties of the Seller, Buyer and Merger Sub made in
this Agreement, in the Seller Disclosure Schedule delivered to Buyer, in the
Buyer Disclosure Schedule delivered to Seller and the certificates executed
and delivered in connection with Sections 7.2(a) and 7.3(a) hereof (and
related indemnification obligations) shall expire and terminate on the date
which is eighteen (18) months from the Closing Date, and be of no further
force and effect thereafter, except that (i) the representations
and warranties of Seller set forth in Sections 3.2 and 3.3 (and related
indemnification obligations) shall expire and terminate on the date which is
the third (3rd) anniversary of the Closing Date, and be of no further force
and effect thereafter, (ii) the representations and warranties of Seller set

and terminate on the date which is the second (2nd) anniversary of the Closing

representations and warranties of the Seller set forth in Section 3.11 (and
related indemnification obligations) shall expire and terminate on the date
which is sixty (60) days following the expiration of the applicable statute
of limitations, and be of no further force and effect thereafter
(collectively, the

 



65  representations referred to in clauses (i) through (iii) above, the "
_Seller Fundamental Representations_ "). Notwithstanding Section 9.1(a), the
indemnification covenants of the Seller Securityholders set forth in Section

or agreement unless it shall have received from the party seeking
indemnification written notice of the existence of the claim for which
indemnification is being sought on or before the expiration (if any) of the
period for which the representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
underlying such claim survives. Any written claim for indemnification
pursuant to this Article IX in respect of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement that is made prior to the applicable expiration date (if
any) for such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement and delivered
to the party against whom such indemnification is sought in accordance with
the provisions of this Article IX, shall survive thereafter and, as to any
such claim, such subsequent expiration will not affect the rights to
indemnification of the party making such claim, it being agreed that if such
claim for indemnification is timely made, the relevant representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements shall survive with respect to the claims
for indemnification set forth in such notice until such matter is resolved.
Such notice shall set forth with reasonable specificity (i) the basis under
this Agreement and the facts that otherwise form the basis of such claim and

this Agreement to the contrary, subject to the last sentence of Section 9.1(b)
on survivability and the limitations in Section 9.4, in the event of any acts

remedies available at Law or in equity (including for tort) with respect to
such fraud or willful breach. 

9.2 _Indemnification by the Seller Securityholders_. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Article IX, from and after the Closing, the Seller
Securityholders, severally and not jointly, and in accordance with their pro
rata share of the Merger Consideration in relation to all other Seller

hold harmless Buyer, the Surviving Corporation, their respective affiliates
and the respective officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives

66  actions, causes of action, demands, assessments, losses, damages,
liabilities, judgments, settlements, penalties, costs, and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) of any nature whatsoever
(collectively, " _Damages_ ") asserted against, resulting to, imposed upon, or
incurred by any such Buyer Indemnified Party, directly or indirectly, by
reason of or resulting from (i) any breach of (A) any of the representations
and warranties contained in Article III of this Agreement (including the
Seller Disclosure Schedule but other than the representations and warranties
contained in Section 3.11 which are covered in clause (ii) below) or the
certificate delivered at the Closing pursuant to Section 7.2(a) hereto by or
on behalf of Seller to Buyer in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby (other than a bring-down of the representations and warranties covered
in Section 3.11, which are covered in clause (ii) below) or (B) any of the
covenants and agreements of Seller (other than the covenant to indemnify for
Taxes pursuant to Section 6.13, which is covered in clause (ii) below), and
(ii) any and all Taxes for which the Seller Securityholders are responsible
pursuant to Section 6.13. The Buyer Indemnified Parties shall seek recovery
for indemnification claims under this Article IX and Section 6.13 and the
Escrow Agreement (i) out of the Net Cash Escrow Account solely to satisfy
amounts payable to Buyer pursuant to Section 2.4 and the Tax Escrow Account
solely to satisfy amounts payable to Buyer pursuant to Section 6.13, each in
the first instance until the Net Cash Escrow Account is exhausted for
satisfying amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.4 or is otherwise fully
distributed or fully reserved against, the Tax Escrow Account is
exhausted for satisfying amounts payable pursuant to Section 6.13 or is
otherwise fully distributed or fully reserved against and then, in each case,
second against the General Escrow Account, and (ii) out of the General Escrow
Account in the first instance for all other indemnification claims under this
Article IX until the General Escrow Account is exhausted or otherwise fully
distributed or fully reserved for pending claims in full, as applicable, and
thereafter, the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to seek recovery
for such indemnification claims directly from the Seller Securityholders,
subject to the limitations set forth in this Article IX and the Escrow
Agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Seller
Securityholders shall not have any liability for any Taxes of Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries for taxable periods or portions thereof beginning after the
Closing Date.

 

9.3 _Indemnification Proceedings for Third Party Claims_. In the event that
any claim or demand for which a party (an " _Indemnifying Party_ ") would be
liable to another party under Section 9.2 (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") is
asserted against or sought to be collected from an Indemnified Party by a
third party, the Indemnified Party shall with reasonable promptness notify
the Indemnifying Party of such claim or demand, but the failure so to notify
the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
obligations under this Article IX, except to the extent the Indemnifying
Party demonstrates that the defense of such claim or demand is materially
prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Party shall have sixty (60) days from
receipt of the above notice from the Indemnified Party (in this Section
9.3, the " _Notice Period_ ") to notify the Indemnified Party whether or not
the Indemnifying Party desires, at the Indemnifying Partys sole cost and
expense, and subject to the Indemnifying Partys written agreement to
accept full responsibility for indemnification and payment of any Damages
with respect to such claim or demand (to extent there are any Damages related
to such claim or demand), to assume the defense of such claim or demand;
_provided_ , that the Indemnified Party is hereby authorized prior to and
during the Notice Period to file any motion, answer or other pleading that it
shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect its interests or those of the
Indemnifying Party and not prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party. If the
Indemnifying Party

 



67  elects to assume the defense of any such claim or demand, the Indemnified
Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel at its own expense and
to participate in the defense thereof. If the Indemnifying Party elects not
to assume the defense of such claim or demand (or fails to give notice to the
Indemnified Party during the Notice Period), the Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to assume the defense of such claim or demand with counsel of its
own choice, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party. If the claim or demand
is asserted against both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party and
based on the advice of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnifying Party it is determined that there is a conflict of interest
which renders it inappropriate for the same counsel to represent both the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall be
responsible for paying separate counsel for the Indemnified Party; _provided,
however,_ that the Indemnifying Party shall not be responsible for paying for
more than one separate firm of attorneys to represent all of the Indemnified
Parties, regardless of the number of Indemnified Parties. If the Indemnifying
Party elects to assume the defense of such claim or demand, (i) no compromise
or settlement thereof may be effected by the Indemnifying Party without the
Indemnified Partys written consent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless the sole relief provided is monetary
damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party, the settlement does
not include any admission of liability and the Indemnified Party is fully
released from all liabilities relating to such claim or demand and (ii) the
Indemnified Party shall have no liability with respect to any compromise or
settlement thereof effected without its written consent (which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). In addition, the
Indemnifying Party shall keep the Indemnified Party apprised of the status of
the claim, liability or expense and any resulting suit, proceeding or
enforcement action, shall furnish the Indemnified Party with all documents
and information that the Indemnified Party shall reasonably request and shall
consult with the Indemnified Party prior to acting on major matters, including
settlement discussions. In the event that the Indemnifying Party does not
assume the defense of such claim or demand, the Indemnified Party shall keep
the Indemnifying Party apprised of the status of the claim, liability or
expense and any resulting suit, proceeding or enforcement action,
shall furnish the Indemnifying Party with all documents and information that
the Indemnifying Party shall reasonably request and shall consult with the
Indemnifying Party prior to acting on major matters, including settlement
discussions. The Indemnifying Party may not enter into any compromise or
settlement of such claim or demand in which the Indemnifying Party receives a
release from all liabilities relating to such claim or demand in connection
with a compromise or settlement, unless such release also applies to the
Indemnifying Party. With respect to any claim subject to indemnification under
this Article IX, the parties shall cooperate in such a manner and use their
commercially reasonable efforts to preserve in full the confidentiality of
all confidential information and the attorney-client and work-product
privileges. In connection therewith, each party agrees that: (i) it will use
commercially reasonable efforts, in respect of any claim in which it has
assumed or has participated in the defense, to avoid production of
confidential information (consistent with applicable law and rules of
procedure) and (ii) it will use commercially reasonable efforts to make
all communications between any parties hereto and counsel responsible for or
participating in the defense of any third-party claim will so as to preserve
any applicable attorney-client or work-product privilege.

 



68 9.4 _Certain Limitations._

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Seller
Securityholders shall not have any liability to the Buyer Indemnified Parties
for any claims for indemnification made by the Buyer Indemnified Parties
pursuant to this Agreement except as satisfied out of and subject to the
amount in the General Escrow Account (such aggregate amount, the " _Cap_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Cap shall not apply to any Damages based
upon, arising out of, or by reason of any breach of the Seller Fundamental
Representations, the indemnification covenants in Section 6.13 or fraud or
willful breach.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no
Seller Securityholder shall have any liability to the Buyer Indemnified
Parties for any claims for indemnification made by the Buyer Indemnified
Parties pursuant to this Agreement based upon, arising out of, or by reason of
any one or more breaches of any one or more of the Seller Fundamental
Representations or arising out of the indemnification covenants of Section
6.13 in excess of such Seller Securityholders pro rata share of such claim up
to such Seller Securityholders pro rata share of $150,000,000 in the
aggregate for all such claims (the " _Fundamental Representation Cap_ ").

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no Seller
Securityholder shall have any liability to the Buyer Indemnified Parties for
any claims for indemnification made by the Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant
to this Agreement based upon, arising out of, or by reason of any one or more
claims for fraud committed by the Seller or willful breach committed by the
Seller in excess of such Seller Securityholders pro rata share of such claim
up to the Merger Consideration actually received by such Seller
Securityholder in the aggregate for all such claims. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, the Seller Securityholders shall not have
any liability for indemnification claims, in the aggregate, including all
recoveries pursuant to any and all claims under this Agreement, in excess of
the Merger Consideration actually received by such Seller Securityholder. For
the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, to
the extent that an indemnification payment made pursuant to this Agreement is
subject to a cap specified in this Section 9.4 or the Net Cash Escrow Amount
or the Tax Escrow Amount, such payment shall reduce all caps specified in
this Section 9.4, if any, by the aggregate amount of such payments;
_provided_ that any indemnification payment made pursuant to this Article IX
that is made out of the Tax Escrow Account shall not reduce the amount of the
Cap.

 

(d) Except in the case of fraud committed by the Seller or willful breach
committed by the Seller, the Seller Securityholders shall not have any
liability under this Article IX unless and until the aggregate amount of all
Damages incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Parties and indemnifiable hereunder
exceeds $500,000 (the " _Basket_ ") and, once such Damages reach the Basket,
the Seller Securityholders shall be required to pay only those Damages that
are in excess of the Basket, subject to the limitations and provisions set
forth in this Article IX.

 

(e) The amount of any Damages payable by the Indemnifying Party to the
Indemnified Party shall be net of (i) any amounts actually recovered by the
Indemnified Party under applicable insurance policies (less any directly
resulting increases in premium), and (ii) any net Tax benefit available to
such Indemnified Party or its Affiliates arising in connection with
the accrual, incurrence or payment of any such Damages, to the extent such
net Tax Benefit is realized, determined on a with and without basis, in the
taxable year in which such payment

 



69  for Damages was made. For the purposes of calculating the net Tax benefit
under the foregoing sentence, Buyer shall have reasonable discretion to
determine the amount of such Tax benefit and shall have no obligation to
share or disclose any of its Tax Returns in connection therewith with the
Securityholders Representative, Seller or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_
such calculations are made in good faith. Each Indemnified Party shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to recover under insurance policies for
any Damages prior to seeking indemnification under this Agreement.

(f) The Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover under
Article IX for lost profits, special, consequential, indirect or punitive
damages; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing limitation shall not
preclude any indemnitee from claiming Damages based on diminution in value,
including Damages calculated by application of a multiple, but a multiple will
only be applied to the extent that (and only to the extent that) the basis
for such Damages is of a recurring nature.

(g) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, no
Buyer Indemnified Party shall have any right to indemnification under this
Article IX with respect to any Damages to the extent such Damages (i) arise
solely out of changes after the Closing Date in applicable Law
or interpretations or applications thereof; or (ii) are duplicative of
Damages that have previously been recovered (including, without limitation,
amounts taken into account in the calculation of Merger Consideration, Initial
Merger Consideration or Net Cash Balance).

(h) For purposes of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
Buyer, Merger Sub and Seller acknowledge and agree (i) that they are not
entitled to rely on any representations or warranties or other statements of
fact or opinion, other than the representations and warranties expressly set
forth in this Agreement, the Seller Disclosure Schedule and the Buyer
Disclosure Schedule, and (ii) that in connection with the transactions set
forth herein, Buyer has received certain estimates, projections, forecasts and
similar forward-looking statements relating to the future operating and
financial performance of Seller and its Subsidiaries and no representation or
warranty is being made by or on behalf of Seller with respect to such matters.
Buyer, Merger Sub and Seller also acknowledge and agree that anything herein
to the contrary notwithstanding, no breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained herein shall give rise to any right on the
part of any Buyer Indemnified Parties, after the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to rescind this Agreement or any
of the transactions contemplated hereby.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement, Buyer and each of the other Buyer Indemnified Parties agree to keep
the Securityholders Representative regularly informed regarding, and
cooperate with the Securityholders Representative with respect to, any Tax
for which the Seller Securityholders may have indemnification obligations
pursuant to this Agreement and to use its commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including, but
not limited to, with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby) upon
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or upon the Seller Securityholders. These
efforts include negotiating in good faith with Governmental Authorities or
any other Person to reduce any such Tax obligation. In the event that any
Buyer Indemnified Party intends to pay any Tax for which the Seller

 



70  Securityholders may have indemnification obligations pursuant to this
Agreement for a Taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date, or
portions thereof, for which a Governmental Authority or any other Person has
not sought payment or asserted that Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Subsidiaries owes any Taxes (or has not paid Taxes owed),
Buyer shall provide written notice to the Securityholders Representative
three (3) months prior to paying any such amount. During such three (3)-month
period, to the extent requested by the Securityholders Representative, Buyer
and its Representatives shall meet in person with the Securityholders
Representative and its Representatives so that the Securityholders
Representative may provide Buyer with its view on payment of such amount
and/or the amount of such payment, and their reasonable basis for believing
such amounts should not be paid or that a lesser amount should be paid.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the expiration of such three (3)-month
period, Buyer shall have the sole and exclusive right to determine whether or
not to pay any such amounts. In the event that Buyer, the Surviving
Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries enter into any compromise or
settlement with regard to such Taxes with any Governmental Authority or any
other Person in which Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries receives a release from liabilities relating to such
Taxes in connection with such compromise or settlement, Buyer shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to have such Governmental Authority or other
Person enter into a release of the Seller Securityholders and the
Securityholders Representative on the same terms as the release applicable to
the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries, as
applicable. Nothing in this Section 9.4(i) shall be construed to limit
Buyers right and ability to make an indemnification claim pursuant to this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, provided a Buyer Indemnified Party complies
with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, or to limit the
Securityholders Representatives right and ability to contest such
indemnification claim. For the avoidance of doubt, any claim for Taxes under
this Agreement is subject to the provisions of Section 9.3 of this Agreement.

9.5 _Exclusivity_. After the Closing Date, this Article IX, Article II and
the indemnification covenants in Section 6.13 and Sections 3, 5, 6 and 12 of
the Escrow Agreement shall provide the exclusive remedy for breaches of
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in
this Agreement, in the Seller Disclosure Schedule delivered to Buyer, in the
Buyer Disclosure Schedule delivered to Seller and in the certificates executed
and delivered in connection with Sections 7.2(a), 7.2(b), 7.3(a) and 7.3(b)
hereto, except with respect to matters for which the remedy of specific
performance, injunctive relief or other non-monetary equitable remedies are
available. All obligations of the Seller Securityholders pursuant to this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement shall be satisfied (a) first, severally
but not jointly from the Net Cash Escrow Account, Tax Escrow Account and the
General Escrow Account, as applicable, and in the case of the Net Cash Escrow
Account or the Tax Escrow Account, second against the General Escrow Account
after the Net Cash Escrow Account or the Tax Escrow Account, as applicable,
has been exhausted, fully distributed or fully reserved for outstanding
claims, and, in each case, in accordance with each Seller Securityholders
pro rata share of the Merger Consideration in relation to all other Seller
Securityholders as set forth on Schedule 9.2, and subject to the terms,
conditions and limitations set forth in this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement and (b) second or third, as the case may be, by the Seller
Securityholders, severally but not jointly and in accordance with each Seller
Securityholders pro rata share of the Merger Consideration in relation to all
other Seller Securityholders as set forth on Schedule 9.2, and subject to the
terms, conditions and limitations set forth in this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement.

 



71 9.6 _Exercise of Remedies by Buyer Indemnified Parties Other Than Buyer_. No
Buyer Indemnified Party (other than Buyer or any successor thereto or assign
thereof) shall be permitted to assert any indemnification claim or exercise
any other remedy under this Agreement unless Buyer (or any successor thereto
or assign thereof) shall have consented to the assertion of such
indemnification claim or the exercise of such other remedy.

9.7  _Merger Consideration Adjustment_. The parties agree to treat any
indemnity payments made under this Agreement as adjustments to the Merger
Consideration, to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

 

ARTICLE X - SECURITYHOLDERS REPRESENTATIVE

10.1 _Securityholders  Representative._

(a) Each Seller Securityholder by approving this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, executing a Letter of Transmittal and/or

irrevocably and unconditionally appoints Papachey, Inc. as its true and
lawful attorney-in-fact, to act as its representative (" _Securityholders 
Representative_") under this Agreement and, as such, to act, as such holders
agent (with full power of substitution), to take such action on such holders
behalf with respect to all matters relating to this Agreement, the Merger and
the transactions contemplated hereby, including (i) to execute and deliver all
certificates and documents that the Securityholders Representative deems
necessary or appropriate in connection with the consummation of the Merger;
(iii) to receive and provide a receipt for all payments made by Buyer and/or
Seller to any of the Seller Securityholders under this Agreement; (iv) to pay

any such termination, amendment or waiver, if material to the rights and
obligations of the Seller Securityholders in the reasonable judgment of the
Securityholders Representative, shall be taken in the same manner with
respect to all holders unless otherwise agreed by each holder who is subject
to any disparate treatment of a potentially adverse nature; (vi) to
defend and settle all disputes and claims that arise under this Agreement or
the Escrow Agreement or any other, certificate or instrument delivered in

refrain from doing any further act or deed on behalf of such holders that the
Securityholders Representative deems necessary or appropriate in such
Persons sole discretion relating to the subject matter of this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement as fully and completely as any Seller Securityholder
could do if personally present and acting. All decisions and actions by the
Securityholders Representative, including any agreement between the
Securityholders Representative and the Buyer Indemnified Parties relating to
indemnification obligations of the Seller Securityholders under Article IX,
including the defense or settlement of any claims and the making of payments
with respect hereto, shall be binding upon all of the Seller Securityholders,
and no holder shall have the right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise
contest the same. The Securityholders Representative shall incur no liability
to the Seller

 



72  Securityholders with respect to any action taken or suffered by such holders
in reliance upon any notice, direction, instruction, consent, statement or
other documents believed by the Securityholders Representative to be
genuinely and duly authorized, nor for any other action or inaction taken in
its capacity as the Securityholders Representative, including with respect to
the indemnification obligations of the Seller Securityholders under Article
IX, including the defense or settlement of any claims and the making of
payments with respect thereto. The Securityholders Representative may, in all
questions arising under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby, rely on the advice of counsel, and for
anything done, omitted or suffered in good faith by the Securityholders
Representative shall not be liable to the Seller Securityholders.

 

(b) Buyer and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely on the
instructions, decisions and acts of Securityholders Representative, the
Escrow Agent and Buyer are hereby released and relieved from any liability to
any Person for any acts done by them in accordance with any instructions,
decisions or acts of the Securityholders Representative. Buyer and
the Escrow Agent are each hereby expressly authorized to rely on the
genuineness of the signature of the Securityholders Representative or any
instrument, certificate or document. Upon receipt of any writing that has been
signed by the Securityholders Representative, Buyer and the Escrow Agent may
each act upon the same without any further duty of inquiry as to the
genuineness of the writing.

(c) The Securityholders Representative shall be entitled to conclusively
rely, and shall be fully protected from action by the Seller Securityholders
in relying, upon any statements furnished to it by any holder, or Buyer, or
any other evidence deemed by the Securityholders Representative to be
reliable, and the Securityholders Representative shall be entitled to act on
the advice of counsel selected by it.

 

(d) By approving this Agreement, executing the Letter of Transmittal and/or
participating in the Merger and accepting the benefits thereof, the Seller
Securityholders immediately prior to the Effective Time agree on a several and
not joint basis to (i) indemnify the Securityholders Representative (in its
capacity as such) against and to hold the Securityholders Representative (in
its capacity as such) harmless from, any and all Damages which may at any time
be imposed upon, incurred by or asserted against the Securityholders
Representative in such capacity in any way relating to or arising out of
its action or failure to take action pursuant to this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement or in connection herewith in such capacity, and (ii) to pay the
Securityholders Representative for all costs and expenses incurred on behalf
of the Seller Securityholders, promptly upon demand by the Securityholders
Representative and on an as-incurred basis, on a pro rata basis. The
agreements in this Article X shall survive termination of this Agreement.

 

(e) The Securityholders Representative shall be entitled to reimbursement
from the Seller Securityholders through the Securityholders Representative
Expense Fund and, once exhausted, otherwise directly from such Seller
Securityholders on a pro rata basis for out of pocket fees and expenses
(including legal, accounting and other advisors fees and expenses, if
applicable) incurred by the Securityholders Representative in performing its
obligations under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

time) on the next Business Day.

11.3 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections,
Exhibits, or Schedules, such reference shall be to a Section of, or Exhibit or
Schedule to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents
and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and
shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.
Whenever the words "include," "includes," or "including" are used in this
Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." No provision of this Agreement shall be construed to require
Seller, Buyer or Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates to take any action that would violate applicable law, rule, or
regulation.

 

11.4 _Rules of Construction_. The parties to this Agreement agree that they
have been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement and, therefore,

 



75  waive the application of any law, regulation, holding or rule of
construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will
be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.

11.5 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, all of
which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and
delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not
sign the same counterpart. 

11.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the Exhibits and
Schedules hereto, the Confidentiality Agreement and any documents delivered
by the parties in connection herewith constitutes the entire agreement and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties hereto, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter
hereof.

11.7 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction and Venue_. This Agreement shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware
without regard to its rules of conflict of laws. Each of Buyer, Merger Sub and
Seller hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to submit to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware and of the
United States of America located in the State of Delaware (the " _Delaware
Courts_ ") for any litigation arising out of or relating to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby (and agrees not to commence any
litigation relating thereto except in such courts), waives any objection to
the laying of venue of any such litigation in the Delaware Courts, and agrees
not to plead or claim in any Delaware Court that such litigation brought
therein has been brought in any inconvenient forum. Each of the parties hereto
agrees, (a) to the extent such party is not otherwise subject to service of
process in the State of Delaware, to appoint and maintain an agent in the
State of Delaware as such partys agent for acceptance of legal process, and
(b) that service of process may also be made on such party by prepaid
certified mail with a proof of mailing receipt validated by United
States Postal Service constituting evidence of valid service. Service made
pursuant to (a) or (b) above shall have the same legal force and effect as if
served upon such party personally with the State of Delaware.

 

11.8 _Severability_. In the event that any one or more provisions of this
Agreement shall for any reason be held invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in
any respect by any court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity,
illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this
Agreement and the parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to
substitute a valid, legal, and enforceable provision which, insofar as
practicable, implements the original purposes and intents of this Agreement.

11.9 _Assignment; Reliance of Other Parties_. Neither this Agreement nor any
of the rights, interests, or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of
the parties hereto in whole or in part (whether by operation of law or
otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other parties and any
attempt to make any such assignment without such consent shall be null and
void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by the parties and their
respective successors and assigns. Except as provided in Section 6.7
(Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance) hereof,
this Agreement (including the documents and instruments referred to herein)
is not intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any
rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement.

 



76 11.10 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that the provisions contained in
