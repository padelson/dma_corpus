entitled, without duplication, to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Redfish Common Stock, Redfish
Restricted Shares or any other equity rights in Redfish such amounts as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the &#147;<B>Code</B>&#148;), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any
provision of applicable law and shall further be entitled to sell Dorado Common Stock otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to satisfy any such withholding requirement (which Dorado Common
Stock will be valued with respect to such withholding at the average of the high and low trading
prices of Dorado Common Stock on the NYSE on the day of such sale). To the extent that amounts are
so withheld by the Exchange Agent or Dorado, as the case may be, and paid over to the applicable
Governmental Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement

delivered to Redfish a true and complete copy of the commitment letter from J.P. Morgan Securities
Inc. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the &#147;<B>Financing Sources</B>&#148;) that relates to the provision of all
of the financing for immediately available cash funds (the &#147;<B>Funds</B>&#148;) sufficient, together with cash
on hand of Dorado, (i)&nbsp;to pay the cash portion of the Merger Consideration and (ii)&nbsp;for any other
amounts payable by Dorado under this Agreement (such commitment letter, together with all
agreements, arrangements or undertakings related thereto and all schedules, annexes, exhibits or
other attachments thereto (except that amounts of fees payable under documents relating solely to
fee arrangements in connection therewith may be redacted) collectively, the &#147;<B>Commitment Letter</B>&#148;).
The Commitment Letter has not been amended or modified, no such amendment or modification is
contemplated, and the commitment contained in the Commitment Letter has not been withdrawn or
rescinded in any respect. Dorado has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees in
connection with the Commitment Letter that are payable on or prior to the date hereof. The
Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and is the legal, valid and binding obligation of
Dorado and does not restrict any transfer of funds from Dorado in connection with the Merger or
other matters contemplated by this Agreement. There are no conditions precedent or other
contingencies related to advances under the Commitment Letter, other than as explicitly set forth
in the Commitment Letter. No event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time, or
both, would constitute a default on the part of Dorado under the Commitment Letter. Dorado and its
affiliates (as applicable) are in a position to satisfy timely all conditions to be satisfied by
them to advances under the Commitment Letter, and Dorado has no reason to believe that any
conditions to advances contemplated by the Commitment Letter will not be satisfied or that such
advances will not be made to Dorado at the times set forth in this Agreement in order to satisfy
Dorado&#146;s obligations herein. Subject to Dorado&#146;s receipt thereof on or before the Closing Date, on
the Closing Date, the aggregate proceeds of the financings provided for in the Commitment Letter,
together with available funds (in cash or cash equivalents) of Dorado (details in respect of which
have been delivered by Dorado to Redfish prior to the date of this Agreement), would equal or
exceed the amount of the Funds.
