AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

   

 THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, executed this 31st day of October, 2009 (this "Agreement"), is by and between Encore Acquisition Company, a Delaware corporation ("Redfish"), and Denbury Resources Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Dorado"). 

   

RECITALS 

   

 A. The respective boards of directors of Dorado and Redfish have each approved this Agreement and deem it advisable and in the best interests of their respective companies and equity holders to consummate the merger of Redfish with and into Dorado, with Dorado as the surviving entity (the "Merger") upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein. 

   

 B. Pursuant to the Merger, each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of Redfish ("Redfish Common Stock"), other than (i) the shares of Redfish Common Stock owned by Dorado or Redfish (or any of their respective direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries), (ii) Redfish 2009 Bonus Restricted Shares and (iii) the Dissenting Shares, will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, all as more fully described and provided for in this Agreement. 

   

AGREEMENT 

   

 In consideration of the mutual promises contained herein, the benefits to be derived by each party hereunder and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Redfish and Dorado agree as follows: 

   

ARTICLE I 

   

 _THE MERGER_   

  

 Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, including Article VII hereof, and in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), at the Effective Time, Redfish shall be merged with and into Dorado. As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Redfish shall cease, and Dorado shall continue as the surviving entity of the Merger (the "Surviving Entity"). The Merger shall have the effects specified herein and in the DGCL. 

   

 Section 1.2 _Effective Time; Closing_. As promptly as practicable (but no later than one business day) after the satisfaction or, if permissible, waiver in accordance with Section 8.5 of the last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than conditions that by their nature can be satisfied only at the Closing but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions), the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in such form as is required by, and executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of, the DGCL (the date and time of such filing, or at such later time as shall be agreed upon by Dorado and Redfish and specified in the Certificate of Merger, being the "Effective Time"). Prior to but on the same day as such filing, a closing (the "Closing") shall be 

   ##### 

    

   

held at the offices of Baker Botts L.L.P. at 910 Louisiana Street, Houston,
Texas 77002-4995, or such other place as the parties shall agree, for the
purpose of confirming the satisfaction or waiver, as the case may be, of the
conditions set forth in Article VII. The date of the Closing is referred to
herein as the "Closing Date." 

   

 Section 1.3  _Governing Documents_.  

   

 (a) _Certificate of Incorporation_. At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of Dorado in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Entity, until thereafter amended as provided therein and in accordance with applicable law. 

   

 (b) _Bylaws_. At the Effective Time, the bylaws of Dorado in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Entity, until thereafter amended as provided therein and in accordance with applicable law and the terms of such bylaws. 

   

 Section 1.4  _Directors and Officers_.  

   

 (a) _Directors_. The directors of Dorado immediately prior to the Effective Time shall continue to be the directors of the Surviving Entity, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Entity. 

   

 (b) _Officers_. The officers of Dorado immediately prior to the Effective Time shall continue to be the officers of the Surviving Entity, in each case until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified. 

   

ARTICLE II 

   

 _CONVERSION OF REDFISH COMMON STOCK_   

  

 Section 2.1  _Equity Interests of Redfish and Dorado_.  

   

 (a) _Merger Consideration_. At the Effective Time, subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, each share of Redfish Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any Redfish Restricted Shares but excluding Redfish 2009 Bonus Restricted Shares, Redfish Excluded Shares and Redfish Subsidiary Shares) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive the following consideration (collectively, the "Merger Consideration"), subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 2.3: 

    

 (i) Each share of Redfish Common Stock (including Redfish Restricted Shares but excluding Redfish 2009 Bonus Restricted Shares) with respect to which an election to receive a combination of stock and cash has been effectively made and not revoked or lost pursuant to Section 2.1(b) (each, a "Mixed Consideration Election Share") and each Non-Election Share shall be converted into the right to receive the combination (such combination, the "Per Share Mixed Consideration") of (x) $15.00 in cash (the "Per 

   ##### 

  

    

Share Mixed Election Cash Amount") and (y) a number of validly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock, par value $.001 per
share ("Dorado Common Stock") equal to the quotient (the "Mixed Election
Stock Exchange Ratio") determined by dividing $35.00 by the volume weighted
average price of Dorado Common Stock for the period of twenty (20)
consecutive trading days ending on the second full trading day prior to the
Effective Time (the "Dorado Share Value") and rounding to the nearest ten-
thousandth of a share, for sales conducted regular way on the New York Stock
Exchange ("NYSE"), as such volume weighted average price is calculated on the
VAP screen on the Bloomberg Professional  Service and shown as VWAP for
such period or, if not calculated thereby, another authoritative source;
_provided_ , that (x) if the Dorado Share Value is equal to or greater than
$16.91, the Mixed Election Stock Exchange Ratio shall equal 2.0698, and (y)
if the Dorado Share Value is equal to or less than $13.29, the Mixed Election
Stock Exchange Ratio shall equal 2.6336. 

   

 (ii) If the Available Cash Election Amount equals or exceeds the Cash Election Amount, then each share of Redfish Common Stock (including Redfish Restricted Shares but excluding Redfish 2009 Bonus Restricted Shares) with respect to which an election to receive cash has been effectively made and not revoked or lost pursuant to Section 2.1(b) (each, a "Cash Election Share") shall be converted into the right to receive $50.00 in cash without interest (the "Per Share Cash Election Consideration"). If (A) the product of the number of Cash Election Shares and the Per Share Cash Election Consideration (such product being the "Cash Election Amount") exceeds (B) the product of (x) the Per Share Mixed Election Cash Amount and (y) the difference between (1) the total number of shares of Redfish Common Stock (including Redfish Restricted Shares but excluding Redfish 2009 Bonus Restricted Shares, Redfish Excluded Shares and Redfish Subsidiary Shares) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time minus (2) the number of Mixed Consideration Election Shares (provided that Non-Election Shares shall be deemed to be Mixed Consideration Election Shares for purposes of this Section 2.1(a)(ii)) (such product being the "Available Cash Election Amount"), then each Cash Election Share shall be converted into a right to receive (1) an amount of cash (without interest) equal to the product of (p) the Per Share Cash Election Consideration and (q) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Available Cash Election Amount and the denominator of which shall be the Cash Election Amount (such fraction being the "Cash Fraction") and (2) a number of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Dorado Common Stock equal to the product of (r) the Exchange Ratio and (s) one minus the Cash Fraction. 

   

 (iii) If the Cash Election Amount equals or exceeds the Available Cash Election Amount, then each share of Redfish Common Stock (including Redfish Restricted Shares but excluding Redfish 2009 Bonus Restricted Shares) with respect to which an election to receive stock consideration is properly made and not revoked or lost pursuant to Section 2.1(b) (each, a "Stock Election Share") shall be converted into the right to receive a number of validly issued, fully paid 

   ##### 

  

    

and non-assessable shares of Dorado Common Stock (subject to adjustment in
accordance with Section 2.3 and together with any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Dorado Common Stock to be paid pursuant to Section 2.2(e) (the "Per
Share Stock Election Consideration")), equal to the quotient (the "Exchange
Ratio") determined by dividing $50.00 by the Dorado Share Value and rounding
to the nearest ten-thousandth of a share; _provided_ , that (x) if the Dorado
Share Value is equal to or greater than $16.91, the Exchange Ratio shall
equal 2.9568, and (y) if the Dorado Share Value is equal to or less
than $13.29, the Exchange Ratio shall equal 3.7622. If the Available Cash
Election Amount exceeds the Cash Election Amount, then each Stock Election
Share shall be converted into the right to receive (1) an amount of cash
(without interest) equal to the amount of such excess divided by the number
of Stock Election Shares and (2) a number of validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable shares of Dorado Common Stock equal to the product of (x) the
Exchange Ratio and (y) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Per
Share Cash Election Consideration minus the amount calculated in clause (1)
of this paragraph and the denominator of which shall be the Per Share Cash
Election Consideration. 

  

 (b) _Election Procedures_. 

    

 (i) Not less than thirty (30) days prior to the anticipated Effective Time, an election form and other appropriate and customary transmittal materials (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates theretofore representing shares of Redfish Common Stock or non-certificated shares represented by book entry ("Book Entry Shares") shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such Certificates or Book Entry Shares, respectively, to the Exchange Agent) in such form as Dorado shall specify and as shall be reasonably acceptable to Redfish (the "Election Form") shall be mailed at such time as Redfish and Dorado may agree (the "Mailing Date") to each holder of record of shares of Redfish Common Stock as of five (5) business days prior to the Mailing Date (the "Election Form Record Date"). 

   

 (ii) Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or the beneficial owner through appropriate and customary documentation and instructions), other than any holder of Redfish Excluded Shares or Redfish Subsidiary Shares, to specify (i) the number of shares of such holders Redfish Common Stock with respect to which such holder elects to receive the Per Share Mixed Consideration, (ii) the number of shares of such holders Redfish Common Stock with respect to which such holder elects to receive the Per Share Stock Election Consideration, (iii) the number of shares of such holders Redfish Common Stock with respect to which such holder elects to receive the Per Share Cash Election Consideration, or (iv) that such holder makes no election with respect to such holders Redfish Common Stock ("Non-Election Shares"). Any Redfish Common Stock with respect to which the Exchange Agent has not received an effective, properly completed Election Form on or before 5:00 p.m., New York time, on the twentieth (20th) day following the Mailing Date (or such other time and date as Redfish and Dorado shall agree) (the "Election Deadline") (other than any shares 

   ##### 

  

    

of Redfish Common Stock that constitute Dissenting Shares as of such time)
shall also be deemed to be Non-Election Shares. 

   

 (iii) Dorado shall make available one or more Election Forms as may reasonably be requested from time to time by any persons who become holders (or beneficial owners) of Redfish Common Stock between the Election Form Record Date and the close of business on the business day prior to the Election Deadline, and Redfish shall provide to the Exchange Agent all information reasonably necessary for it to perform as specified herein. 

   

 (iv) Any election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent shall have received a properly completed Election Form by the Election Deadline. An Election Form shall be deemed properly completed only (i) if accompanied by one or more Certificates (or customary affidavits and, if required by Dorado or the Surviving Entity, the posting by such person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Entity may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate) and/or (ii) upon receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent or such other evidence of transfer of Book Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request, collectively representing all shares of Redfish Common Stock covered by such Election Form, together with duly executed transmittal materials included in the Election Form. Any Election Form may be revoked or changed by the person submitting such Election Form, by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline. In the event an Election Form is revoked prior to the Election Deadline, the shares of Redfish Common Stock represented by such Election Form shall become Non-Election Shares and Dorado shall cause the Certificates representing such shares of Redfish Common Stock or Book-Entry Shares to be promptly returned without charge to the person submitting the Election Form upon written request to that effect from the holder who submitted the Election Form, except to the extent (if any) a subsequent election is properly made with respect to any or all of such shares of Redfish Common Stock. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of the Election Form, the Exchange Agent, in consultation with Dorado and Redfish, shall have reasonable discretion to determine whether any election, revocation or change has been properly or timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in the Election Forms, and any good faith decisions of the Exchange Agent regarding such matters shall be binding and conclusive. None of Dorado, Redfish or the Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to notify any person of any defect in an Election Form. 

  

 (c) _Cancellation of Shares (other than Redfish Excluded Shares and Redfish Subsidiary Shares)_. As a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, at the Effective Time, all shares of Redfish Common Stock (other than Redfish Excluded Shares and any Redfish Subsidiary Shares) shall cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any shares of Redfish Common Stock (other than Redfish Excluded Shares and any Redfish Subsidiary Shares) (the "Certificates") and each Book Entry Share shall thereafter 

    ##### 

  

    

represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration with respect to
the shares of Redfish Common Stock formerly represented thereby, and any
dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled
pursuant to Section 2.2(c). For purposes of this Agreement, "Redfish Excluded
Shares" shall mean (i) any shares of Redfish Common Stock held by Dorado,
Redfish or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Dorado, in each
case except for any such shares held on behalf of third parties, and (ii) any
Dissenting Shares. For purposes of this Agreement, "Redfish
Subsidiary Shares" shall mean any shares of Redfish Common Stock held by any
direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Redfish except for any such
shares held on behalf of third parties. 

   

 (d) _Cancellation of Redfish Excluded Shares and Redfish Subsidiary Shares_. Each Redfish Excluded Share and each Redfish Subsidiary Share at the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled and retired without payment of any consideration therefor, and no Dorado Common Stock or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor, subject to the right of the holder of any Dissenting Shares to receive the payment to which reference is made in Section 2.4. 

   

 (e) _Dorado_. At the Effective Time, each share of Dorado Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall continue to be one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $.001 per share, of the Surviving Entity. 

   

 (f) _Employee Stock Options; Restricted Stock_. 

   

 (i) In accordance with the terms of Redfishs 2000 Incentive Stock Plan (the "2000 Stock Plan") or Redfishs 2008 Incentive Stock Plan (the "2008 Stock Plan"), each holder of an option to purchase shares of Redfish Common Stock (in each case, an "Option"), shall have such Option that is then outstanding, whether or not exercisable or vested, converted into an obligation of the Surviving Entity to pay to the holder thereof, an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Redfish Common Stock previously subject to such Option, whether or not then exercisable or vested, and (ii) the excess, if any, of (A) in the case of the 2000 Stock Plan, the "Change in Control Price," as defined in the 2000 Stock Plan, or (B) in the case of the 2008 Stock Plan, the Per Share Cash Election Consideration, in either case, over the exercise price per share previously subject to such Option, without interest and reduced by any applicable withholding. 

  

 (ii) Except as set forth in (iii) below with respect to Redfish 2009 Bonus Restricted Shares, subject to the terms and upon the conditions herein, as of the Effective Time, the restrictions on each Redfish Restricted Share granted and then outstanding under the 2000 Stock Plan or the 2008 Stock Plan shall, without any action on the part of the holder thereof, Redfish or Dorado, lapse, each such Redfish Restricted Share will be fully vested in each holder thereof at that time, and each such Redfish Restricted Share will be treated at the Effective Time the same as, and have the same rights and be subject to the same conditions as, each share of Redfish Common Stock not subject to any restrictions, except that upon that vesting the holder may satisfy the applicable withholding Tax obligations by returning to the Surviving Entity a sufficient number of shares of Redfish Common Stock equal in value to that 

   ##### 

  

 

obligation. Prior to the Effective Time, Redfish, the Redfish Board of
Directors and the Compensation Committee of such board shall take all
actions necessary under the 2000 Stock Plan, the 2008 Stock Plan, the award
agreements thereunder and otherwise to effectuate this Section 2.1(f)(ii).
For purposes of this Agreement, "Redfish Restricted Shares" shall mean shares
of restricted Redfish Common Stock granted and awarded pursuant to the 2000
Stock Plan or the 2008 Stock Plan (excluding any such shares the
restrictions on which have lapsed prior to the Effective Time and excluding
Redfish 2009 Bonus Restricted Shares). 

   

 (iii) Each Redfish 2009 Bonus Restricted Share shall be converted into Converted Restricted Shares in accordance with Section 6.8(c) of the Agreement. As of the Effective Time, Dorado shall assume the obligations of Redfish under the 2008 Stock Plan. Dorado shall cause the registration of the Converted Restricted Shares to become effective as part of a registration statement on Form S-8, or any successor or other appropriate forms, no later than the Effective Time, and shall maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements, including the current status of any related prospectus, for so long as the Converted Restricted Shares remain outstanding. With respect to those individuals, if any, who subsequent to the Effective Time will be subject to the reporting requirements under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, where applicable, Dorado shall use all reasonable efforts to administer or cause to be administered the 2008 Stock Plan in a manner that complies with Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act to the extent the 2008 Stock Plan complied with such rule prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (iv) Redfish shall make arrangements reasonably satisfactory to Dorado to satisfy all employment and income tax withholding requirements with respect to each award under the 2000 Stock Plan and the 2008 Stock Plan that vests pursuant to this Section 2.1(f). 

  

 Section 2.2 _Exchange of Shares_. 

   

 (a) _Exchange Fund_. As of the Effective Time, Dorado shall appoint a commercial bank or trust company or such other party as is reasonably satisfactory to Redfish to act as exchange agent hereunder for the purpose of exchanging Certificates and Book Entry Shares for the Merger Consideration (the "Exchange Agent"). Prior to the Effective Time, Dorado shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of holders of shares of Redfish Common Stock, the number of shares of Dorado Common Stock that are issuable pursuant to Section 2.1 and an amount of cash representing the aggregate cash consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.1. Dorado shall deposit such shares of Dorado Common Stock with the Exchange Agent by delivering to the Exchange Agent certificates representing, or providing to the Exchange Agent an uncertificated book-entry for, such shares. In addition, Dorado shall make available to the Exchange Agent from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to make payments for the cash consideration pursuant to Section 2.1, payments in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and any dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 2.2(c). Any cash and shares of Dorado Common Stock deposited by Dorado with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Exchange Fund." 

   

 (b) _Exchange Rules._ Promptly after the Effective Time, Dorado shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of one or more shares of Redfish Common 

    ##### 

  

    

Stock as of the Effective Time (other than any holder which has previously
and properly surrendered all of its Certificate(s) to the Exchange Agent in
accordance with Section 2.1(b) (each, an "Electing Stockholder")): (i)
a letter of transmittal (the "Letter of Transmittal"), which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the shares of
Redfish Common Stock shall pass, only upon delivery of the corresponding
Certificates to the Exchange Agent or receipt by the Exchange Agent of an
"agents message" with respect to Book Entry Shares, which letter shall be in
customary form and have such other provisions as Dorado may reasonably
specify, and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of such
Certificates or Book Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration.
Each holder of shares of Redfish Common Stock that have been converted into a
right to receive the Merger Consideration, upon (i) with respect to any
Electing Stockholder, completion of the calculations required by Section
2.1(a) or (ii) with respect to any holder that is not an Electing
Stockholder, surrender of a Certificate or Book Entry Shares to the Exchange
Agent together with such Letter of Transmittal, duly executed and completed
in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, will be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor (i) one or more shares of Dorado Common Stock which shall
be in uncertificated book-entry form unless a physical certificate is
requested and which shall represent, in the aggregate, the whole number of
shares that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(a)
(after taking into account all shares of Redfish Common Stock then held by
such holder) and (ii) a check in the amount equal to any cash that such holder
has the right to receive pursuant to this Article II, consisting of the cash
consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(a), cash in lieu of any fractional
shares of Dorado Common Stock, as the case may be, pursuant to Section 2.2(e)
and any dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 2.2(c). No
interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash payable pursuant to Section
2.1(a), Section 2.2(c) or Section 2.2(e). In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Redfish Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer
records of Redfish, one or more shares of Dorado Common Stock evidencing, in
the aggregate, the proper number of shares of Dorado Common Stock and a
check in the proper amount of any cash consideration pursuant to Section
2.1(a), cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Dorado Common Stock pursuant
to Section 2.2(e) and any dividends or other distributions to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c), may be issued with respect to
such Redfish Common Stock, as the case may be, to such a transferee if the
Certificate representing such shares of Redfish Common Stock is presented to
the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes
have been paid. 

   

 (c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. All shares of Dorado Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be deemed issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time. No dividends or other distributions declared or made in respect of Dorado Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any shares of Redfish Common Stock until the holder of such shares shall surrender such shares in accordance with this Article II. Subject to applicable law, following surrender of any such shares, there shall be issued and/or paid to the holder of the certificates representing whole shares of Dorado Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the dividends or other distributions payable in respect of such shares of Dorado Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to the date of such surrender and not previously paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such shares of Dorado Common Stock with a record date after the 

    ##### 

  

    

Effective Time but on or prior to the date of such surrender and with a
payment date subsequent to such surrender. 

   

 (d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Redfish Common Stock._ All shares of Dorado Common Stock issued and cash paid upon conversion of shares of Redfish Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Article II (including any cash paid pursuant to Section 2.2(c) or Section 2.2(e)) shall be deemed to have been issued or paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Redfish Common Stock previously represented by such Certificates and/or Book Entry Shares. 

   

 (e) _No Fractional Shares of Dorado Common Stock_. 

    

 (i) No certificates or scrip or shares of Dorado Common Stock representing fractional shares of Dorado Common Stock or book-entry credit of the same shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights of a stockholder of Dorado. 

   

 (ii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Redfish Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fractional share of Dorado Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates and/or Book Entry Shares held by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to the product of (A) such fractional part of a share of Dorado Common Stock multiplied by (B) the closing price for a share of Dorado Common Stock on the NYSE Composite Transactions Tape on the business day immediately preceding the Closing Date. 

   

 (iii) As promptly as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of fractional interests, the Exchange Agent shall so notify Dorado, and Dorado shall deposit such amount with the Exchange Agent and shall cause the Exchange Agent to forward payments to such holders of fractional interests subject to and in accordance with the terms hereof. 

  

 (f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates and/or Book Entry Shares as of the date six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Dorado or otherwise on the instruction of Dorado, and any holders of the Certificates and/or Book Entry Shares who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Dorado for the Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Redfish Common Stock formerly represented thereby to which such holders are entitled pursuant to Section 2.1, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Dorado Common Stock to which such holders are entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and any dividends or distributions with respect to shares of Dorado Common Stock to which such holders are entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c). Any such portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Redfish Common Stock five years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority) shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law,

become the property of Dorado free and clear of any claims or interest of any
person previously entitled thereto. 

   

 (g) _No Liability_. None of Dorado, Redfish, the Surviving Entity, any affiliate of any of the foregoing or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any Merger Consideration from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official or Governmental Authority pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 

   

 (h) _Investment of the Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Dorado on a daily basis; _provided_ that no such gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to the stockholders of Redfish pursuant to this Article II and that if at any time prior to the termination of the Exchange Fund pursuant to Section 2.2(f), the amount of cash included in the Exchange Fund is reduced below the amount necessary to pay the cash component of any unpaid Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Dorado Common Stock payable pursuant to Section 2.2(e), and dividends and distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c), Dorado shall promptly deposit additional cash into the Exchange Fund sufficient to rectify this deficiency. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid promptly to Dorado. 

   

 (i) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by Dorado, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Dorado may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Dorado Common Stock to which the holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and any dividends and distributions with respect to shares of Dorado Common Stock to which the holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c), in each case with respect to the shares of Redfish Common Stock formerly represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate. 

   

 (j) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Exchange Agent and the Surviving Entity shall be entitled, without duplication, to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Redfish Common Stock, Redfish Restricted Shares or any other equity rights in Redfish such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of applicable law and shall further be entitled to sell Dorado Common Stock otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to satisfy any such withholding requirement (which Dorado Common Stock will be valued with respect to such withholding at the average of the high and low trading prices of Dorado Common Stock on the NYSE on the day of such sale). To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent or Dorado, as the case may be, and paid over to the applicable Governmental Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (k) _Further Assurances_. After the Effective Time, the officers and directors of the Surviving Entity will be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of Redfish, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of Redfish, any other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Entity any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Entity as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger. 

   

 (l) _Stock Transfer Books_. The stock transfer books of Redfish shall be closed immediately upon the Effective Time and there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Redfish Common Stock thereafter on the records of Redfish. At or after the Effective Time, any Certificates or Book Entry Shares presented to the Exchange Agent or Dorado for any reason shall represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Redfish Common Stock formerly represented thereby (including any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Dorado Common Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled to pursuant to Section 2.2(e)) and any dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c). 

   

 Section 2.3 _Certain Adjustments_. If, subsequent to the date of this Agreement but prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding Dorado Common Stock or Redfish Common Stock shall have been changed by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, split-up, combination or exchange of shares, or a stock dividend or dividend payable in any other securities shall be declared with a record date within such period, or any similar event shall have occurred, the Merger Consideration, the Per Share Mixed Election Cash Amount, the Mixed Election Stock Exchange Ratio, the Exchange Ratio and any other similarly dependent items, as the case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of Redfish Common Stock consideration having the same economic effect as was contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. 

   

 Section 2.4 _Appraisal Rights_. No holder of Dissenting Shares (a "Dissenting Stockholder") shall be entitled to any Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Dorado Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.2(e), or dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 2.2(c) in respect of such Dissenting Shares unless and until such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such holders right to seek appraisal of its Dissenting Shares under the DGCL, and any Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to receive only the payment provided by Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to the Dissenting Shares owned by such Dissenting Stockholder. If any person who otherwise would be deemed a Dissenting Stockholder shall have failed properly to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost the right to seek appraisal with respect to any Dissenting Shares, such Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be treated as though such Dissenting Shares had been converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(a). Redfish shall give Dorado (a) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to applicable law received by Redfish relating to stockholders rights of appraisal and (b) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demand for appraisal under the DGCL. Redfish shall not, except with the prior written consent of Dorado, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisals of Dissenting Shares, offer to settle or settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any 

   ##### 

  

   

such demands. For purposes of this Agreement, "Dissenting Shares" means
shares of Redfish Common Stock as to which the holder thereof has exercised
appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. 

   

 Section 2.5 _Associated Rights_. References in this Agreement to Redfish Common Stock shall include, unless the context requires otherwise, the associated rights (the "Redfish Rights") distributed to the holders of Redfish Common Stock pursuant to the Rights Agreement, dated as of October 28, 2008, between Redfish and Mellon Investor Services LLC, as rights agent, as amended to date (the "Rights Agreement").

Redfish and each Redfish Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation, limited liability company or limited partnership to do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its business makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for such failures to be so qualified or licensed and in good standing that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Redfish Material Adverse Effect. A true and complete list of all the Redfish Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement, together with the jurisdiction of incorporation or formation of each Redfish Subsidiary and the percentage of the outstanding capital stock or other equity interest of each Redfish Subsidiary owned by Redfish and each other Redfish Subsidiary as of such date, is set forth in _Schedule 3.1_.

Except as set forth in _Schedule 3.3_, all of the outstanding capital stock of, or other ownership interests in, each Redfish Subsidiary is owned by Redfish, directly or indirectly, free and clear of all security interests, liens, claims, pledges, options, rights of first refusal, agreements, limitations on Redfishs or such other Redfish Subsidiarys voting rights, charges and other encumbrances of any nature whatsoever. Subject to the foregoing, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not effect or result in any change in the ownership of Redfish or of any Redfish Subsidiary except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement.

 (iv) "Plans" means all employee benefit plans, programs and other arrangements providing benefits to any employee or former employee in respect of services provided to Redfish or any of the Redfish Subsidiaries or Dorado or any of the Dorado Subsidiaries, as applicable, or ERISA Affiliates or to any beneficiary or dependent thereof, and whether covering one individual or more than one individual, sponsored or maintained by Redfish or any of the Redfish Subsidiaries or Dorado or any of the Dorado Subsidiaries, as applicable, or ERISA Affiliates or to which Redfish or any of the Redfish Subsidiaries or Dorado or any of the Dorado Subsidiaries, as applicable, or ERISA Affiliates contributes or is obligated to contribute or could have any liability. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the term "Plans" includes compensation and benefit arrangements (whether or not subject to ERISA) or payroll practices, including, without limitation, any defined benefit or defined contribution pension plan, profit sharing plan, stock ownership plan, deferred compensation agreement or arrangement, vacation pay, sickness, disability or death benefit plan (whether provided through insurance, on a funded or unfunded basis or otherwise), employee stock option or stock purchase plan, bonus or incentive plan or program, long-term incentive programs in the form of restricted stock grants and stock option grants, severance pay plan, agreement, practice, arrangement or policy (including statutory severance and termination indemnity plans), employment agreement, retention pay, consulting or other compensation agreements, medical insurance including medical, dental, vision, and prescription coverage, life and accidental death and dismemberment insurance, tuition aid reimbursement, relocation assistance, expatriate benefits, retiree medical and life insurance maintained by Redfish or any of the Redfish Subsidiaries or Dorado or any of the Dorado Subsidiaries, as applicable, or ERISA Affiliates or to which Redfish or any of the Redfish Subsidiaries or Dorado or any of the Dorado Subsidiaries, as applicable, or ERISA Affiliates has contributed or is obligated to contribute or under which it has any liability and each other employee benefit plan, program or arrangement, including each "employee benefit plan" (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA).

   ##### 

  

   

(where applicable): (i) each writing constituting a part of such Redfish Plan,
including, without limitation, all plan documents (including amendments),
benefit schedules, trust agreements, and insurance contracts and other
funding vehicles; (ii) the three most recent Annual Reports (Form 5500
Series) and all accompanying schedules, if any; (iii) the current summary plan
description, if any; (iv) the most recent annual financial report, if any;
(v) the two most recent actuarial valuations for any defined benefit pension
plans; (vi) any notices to or other communications with any governmental
agency, commission or regulatory body relative to any Redfish Plan in the
past five years; and (vii) the most recent opinion and determination letters
from the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), if any, with respect to any tax
qualified or tax exempt Redfish Plan and/or trust or other funding
instrument. Except as specifically provided in the foregoing documents
provided to Dorado or as set forth on _Schedule 3.11(b)_, there are no
amendments to any Redfish Plan that have been adopted or approved, nor has
Redfish or any of the Redfish Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates undertaken to
make any such amendments or to adopt or approve any new Redfish Plan. Redfish
maintains only one "employee pension plan," as defined in Section 3(2) of
ERISA, which is a defined contribution plan intended to be qualified pursuant
to Section 401(a) and 501(a) of the Code, and to be a cash or deferred
arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code (the "Redfish
401(k) Plan"). The Redfish 401(k) Plan is maintained on a nonstandardized
prototype plan document, the underlying form of which has received a
favorable opinion letter from the IRS, has been timely amended as required to
reflect changes in applicable law and, to the knowledge of Redfish as of the
date hereof, nothing has occurred with respect to the operation of the
Redfish 401(k) Plan that would cause the loss of such tax qualification
or exemption or the imposition of any material liability, penalty or tax
under ERISA or the Code. No stock or other security issued by Redfish or any
Redfish Subsidiary forms or has formed a material part of the assets of any
Redfish Plan. 

   

 (c) Neither Redfish nor any of the Redfish Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates maintains or contributes to any plan that is (i) covered by Title IV of ERISA, (ii) subject to the minimum funding requirements of Section 412 of the Code, (iii) a "Multiemployer Plan" as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA, (iv) a plan that has two or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under common control (within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA) (a "Multiple Employer Plan"), or subject to Section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA, or (v) funded by a voluntary employees beneficiary association within the meaning of Code Section 501(c)(9), nor has Redfish or any of the Redfish Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates, at any time within six years before the date of this Agreement, contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan. There does not now exist, and there are no existing circumstances that could reasonably be expected to result in, any material Controlled Group Liability that would be a liability of Redfish or any of the Redfish Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates following the Closing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither Redfish nor any of the Redfish Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates has engaged in any transaction described in Section 4069 or that constitutes a withdrawal under Section 4201 et seq. of ERISA. 

   

 (d) All contributions required to be made by Redfish or any of the Redfish Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates to any Redfish Plan by applicable laws or by any plan document or other contractual undertaking, and all premiums due or payable with respect to insurance policies funding any Redfish Plan, for any period through the date hereof have been timely made or paid in full and through the Closing Date will be timely made or paid in full. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (e) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.11(e)_, Redfish and the Redfish Subsidiaries and their respective ERISA Affiliates have complied, and are now in compliance, in all material respects, with all provisions of ERISA, the Code and all laws and regulations (including any applicable local laws) applicable to the Redfish Plans. Each Redfish Plan has been operated in material compliance with its terms and has been maintained, in all material respects, in compliance will all provisions of ERISA, the Code and other applicable laws. Except as would not have a Redfish Material Adverse Effect, there is not now, and there are no existing circumstances that could reasonably be expected to give rise to, any requirement for the posting of security with respect to a Redfish Plan or the imposition of any pledge, lien, security interest or encumbrance on the assets of Redfish or any of the Redfish Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates under ERISA or the Code, or similar applicable laws of foreign jurisdictions. Except as would not have a Redfish Material Adverse Effect, neither Redfish nor any of the Redfish Subsidiaries or their respective ERISA Affiliates, nor any "party in interest" or "disqualified person" with respect to any Redfish Plan, has engaged in any nonexempt "prohibited transaction" within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA. 

   

 (f) _Schedule 3.11(f)_ sets forth a list of each Redfish Plan that has assets (or provides benefits) that include securities issued by Redfish, any of the Redfish Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates. 

   

 (g) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.11(g)_, except for health continuation coverage as required by Section 4980B of the Code or Part 6 of Title I of ERISA, neither Redfish nor any of the Redfish Subsidiaries has any material liability for life, health, medical or other welfare benefits to former employees or beneficiaries or dependents thereof. To the knowledge of Redfish, there has been no communication to employees of Redfish or the Redfish Subsidiaries that could reasonably be expected or interpreted to promise or guarantee such employees retiree health or life insurance benefits or other retiree death benefits on a permanent basis. 

   

 (h) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.11(h)_, neither this Agreement nor the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will result in any forgiveness of indebtedness or obligation to fund benefits with respect to any employee, director, independent contractor, consultant or officer of Redfish or any Redfish Subsidiary, or result in any restriction on the right to merge, amend or terminate any Redfish Plan, or result in any new or increased contribution required to be made to any of the Redfish Plans. 

   

 (i) Except as disclosed in _Schedule 3.11(i)_, there is no pending, or, to the knowledge of Redfish, threatened, suit, claim, action, proceeding, hearing, notice of violation, demand letter or investigation (an "Action") (other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course) that have been asserted or instituted against any Redfish Plan, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties to any Redfish Plan or the assets of any of the trusts under any Redfish Plan that could reasonably be expected to result in any material liability of Redfish or any of the Redfish Subsidiaries to any person, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the United States Department of Treasury, the United States Department of Labor or any Multiemployer Plan, or to comparable entities or Redfish Plans under applicable laws of jurisdictions outside the United States. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (j) _Schedule 3.11(j)_ sets forth the names of all directors and Section 16 officers of Redfish, the total salary and bonus each will be eligible to receive in the current Redfish fiscal year, and any changes to the foregoing that will occur as a matter of entitlement subsequent to such fiscal year end. _Schedule 3.11(j)_ also sets forth the liability of Redfish and the Redfish Subsidiaries for deferred compensation under any deferred compensation plan, excess plan or similar arrangement (other than pursuant to Redfish Plans) to each such director, officer and employee and to all other employees as a group, together with the value, as of the date specified thereon, of the assets (if any) set aside in any grantor trust(s) to fund such liabilities. Except as disclosed in _Schedule 3.11(j)_, there are no other material forms of compensation paid to any such director, officer or employee of Redfish. 

   

 (k) No Redfish Plan is subject to the laws of any jurisdiction outside of the United States. 

   

 (l) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.11(l)_, no disallowance of a deduction under Section 162(m) of the Code for employee reimbursement of any amount paid or payable by Redfish or any of the Redfish Subsidiaries has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur. All Redfish Plans that are subject to Section 409A of the Code are in material compliance with the requirements of such Code Section and regulations thereunder.

The information to be supplied in writing by Redfish for inclusion in the registration statement on Form S-4 pursuant to which shares of Dorado Common Stock issued in the Merger will be registered under the Securities Act (the "Registration Statement") will not, at the time the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated in the Registration Statement or necessary in order to make the statements in the Registration Statement, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The information supplied in writing by Redfish for inclusion in the proxy statement/prospectus to be sent to the Redfish Stockholders relating to the Redfish Stockholders Meeting and the proxy statement to be sent to the Dorado Stockholders relating to the Dorado Stockholders Meeting (such proxy statements together, in each case as amended or supplemented from time to time, the "Joint Proxy Statement") will not, at the time the Joint Proxy Statement is first published, sent or given to Redfish Stockholders and Dorado Stockholders, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading and will not, at the time of the Redfish Stockholders Meeting or at the time of the Dorado Stockholders Meeting, omit to state any material fact necessary to correct any statement in any earlier communication with respect to the solicitation of proxies for the Redfish Stockholders Meeting or the Dorado Stockholders Meeting that shall have become false or misleading in any material respect.

 Section 4.23 _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.

 Section 4.25 _Required Dorado Stockholder Vote_. The affirmative vote of a majority of the then outstanding shares of Dorado Common Stock is the only vote of the holders of any class or series of Dorado capital stock necessary to adopt and approve this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger) (such vote, the "Dorado Stockholder Approval"), and no other vote of the holders of any class or series of Dorado capital stock or other Dorado securities is necessary to approve this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger.

Morgan Securities Inc. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the "Financing Sources") that relates to the provision of all of the financing for immediately available cash funds (the "Funds") sufficient, together with cash on hand of Dorado, (i) to pay the cash portion of the Merger Consideration and (ii) for any other amounts payable by Dorado under this Agreement (such commitment letter, together with all agreements, arrangements or undertakings related thereto and all schedules, annexes, exhibits or other attachments thereto (except that amounts of fees payable under documents relating solely to fee arrangements in connection therewith may be redacted) collectively, the "Commitment Letter"). The Commitment Letter has not been amended or modified, no such amendment or modification is contemplated, and the commitment contained in the Commitment Letter has not been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. Dorado has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees in connection with the Commitment Letter that are payable on or prior to the date hereof. The Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and is the legal, valid and binding obligation of Dorado and does not restrict any transfer of funds from Dorado in connection with the Merger or other matters contemplated by this Agreement. There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to advances under the Commitment Letter, other than as explicitly set forth in the Commitment Letter. No event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default on the part of Dorado under the Commitment Letter. Dorado and its affiliates (as applicable) are in a position to satisfy timely all conditions to be satisfied by them to advances under the Commitment Letter, and Dorado has no reason to believe that any conditions to advances contemplated by the Commitment Letter will not be satisfied or that such advances will not be made to Dorado at the times set forth in this Agreement in order to satisfy Dorados obligations herein. Subject to Dorados receipt thereof on or before the Closing Date, on the Closing Date, the aggregate proceeds of the financings provided for in the Commitment Letter, together with available funds (in cash or cash equivalents) of Dorado (details in respect of which have been delivered by Dorado to Redfish prior to the date of this Agreement), would equal or exceed the amount of the Funds.

 _ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS_   

  

 Section 6.1 _Proxy Statement; Stockholders Meeting_. 

   

 (a) Dorado and Redfish shall cooperate and promptly prepare the Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy Statement and shall file the Registration Statement in which the Joint Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus with the SEC as soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof. Dorado and Redfish shall cooperate to respond promptly to any comments made by the SEC and otherwise use reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration 

    ##### 

  

    

Statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
practicable after filing. Subject to applicable laws, Dorado and Redfish each
shall, upon request by the other, furnish the other with all information
concerning itself, its subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and
such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection
with the preparation and filing of the Joint Proxy Statement and the
Registration Statement as provided for hereunder. Each of Dorado and Redfish
agree to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Joint
Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement which shall have become false
or misleading in any material respect. Each of Dorado and Redfish shall cause
the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to its respective stockholders at the
earliest practicable time after the Registration Statement is declared
effective by the SEC. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any event
occurs that is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Joint Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement, Dorado or Redfish, as
applicable, shall inform the other promptly of such occurrence and cooperate
in filing such amendment or supplement with the SEC, use reasonable best
efforts to cause such amendment to become effective as promptly as possible
and, if required, mail that amendment or supplement to stockholders of Dorado
and/or Redfish. Dorado shall use reasonable best efforts, and Redfish shall
cooperate with Dorado, to obtain any and all state securities laws or "blue
sky" permits, approvals and registrations necessary in connection with the
issuance of Dorado Common Stock pursuant to the Merger. 

   

 (b) Dorado shall cause the Registration Statement (and Dorado and Redfish will cause the Joint Proxy Statement, each to the extent that it provides information to be contained therein), at the time it becomes effective under the Securities Act, to comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder, and Redfish shall furnish to Dorado true, accurate and complete information in all material respects relating to Redfish and holders of Redfish Common Stock and Options as is required to be included therein. Dorado shall advise Redfish, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective under the Securities Act, the issuance of any stop order with respect to the Registration Statement, the suspension of the qualification of the Dorado Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any comment or request for additional information by the SEC with respect to the Registration Statement. 

   

 (c) Each of Dorado and Redfish shall ensure that the information provided by it for inclusion in the Joint Proxy Statement and each amendment or supplement thereto, at the time of mailing thereof and at the time of the respective meetings of stockholders of Dorado and Redfish, or, in the case of information provided by it for inclusion in the Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto, at the time it becomes effective, will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. 

   

 (d) Neither the Registration Statement nor the Joint Proxy Statement nor any amendment or supplement (including by incorporation by reference) thereto will be filed or disseminated to the stockholders of Redfish or Dorado without the approval of both Dorado and Redfish (which approval will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), but with respect to documents filed by a party hereto that are incorporated by reference in the Registration 

    ##### 

  

    

Statement or Joint Proxy Statement, this right of approval will apply only
with respect to information relating to the other party or its business,
financial condition or results of operations; and, further, Redfish or
Dorado, in connection with a Redfish Adverse Recommendation Change or a
Dorado Adverse Recommendation Change, as the case may be, may amend or
supplement the Joint Proxy Statement or Registration Statement (including by
incorporation by reference) to effect such a Redfish Recommendation Change or
Dorado Adverse Recommendation Change, and in such event, this right of
approval will apply only with respect to information relating to the other
party or its business, financial condition or results of operations. 

   

 (e) Redfish, acting through the Redfish Board of Directors, shall, in accordance with applicable law and Redfishs certificate of incorporation and bylaws, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold an annual or special meeting of its stockholders (the "Redfish Stockholders Meeting") as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act for the purpose of obtaining the Redfish Stockholder Approval. The Redfish Board of Directors shall, subject to Section 6.3(b), recommend the adoption and approval of this Agreement at the Redfish Stockholders Meeting (the "Redfish Recommendation"), include such recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Redfish Stockholder Approval. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 8.1 and in compliance with Section 6.3, Redfish, regardless of whether the Redfish Board of Directors has approved, endorsed or recommended an Acquisition Proposal for Redfish or has withdrawn, modified or amended the Redfish Recommendation, will submit this Agreement for approval by Redfish Stockholders at the Redfish Stockholders Meeting. 

   

 (f) Dorado, acting through the Dorado Board of Directors, shall, in accordance with applicable law and Dorados certificate of incorporation and bylaws, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold an annual or special meeting of its stockholders (the "Dorado Stockholders Meeting") as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act for the purpose of obtaining the Dorado Stockholder Approval. The Dorado Board of Directors shall recommend the adoption and approval of this Agreement at the Dorado Stockholders Meeting (the "Dorado Recommendation"), include such recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Dorado Stockholder Approval. The Dorado Board of Directors may not withhold or withdraw or, in a manner adverse to Redfish, modify or qualify the Dorado Recommendation (or publicly propose to, or publicly state that it intends to, withhold or withdraw or so modify or qualify the Dorado Recommendation) (any such actions being a "Dorado Adverse Recommendation Change"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Dorado Stockholder Approval, and subject to Dorado compliance at all times with the provisions of this Section 6.1(f) and Section 6.6, the Dorado Board of Directors may make a Dorado Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event if the Dorado Board of Directors concludes in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and, if appropriate, its financial advisor) that the failure to take such action would breach its fiduciary duties under applicable law. However, the Dorado Board of Directors will not be entitled to exercise its right to make a Dorado Adverse Recommendation Change unless Dorado provides written notice to Redfish (a "Dorado Notice"), at least four business days before taking such action, of its intention to do so and Dorado otherwise complies with this Section 6.1(f). A Dorado Notice shall include a description of the Intervening Event. If requested by Redfish, 

    ##### 

  

    

Dorado shall engage in good faith negotiations with Redfish, during the four
business day period after Redfishs receipt of a Dorado Notice, to amend this
Agreement in such a manner such that the failure by the Dorado Board of
Directors to make a Dorado Adverse Recommendation Change would no longer
cause such board to be in breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable
law. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, unless this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 8.1, Dorado will,
regardless of whether Dorado has withdrawn, modified or amended the Dorado
Recommendation, submit this Agreement for approval by the Dorado Stockholders
at the Dorado Stockholders Meeting. The term "Intervening Event" means, with
respect to either party, a material event or circumstance that was not known
or reasonably foreseeable to the board of directors of such party on the date
of this Agreement (or if known, the consequences of which are not known to or
reasonably foreseeable by such board of directors as of the date hereof),
which event or circumstance, or any material consequences thereof, becomes
known to the board of directors of such party prior to the time at which such
party receives the Redfish Stockholder Approval or Dorado Stockholder
Approval, as applicable; provided, however, that in no event shall any of the
following constitute an Intervening Event: (i) the receipt, existence or terms
of an Acquisition Proposal for Dorado or of information or any communication
that could lead to any acquisition by Dorado of any business or assets other
than Redfish, or any consequence thereof, (ii) any failure to arrange or
receive the Financing or any Alternate Financing, or any of the terms or
consequences of the Financing or any Alternate Financing, or (iii) any change
in, or event or condition generally affecting, the oil and natural gas
industry or exploration and production companies, including, without
limitation, any change in oil or natural gas prices or price differentials. 

   

 (g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Dorado or Redfish, after consultation with the other party hereto, may adjourn or postpone the Dorado Stockholders Meeting or the Redfish Stockholders Meeting, as applicable, to the extent it believes in good faith is necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement is provided to its stockholders or, if as of the time for which the Dorado Stockholders Meeting or the Redfish Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Joint Proxy Statement) there are insufficient shares of Dorado Common Stock or Redfish Common Stock, as applicable, represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct business at such meeting or to obtain approval of the matters to be considered thereat, or, regarding the Dorado Stockholders Meeting to the extent Dorado believes in good faith is necessary in order to facilitate securing the Financing as near as practicable to the time of the Dorado Stockholder Meeting. 

   

 (h) Prior to the Effective Time, Dorado shall use all reasonable efforts to obtain authorization for listing on the New York Stock Exchange of the shares of Dorado Common Stock issuable and required to be reserved for issuance in connection with the Merger, subject to official notice of issuance. 

   

 (i) Each of Redfish and Dorado will use reasonable best efforts to hold the Redfish Stockholders Meeting and the Dorado Stockholders Meeting, respectively, on the same date as the other party and as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement.

Any such investigation shall be conducted in a manner that minimizes any interference with the operations of Dorado and Redfish, as the case may be. Each of Dorado and Redfish may, at their own expense, photocopy information it reviews, subject to applicable third-party approvals. Each of Dorado and Redfish agrees to indemnify and hold the other party harmless from any and all claims and liabilities, including costs and expenses for loss, injury to or death of any representative of Dorado or Redfish, as the case may be, and any loss, damage to or destruction of any property owned by Dorado or Redfish or any other person or entity (including claims or liabilities for loss of use of any property) resulting directly or indirectly from the action or inaction of any of their respective representatives during any visit to the others business or property sites prior to the Effective Time, whether pursuant to this Section 6.2 or otherwise. Neither Dorado nor Redfish, nor any of their respective employees, representatives, consultants, attorneys, investment bankers, agents, lenders or other advisors, shall conduct any environmental testing or sampling on any of the business or property sites of the other party prior to the Effective Time without the prior written consent of the other party. 

   

 (b) To the extent permitted by applicable law, in order to facilitate the continuing operation of Redfish by Dorado without disruption and to assist in an achievement of an orderly transition in the ownership and management of Redfish, until the Effective Time, Redfish and Dorado shall cooperate reasonably with each other to effect an orderly transition including, without limitation, with respect to communications with employees. 

   

 (c) Any information obtained by either party hereto or its employees, representatives, consultants, attorneys, investment bankers, agents, lenders and other advisors under this Section 6.2 shall be subject to the confidentiality and use restrictions contained in those certain letter agreements between Redfish and Dorado dated September 30, 2009 and October 19, 2009 (the "Confidentiality Agreements"). 

   

 (d) Nothing in this Section 6.2 shall require Dorado or Redfish to provide any information which it reasonably believes it may not provide to the other by reason of applicable law, rules or regulations, which constitutes information protected by attorney/client privilege, or which Dorado or Redfish (or any of their respective subsidiaries) is required to keep confidential by reason of contract, agreement or understanding with third parties in effect on the date hereof. 

   

 Section 6.3 _No Solicitation_. 

   

 (a) Except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement, neither Redfish nor any of the Redfish Subsidiaries may, and Redfish and the Redfish Subsidiaries shall direct their respective officers, directors, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, financial advisors, agents and other representatives not to, (i) directly or indirectly initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate (including by way of furnishing non-public information) any inquiry or the making or submission of any proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal for Redfish, (ii) participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, or disclose any non-public information or data relating to Redfish or any of

the Redfish Subsidiaries or afford access to the properties, books or records
of Redfish or any of the Redfish Subsidiaries to any person that has made an
Acquisition Proposal for Redfish or to any person in contemplation of an
Acquisition Proposal for Redfish, or (iii) accept an Acquisition Proposal for
Redfish or enter into any agreement, including any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership

constituting or related to, or that is intended to or could reasonably
be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal for Redfish (other than an

or (B) requiring, intended to cause, or which could reasonably be expected to
cause Redfish to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger (any
agreement, arrangement or understanding referred to in this clause (iii),
an "Acquisition Agreement"). Any violation of any of the foregoing
restrictions by any Redfish Subsidiary, by any director or executive officer
of Redfish, or by any other representative of Redfish or any Redfish
Subsidiary acting at the direction of the Redfish Board of Directors or
any director or executive officer of Redfish, will constitute a breach of
this Agreement by Redfish. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, Redfish and the Redfish Board of Directors may take any action
described in clause (ii) or (iii) of this Section 6.3(a) with respect to a
third party if at any time after the execution of this Agreement and prior to
obtaining the Redfish Stockholder Approval (w) Redfish receives a written
Acquisition Proposal for Redfish from that third party (and an Acquisition
Proposal for Redfish from that third party was not during that time period
initiated, solicited, knowingly encouraged or knowingly facilitated in
violation of this Section 6.3 by Redfish, by any Redfish Subsidiary, by any
executive officer or director of Redfish, or by any other representative of
Redfish or any Redfish Subsidiary acting at the direction of the Redfish
Board of Directors or any director or executive officer of Redfish), and (x)
the Redfish Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation
with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that such proposal
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal,
but Redfish may not deliver any information to that third party without
entering into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and (y) Redfish has
previously disclosed or concurrently discloses or makes available the same
information, if any, to Dorado as it makes available to that third party and
provides to Dorado a copy of the Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement that
Redfish entered into with that third party. Nothing contained in this Section
6.3 shall prohibit Redfish or the Redfish Board of Directors from taking
and disclosing to the Redfish Stockholders a position with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal for Redfish contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that any
disclosure of a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act other than a "stop, look and listen" or
similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act, that is not coupled with an express rejection of any applicable
Acquisition Proposal for Redfish or an express reaffirmation of
its recommendation to its stockholders in favor of the Merger shall be deemed
to be a Redfish Adverse Recommendation Change. Any action permitted by this
Section 6.3(a) shall not constitute a breach of Redfishs representations,
warranties or covenants in this Agreement. 

   

 (b) Neither (i) the Redfish Board of Directors nor any committee thereof may directly or indirectly (A) withdraw (or amend or modify in a manner adverse to Dorado), or propose publicly to withdraw (or amend or modify in a manner adverse to Dorado), the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Redfish Board of Directors or any such 

     ##### 

 

  

committee thereof of this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or (B) recommend, adopt or approve, or propose
publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, any Acquisition Proposal for Redfish
(any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a "Redfish
Adverse Recommendation Change") nor (ii) shall Redfish or any of the Redfish
Subsidiaries execute or enter into an Acquisition Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing or Section 6.3(e), at any time prior to obtaining the Redfish
Stockholder Approval, and subject to Redfishs compliance at all times with
the provisions of this Section 6.3 and Section 6.6, the Redfish Board of
Directors may (v) in response to a Superior Proposal, make a Redfish Adverse
Recommendation Change and enter into an Acquisition Agreement but only so
long as Redfish terminates this Agreement pursuant to, and concurrently
complies with all the provisions of, Section 8.1(d)(ii) and 8.3 and (w) make a
Redfish Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event if
the Redfish Board of Directors concludes in good faith (after consultation
with outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would breach
its fiduciary duties under applicable law. However, the Redfish Board
of Directors will not be entitled to exercise its right to make a Redfish
Adverse Recommendation Change unless Redfish provides written notice to
Dorado (a "Redfish Notice"), at least four business days before taking such
action, of its intention to do so and Redfish otherwise complies with this
Section 6.3(b). A Redfish Notice shall (i) if the Redfish Board of Directors
intends to make a Redfish Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an
Acquisition Proposal for Redfish that constitutes a Superior Proposal,
specify the material terms and conditions of that Superior Proposal and
identify the person or group making that Superior Proposal, or (ii) if the
Redfish Board of Directors intends to make a Redfish Adverse Recommendation
Change in response to an Intervening Event, include a description of the
Intervening Event. Redfish will not be entitled to exercise its right to make
a Redfish Adverse Recommendation Change under clause (v) above and enter into
an Acquisition Agreement in response to a Superior Proposal (x) until four
business days after Redfish provides a Redfish Notice to Dorado and (y) if
during that four business day period, Dorado proposes any alternative
transaction (including any modifications to the terms of this
Agreement), unless the Redfish Board of Directors determines in good faith
(after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
and taking into account all financial, legal, and regulatory terms and
conditions of that alternative transaction proposal) that such
alternative transaction proposal is not at least as favorable to the Redfish
Stockholders as the Superior Proposal (it being understood that any change in
the financial or other material terms of a Superior Proposal in response to
any alternative transaction proposal (including any modifications to the
terms of this Agreement) by Dorado will require a new Redfish Notice and a new
two business day period under this Section 6.3(b)). If requested by Dorado,
Redfish shall engage in good faith negotiations with Dorado, during the four
or two business day period after Dorados receipt of a Redfish Notice
specifying that the Redfish Board of Directors intends to make a Redfish
Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event, to amend
this Agreement in such a manner such that the failure by the Redfish Board of
Directors to make a Redfish Adverse Recommendation Change would no longer
cause such board to be in breach of its fiduciary duties under
applicable law. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
disclosure (including without limitation the public disclosure) by Redfish of
any Acquisition Proposal for Redfish and the operation of this Agreement with
respect thereto shall not be deemed to be a Redfish Adverse Recommendation
Change, so long as Redfish includes in any such disclosure a statement that
the Redfish Board of Directors has not changed its recommendation with
respect to this Agreement. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (c) In addition to the obligations of Redfish and Dorado set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 6.3, as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, Redfish shall advise Dorado in writing of any Acquisition Proposal for Redfish received from any person, and the terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal for Redfish, and Redfish shall promptly provide to Dorado copies of any written materials received by Redfish from such person in connection with any of the foregoing, and the identity of the person or group of persons making any such Acquisition Proposal for Redfish. Redfish shall provide simultaneously to Dorado any non-public information concerning itself or the Redfish Subsidiaries provided to any such other person or group in connection with any Acquisition Proposal for Redfish that was not previously provided to Dorado. Redfish shall keep Dorado fully informed of the status of any Acquisition Proposal for Redfish (including the identity of the parties and price involved and any changes to any material terms and conditions thereof). Redfish shall not release any third party from, or waive any provision of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it is a party, except, with respect to any such agreement in effect prior to the date hereof, in response to a request therefor from the other party thereto, if that other party initiated the communication that ultimately led to that request, and then only to the extent necessary to enable that other party to make an inquiry, submit a proposal or initiate discussions that, in any such event, would not result from or constitute a violation by Redfish or any of the Redfish Subsidiaries of any of their obligations under this Section 6.3. 

  

 (d) For purposes of this Agreement "Acquisition Proposal," with respect to any entity, means any bona fide proposal, whether or not in writing, for the (i) direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of a business or assets that constitute 15% or more of the net revenues, net income or the assets (based on the fair market value thereof) of such entity and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of 15% or more of any class of equity securities or capital stock of such entity or any of its subsidiaries whose business constitutes 15% or more of the net revenues, net income or assets of such entity and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (iii) merger, consolidation, restructuring, transfer of assets or other business combination, sale of shares of capital stock, tender offer, exchange offer, recapitalization, stock repurchase program or other similar transaction that if consummated would result in any person beneficially owning 15% or more of any class of equity securities of such entity or any of its subsidiaries whose business constitutes 15% or more of the net revenues, net income or assets of such entity and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The term "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal with respect to Redfish made by a third party to acquire, directly or indirectly, pursuant to a tender offer, exchange offer, merger, share exchange, consolidation or other business combination, (A) 50% or more of the assets of Redfish and the Redfish Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (B) 50% or more of the then outstanding equity securities of Redfish, in each case on terms that a majority of the board of directors of Redfish determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, and taking into account all financial, legal and regulatory terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal and this Agreement, including any alternative transaction (including any modification to the terms of this Agreement) proposed by any other party in response to that Superior Proposal, including any conditions to and expected timing of consummation, and any risks of non-consummation, of such Acquisition Proposal) to be more favorable to the Redfish Stockholders (in their capacity as stockholders) than the transactions contemplated hereby and any alternative transaction (including any modification to the terms of this Agreement) proposed 

   ##### 

  

    

by Dorado pursuant to this Section 6.3. For purposes of this Agreement the
term "Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement" means a confidentiality agreement
executed by Redfish and the applicable counterparty having confidentiality
provisions that are at least as favorable to Redfish as those of
the Confidentiality Agreements. 

  

 (e) Immediately after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Redfish will, and will cause the Redfish Subsidiaries to, and Redfish and the Redfish Subsidiaries will use their reasonable best efforts to cause their respective officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other agents to, terminate any activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any possible Acquisition Proposal for Redfish. Redfish shall (i) take the necessary steps to inform promptly its officers, directors, investments bankers, attorneys, accountants, financial advisors, agents or other representatives involved in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement of the obligations undertaken in this Section 6.3 and (ii) request each person who has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with that persons consideration of acquiring Redfish or any material portion thereof to return or destroy all confidential information heretofore furnished to that person by or on its behalf to the extent such request is permitted or contemplated by that confidentiality agreement. 

  

 Section 6.4 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_. 

  

 (a) The certificate of incorporation of Dorado and each of its subsidiaries which before the Merger were Redfish Subsidiaries shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification and advancement of expenses than are set forth in the certificate of incorporation of Redfish or such Redfish Subsidiary as of the date of this Agreement, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who at any time from and after the date of this Agreement and to and including the Effective Time were directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries or agents of Redfish or any of the Redfish Subsidiaries in respect of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including, without limitation, the matters contemplated by this Agreement). 

  

 (b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity, shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, indemnify and hold harmless and advance expenses to, each present and former director, officer, employee, fiduciary and agent of Redfish and each Redfish Subsidiary and each person who served as a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise at the request of Redfish or any Redfish Subsidiary (each, together with such persons heirs, executors or administrators, an "Indemnified Party" and, collectively the "Indemnified Parties") against all costs and expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, inquiries, liabilities and settlement amounts paid in connection with any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to any action or omission in their capacity as an officer, director, employee, fiduciary or agent (including, without limitation, any claim arising out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, for a period of six years after the later of the date of this 

   ##### 

  

    

Agreement or the Effective Time, in each case to the fullest extent permitted
under the DGCL (and shall pay any expenses in advance of the final disposition
of any such action or proceeding to each Indemnified Party to the fullest
extent permitted under the DGCL, upon receipt from the Indemnified Party to
whom expenses are advanced of any undertaking to repay such advances required
under the DGCL). In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, (i) the Indemnified Parties may retain Redfishs regularly
engaged legal counsel or other counsel (including local counsel) satisfactory
to them, and Redfish or the Surviving Entity, as the case may be, shall
promptly pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel, after
statements therefor are received and (ii) Redfish and the Surviving Entity
shall use all reasonable efforts in the vigorous defense of any such matter;
_provided, however_ , that neither Redfish nor the Surviving Entity shall be
liable for any settlement effected without its written consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned); and
_provided, further_ , that neither Redfish nor the Surviving Entity shall be
obligated pursuant to this Section 6.4(b) to pay the fees and expenses of
more than one counsel (plus appropriate local counsel) for all Indemnified
Parties in any single action unless there is, as determined by counsel to
the Indemnified Parties, under applicable standards of professional conduct,
a conflict or a reasonable likelihood of a conflict on any significant issue
between the positions of any two or more Indemnified Parties, in which case
such additional counsel (including local counsel) as may be required to avoid
any such conflict or likely conflict may be retained by the Indemnified
Parties at the expense of Redfish or the Surviving Entity; and _provided,
further,_ that, in the event that any claim for indemnification is asserted
or made within such six-year period, all rights to indemnification in respect
of such claim shall continue until the disposition of such claim. 

  

 (c) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall maintain in effect the current directors and officers liability insurance policies maintained by Redfish and the Redfish Subsidiaries (provided that the Surviving Entity may substitute therefor third-party policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to such officers and directors so long as substitution does not result in gaps or lapses in coverage) with respect to matters occurring on or before the Effective Time; _provided_ , that the Surviving Entity shall not be required to pay annual premiums in excess of 250% of the last annual premium paid by Redfish prior to the date hereof (the amount of which premium is set forth in _Schedule 6.4_), but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount. 

  

 (d) In the event the Surviving Entity or any of its respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Entity shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.4. 

  

 (e) The Surviving Entity shall pay all reasonable expenses, including attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 6.4. 

  

 (f) The obligations of Redfish and Dorado under this Section 6.4 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any director, officer, employee, fiduciary and agent to whom this Section 6.4 applies without the consent of each affected director, officer, employee, 

   ##### 

  

    

fiduciary or agent (it being expressly agreed that the directors, officers,
employees, fiduciaries and agents to whom this Section 6.4 applies shall be
third-party beneficiaries of this Section 6.4). The rights of each
Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to any other rights such
Indemnified Party may have under the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or
other governing documents of Redfish or its Subsidiaries, any other
indemnification agreement or arrangement, the DGCL or otherwise. 

  

 Section 6.5 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Redfish shall give prompt notice to Dorado, and Dorado shall give prompt notice to Redfish, of (i) the occurrence, or nonoccurrence, of any event the occurrence, or nonoccurrence, of which would be likely to cause any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to be materially untrue or inaccurate and (ii) any failure of Redfish or Dorado, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement required to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; _provided, however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.5 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice and this Section 6.5 will not constitute a covenant, obligation or agreement for purposes of Article VIII hereof. 

  

 Section 6.6 _Further Action; Best Efforts_. 

  

 (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, and subject, in the case of both parties, to Section 6.1, and in the case of Redfish, to Section 6.3 hereof, each of the parties hereto shall cooperate and use its best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable law to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including (i) preparing and filing as promptly as practicable with any Governmental Authority or other third party all documentation to effect all necessary filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information, applications and other documents, (ii) obtaining and maintaining all approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations required to be obtained from any Governmental Authority or other third party that are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, and (iii) vigorously defending or contesting any litigation or administrative proceeding, and seeking to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any order, decree, injunction or ruling (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that is in effect, and that seeks to or would prohibit, prevent, enjoin or materially restrain or delay the consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Dorado and Redfish shall (A) make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Merger as promptly as practicable, and in any event within 15 business days of the date hereof, (B) supply as promptly as practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and in any event, "substantially comply" and certify substantial compliance with any request for additional information (also known as a "second request") issued pursuant to the HSR Act within 60 days of such request, and (C) take all other actions necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act as soon as practicable. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Dorado shall take, or cause to be taken, any and all actions, including the disposition of 

   ##### 

  

    

assets, the taking of mitigating steps or the making of agreements or
commitments, required by any Governmental Authority as a condition to the
granting of any approval, consent, registration, permit, authorization
or other confirmation under the HSR Act or otherwise necessary for the
consummation of the Merger or as may be required to avoid, lift, vacate or
reverse any legislative, administrative or judicial action that would
otherwise prevent or materially restrain or delay the consummation of the
Merger. 

  

 (b) Each of Redfish and Dorado shall (i) promptly notify the other of any communication concerning this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby to that party or its affiliates from any Governmental Authority and permit the other to review in advance any proposed communication concerning this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby to any Governmental Authority; (ii) not participate or agree to participate in any meeting or discussion with any Governmental Authority in respect of any filing, investigation or other inquiry concerning this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby unless it consults with the other in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting or discussion; and (iii) furnish the other party with copies of all correspondence, filings and communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between it and its affiliates and representatives on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or members of any such authoritys staff on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 (c) Each party agrees that, from and after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, and except as may be agreed in writing by the other party or as may be expressly permitted pursuant to this Agreement, it shall not, and shall not permit any of its subsidiaries to agree, in writing or otherwise, to take any action which could reasonably be expected to delay the consummation of the Merger or result in the failure to satisfy any condition to consummation of the Merger. 

  

 Section 6.7 _Public Announcements_. Dorado and Redfish shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement without the others prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, except as may be required by law or any listing agreement with a national securities exchange to which Dorado or Redfish is a party. 

  

 Section 6.8 _Employee Matters_. 

  

 (a) The Surviving Entity shall employ, immediately after the Effective Time, all persons who were employees of Redfish immediately prior to the Effective Time, but except as required by law, the Surviving Entity will have no obligation to continue employing any such employee for any length of time thereafter except pursuant to any agreement that is specifically disclosed on any Schedule referenced in Section 3.11 and identified therein as providing such an exception. All employees and former employees whom the Surviving Entity has decided to continue to employ shall be provided with employee benefits that are comparable to other similarly situated employees of Dorado. The Surviving Entity shall treat the period of employment with Redfish (and with predecessor employers with respect to which Redfish has 

   ##### 

  

    

granted service credit) as employment and service with Dorado and the
Surviving Entity for benefit plan eligibility and vesting purposes (but not
for purposes of benefit accruals or benefit computations, other than for
purposes of vacation, sick pay or other paid time off) for all of the
Surviving Entitys employee benefit plans, programs, policies or arrangements
to the extent service with Dorado or the Surviving Entity is recognized under
any such plan, program, policy or arrangement, except to the extent such
treatment would result in duplicative benefits for the same period of
service, to the extent such service is prior to a specific date before which
service would not have been credited for employees of Dorado. For
the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs, Dorado agrees to credit
each employee of Redfish or any Redfish Subsidiary with an amount of vacation
and sick leave equal to the employees unused vacation and sick leave under
Redfishs vacation and sick leave policy immediately prior to the Effective
Time based on the policy as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time. 

  

 (b) Under any medical or dental plan covering any employee or former employee of Redfish, there shall be waived, and the Surviving Entity shall cause the relevant insurance carriers and other third parties to waive, restrictions and limitations for any medical condition existing as of the Effective Time of any such employee and his or her eligible dependents for the purpose of any such plan, so long as those persons had the requisite "creditable" service prior to the Effective Time, provided, however, that such treatment shall not apply to a preexisting condition of any employee or former employee of Redfish who was, as of the Effective Time, excluded from participation in a Plan by virtue of such preexisting condition, and provided, further, that any employee or former employee of Redfish whose credited service with Redfish would still subject him or her to an exclusion or waiting period if such service were treated as service with Dorado or the Surviving Entity shall be subject to the exclusion or waiting period until he or she has sufficient aggregate service with the Surviving Entity and Redfish. Further, the Surviving Entity shall offer to each Redfish employee coverage under a group health plan that credits that employee toward the deductibles imposed under the group medical and dental plan of the Surviving Entity, for the year during which the Effective Time occurs, with any deductible already incurred during that year under the relevant Redfish Plan. 

  

 (c) Redfish may pay to each person who is a participant in an annual incentive program (a "Bonus Plan Participant"): 

  

 (i) a cash bonus with respect to calendar year 2009 in an amount equal to the Bonus Plan Participants target annual cash incentive opportunity, as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Redfish on February 9, 2009, or as disclosed to Dorado in writing prior to the execution of this Agreement (except as to any employee of Redfish and any Redfish Subsidiary who was not employed by Redfish or any Redfish Subsidiary, as applicable, prior to 2009 or was not otherwise eligible for full annual incentive bonus in respect of 2008, Redfish shall pay a 2009 annual bonus in an amount commensurate with amounts being paid to other employees of Redfish and any Redfish Subsidiary, as applicable, with similar job titles or responsibilities); and 

   

 (ii) an equity compensation bonus with respect to calendar year 2009 in an amount equal to the Bonus Plan Participants target annual equity incentive opportunity, with such equity compensation bonus to be paid solely in the form of restricted shares of Redfish Common Stock (the "Redfish 2009 Bonus Restricted Shares") valued based on the fair market 

   ##### 

  

   

value of Redfish Common Stock on the date of grant, and granted upon the
earlier of (A) the time that annual incentive bonuses for 2009 would be paid
in the ordinary course of business or (B) immediately prior to the Effective
Time. The Redfish 2009 Bonus Restricted Shares shall be granted under the
2008 Stock Plan on the following terms and conditions: 

    

 (A) vesting of the Redfish 2009 Bonus Restricted Shares will occur over such period of time, but in no event less than four years, and on such terms (consistent with past practices but as modified by Section 6.8(c)(ii)(B) below) as the Compensation Committee of the Redfish Board of Directors shall determine at the time of grant; 

   

 (B) the Redfish 2009 Bonus Restricted Shares shall not vest upon the occurrence of the Effective Time, but shall convert at the Effective Time into a number of restricted shares of Dorado Common Stock ("Converted Restricted Shares") determined by multiplying the number of shares of Redfish Common Stock subject to such grant by the Exchange Ratio; 

   

 (C) notwithstanding (A) above, the Converted Restricted Shares shall vest immediately in full upon the termination of the applicable Bonus Plan Participants employment by the Surviving Entity or an affiliate without Cause or due to such participants Resignation for Good Reason within the meaning of the Employee Severance Protection Plan. 

  

 (iii) Within 30 days following the Effective Time, the Compensation Committee of the Dorado Board of Directors shall grant to each Bonus Plan Participant who remains employed by the Surviving Entity or an affiliate following the Effective Time an award consistent with awards granted to similarly situated Dorado employees in accordance with Dorados past practices. 

   

 (d) With respect to calendar year 2010, the target annual incentive opportunity for each Bonus Plan Participant shall be the same as such target for calendar year 2009, and any Bonus Plan Participant who is terminated following the Effective Time and prior to the date on which annual bonuses for 2010 are paid to Dorado employees in the ordinary course as a result of an involuntary termination without Cause or Resignation for Good Reason (within the meaning of the Employee Severance Protection Plan) shall receive a bonus payout for 2010 in an amount at least equal to the Bonus Plan Participants target annual incentive opportunity (including for this purposes the cash equivalent of any options or restricted stock that would have been payable in respect of performance during calendar year 2010), prorated based on the number of days that have elapsed in calendar year 2010 through the date on which the termination of employment occurs, with such bonus paid in cash within 10 days following termination of employment. With respect to any employees of Redfish and any Redfish Subsidiary who was not employed by Redfish or any Redfish Subsidiary, as applicable, prior to 2010 or was not otherwise eligible for full annual incentive bonus in respect of 2009, Redfish shall set an annual incentive opportunity in an amount commensurate with amounts being paid 

   ##### 

  

    

to other employees of Redfish and any Redfish Subsidiary, as applicable, with
similar job titles or responsibilities. 

  

 (e) Dorado hereby acknowledges that a "Change in Control" within the meaning of the Employee Severance Protection Plan, the 2000 Stock Plan, the 2008 Stock Plan and the Long-Term Incentive Plan of the MLP General Partner will occur at the Effective Time. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Dorado shall honor all of the terms and conditions of the Employee Severance Protection Plan, the 2000 Stock Plan, the 2008 Stock Plan, the Partnership Agreement and the Long-Term Incentive Plan of the MLP General Partner, without any adverse effect on any employee or former employee of Redfish or any Redfish Subsidiary. 

  

 (f) Dorado hereby agrees to operate and implement and/or cause the Surviving Entity to operate and implement the Employee Severance Protection Plan in compliance with Section 409A of the Code to the extent applicable and to the extent such plan document is in compliance therewith as of January 1, 2009, and acknowledges that such plan may not be amended or terminated prior to the second anniversary of the Merger without the express consent of employees covered thereby or as may be required in order to comply with applicable law. 

  

 (g) Prior to the Effective Time, if requested by Dorado, Redfish will take such action as is necessary to terminate the Redfish 401(k) Plan and will take all necessary action to ensure that each Redfish employee is fully vested in his or her account balance under the Redfish 401(k) Plan. As soon as practicable following IRS approval of the termination of the Redfish 401(k) Plan, the assets thereof shall be distributed and Dorado shall permit Redfish employees employed by Dorado to roll any eligible rollover distributions (and loans under the Redfish 401(k) Plan) into Dorados 401(k) Plan. If the Redfish 401(k) Plan is terminated, employees of Redfish shall be eligible as of the Effective Time to participate in Dorados 401(k) Plan. 

  

 Section 6.9 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Redfish and Dorado shall take steps reasonably necessary to cause dispositions of shares of Redfish Common Stock (including derivative securities) and acquisitions of Dorado Common Stock (including derivative securities) pursuant to the Merger by each individual who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, or will become subject to such reporting requirements with respect to Dorado, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. 

  

 Section 6.10 _Redfish Indebtedness_. The parties agree and acknowledge that within 30 days after the consummation of the Merger, Dorado shall make "change of control" purchase offers to the holders of each series of Redfishs senior subordinated notes in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the respective applicable indentures and shall purchase the notes of any such holders who properly tender their notes pursuant to such offers. 

  

 Section 6.11 _Financing_. 

  

 (a) Dorado shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and 

   ##### 

  

    

consummate the financing necessary for the Funds (the "Financing") on the
terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letter, including using its
reasonable best efforts to (i) satisfy on a timely basis all terms, covenants
and conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter; (ii) enter into
definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions
contemplated by the Commitment Letter; (iii) enforce its rights under the
Commitment Letter; and (iv) consummate the Financing on or prior to the
Outside Date. Dorado will furnish correct and complete copies of all such
definitive agreements to Redfish promptly upon their execution. 

  

 (b) Dorado shall keep Redfish informed with respect to all material activity concerning the status of the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter and shall give Redfish prompt notice of any material adverse change with respect to such Financing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Dorado agrees to notify Redfish promptly, and in any event within two business days, if at any time (i) the Commitment Letter shall expire or be terminated, rescinded or withdrawn for any reason, (ii) any financing source that is a party to the Commitment Letter notifies Dorado that such source no longer intends to provide financing to Dorado on the terms set forth therein or (iii) for any reason Dorado no longer believes in good faith that it will be able to obtain all or any portion of the Funds on the terms set forth in the Commitment Letter. Dorado shall not, and shall not permit any of its affiliates to, without the prior written consent of Redfish, take or fail to take any action or enter into any transaction, including any merger, acquisition, joint venture, disposition, lease, contract or debt or equity financing, that could reasonably be expected to breach or make untrue any representation or warranty contained in the Commitment Letter or otherwise impair, delay or prevent consummation of the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter. Dorado shall not amend or alter, or agree to amend or alter, the Commitment Letter in any manner that would prevent, impair or delay the consummation of transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written consent of Redfish. 

  

 (c) If any portion of the Funds becomes unavailable or the Commitment Letter therefor shall be terminated, rescinded, withdrawn or modified in a manner materially adverse to Dorado for any reason, Dorado shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain alternative financing for the Funds from alternative sources ("Alternate Financing") and to obtain, and, if obtained, will provide Redfish a copy of, a new financing commitment that provides for at least the amount of the Funds on terms and conditions (including termination rights and funding conditions) no less favorable to Dorado, in the aggregate, than those included in such prior commitment letter ("New Commitment Letter"). To the extent applicable, Dorado shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action necessary, proper or advisable to arrange promptly and consummate the Alternate Financing on the terms and conditions described in any New Commitment Letter, including compliance with the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 6.11, which shall apply to any New Commitment Letter. Redfish acknowledges that Dorados compliance with the provisions of this Section 6.11(c) with respect to Alternate Financing will not constitute a breach of the representations and warranties of Dorado in Section 4.9. 

  

 (d) Dorado shall publicly announce, not later than the Determination Date, (i) whether or not it has entered into binding definitive agreements for the Financing and (ii) if it has entered into such agreements, whether or not all conditions to the obligations of the lenders to consummate the Financing under such definitive agreements on the Closing Date shall have 

   ##### 

  

    

been satisfied or waived as of the date of such announcement (excluding for

such consummation were the date of such announcement). 

  

 Section 6.12 _Authorization for Shares and Stock Exchange Listing_. Prior to the Effective Time, Dorado shall have taken all action necessary to permit it to issue the number of shares of Dorado Common Stock required to be issued pursuant to this Agreement.

 Section 6.13 _Rights Agreement_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Redfish Board of Directors shall take any action (including, as necessary, amending or terminating (but with respect to termination, only as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) the Rights Agreement) necessary so that (a) none of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the conversion of shares of Redfish Common Stock into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Agreement, and the consummation of the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement hereby will cause (i) the Redfish Rights to become exercisable under the Rights Agreement, (ii) Dorado or any of its affiliates to be deemed an "Acquiring Person" (as defined in the Rights Agreement), (iii) the provisions of Section 11 or Section 13 of the Rights Agreement to become applicable to any such event or (iv) the "Distribution Date" or the "Stock Acquisition Date" (each as defined in the Rights Agreement) to occur upon any such event, and (b) the "Final Expiration Date" (as defined in the Rights Agreement) of the Redfish Rights will occur immediately prior to the Effective Time so that the Redfish Rights will expire immediately prior to the Effective Time. Without the prior written consent of Dorado, neither the Redfish Board of Directors nor Redfish shall take any other action to terminate the Rights Agreement, redeem the Redfish Rights, cause any person not to be or become an "Acquiring Person" or otherwise amend the Rights Agreement in a manner, or take any other action under the Rights Agreement, adverse to Dorado or its affiliates. 

  

 Section 6.14 _State Takeover Laws_. If any "fair price," "moratorium," "business combination," or "control share acquisition" statute or other similar statute or regulation is or shall become applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Redfish and the Redfish Board of Directors shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and shall otherwise act to minimize the effects of any such statute or regulation on the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 Section 6.15 _Stockholder Litigation_. Redfish shall give Dorado the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation against Redfish and/or its directors or officers relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Redfish agrees that it shall not settle or offer to settle any litigation commenced on or after the date hereof against Redfish or any of its directors or officers by any stockholder of Redfish relating to this Agreement, the Merger, any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise, 

   ##### 

  

    

without the prior written consent of Dorado (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). 

  

 Section 6.16 _Reorganization_. 

  

 (a) Each of Dorado and Redfish shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and to obtain the Tax opinions described in Section 7.2(d) and Section 7.3(d). Dorado and Redfish shall file all Tax Returns consistent with the treatment of the Merger as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and in particular as a transaction described in Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code. This Agreement is intended to constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Sec. 1.368-2(g). 

  

 (b) Dorado shall deliver to Baker Botts L.L.P. and Baker and Hostetler LLP a "Tax Representation Letter," dated as of the Closing Date and signed by an officer of Dorado, containing representations of Dorado and Redfish shall deliver to Baker Botts L.L.P. and Baker and Hostetler LLP a "Tax Representation Letter," dated as of the Closing Date and signed by an officer of Redfish, containing representations of Redfish, in each case as shall be reasonably necessary or appropriate to enable Baker Botts L.L.P. and Baker and Hostetler LLP to render the opinions described in Section 7.2(d) and Section 7.3(d). Each of Dorado and Redfish shall use its reasonable best efforts not to take or cause to be taken any action that would cause to be untrue (or fail to take or cause not to be taken any action which would cause to be untrue) any of the certifications and representations included in the tax representation letters described in this Section 6.16. 

  

 Section 6.17 _Comfort Letters_. 

  

 (a) In connection with the information regarding Redfish and the Redfish Subsidiaries or the Merger provided by Redfish specifically for inclusion in, or incorporation by reference into, the Joint Proxy Statement and the Registration Statement, Redfish shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be delivered to Dorado a letter of Ernst and Young, dated the date on which the Registration Statement becomes effective and addressed to Dorado, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Dorado and customary in scope and substance for letters delivered by independent public accountants in connection with registration statements similar to the Registration Statement on Form S-4.
