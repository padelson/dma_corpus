 **AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER**

 



 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered
into as of April 6, 2015, by and among Italics Inc., a Delaware corporation ("
_Newco_ "), Italics Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Newco (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Informatica Corporation, a
Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). All capitalized terms that are not
defined elsewhere in this Agreement shall have the respective meanings
assigned thereto in _Annex A_.

 



 

 **W I T N E S S E T H:**

 



 

WHEREAS, it is proposed that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the " _Merger_
"), and each share (each a " _Share_ " and collectively, the " _Shares_ ") of
common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the " _Company
Common Stock_ ") then outstanding (other than the Carry-Forward Share (as
defined in Section 1.1(a))) will thereupon be cancelled and converted into the
right to receive Forty-Eight Dollars and Seventy-Five Cents ($48.75) in cash,
without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

 



 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has
unanimously (i) determined that this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger, are advisable, (ii) determined that
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger,
are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders,
(iii) approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger, and (iv) resolved to recommend that the stockholders of
the Company (the " _Company Stockholders_ ") adopt this Agreement.

 



 

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Newco and Merger Sub have unanimously (i)
determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger, are advisable, and (ii) approved this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger.

 



 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Permira V L.P.1,
Permira V L.P.2, Permira Investments Limited, P5 Co-Investment L.P., P5 CIS
S.a r.l., Permira V I.A.S L.P. and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (the "

_Funding Agreement_ ") pursuant to which the Sponsors agree, on the terms and
subject to the conditions contained therein, to fund to Newco certain payment
obligations of Newco and Merger Sub under this Agreement.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, as
well as other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged and accepted, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, Newco, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows:

 



 

Article I ** 
THE MERGER**

 



 

1.1 _The Carry-Forward Share Purchase and the Merger_.

 



 

(a) _Carry-Forward Share Purchase_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, a
Person (" _TPH_ ") designated by Newco (by written notice to the Company)
shall subscribe for one Share (the " _Carry-Forward Share_ ") in exchange for
cash equal to the Merger Consideration, and the Company shall issue the Carry-
Forward Share to such Person in exchange for such cash payment.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL, on the Closing Date,
Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease and the Company shall continue
as the surviving corporation of the Merger and a wholly owned subsidiary of
Newco. The Company, as the surviving corporation of the Merger, is sometimes
referred to herein as the " _Surviving Corporation_." Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, on the Closing Date,
Newco, Merger Sub and the Company shall cause the Merger to be consummated
under the DGCL (and any other applicable Delaware law) by filing a certificate
of merger in customary form and substance (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ")
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the " _Delaware
Secretary of State_ ") in accordance with the applicable provisions of the
DGCL. The time of such filing and acceptance by the Delaware Secretary of
State, or such later time as may be agreed in writing by Newco and the Company
and specified in the Certificate of Merger, is referred to herein as the "
_Effective Time_."

 



 

1.2 _The Surviving Corporation of the Merger_.

 



 

(a) _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation_.

 



 

(i) _Certificate of Incorporation_. Subject to the terms of _Section 7.11_,
at the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company shall
be amended and restated in its entirety to read identically to the Certificate
of Incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and such amended and restated Certificate of Incorporation
shall become the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter amended in accordance with the applicable provisions of the
DGCL and such Certificate of Incorporation; _provided, however_ , that at the
Effective Time the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
shall be amended so that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be
"Informatica Corporation".

 



 

(ii) _Bylaws_. Subject to the terms of _Section 7.11_, at the Effective Time,
the Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall become the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL, the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such Bylaws.

 



 

(b) _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_.

 



 

(i) _Directors_. At the Effective Time, the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation shall be the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.

 



 

(ii) _Officers_. At the Effective Time, the initial officers of the Surviving
Corporation shall be the officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors are duly appointed.

 



 

1.3 _General Effects of the Merger_. The effects of the Merger shall be as
provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

 



      
 

 



 

1.4 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock of the Merging Corporations_.

 



 

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Subject to the last sentence of this
Section 1.4(a), at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Newco, Merger Sub, the Company, or any other Person, (i)
each share of class A common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Merger Sub
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of class A common
stock of the Surviving Corporation, with each certificate evidencing ownership
of such shares of class A common stock of Merger Sub thereafter evidencing
ownership of shares of class A common stock of the Surviving Corporation and
(ii) each share of class B common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Merger
Sub that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled and extinguished for no consideration. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, Newco shall have the right to convert Merger
Sub from a Delaware corporation into a Delaware limited liability company
prior to the Closing Date (the " _Merger Sub Conversion_ "), _provided_ that
Newco shall notify the Company of such conversion no later than five (5)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date. In the event that the Merger Sub
Conversion is consummated, and only in such event, the first sentence of this
Section 1.4(a) shall be inapplicable and of no further force and effect and,
at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of Newco, Merger Sub, the Company, or any other Person, each limited
liability company interest of Merger Sub that is outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable share of class A common stock of the Surviving Corporation,
with each certificate evidencing ownership of such limited liability company
interests of Merger Sub, if any, thereafter evidencing ownership of shares of
class A common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(b) _Common Stock of the Company_.

 



 

(i) _Generally_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Newco, Merger Sub, the Company, or any other Person,
other than as otherwise set forth in this _Section 1.4(b)_, each Share that
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or
unvested or otherwise subject to a repurchase option or obligation, risk of
forfeiture or other condition under any applicable restricted stock purchase
agreement or other agreement with the Company or under which the Company has
any rights), other than Cancelled Shares, Dissenting Shares and the Carry-
Forward Share, shall be canceled and extinguished and automatically converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon the surrender of the
certificate, if any, representing such Share or the transfer of such non-
certificated Shares represented by book entry (" _Uncertificated Shares_ ") in
the manner provided in _Section 2.3(c)_ (or in the case of a lost, stolen or
destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if required)
in the manner provided in _Section 2.3(d)_); _provided, however_ , that the
Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect fully the
effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any
dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other like change with
respect to Company Common Stock having a record date on or after the date
hereof and prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, all
Shares (other than the Carry-Forward Share) shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled, retired and cease to exist, and each holder
of Shares (other than the Carry-Forward Share) shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration
issuable in respect thereof pursuant to this _Section 1.4(b)(i)_. The Merger
Consideration issued upon the surrender for exchange of Shares (other than the
Carry-Forward Share) in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to
have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares,
and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the
Surviving Corporation of Shares which were outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time. If,

 



      
 

 



 

after the Effective Time, a certificate representing Shares (other than the
Carry-Forward Share) is presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason,
then such certificate shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration in accordance with this _Section 1.4(b)_.

 



 

(ii) _Cancelled Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Newco, Merger Sub, the Company, or any other Person,
each Share that is owned by Newco, Merger Sub or the Company, or by any direct
or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Newco, Merger Sub or the Company, in
each case immediately prior to the Effective Time (" _Cancelled Shares_ "),
shall be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof or
consideration paid therefor.

 



 

(iii) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
in this Agreement, Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares and the Carry-Forward Share) and
held by a holder who has not voted in favor of adoption of this Agreement or
consented thereto in writing and who has properly exercised appraisal rights
of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (such shares being
referred to collectively as the " _Dissenting Shares_ " until such time as
such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses such holders
appraisal rights under Delaware Law with respect to such shares) shall not be
converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration but instead shall
be entitled to payment of the appraised value of such shares in accordance
with Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided, however_ , that if, after the
Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses
such holders right to appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, or if a
court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not
entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such Shares shall
be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section
1.4(b)(i)_, without interest thereon, upon surrender of such Certificate
formerly representing such share or transfer of such Uncertificated Share, as
the case may be. The Company shall provide Newco prompt written notice of any
demands received by the Company for appraisal of Shares, any withdrawal of any
such demand and any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the
Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to Delaware Law that relates to
such demand, and Newco shall have the opportunity and right to participate in
and direct all negotiations and Legal Proceedings with respect to such
demands. Except with the prior written consent of Newco, the Company shall not
make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such
demands.

 



 

(iv) _Carry-Forward Share_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Newco, Merger Sub, the Company, or any other
Person, the Carry-Forward Share shall be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of class B common stock of the
Surviving Corporation (and such share of class B common stock of the Surviving
Corporation, along with the shares of class A common stock of the Surviving
Corporation into which the shares of class A common stock of Merger Sub (or,
in the event that the Merger Sub Conversion is consummated, the limited
liability company interests of Merger sub) are converted pursuant to _Section
1.4(a)_, shall be the only shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation that are issued and outstanding immediately after the Effective
Time).

 



 

(c) _Stock Awards of the Company_.

 



 

(i) _Stock Options_. Newco shall not assume any Company Options in connection
with the Merger. At the Effective Time, each Company Option outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) shall,
without any action on the part of Newco, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder
thereof, be cancelled and converted into, and shall become a

 



      
 

 



 

right to receive, an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of
(x) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration over (B) the exercise
price per share of such Company Option, multiplied by (y) the total number of
Shares issuable upon the exercise in full of such Company Option (the "
_Option Consideration_ "); _provided_ that, if the exercise price per share of
any such Company Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration,
such Company Option shall be cancelled without any cash payment or other
consideration being made in respect thereof. The payment of the Option
Consideration will be subject to withholding for all required Taxes. The
Company agrees to take all actions necessary to effect this cancellation of
Company Options upon the Effective Time and to give effect to this _Section
1.4(c)(i)_ (including the satisfaction of the requirements of Rule 16b-3(e)
under the Exchange Act). As soon as practicable (and in no event more than
thirty calendar days) following the Closing, Newco shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to pay to each holder of a Company Option the Option Consideration
(if any), less any applicable withholding taxes, required to be paid to any
such holder of a Company Option. The cancellation of a Company Option as
provided in the first sentence of this _Section 1.4(c)(i)_ shall be deemed
the termination, and satisfaction in full of, any and all rights the holder
had or may have had in respect of such Company Option.

 



 

(ii) _Restricted Stock Units_.

 



 

(A) _Vested RSUs_. Except as otherwise agreed to in writing by Newco and a
holder of a Vested RSU prior to the Effective Time, at the Effective Time,
each Vested RSU shall, without any action on the part of Newco, Merger Sub,
the Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into, and shall
become a right to receive, an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the
product of (x) the Merger Consideration multiplied by (y) the total number of
Shares subject to such Vested RSUs (the " _Vested RSU Consideration_ "). The
payment of the Vested RSU Consideration will be subject to withholding
(pursuant to net share issuance and withholding) for all required Taxes. The
Company agrees to take all action necessary to effect this cancellation of
Vested RSUs upon the Effective Time and to give effect to this _Section
1.4(c)(ii)(A)_ (including the satisfaction of the requirements of Rule
16b-3(e) under the Exchange Act). As soon as practicable (and in no event more
than thirty calendar days) following the Closing, but subject to any payment
timing requirements set forth in the applicable plan and/or any applicable
agreements governing the Vested RSUs, Newco shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to pay to each holder of Vested RSUs, the Vested RSU
Consideration, less any applicable withholding taxes, required to be paid to
the holder of such Vested RSUs. The cancellation of an award of Vested RSUs as
provided in the first sentence of this _Section 1.4(c)(ii)(A)_ shall be
deemed the termination, and satisfaction in full of, any and all rights the
holder had or may have had in respect of such award of Vested RSUs.

 



 

(B) _Rollover RSUs_. Except as otherwise agreed to in writing by Newco and a
holder of an award covering any Rollover RSUs prior to the Effective Time, at
the Effective Time each award covering any Rollover RSUs shall, without any
action on the part of Newco, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof, be
assumed and converted into a right to receive an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to the product of (x) the Merger Consideration multiplied by
(y) the total number of Shares subject to such Rollover RSUs (each, a "
_Converted RSU Cash Award_ "). Each portion of any Converted RSU Cash Award
shall, subject to the holders continued employment with Newco or its
Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) through the Adjusted Vesting
Date relating to the underlying Rollover RSU, vest on the applicable Adjusted
Vesting Date and the vested portion of the Converted RSU Cash Award will be
paid to the holder of such Converted RSU Cash Award in accordance with the
terms of the applicable plan and/or applicable agreements governing the
Rollover RSU. The Converted RSU Cash Awards will otherwise retain the same
terms and conditions as contained in the original Rollover RSU. For the
avoidance of doubt, Newco shall assume the Rollover RSUs as Converted RSU Cash
Awards in connection with the Merger subject to the terms and conditions set
forth

 



      
 

 



 

in this _Section 1.4(c)(ii)(B)_. For the purposes of all Rollover RSUs and
Rollover PSUs, each vesting date underlying the applicable award shall be
accelerated by twelve months (each an " _Adjusted Vesting Date_ ").

 



 

(iii) _Performance Restricted Stock Units_. With respect to PSUs that are
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, the number of
Shares subject to the applicable PSU shall be determined as follows: (x) if
the performance period has already been completed, the number of Shares
subject to the applicable PSU shall be based on actual performance during the
completed performance period or (y) if the applicable performance period has
not been completed, all performance goals shall be deemed achieved at one
hundred percent (100%) of the applicable target levels, provided that if the
applicable plan and/or any applicable agreements governing the PSUs specify
that a greater number of Shares subject to the PSUs otherwise would vest on or
prior to the Effective Time, then the terms of the applicable plan and/or any
applicable agreements governing such PSU shall control. PSUs outstanding as of
the Effective Time shall vest and settle as set forth below.

 



 

(A) _Vested PSUs_. Except as otherwise agreed to in writing by Newco and a
holder of a Vested PSU prior to the Effective Time, at the Effective Time,
each Vested PSU shall, without any action on the part of Newco, Merger Sub,
the Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into, and shall
become a right to receive, an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the
product of (x) the Merger Consideration multiplied by (y) the total number of
Shares subject to such PSUs (as determined in accordance with this _Section
1.4(c)(iii_)) (the " _Vested PSU Consideration_ "). The payment of the Vested
PSU Consideration will be subject to withholding (pursuant to net share
issuance and withholding) for all required Taxes. The Company agrees to take
all action necessary to effect this cancellation of Vested PSUs upon the
Effective Time and to give effect to this _Section 1.4(c)(iii)(A)_ (including
the satisfaction of the requirements of Rule 16b-3(e) under the Exchange Act).
As soon as practicable (and in no event more than thirty calendar days)
following the Closing, but subject to any payment timing requirements set
forth in the applicable plan and/or any applicable agreements governing the
Vested PSUs, Newco shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay to each holder
of Vested PSUs the Vested PSU Consideration, less any applicable withholding
taxes, required to be paid to the holder of such Vested PSUs. The cancellation
of an award of Vested PSUs as provided in the first sentence of this _Section
1.4(c)(iii)(A)_ shall be deemed the termination, and satisfaction in full of,
any and all rights the holder had or may have had in respect of such award of
Vested PSUs.

 



 

(B) _Rollover PSUs_. Except as otherwise agreed to in writing by Newco and a
holder of an award covering any Rollover PSUs prior to the Effective Time, at
the Effective Time each award covering any Rollover PSUs shall, without any
action on the part of Newco, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof, be
assumed and converted into a right to receive an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to the product of (x) the Merger Consideration multiplied by
(y) the total number of Shares subject to such Rollover PSUs (as determined in
accordance with this _Section 1.4(c)(iii_)) (each, a " _Converted PSU Cash
Award_ "). Each portion of any Converted PSU Cash Award shall, subject to the
holders continued employment with Newco or its Affiliates (including the
Surviving Corporation) through the applicable Adjusted Vesting Dates relating
to the underlying Rollover PSU, vest on the applicable Adjusted Vesting Dates
and the vested portion of the Converted PSU Cash Award will be paid to the
holder of such Converted PSU Cash Award in accordance with the terms of the
applicable plan and/or applicable agreements governing the Rollover PSU. The
Converted PSU Cash Awards will otherwise retain the same terms and conditions
as contained in the original Rollover PSU. For the avoidance of doubt, Newco
shall assume the Rollover PSUs as Converted PSU Cash Awards in connection with
the Merger subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this _Section
1.4(iii)(B)_.

 



      
 

 



 

(iv) _Treatment of ESPP_. The Company shall terminate the ESPP effective as of
the Effective Time. If the Purchase Period (as defined in the ESPP) under the
ESPP that is in effect on the date of this Agreement (the " _Current Purchase
Period_ ") does not conclude prior to the Effective Time, (i) the Current
Purchase Period shall terminate immediately prior to the Effective Time; (ii)
each Participants (as defined in the ESPP) accumulated payroll deduction
shall be used to purchase Shares in accordance with the terms of the ESPP; and
(iii) such Shares shall be treated the same as all other Shares in accordance
with _Section 1.4(b)(i)_. The Company shall take such action as may be
necessary to provide that (i) only Participants in the ESPP as of the date of
this Agreement may continue to participate in the ESPP after the date of this
Agreement; (ii) no Participant in the ESPP may increase after the date of this
Agreement the payroll deductions credited to such Participants account under
the ESPP; and (iii) no further Purchase Periods shall commence under the ESPP
on or following the date of this Agreement.

 



 

(v) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the
Company Board and the Compensation Committee of the Company Board, as
applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions which are
necessary to effectuate the provisions of _Sections 1.4(c)(i)_ , _1.4(c)(ii)_
, _1.4(c)(iii)_ and _1.4(c)(iv)_ and to ensure that neither any holder of an
Outstanding Stock Award any other participant in any Company Equity Incentive
Plan shall have any right thereunder to acquire any securities of the Company,
Newco or the Surviving Corporation or to receive any payment or benefit with
respect to any award previously granted under a Company Equity Incentive
Plans, except as provided in this _Section 1.4(c)_.

 



 

(vi) _Payment_. The Company or the Surviving Corporation shall pay through its
payroll system the Option Consideration, Vested RSU Consideration and Vested
PSU Consideration required pursuant to this _Section 1.4_.

 



 

1.5 _Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes or intent of this
Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and
possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Company and Merger Sub, the directors and officers of the Company and
Merger Sub shall have the authority to take all such lawful and necessary
action.

2.3 _Issuance of Merger Consideration After the Closing_.

 



 

(a) _Payment Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall select a
bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to Newco to act as the payment
agent for the Merger (the " _Payment Agent_ ").

 



 

(b) _Payment Fund_.

 



 

(i) _Creation of Payment Fund_. On the Closing Date, Newco or the Surviving
Corporation shall deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Payment Agent,
for payment to the holders of Shares pursuant to the provisions of _Article
I_, an amount of cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the
Merger Consideration by (y) the aggregate number of Shares issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding Cancelled
Shares, Dissenting Shares and the Carry-Forward Share) (such cash amount being
referred to herein as the " _Payment Fund_ "). For the avoidance of doubt,
with respect to any Dissenting Shares, Newco shall only be required to deposit
or cause to be deposited with the Payment Agent cash sufficient to pay the
Merger Consideration in exchange for any such Dissenting Shares if the holder
thereof fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses its right to
appraisal under the DGCL. From time to time following the Effective Time as
required, Newco or the Surviving Corporation shall deposit (or cause to be
deposited) with the Payment Agent additional cash in any amount necessary to
enable the Payment Agent to pay any and all Merger Consideration payable
hereunder.

 



 

(ii) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of the Shares on the date that is one (1)
year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation
upon demand, and any holders of Shares that were issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Merger who have not theretofore exchanged their
Shares for the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of _Section
1.4(b)_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation, as general
creditors thereof, for any payment of and claim to the applicable Merger
Consideration, without interest thereon, to which such holders may be entitled
pursuant to the provisions of _Article I_.

 



 

(c) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time, Newco and
the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder
of record of Shares (other than the Carry-Forward Share) as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time: (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of a certificate or certificates
(the " _Certificates_ ") that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding Shares (excluding Cancelled Shares, Dissenting Shares
and the

 



       
 

 



 

Carry-Forward Share) (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or
transfer of Uncertificated Shares (excluding Cancelled Shares, Dissenting
Shares and the Carry-Forward Share) to the Payment Agent); and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or
transfer of the Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration
payable in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of _Article I_. Each
holder of Shares that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in respect
of the Shares represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share, upon (x)
surrender to the Payment Agent of a Certificate, together with a duly
completed and validly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents
as may reasonably be requested by the Payment Agent, or (y) receipt of an
"agents message" by the Payment Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of
transfer as the Payment Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-
entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares. Until so surrendered or transferred,
as the case may be, from and after the Effective Time each such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share shall represent for all purposes only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to the
provisions of _Article I_. If Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are
presented to the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time for any
reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as
provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth in _Article I_.
No interest shall be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender or
transfer of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share. From and after the
Effective Time, there will be no further registration of transfers on the
records of the Surviving Corporation of Shares that were issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than transfers to
reflect, in accordance with customary settlement procedures, trades effected
prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger
Consideration issuable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 1.4(b)(i)_;
_provided, however_ , that the Surviving Corporation may, in its discretion
and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owners of
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as
it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent with respect to the
Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 



 

(e) _Transferred Shares_. If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be
paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be
a condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly
endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such
Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person
requesting such payment shall pay to the Payment Agent any transfer or other
similar Tax required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to
the satisfaction of the Payment Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.

 



 

(f) _Tax Withholding_. Each of the Payment Agent, Newco and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted or
withheld therefrom under Applicable Law. To the extent that such amounts are
so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid.

 



 

(g) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Newco, the Surviving Corporation or any
other party hereto

 



      
 

 



 

shall be liable to a holder of Shares for any amount properly paid to a public
official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Applicable
Law.

 



 

Article III ** 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES 
OF THE COMPANY**

 



 

Except (i) as set forth in the section of the disclosure letter delivered by
the Company to Newco on the date of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure
Letter_ ") that relates to such section or in any other section of the Company
Disclosure Letter to the extent it is reasonably apparent from the text of
such disclosure that such disclosure is applicable to such other section,
other than matters required to be disclosed for purposes of _Sections 3.1_ ,
_3.5_ , and _3.10(b)_ , which matters shall only be disclosed by specific
disclosure in the respective corresponding section of the Company Disclosure
Letter, and (ii) as disclosed in the SEC Reports, including the Annual Report
on Form 10-K of the Company for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014 (the "
_Company Form 10-K_") (other than disclosures in the "Risk Factors" or
"Forward-Looking Statements" sections of such reports and other disclosures
that are similarly predictive or forward-looking in nature) filed after the
Reference Date and prior to the date of this Agreement (and (i) then only to

such SEC Reports to a matter covered by a representation or warranty set forth
in this Article III is reasonably apparent as to matters or items which are
subject of such representation or warranty and (ii) without giving effect to
any amendment to any such documents filed on or after the date hereof), the
Company hereby represents and warrants to Newco and Merger Sub as follows:

 



 

3.1 _Organization and Standing_. The Company is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under Delaware Law. The Company has the
requisite power and authority to carry on its business as it is presently
being conducted and to own, lease or operate its properties and assets. The
Company is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned or leased or the
nature of its activities make such qualification necessary (to the extent the
"good standing" concept is applicable in the case of any jurisdiction outside
the United States), except where the failure to be so qualified or in good
standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has delivered
or made available to Newco complete and correct copies of the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws, as amended to date, of the Company. The Company is
not in violation of its certificate of incorporation or bylaws.

 



 

3.2 _Authorization and Enforceability_.

 



 

(a) The Company has all requisite power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement and, subject in the case of the Merger to obtaining the
Requisite Stockholder Approval, to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby and to perform its obligations hereunder. The execution and delivery of
this Agreement by the Company, the performance by the Company of its covenants
and obligations hereunder and the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger) have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company, and
no additional corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary
to authorize this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Merger), other than in the case of the
Merger obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Newco and Merger
Sub, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except that such
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and other similar Applicable Law affecting or
relating to creditors rights generally and by general principles of equity
(collectively, the " _Enforceability Limitations_ ").

 



 

(c) At a meeting duly called and held prior to the execution of this
Agreement, the Company Board unanimously (i) determined that this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, are advisable,

including the Merger, are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and
its stockholders, (iii) approved this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger, (iv) assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties set forth in _Section 4.5_, took all actions
necessary so that the restrictions on business combinations and stockholder

respect to or as a result of the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, (v) directed that the adoption of this Agreement be
submitted to a vote of the Company Stockholders at the Company Stockholder
Meeting and (vi) resolved to recommend that the holders of Shares adopt this
Agreement in accordance with the applicable provisions of Delaware Law, which
resolutions, as of the date hereof, have not been subsequently withdrawn or
modified.

 



 

(d) Other than Section 203 of the DGCL, no other "control share acquisition,"
"fair price," "moratorium" or other similar antitakeover Applicable Law
applies to the Merger, this Agreement or any of the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



 

(e) The Company Board has received the opinion of Qatalyst Partners LP to the
effect that, as of the date of such opinion and subject to the limitations,
qualifications and assumptions set forth therein, the Merger Consideration to
be received by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, other than Newco
or any Affiliates of Newco, pursuant to this Agreement is fair, from a
financial point of view, to such holders. As of the date of this Agreement,
such opinion has not been withdrawn, revoked or modified. A written copy of
such opinion will be provided to Newco promptly following receipt by the
Company.

 



 

(f) Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in
_Section 4.5_, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding Shares entitled to vote at a meeting of the holders of Company
Common Stock called to consider the Merger (the " _Requisite Stockholder
Approval_ ") is the only vote of the holders of any class or series of Company
Common Stock necessary (under Applicable Law or otherwise) to approve this
Agreement and consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 



 

3.3 _Required Governmental Approvals_. No consent, approval, order or
authorization of, or filing or registration with, or notification to (any of
the foregoing being a " _Consent_ "), any Governmental Authority is required
on the part of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the
execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement and the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby (including

from the U.S. Department of Defense, Defense Security Service, (e) filing with

CFIUS and (f) such other Consents the failure of which to obtain would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

3.4 _No Conflicts_. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of
this Agreement, the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Merger) and the compliance by the Company
with any of the provisions hereof do not and will not (i) violate or conflict
with any provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other
constituent documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) subject
to obtaining the Consents set forth in _Section 3.4_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter, other than with respect to the ASR Confirmations, violate,
conflict with, or result in the breach of or constitute a default (or an event
which with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) under, or
result in the termination of, or accelerate the performance required by, or
result in a right of termination or acceleration under, or result in the loss
of any benefit or the imposition of any additional payment or other Liability
under, any Material Contract, (iii) assuming compliance with the matters
referred to in _Section 3.4_ of the Company Disclosure Letter and, in the
case of the consummation of the Merger, subject to obtaining the Requisite

be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, none of the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries, or, to the knowledge of the Company, any of their
respective directors, officers, employees or agents has, with respect to any
Employee Plan, engaged in or been a party to any non-exempt "prohibited
transaction," as such term is defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section

of a penalty assessed pursuant to Section 502(i) of ERISA or a tax imposed by
Section 4975 of the Code.

 



 

(e) Neither the Company, any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective
ERISA Affiliates has ever maintained, participated in or contributed to (or

year. Neither the execution or delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger)
will, except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement, either alone or in
conjunction with any other event, (i) result in any material payment or
benefit becoming due or payable, or required to be provided, to any director,
employee, consultant or independent contractor of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (ii) materially increase the amount or value of any benefit or
compensation otherwise payable or required to be provided to any such

third Person.

 



 

(i) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger) will not, as a result

expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. All such insurance
policies are in full force and effect, no notice of cancellation has been
received, and there is no existing default or event which, with the giving of
notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default by any insured

as of the date hereof, together with the Companys available cash, cash
equivalents or marketable securities (based on the most recent balance sheet
contained in the SEC Reports), in the aggregate are sufficient (after netting
out applicable fees, expenses, original issue discount and similar premiums
and charges provided under the Debt Commitment Letters, including after giving
effect to the maximum amount of the flex, including original issue discount
flex) to enable Newco to (i) consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement upon the terms contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) pay all of the
Merger Consideration payable in respect of Shares in the Merger pursuant to
this Agreement, (iii) pay all amounts payable in respect of Company Options
and RSUs (including PSUs) under this Agreement, (iv) pay all liabilities and
other obligations of the Company contemplated by the Financing Commitment
Letters in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and (v) pay all related fees and expenses associated with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement incurred by Newco, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates.

 



 

(d) As of the date of this Agreement, (i) none of the Financing Commitment
Letters has been amended or modified (and no such amendment or modification is
contemplated as of the date hereof) and (ii) the respective commitments set
forth in the Financing Commitment Letters have not been withdrawn or rescinded
in any respect (and no such withdrawal or rescission is contemplated). Except
as set forth in the Financing Commitment Letters, there are no side letters or
other agreements, contracts or arrangements relating to the Financing. To
Newcos knowledge, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse
of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of Newco
under any term or condition of the Financing Commitment Letters in the form so
delivered to the Company, or otherwise result in any portion of the Financing
contemplated thereby to be unavailable or delayed (assuming satisfaction of
the conditions set forth in Section 2.2(a) and (b) of this Agreement). There
are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of
the full amount of the Financing, other than as set forth in the Financing
Commitment Letters. Newco has no reason to believe that any term or condition
to the Financing set forth in the Financing Commitment Letters will not be
fully satisfied on a timely basis or that the Financing will not be available
to Newco at the Closing, including any reason to believe that any of the Debt
Financing Sources or the Sponsors will not perform their respective funding
obligations under the Financing Commitment Letters in accordance with their
respective terms and conditions.

 



 

(e) None of the Sponsors, Newco, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates has entered into any Contract with any Person (i) awarding any
Person any financial advisory role on an exclusive basis, or (ii) prohibiting
or seeking to prohibit such Person from providing or seeking to provide debt
financing to any Person in connection with a transaction relating to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger.

 



 

4.10 _Funding Agreement_. The Funding Agreement is in full force and effect
and is a valid and binding obligation of the Sponsors, enforceable against the
Sponsors in accordance with its terms (subject to the Enforceability
Limitations) and no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, could constitute a default on the part of the Sponsors under the
Funding Agreement.

 



 

4.11 _Non-Reliance_. Newco and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge (each for itself
and on behalf of its Affiliates and Representatives) that, as of the date
hereof, Newco, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates and Representatives
(a) have received full access to (i) such books and records, facilities,
equipment, contracts and other assets of the Company that Newco and Merger Sub
and their

 



      
 

 



 

respective Affiliates and Representatives, as of the date hereof, have
requested to review and (ii) the electronic data room hosted by the Company in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) have
had full opportunity to meet with the management of the Company and to discuss
the business and assets of the Company. Newco and Merger Sub hereby
acknowledge and agree (each for itself and on behalf of its respective
Affiliates and Representatives) that, except for the representations and
warranties of the Company expressly set forth in _Article III_, (a) none of
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries (or any other Person) makes, or has

the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective businesses,
operations, properties, assets, liabilities or otherwise in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
as to the accuracy or completeness of any such information, and none of Newco,
Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives is relying
on any representation or warranty except for those representations and
warranties of the Company expressly set forth in _Article III_, (b) no Person
has been authorized by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to make any
representation or warranty relating to the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective businesses, operations, properties, assets, liabilities or
otherwise in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, and if made, such representation or warranty has not been and may not
be relied upon by Newco, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates or
Representatives as having been authorized by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (or any other Person), and (c) any estimate, projection,
prediction, data, financial information, memorandum, presentation or any other
materials or information provided or addressed to Newco, Merger Sub or any of
their respective Affiliates or Representatives, including any materials or
information made available in the electronic data room hosted by the Company
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or in
connection with presentations by the Companys management, are not and shall
not be deemed to be or include representations or warranties unless and to the
extent any such materials or information is expressly the subject of any
express representation or warranty of the Company set forth in _Article III_.
Newco and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge (each for itself and on behalf of its
Affiliates and Representatives) that it has conducted, to its satisfaction,
its own independent investigation of the business, operations and financial
condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries and, in making its determination
to proceed with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of
Newco, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates and Representatives have
relied on the results of their own independent investigation.

Company, Newco, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates should be
discovered by the Company, on the one hand, or Newco or Merger Sub, on the
other hand, that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement, any Other Required Company Filing or any Other Required Newco
Filing, as the case

 



      
 

 



 

may be, so that such filing would not include any misstatement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, then the party that discovers such
information will promptly notify the other, and an appropriate amendment or

party in good faith.

of the Company Stockholder Meeting to be selected after reasonable
consultation with Newco. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this

number of Shares present or represented by proxy at the Company Stockholder
Meeting to constitute a quorum at the Company Stockholder Meeting, (B) the

Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to _Article VIII_, the Company shall
establish a record date for, call, give notice of, convene and hold the
Company Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of voting upon the adoption of
this Agreement in accordance with Delaware Law, whether or not the Company
Board at any time subsequent to the date hereof shall have effected a Company
Board Recommendation Change or otherwise shall determine that this Agreement
is no longer advisable or recommends that the Company Stockholders reject it.

 



 

(c) _Board Recommendation_.

 



 

(i) Subject to the provisions of this _Section 7.1(c)_, (A) the Company Board
shall (x) recommend that the Companys stockholders adopt this Agreement in
accordance with the applicable provisions of Delaware Law (the " _Company
Board Recommendation_ ") and (y) include the Company Board Recommendation in
the Proxy Statement, and (B) neither the Company Board nor any committee
thereof shall (1) fail to make, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify the Company
Board Recommendation in a manner that is adverse to Newco, or publicly propose
to withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify the Company Board
Recommendation in a manner that is adverse to Newco, or (2) approve, endorse,
adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, endorse, adopt or
recommend, an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Transaction other than the
Merger (the actions or inactions referred to in the preceding clauses (1) and
(2) being referred to herein as a " _Company Board Recommendation Change_ ").

 



 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Company Board may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change at any time
prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval in the event that:

 



 

(A) the Company Board has received a written Acquisition Proposal after the
date of this Agreement that was not solicited in material violation of
_Section 6.2(a)_;

 



 

(B) The Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor and its outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition
Proposal is a Superior Proposal (which determination and any public
announcement thereof shall not constitute a Company Board Recommendation
Change);

 



 

(C) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company
Board shall have given Newco at least three (3) Business Days written notice
of its intention to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change pursuant to
this _Section 7.1(c)(ii)_ (the " _Board Recommendation Notice Period_ ")
(which notice shall include the most current version of the proposed
definitive agreement and, to the extent not included therein, all material
terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and the identity of the Person
making such Superior Proposal);

 



 

(D) if requested by Newco, during the Board Recommendation Notice Period, the
Company shall have met and negotiated with Newco regarding modifications to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Superior Proposal
ceases to be a Superior Proposal;

 



 

(E) prior to the end of the Board Recommendation Notice Period, Newco shall
not have made a counter-offer or proposal in writing and in a manner that, if
accepted by the Company, would form a binding contract, that the Company Board
determines (after consultation with its financial advisor and its outside
legal counsel) is at least as favorable to the Company Stockholders as such
Superior Proposal (it being understood that (x) any material revision to the
terms of a Superior Proposal, including, any revision in price, shall require
a new written notice pursuant to clause (C) above,

 



      
 

 



 

(y) the Board Recommendation Notice Period shall be extended, if applicable,
to the extent necessary to ensure that at least three (3) Business Days remain
in the Board Recommendation Notice Period subsequent to each time the Company
notifies Newco of any such material revision and (z) there may be multiple
extensions of the Board Recommendation Notice Period); and

 



 

(F) the Company Board determines (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and after considering any counter-offer or proposal made by Newco
pursuant to clause (E) above), that, in light of such Superior Proposal, the
failure to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law.

 



 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
the Company Board may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change in response
to an Intervening Event unrelated to a Superior Proposal at any time prior to
obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval but only if prior to taking any
such action:

 



 

(A) the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) that the failure to effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law
(taking into account any adjustment or revisions proposed by Newco (including
pursuant to clause (C) below);

 



 

(B) the Company Board has given Newco at least five (5) Business Days prior
written notice of its intention to take such action, which notice shall
specify in detail the basis for the Company Board Recommendation Change;

 



 

(C) during such five (5) Business Day period, the Company has negotiated, and
has caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Newco to the
extent Newco wishes to negotiate, to enable Newco to revise the terms of this
Agreement in such a manner that would obviate the need for taking such action;

 



 

(D) following such five (5) Business Day period, the Company Board shall have
determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisers and
outside legal counsel) that the revisions proposed by Newco pursuant to the
foregoing clause (C) would not obviate the need for a Company Board
Recommendation Change in response to such Intervening Event.

 



 

(iv) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board from taking
and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying with the provisions of Rule 14d-9
under the Exchange Act or any other Applicable Law; _provided, however_ , that
any statement(s) made by the Company Board pursuant to Rule 14e-2(a) under the
Exchange Act or Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act shall be subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement; _provided, further_ , for the
avoidance of doubt, that it shall not constitute a Company Board
Recommendation Change for the Company Board to make a "stop, look and listen"
communication pursuant to Rule 14d9-f.

 



 

7.2 _Regulatory Approvals_.

 



 

(a) _Filings and Cooperation_. Each of Newco and the Company shall (a) within
fifteen (15) Business Days following the date hereof, file with the FTC and
the Antitrust Division of the DOJ a Notification and Report Form relating to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby

 



      
 

 



 

(including the Merger) as required by the HSR Act, (b) as soon as reasonably
practicable following the date hereof, file comparable pre-merger notification
filings, forms and submissions that are required in the Relevant Antitrust
Jurisdictions, and (b) within fifteen (15) Business Days following the date
hereof, file a draft joint voluntary notice with CFIUS with respect to the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement. Each of Newco and the Company
shall (a) cooperate and coordinate with the other in the making of such
filings and the taking of any other actions pursuant to this _Section 7.2_,
(b) supply the other with any information that may be required in order to
effectuate such filings, and (c) supply any additional information that
reasonably may be required or requested by the FTC, the DOJ, CFIUS or the
competition or merger control authorities of the Relevant Antitrust
Jurisdictions and that Newco reasonably deems necessary and/or appropriate.
Each party hereto shall promptly inform the other party or parties hereto, as
the case may be, of any communication, and furnish the other parties with
copies of any written communication, from any Governmental Authority in the
U.S. or any Relevant Antitrust Jurisdictions regarding the Merger or any other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If any party hereto or Affiliate
thereof receives a request for additional information or documentary material
from any such Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger or any other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then such party shall use
reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably
practicable and after consultation with the other party, an appropriate
response in compliance with such request.

 



 

(b) _Remedies_. In furtherance and not in limitation of the provisions of
_Section 7.2(a)_, if and to the extent necessary to resolve such objections,
if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to
clearance of the Merger pursuant to the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Laws
of the Relevant Antitrust Jurisdictions applicable to the Merger, each of
Newco and Merger Sub (and their respective Affiliates, if applicable) will (i)
offer, negotiate, commit to and effect, by consent decree, hold separate order
or otherwise, (A) the sale, divestiture, license or other disposition of any
and all of the capital stock or other equity or voting interest, assets
(whether tangible or intangible), rights, products or businesses of Newco and
Merger Sub (and their respective Affiliates, if applicable), on the one hand,
and the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand; and (B) any other
restrictions on the activities of Newco and Merger Sub (and their respective
Affiliates, if applicable), on the one hand, and the Company and its
Subsidiaries, on the other hand, and (ii) contest, defend and appeal any Legal
Proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or
the consummation of the Merger. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this
Agreement shall obligate or require Newco, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates to, and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not,
without the prior written consent of Newco, take any action, or agree or
commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or limitation, in
connection with obtaining the foregoing clearances that would reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, results of
operations, or financial condition of (x) Newco, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates, or (y) the Company and its Subsidiaries (in each case
of (x) and (y), measured on a scale relative to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole).

 



 

(c) _Additional Actions_. From the date of this Agreement until the earlier to
occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ and the
Effective Time, unless the Company otherwise consents, Newco and Merger Sub
will not, and will not cause any of their Affiliates (including the Sponsors)
to: (a) acquire or agree to acquire by merging or consolidating with, or by
purchasing a substantial portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any
other manner, any business of any Person or other business organization or
division thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets if such
business competes in any line of business of the Company or its Subsidiaries
and the entering into of a definitive agreement relating to, or the
consummation of, such acquisition, merger or consolidation could reasonably be
expected to (i) impose any material delay in the obtaining of, or materially
increase the risk of not obtaining, any authorization, consent, order,
declaration or approval of any Governmental

 



       
 

 



 

Authority necessary to consummate the Merger or the expiration or termination
of any applicable waiting period, (ii) materially increase the risk of any
Governmental Authority entering an order prohibiting the consummation of the
Merger, (iii) materially increase the risk of not being able to remove any
such order on appeal or otherwise, or (iv) materially delay or prevent the
consummation of the Merger; (b) enter or agree to enter into any definitive
agreement (i) for the acquisition of any business or Person or take or agree
to take any other action that, in either case, would reasonably be expected to
materially interfere with their ability to make available to the Payment Agent
immediately prior to the Effective Time funds sufficient to enable Newco and
Merger Sub to satisfy all of their obligations under this Agreement, or (ii)
that otherwise would be reasonably expected to delay or prevent the
consummation of the Merger; and (c) take or agree to take any other action
that would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the
consummation of the Merger.

 



 

7.3 _Financing_.

 



 

(a) _No Amendments to Financing Commitment Letters_. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, each of Newco and Merger Sub will not permit any
assignment of the Financing Commitment Letters, or any amendment or
modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy pursuant
to, the Financing Commitment Letters if such assignment, amendment,
modification or waiver would, or could reasonably be expected to, (i) reduce
the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (unless the Equity Financing is
increased by an equivalent amount) or reduce the aggregate amount of the
Equity Financing, (ii) impose new or additional conditions to the Financing or
otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the receipt of the
Financing, (iii) adversely impact the ability of Newco or Merger Sub to
enforce its rights against the other parties to the Financing Commitment
Letters, or (iv) prevent, impede or materially delay the consummation of the
Financing. In addition to the foregoing, Newco and Merger Sub shall not
release or consent to the termination of the Debt Commitment Letters or of any
lender in accordance with the terms of the Debt Commitment Letters or release
any commitment in connection with the appointment of the Additional Lead
Arrangers under Section 2 of the Debt Commitment Letters prior to the first to
occur of the Closing and the expiration of the Debt Commitment Letters in
accordance with their terms, except (x) for assignments and replacements of a
lender under the terms of, and only in connection with, the syndication in
connection with the funding and Closing of the Debt Financing under the Debt
Commitment Letters, (y) for replacements of the Debt Commitment Letters with
alternative financing commitments pursuant to _Section 7.3(c)_ or (z) with
the prior written consent of the Company.

 



 

(b) _Equity Financing_. Newco shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions
and do (or cause to be done) all things necessary, proper or advisable to
obtain the Equity Financing, including by (i) maintaining in effect the Equity
Commitment Letter, (ii) complying with its obligations under the Equity
Commitment Letter, (iii) satisfying on a timely basis all conditions
applicable to Newco or Merger Sub in such Equity Commitment Letter that are
within its control, if any, (iv) enforcing its rights under the Equity
Commitment Letter, and (v) consummating the Equity Financing at or prior to
Closing, including by causing the Sponsors to fund the Equity Financing at the
Closing.

 



 

(c) _Debt Financing and Alternate Debt Financing_. Newco shall use (or cause
Merger Sub to use) its reasonable best efforts to arrange the Debt Financing
and obtain the financing contemplated thereby as promptly as reasonably
practicable on the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letters, including using its reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect
the Debt Commitment Letters in accordance with the terms and subject to the
conditions thereof, (ii) comply with its obligations under the Debt Commitment
Letters, (iii) as promptly as practicable, negotiate, execute and deliver
definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letters on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letters, (iv)

 



      
 

 



 

satisfy on a timely basis all conditions to funding that are applicable to
Newco and Merger Sub in the Debt Commitment Letters and the definitive
agreements with respect to the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letters, (v) enforce its rights under the Debt Commitment Letters
and (vi) consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to the Closing. Newco and
Merger Sub will fully pay, or cause to be fully paid, all commitment or other
fees arising pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letters as and when they become
due. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, in the event that
any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters, Newco shall use its
reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event, (i) obtain alternative financing from alternative
sources on terms and conditions not less favorable in the aggregate to Newco,
Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation than those set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letters and in an amount at least equal to the Debt Financing or
such unavailable portion thereof, as the case may be (the " _Alternate Debt
Financing_ "), and (ii) obtain one or more new financing commitment letters
with respect to such Alternate Debt Financing (the " _New Debt Commitment
Letters_ "), which New Debt Commitment Letters will replace the existing Debt
Commitment Letter in whole or in part. Newco shall promptly provide the
Company with a copy of any New Debt Commitment Letters and any fee letter in
connection therewith (except that the fee amounts, pricing caps and other
economic terms, none of which would adversely affect the conditionality,
availability or termination of the Alternate Debt Financing to be funded at
the Closing, set forth therein may be redacted). In the event that any New
Debt Commitment Letters are obtained, (A) any reference in this Agreement to
the "Financing Commitment Letters" or the "Debt Commitment Letters" will be
deemed to include the Debt Commitment Letters to the extent not superseded by
one or more New Debt Commitment Letters at the time in question and any New
Debt Commitment Letters to the extent then in effect, and (B) any reference in
this Agreement to the "Financing" or the "Debt Financing" means the debt
financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters as modified pursuant to
the foregoing.

 



 

(d) _Information_. Newco and Merger Sub shall (i) keep the Company reasonably
informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of its efforts to arrange
the Financing or any applicable Alternate Debt Financing, and (ii) promptly
(but in any event within one Business Day) provide the Company with copies of
all executed amendments, modifications or replacements of Debt Commitment
Letters (it being understood that any amendments, modifications or
replacements shall only be as permitted herein) or definitive agreements
related to the Financing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Newco and Merger Sub shall promptly notify the Company (A) of any breach (or
threatened breach) or default (or any event or circumstance that, with notice
or lapse of time or both, could reasonably be expected to give rise to any
breach or default) by any party to the Financing Commitment Letters or
definitive agreements related to the Financing of which Newco becomes aware,
(B) of the receipt by Newco or Merger Sub of any written notice or
communication from the Sponsors, any Equity Financing Source or any Debt
Financing Source with respect to any breach (or threatened breach), default,
termination or repudiation by any party to a Financing Commitment Letter or
any definitive agreements related to the Financing of any provisions of any
Financing Commitment Letter or such definitive agreements, and (C) if for any
reason, Newco or Merger Sub at any time believes it will not be able to obtain
all or any portion of the Financing on the terms, in the manner or from the
sources contemplated by the Financing Commitment Letters or any definitive
agreements related to the Financing.

 



 

(e) _No Financing Condition_. Newco and Merger Sub each acknowledge and agree
that obtaining the Financing is not a condition to the Closing. In the event
that the Financing has not been obtained, Newco and Merger Sub will each
continue to be obligated, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in _Section 2.2_, to consummate the Merger.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) _Company Support_.

 



 

(i) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will use its reasonable best
efforts, and will use its reasonable best efforts to cause each of its
Subsidiaries and Representatives to use its respective reasonable best
efforts, to provide Newco, at Newcos sole expense, with all cooperation
reasonably requested by Newco to assist it in causing the conditions in the
Debt Commitment Letters to be satisfied or as is otherwise reasonably
requested by Newco in connection with the Debt Financing, including:

 



 

(A) participation by the Companys senior management team in a reasonable

(C) as promptly as reasonably practical, furnishing Newco and the Debt
Financing Sources with (x) such information as may be reasonably necessary for

looking information) as Newco, Merger Sub or Debt Financing Sources shall
reasonably request in order to consummate the Debt Financing or as is
customary for the arrangement of loans or issuance of debt securities
contemplated by the Debt Financing (including all information contemplated by
paragraph 8 of Exhibit D to the Debt Commitment Letter or the analogous
provision in any amendment, modification, supplement, restatement or
replacement thereof permitted or required hereunder), but in each case subject
to the limitations specified in paragraph 8 of Exhibit D;

 



 

(D) delivery of customary authorization letters that authorize the
distribution of the confidential information memorandum to prospective
lenders, which letters shall contain a customary "10b-5" representation by the

representation that the public-side version does not include material non-
public information about the Company and its Subsidiaries or their securities;

 



 

(E) delivery to Newco and the Debt Financing Sources of the Required Financial
Information;

 



 

(F) reasonable participation by senior financial officers of the Company and

prepared after giving effect to the transactions described in the Debt
Commitment Letters as if such transactions had occurred as of such date (in
the case of such balance sheet) or at the beginning of such period (in the
case of such statements of income), which need not include adjustments for
purchase accounting (including adjustments of the type contemplated by
Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 805,
Business Combinations (formerly SFAS 141R));

 



      
 

 



 

(H) using reasonable best efforts to assist in obtaining consents and legal
opinions customary for financings similar to the Debt Financing;

 



 

(I) using reasonable best efforts prior to the commencement of the Marketing
Period to help Newco procure public corporate ratings in respect of the
Company and public ratings of the facilities contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letters and public ratings for any notes issued as a part of the
Debt Financing from Standard and Poors Financial Services LLC and Moodys
Investors Service, Inc.;

 



 

(J) ensuring that there are no competing issues, offerings, arrangements or
placements of debt securities or syndicated commercial bank or other credit
facilities of the Company or its Subsidiaries (of the types contemplated by
the Debt Commitment Letter) being offered, placed or arranged between the date
of this Agreement and the Closing Date (other than any indebtedness of the
Company and its Subsidiaries permitted to be incurred hereunder);

 



 

(K) reasonably facilitating the satisfaction on a timely basis of all
conditions in the Debt Commitment Letters that are within its control;

 



 

(L) assisting in the preparation of any credit agreement, guarantee, pledge

Subsidiaries that Newco reasonably determines to be required by U.S.
regulatory authorities under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money
laundering rules and regulations, including without limitation the PATRIOT
Act, in connection with the Debt Financing; and

 



 

(N) using reasonable best efforts to ensure that any syndication efforts in
connection with the Debt Financing benefit from the Companys existing lending
and investment banking relationships;

 



 

(O) taking all actions reasonably requested by Newco and necessary to (A)
permit the prospective lenders involved in the Debt Financing to evaluate the
Companys current assets, cash management and accounting systems, policies and
procedures relating thereto for the purpose of establishing collateral
arrangements to the extent customary and reasonable and (B) at the Closing,
establish bank and other accounts and blocked account agreements and lock box
arrangements in connection with the foregoing; and

 



 

(P) subject to customary confidentiality arrangements, providing other
customary and reasonable due diligence materials as Newco may reasonably
request to potential Debt Financing Sources necessary to consummate the Debt

(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 7.3(f)(i)_ or any other
provision of this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement will require the
Company or any of its

 



      
 

 



 

Subsidiaries to (A) waive or amend any terms of this Agreement or agree to pay
any fees or reimburse any expenses prior to the Effective Time for which it
has not received prior reimbursement or is not otherwise indemnified by or on
behalf of Newco, (B) enter into any definitive agreement the effectiveness of
which is not conditioned on the Closing Date, (C) give any indemnities the
effectiveness of which are not conditioned on the Closing Date, (D) take any
action that, in the good faith determination of the Company, would
unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company and its

be deemed to unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries), (E) provide any information the disclosure of
which is prohibited or restricted by its organizational documents or any
Applicable Law or is legally privileged, or (F) take any action that will
conflict with or violate any Applicable Laws or would result in a violation or
breach of, or default under, any agreement to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party; provided that the Company and its Subsidiaries shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of any third Person
to such agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party.
In addition, no action, liability or obligation of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives pursuant to any
certificate, agreement, arrangement, document or instrument relating to the
Debt Financing will be effective until the Effective Time, and neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will be required to take any action
pursuant to any certificate, agreement, arrangement, document or instrument
(including being an issuer or other obligor with respect to the Debt
Financing) that is not contingent on the occurrence of the Closing or that
must be effective prior to the Effective Time. Nothing in this Agreement will
require (A) any officer or Representative of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to deliver any certificate or opinion or take any other action
pursuant to _Section 7.3(f)(i)_ or any other provision of this Agreement that
could reasonably be expected to result in personal liability to such officer
or Representative, or (B) the members of the Company Board as of the date
hereof to approve any financing or Contracts related thereto prior to the
Effective Time.

 



 

(g) _Confidentiality_. All non-public or other confidential information
provided by the Company or any of its Representatives pursuant to this
Agreement will be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement, except that Newco and Merger Sub will be permitted to disclose such
information to any financing sources or prospective financing sources and
other financial institutions and investors that are or may become parties to
the Debt Financing and to any underwriters, initial purchasers or placement
agents in connection with the Debt Financing (and, in each case, to their
respective counsel and auditors) and to any rating agencies so long as such
Persons (i) agree to be bound by the Confidentiality Agreement as if parties
thereto, or (ii) are subject to other confidentiality undertakings reasonably
satisfactory to the Company and of which the Company is a beneficiary.

 



 

(h) _Company Reimbursement and Indemnification_.

 



 

(i) Upon request by the Company, Newco shall promptly following the Closing or
the valid termination of this Agreement (and in any event within thirty (30)
calendar days following the Closing or the valid termination of this
Agreement) reimburse the Company and its Subsidiaries for all reasonable out-
of-pocket costs and expenses (including legal fees and expenses) incurred by
the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with providing the
support and cooperation contemplated by _Section 7.3(f)_; provided, that, the
Company shall consult with Newco prior to the Company and/or any of its
Subsidiaries making any expenditures in excess of $50,000 in connection with
providing the support and cooperation contemplated by _Section 7.3(f)_.

 



 

(ii) Newco shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries,
and each of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and other
representatives,

 



      
 

 



 

from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, interest, costs or
expenses (including reasonable out-of-pocket legal fees and expenses), awards,
judgments, penalties and amounts paid in settlement suffered or incurred by
any of them in connection with the Debt Financing, including providing the
support and cooperation contemplated by _Section 7.3(f)_ and any information
utilized in connection therewith (other than information provided by the
Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries), other than to the extent such
losses, damages, claims, interest, costs or expenses arise from the willful
misconduct or gross negligence of any such indemnified person.

 



 

(i) _No Exclusive Arrangements_. In no event will the Sponsors, the Equity
Financing Sources, Newco, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates
(which for this purpose will be deemed to include each direct investor in
Newco or Merger Sub and the financing sources or potential financing sources
of Newco, Merger Sub and such investors) enter into or enforce any Contract
prohibiting or seeking to prohibit any bank, investment bank or other
potential provider of debt or equity financing for the Merger or any other
transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from providing or
seeking to provide debt or equity financing to any Person in connection with
the Merger or any other transaction relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

 



 

(j) _Company Logos_. The Companys and its Subsidiaries logos may be used in
connection with the Debt Financing; _provided_ that such logos are used solely
in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(k) _Waiver_. In no event shall the Company or any of its Affiliates (i) seek
to enforce this Agreement against, make any claims for breach of this
Agreement against, or seek to recover monetary damages from, any Debt
Financing Source or any of its directors, officers, employees, incorporators,
members, partners, shareholders, Affiliates, agents, attorneys, advisors,
lenders or representatives or (ii) seek to enforce the commitments against,
make any claims for breach of the commitments contained in the Debt Commitment
Letters against, or seek to recover monetary damages from, or otherwise sue,
the Debt Financing Sources for any reason, including in connection with the
Debt Financing or the obligations of the Debt Financing Sources thereunder.
The Company and its Affiliates hereby waive any and all claims and causes of
action (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity) against the Debt
Financing Sources that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this
Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letters or the Debt Financing. Nothing in this
_Section 7.3(k)_ shall in any way limit or qualify the obligations and
liabilities of the parties to the Debt Commitment Letters to each other or in
connection therewith.

 



 

7.4 _Efforts to Close_.

 



 

(a) _Reasonable Best Efforts_. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
other covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement, including
_Sections 7.2_ and _7.3_ , each of Newco, Merger Sub and the Company shall use
their reasonable best efforts to take (or cause to be taken) all actions, and
to do (or cause to be done), and to assist and cooperate with the other party
or parties hereto in doing, all things reasonably necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the Merger and other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including using reasonable best efforts to (i) cause the conditions to the
Merger set forth in _Section 2.2_ to be satisfied or fulfilled, (ii) obtain
all necessary consents, approvals, orders and authorizations from Governmental
Authorities, the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting periods
under the HSR Act and all other applicable Antitrust Laws in the Relevant
Antitrust Jurisdictions, and (iii) seek all necessary or appropriate consents,
waivers and approvals under any Material Contracts to which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party in connection with this Agreement and the
consummation

 



      
 

 



 

of the Merger and other transactions contemplated by this Agreement so as to
maintain and preserve the benefits under such Material Contracts following the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger).

 



 

(b) _Forbearance_. In addition to the foregoing, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, neither Newco or Merger Sub or their Affiliates,
on the one hand, nor the Company, on the other hand, will take any action, or
fail to take any action, that is intended to or has (or would reasonably be
expected to have) the effect of preventing, impairing, materially delaying or
otherwise adversely affecting (i) the consummation of the Merger, or (ii) the
ability of such party to fully perform its obligations pursuant to this
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, no action by the Company taken in
compliance with _Section 7.3(f)_ will be considered a violation of this
_Section 7.4_.

 



 

(c) _No Consent Fee_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this _Section 7.4_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries will be required to agree to the payment of a consent
fee, "profit sharing" payment or other consideration (including increased or
accelerated payments), or the provision of additional security (including a
guaranty), in connection with the Merger, including in connection with
obtaining any consent pursuant to any Material Contract.

 



 

7.5 _Access to the Company_. At all times during the period commencing with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier
to occur of the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article
VIII_ and the Effective Time, the Company shall afford Newco and its
Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours and after
reasonable advance notice, to all assets, properties, books and records and
personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries as Newco may reasonably request;
_provided, however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may
restrict or otherwise prohibit access to any documents or information to the
extent that (a) any Applicable Law requires the Company to restrict or
otherwise prohibit access to such documents or information; (b) access to such
documents or information would give rise to a material risk of waiving any
attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other privilege applicable
to such documents or information; (c) access to a Contract to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound would violate
or cause a default pursuant to, or give a third Person the right to terminate
or accelerate the rights pursuant to, such Contract; provided that the Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of such third
Person to such Contract; (d) access would result in the disclosure of any
trade secrets of third Persons; or (e) such documents or information are
reasonably pertinent to any adverse Legal Proceeding between the Company and
its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Newco and its Affiliates, on the other
hand. Nothing in this _Section 7.5_ will be construed to require the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives to prepare
any reports, analyses, appraisals, opinions or other information. Any
investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this _Section
7.5_ will be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with
the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries or create a
risk of damage or destruction to any property or assets of the Company or its
Subsidiaries. Any access to the properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries
will be subject to the Companys reasonable security measures and insurance
requirements and will not include the right to perform invasive testing. The
terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement will apply to any
information obtained by Newco or any of its Representatives in connection with
any investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this
_Section 7.5_. All requests for access pursuant to this _Section 7.5_ must
be directed to the General Counsel of the Company, or another person
designated in writing by the Company.

(a) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the valid
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ and the Effective
Time, the Company shall promptly notify Newco in writing in the event that any
representation or warranty made by the Company in this Agreement has become
untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or in the event that the Company
has failed to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant or

in accordance with its terms.

 



 

7.8 _Public Disclosure_. The initial press release concerning this Agreement
and the Merger will be a joint press release reasonably acceptable to the
Company and Newco. Thereafter, except in connection with a Company Board
Recommendation Change or following a Company Board Recommendation Change), the
Company, on the one hand, and Newco and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall
use their respective reasonable best efforts to consult with the other parties
to this Agreement before (a) participating in any media interviews, (b)
engaging in any meetings or calls with analysts, institutional investors or
other similar Persons, or (c) providing any statements that are public or are
reasonably likely to become public, in any such case to the extent relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby including the Merger;
_provided, however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Company,
Newco or Merger Sub will not be obligated to engage in such consultation with
respect to communications that are (i) required by Applicable Law or any stock
exchange rule or listing agreement, or (ii) principally directed to employees,
suppliers, customers, partners or vendors.

 



 

7.9 _Transaction Litigation_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
promptly notify Newco of all (i) notices other communications received by the
Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates from any Governmental
Authority in connection with the Merger or any other transaction contemplated
by this Agreement or from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person
is required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, if the subject matter of such communication or the failure of such
party to obtain such consent could be material to the Company, its
Subsidiaries or Newco and (ii) Legal Proceedings commenced or threatened
against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, in each case in
connection with, arising from or otherwise relating to the Merger or any other

shall (a) give Newco the opportunity to participate in the defense, settlement
or prosecution of any Transaction Litigation; and (b) consult with Newco with
respect to the defense, settlement and prosecution of any Transaction
Litigation. For purposes of this _Section 7.9_, "participate" means that
Newco will be kept apprised of proposed strategy and other significant
decisions with respect to the Transaction Litigation by the Company (to the
extent that the attorney-client privilege between the Company and its counsel
is not undermined or otherwise affected), and Newco may offer comments or
suggestions with respect to such Transaction Litigation which the Company
shall consider in good faith, but will not be afforded any decision-making
power or other authority over such Transaction Litigation.

 



 

7.10 _Section 16(b) Exemption_. The Company shall take all actions reasonably
necessary to cause the Merger and all other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and any other dispositions of equity securities of the Company

director or executive officer of the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



 

7.11 _Directors and Officers Exculpation, Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) _Existing Agreements and Protections_. The Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries shall (and Newco shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to) honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries under any and all indemnification agreements
between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of their respective
current or former directors and officers and any person who becomes a director
or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective
Time (the " _Indemnified Persons_ "). In addition, during the period
commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and
Newco shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause the
certificates of incorporation and bylaws (and other similar organizational
documents) of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain
provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of
expenses that are at least as favorable as the indemnification, exculpation
and advancement of expenses provisions set forth in the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws (or other similar organizational documents) of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof, and during such six-year
period such provisions shall not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified in
any manner except as required by Applicable Law.

 



 

(b) _Indemnification_. Without limiting the generality of the provisions of
_Section 7.11(a)_, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Newco shall cause the Surviving Corporation to)
indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Person from and against any
costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
investigation expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim,
proceeding, investigation or inquiry, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative, to the extent such claim, proceeding, investigation or
inquiry arises directly or indirectly out of or pertains directly or
indirectly to (i) any action or omission or alleged action or omission in such
Indemnified Persons capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates (regardless of whether
such action or omission, or alleged action or omission, occurred prior to, at
or after the Effective Time), or (ii) any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that if, at any time prior to the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Person delivers to Newco a
written notice asserting a claim for indemnification under this _Section
7.11(b)_, then the claim asserted in such notice shall survive the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time until such time

 



      
 

 



 

as such claim is fully and finally resolved. In the event of any such claim,
proceeding, investigation or inquiry, (i) the Surviving Corporation shall have
the right to control the defense thereof after the Effective Time (it being
understood that, by electing to control the defense thereof, the Surviving
Corporation will be deemed to have waived any right to object to the
Indemnified Persons entitlement to indemnification hereunder with respect
thereto), (ii) each Indemnified Person shall be entitled to retain his or her
own counsel, whether or not the Surviving Corporation shall elect to control
the defense of any such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, (iii) the
Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of any
counsel retained by an Indemnified Person promptly after statements therefor
are received, whether or not the Surviving Corporation shall elect to control
the defense of any such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, and (iv)
no Indemnified Person shall be liable for any settlement effected without his
or her prior express written consent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this _Section 7.11(b)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither
the Surviving Corporation nor any of its Affiliates (including Newco) shall
settle or otherwise compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or
otherwise seek termination with respect to any claim, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry for which indemnification may be sought by an
Indemnified Person under this Agreement unless such settlement, compromise,
consent or termination includes an unconditional release of all Indemnified
Persons from all liability arising out of such claim, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry.

 



 

(c) _Insurance_. During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending
on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall (and Newco shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain in effect
the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance (" _D andO
Insurance_") in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, covering each person covered by the DandO Insurance, on terms
with respect to the coverage and amounts that are equivalent to those of the
DandO Insurance; _provided, however_ , that in satisfying its obligations under
this _Section 7.11(c)_, the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to
pay annual premiums in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the amount
paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year (such three
hundred percent (300%) amount, the " _Maximum Annual Premium_ "); _provided,
however_ , that that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed
such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy
with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum
Annual Premium. Prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Company may purchase a six-year
"tail" prepaid policy on the DandO Insurance. In the event that the Company
elects to purchase such a "tail" policy prior to the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall (and Newco shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to) maintain such "tail" policy in full force and effect and continue to honor
their respective obligations thereunder, in lieu of all other obligations of
the Surviving Corporation (and Newco) under the first sentence of this
_Section 7.11(c)_ for so long as such "tail" policy shall be maintained in
full force and effect.

 



 

(d) _Successors and Assigns_. If the Surviving Corporation (or Newco) or any
of its successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfer all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations of the Surviving
Corporation (or Newco) set forth in this _Section 7.11_.

 



 

(e) _No Impairment; Third Party Beneficiaries_. The obligations set forth in
this _Section 7.11_ shall not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in
any manner that adversely affects any Indemnified Person (or any other person
who is a beneficiary under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to
in _Section 7.11(c)_ (and their heirs and representatives)) without the prior
written

 



       
 

 



 

consent of such affected Indemnified Person or other person who is a
beneficiary under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in
_Section 7.11(c)_ (and their heirs and representatives). Each of the
Indemnified Persons or other persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO
Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section 7.11(c)_ (and their
heirs and representatives) are intended to be third party beneficiaries of
this _Section 7.11_, with full rights of enforcement as if a party thereto.
The rights of the Indemnified Persons (and other persons who are beneficiaries
under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section 7.11(c)_
(and their heirs and representatives)) under this _Section 7.11_ shall be in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that such persons
may have under the certificates of incorporation, bylaws or other equivalent
organizational documents, any and all indemnification agreements of or entered
into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or applicable law (whether at
law or in equity).

 



 

(f) _Joint and Several Obligations_. The obligations and liability of the
Surviving Corporation, Newco and their respective Subsidiaries under this
_Section 7.11_ shall be joint and several.

 



 

(g) _Preservation of Other Rights_. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to,
shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to
directors and officers insurance claims under any policy that is or has been
in existence with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of
their respective directors, officers or other employees, it being understood
and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this _Section 7.11_ is
not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under such policies.

 



 

7.12 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Acknowledgment of Change of Control_. Newco hereby acknowledges that a
"change of control" (or similar phrase) within the meaning of the Employee
Plans, as applicable, will occur as of the Effective Time, as applicable.

 



 

(b) _Existing Agreements_. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Newco shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) honor
all Employee Plans and compensation arrangements in accordance with their
terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, _provided,
however,_ that nothing in this sentence shall prohibit the Surviving
Corporation from amending or terminating any such Employee Plans, arrangements
or agreements in accordance with their terms or Applicable Law.

 



 

(c) _Continuation of Company Plans_. As of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Newco shall cause the Surviving Corporation to)
continue to employ the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who are
employed as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. For a period of one
(1) year following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and
Newco shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) either (i) maintain for the
benefit of each Continuing Employee the Employee Plans and any other employee
benefit plans or other compensation and severance arrangements of the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (together, the " _Company
Plans_ " but excluding equity based benefits and individual employment
agreements) at benefit levels that are no less than those in effect at the
Company or its Subsidiaries on the date of this Agreement, and provide
compensation and benefits to each Continuing Employee under such Company
Plans, or (ii) provide compensation, benefits and severance payments (other
than equity based benefits) to each Continuing Employee that, taken as a
whole, are no less favorable in the aggregate than the compensation, benefits
and severance payments (other than equity based benefits) provided to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time (" _Comparable
Plans_ "), or (iii) provide some combination of (i) and (ii) above such that
each Continuing Employee receives compensation,

 



      
 

 



 

benefits and severance payments (other than equity based benefits ) that,
taken as a whole, are no less favorable in the aggregate than the
compensation, benefits and severance payments (other than equity based
benefits ) provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time. For a period of one (1) year following the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation will (and Newco will cause the Surviving Corporation to)
provide severance benefits to eligible employees in accordance with the
Companys severance plans, guidelines and practices as in effect on the date
of this Agreement and that have been made available to Newco prior to the
Closing.

 



 

(d) _Service Credit; Etc_. The Surviving Corporation shall (and Newco shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to) provide each Continuing Employee with
credit for all service with the Company and its Subsidiaries (and their
respective predecessors) prior to the Effective Time for purposes of
eligibility to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits where length
of service is relevant (including for purposes of vacation accrual and
severance pay entitlement and excluding for purposes of any defined benefit
plan or retiree welfare plan); _provided, however_ , that such service need
not be credited to the extent that (i) it would result in duplication of
coverage or benefits or (ii) such service credit is not recognized by the
Company for similar purposes as of immediately prior to the date hereof. In
addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) each
Continuing Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any
waiting time, in any and all employee benefit plans sponsored by the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries (other than the Company Plans) (such plans,
collectively, the " _New Plans_ ") to the extent coverage under any such New
Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Company Plan in which such
Continuing Employee participates immediately before the Effective Time (such
plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), (ii) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision and/or disability benefits
to any Continuing Employee, the Surviving Corporation shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause all waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions,
evidence of insurability requirements and actively-at-work or similar
requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and
his or her covered dependents, and the Surviving Corporation shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred by such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of
the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employees participation
in the corresponding New Plan begins to be given full credit under such New
Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-
of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her
covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been
paid in accordance with such New Plan, and (iii) credit the accounts of such
Continuing Employees under any New Plan which is a flexible spending plan with
any unused balance in the account of such Continuing Employee under the
applicable Company Plan. Any vacation or paid time off accrued but unused by a
Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
credited to such Continuing Employee following the Effective Time, and shall
not limit future accruals.

 



 

(e) _No Third Party Beneficiary Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, this _Section 7.12_ will not be deemed
to (i) guarantee employment for any period of time for, or preclude the
ability of Newco, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to terminate any Continuing Employee for any reason; (ii) subject
to the limitations and requirements specifically set forth in this _Section
7.12_, require Newco, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to continue any Company Plan or prevent the amendment,
modification or termination thereof after the Effective Time; (iii) create any
third party beneficiary rights in any Person; or (iv) establish, amend or
modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement.

 



 

7.13 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Newco shall take all actions necessary to
cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their respective
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger and other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement upon the terms and

 



      
 

 



 

subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. Newco and Merger Sub
will be jointly and severally liable for the failure by either of them to
perform and discharge any of their respective covenants, agreements and
obligations pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement.

 



 

7.14 _Newco Vote_. Immediately following the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, Newco, in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, will
execute and deliver to Merger Sub and the Company a written consent approving
the Merger in accordance with the DGCL.

 



 

7.15 _Repatriation_. The Company and its Subsidiaries will use their
commercially reasonable efforts (in the manner reasonably requested in writing
by Newco) to distribute or transfer or cause to be distributed or transferred,
immediately before Closing (including pursuant to the repayment of outstanding
intercompany obligations), any unrestricted cash balances held in commercial
bank accounts of any non-U.S. Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
distribution or transfer will be required to be made (i) to the extent that
such distribution or transfer would be subject to withholding or other Taxes
or would cause the Company or any Subsidiary to suffer any other adverse Tax
consequences in advance of the Effective Time, and (ii) unless and until all
of the conditions to the Merger set forth in _Section 2.2_ have been
satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be
satisfied or waived (if permitted hereunder) at the Closing, but subject to
the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted hereunder) of such
conditions at the Closing) and Newco has irrevocably confirmed that it is
prepared to consummate the Closing.

otherwise) in the event of, or arising out of fraud in connection with any of
the transactions contemplated hereby.

9.11 _Remedies_.

 



 

(a) _Generally_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies

(b) _Specific Performance_.

 



 

(i) The parties hereto hereby agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with its specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that money damages or
other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such damages.
Accordingly, the parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree, subject to
_Section 8.4(e)_ and _Section 9.11(b)(ii)_, that in the event of any breach
or threatened breach by the Company, on the one hand, or Newco and Merger Sub,
on the other hand, of any of their respective covenants or obligations set
forth in this Agreement, the Company, on the one hand, and Newco and Merger
Sub, on the other hand, shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the
other (as applicable), and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of
this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the other under this
Agreement, and this right

 



      
 

 



 

shall include the right of the Company to cause Newco and Merger Sub to fully
enforce (A) the terms of the Equity Commitment Letter against the Sponsors to
the fullest extent permissible under this _Section 9.11(b)_, the Equity
Commitment Letter and Applicable Law, and (B) the terms of the Debt Commitment
Letters against the Debt Financing Sources to the fullest extent permissible
under the Debt Commitment Letters and Applicable Law, and to thereafter cause
the Merger to be consummated in accordance with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement.

 



 

(ii) Notwithstanding _Section 9.11(b)(i)_, it is acknowledged and agreed that
the right of the Company to an injunction, specific performance or other
equitable remedy in connection with enforcing Newcos obligation to cause the
Equity Financing to be funded will be subject to the requirements that (A) all
of the conditions set forth in _Section 2.2(a)_ and _Section 2.2(b)_ have
been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be
satisfied at the Closing, each of which is capable of being satisfied at the
Closing), (B) the Debt Financing has been funded or will be funded on the date
the Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to _Section 2.1_ if the
Equity Financing is funded at the Closing, (C) Newco and Merger Sub shall have
failed to consummate the Merger by the time the Closing was required by
_Section 2.1_ to occur, and (D) the Company has irrevocably notified Newco in
writing that (x) the Company is ready, willing and able to consummate the
Merger, and (y) all conditions set forth in _Section 2.2(c)_ have been
satisfied (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied
at the Closing, each of which is capable of being satisfied at the Closing) or
that it is willing to waive any unsatisfied conditions set forth in _Section
2.2(c)_ and (E) if specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing
and Debt Financing are funded, the Closing will occur. In no event will the
Company be entitled to enforce or seek to enforce specifically Newcos
obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded if the Debt Financing
has not been funded (or will not be funded at the Closing if the Equity
Financing is funded at the Closing).

 



 

(iii) The parties hereto hereby agree, subject to _Section 8.4(e)_ and
_Section 9.11(b)(ii)_, not to raise any objections to the availability of the
equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement by any party, and to specifically
enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and
obligations of any party under this Agreement. Any party hereto seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement will not be required
to provide any bond or other security in connection with such injunction or
enforcement, and each party hereto irrevocably waives any right that it may
have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or other
security. The parties hereto further agree that (x) by seeking the remedies
provided for in this _Section 9.11(b)_, a party hereto shall not in any
respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may be available
to a party under this Agreement, the Financing Commitment Letters or the
Funding Agreement (including monetary damages) in the event that this
Agreement has been terminated or in the event that the remedies provided for
in this _Section 9.11(b)_ are not available or otherwise are not granted, and
(y) nothing set forth in this _Section 9.11(b)_ shall require any party
hereto to institute any proceeding for (or limit any partys right to
institute any proceeding for) specific performance under this _Section
9.11(b)_ prior or as a condition to exercising any termination right under
_Article VIII_ (and pursuing damages after such termination), nor shall the
commencement of any Legal Proceeding pursuant to this _Section 9.11(b)_ or
anything set forth in this _Section 9.11(b)_ restrict or limit any partys
right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of _Article
VIII_ or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement or the Funding
Agreement that may be available then or thereafter. While the Company may
pursue both a grant of specific performance under this _Section 9.11(b)_ and
the payment of the Company Termination Fee under Section 8.4(a), under no
circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both (i) a
grant of specific performance that permits the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and (ii) monetary

 



      
 

 



 

damages in connection with this Agreement or any termination of this
Agreement, including all or any portion of the Company Termination Fee.

 



 

(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if prior to
the Termination Date any party initiates a Legal Proceeding to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement, then the Termination Date will be
automatically extended by (A) the amount of time during which such Legal
Proceeding is pending, plus twenty (20) Business Days, or (B) such other time
period established by the court presiding over such Legal Proceeding.

 



 

9.12 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that
might otherwise govern under applicable conflicts of law principles.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims and actions that may be based upon,
arise out of, or relate to, the Debt Financing or involve the Debt Financing
Sources shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
State of New York, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of
law provision or rule (whether of the State of New York or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the law of any jurisdiction
other than the State of New York.

 



 

9.13 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereto (a) irrevocably
consents to the service of the summons and complaint and any other process in
any action or proceeding relating to the transactions contemplated by this
