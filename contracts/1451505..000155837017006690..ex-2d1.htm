This Agreement (this "Agreement") is made on August 13, 2017 between: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(1) Transocean Inc., a Cayman Islands Exempted company with
company registration number 89645 ("Transocean Inc.");  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(2) Transocean Ltd., a Swiss corporation with its registered
office in Steinhausen, Canton of Zug, Switzerland ("Transocean Ltd.");
and \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(3) Songa Offshore SE, a European public company limited by
shares (or societas europaea), duly registered and validly existing under the
laws of Cyprus with company registration number SE9 ("Songa Offshore").  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tTransocean Inc., Transocean Ltd. and Songa Offshore are hereinafter
sometimes referred to collectively as the "Parties", and individually as a
"Party". \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t1\. BACKGROUND \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t1.1 Transocean Inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Transocean Ltd., which is the ultimate parent company of the Transocean group.
Transocean Ltd. is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and together with its
subsidiaries operates in the offshore drilling business.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t1.2 Songa Offshore is an offshore drilling contractor
headquartered in Limassol, Cyprus and listed on the main market of the Oslo
Stock Exchange ("Oslo Børs"). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t1.3 Transocean Ltd. and Songa Offshore have discussed and
agreed, on the terms and conditions set out herein, to seek to complete a
business combination (the "Combination"), to be effected by Transocean Ltd.
and Transocean Inc. or another wholly owned direct or indirect subsidiary of
Transocean Ltd. (such company or companies, the "Offeror") making a
recommended public voluntary exchange offer for all the issued and outstanding
shares (including ordinary shares, restricted shares and shares of any other
class) of Songa Offshore (the "Songa Shares") on such terms and conditions set
out in Clause 2 and Appendix 1 attached to this Agreement (the "Offer").
Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein (including the Appendices
hereto), the Offeror will further make an offer to acquire the issued and
outstanding Bonds (as defined below) issued by Songa Offshore as set out in
Clause 2.19 and terminate, on behalf of Songa Offshore, the Loan (as defined
below) in the manner and pursuant to the terms as set out in Clause
2.20. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t1.4 Prior to this Agreement, the Parties have each performed
an initial due diligence review of the other Party and its applicable
subsidiaries and affiliates according to agreed scopes and documentation
requests. Through such due diligence, the Offeror has reviewed the customer
contracts of Songa Offshore and its subsidiaries, as well as the Norwegian
exit tax case of Songa Offshore and matters related to Opus and Songa
Offshore's reported disputes with DSME (such matters, collectively, the "Phase
1 Due Diligence"), all with a satisfactory result, but the Offeror is still
completing due diligence on other matters that it has begun to review. The
Offeror shall have the right to conduct certain further confirmatory legal,
financial, commercial and technical due diligence of Songa Offshore and its
subsidiaries after the date of this Agreement, such due diligence however only
to cover items other than the Phase 1 Due Diligence. Songa Offshore shall
cooperate and assist Offeror and its representatives with such confirmatory
legal, financial, commercial and technical due diligence as reasonably
requested by Offeror and its representatives, including providing access at
the reasonable request of Offeror and its representatives to documents,
information and personnel of Songa Offshore to complete such confirmatory due
diligence. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in the third sentence of this
Clause 1.4 related to the non-Phase  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t   \t\t\t4/53  \t\t

  

1 Due Diligence shall be construed to limit, in any way, the obligations of
the Offeror contained in this Agreement; provided, that the foregoing shall
not limit Offeror's rights in Clause 9.1. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t1.5 Simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement,
Perestroika AS, a Norwegian private limited company controlled by Mr. Frederik
Mohn, chairman of the Songa Board ("Perestroika AS"), has given an irrevocable
pre-acceptance of the Offer to the Offeror (the "Perestroika AS Pre-
acceptance"), on substantially such terms as set out in Appendix 5 of this
Agreement. As soon as practicable following the execution of this Agreement,
Offeror and Songa Offshore will use their respective reasonable best efforts
to obtain irrevocable pre-acceptances of the Offer (substantially on such
terms as set out in Appendix 5 of this Agreement) (but for avoidance of doubt
without references to lock-up and director appointments) for Songa Shares that
are beneficially owned by Asia Research and Capital Management Ltd., which
together with Perestroika AS, constitute in the aggregate at least 63% of the
Songa Shares on a fully diluted basis as well as board members and members of
the executive management holding Songa Shares (collectively, the "Post-
Execution Pre-acceptances" and together with the Perestroika AS Pre-
acceptance, the "Pre-acceptances"). The Pre-acceptances also include or will
include, where relevant, irrevocable commitments to tender Bonds and exchange
the Loan. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t1.6 Songa Offshore, represented by its board of directors
(the "Songa Board"), and Transocean Ltd. and Transocean Inc. enter into this
Agreement to set forth their respective rights and obligations in connection
with the Combination and the Offer, the Bond Offer (as defined below) and the
Loan Exchange (as defined below). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t1.7 Perestroika AS shall be afforded the right to designate
one individual that the board of directors of Transocean Ltd. will propose to
Transocean Ltd.'s shareholders for election to Transocean Ltd.'s board of
directors at the extraordinary general meeting of shareholders at which the
Transocean Ltd. Shareholder Approvals (as defined in Clause 2.6) are sought
(including any adjournment or postponement thereof (the "Transocean Ltd.
Meeting"). Any such proposal and election shall be conditional upon the
completion of the Offer and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The individual designated by Perestroika AS (the "Perestroika
Designee") shall be Mr. Frederik Mohn. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t2\. THE OFFER  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t2.1 Subject to the conditions set out in Clause 2.9, the
Offeror shall make the Offer to exchange each Songa Share for consideration
consisting of a combination of (i) newly issued registered shares of
Transocean Ltd. at par value CHF 0.10 each (the "Consideration Shares"), (ii)
senior unsecured exchangeable bonds convertible into shares in Transocean
Ltd., such bonds to be issued on the terms set out in Appendix 2 to this
Agreement (the "Consideration CBs"), and (iii) at the election of the holder
of such Songa Share, cash as provided below (the value of any cash and the
value of the aggregate number of Consideration Shares and Consideration CBs to
be delivered per Songa Share, the "Offer Price"). The Offer shall in all
material respects be on the terms and subject to the closing conditions set
out in Appendix 1 to this Agreement, provided that one or more of such closing
conditions may be waived by the Offeror as set out in Appendix 1. The Offer
Price shall be equal to NOK 47.50 per Songa Share. The value of each
Consideration Share will be determined based on the closing price of the RIG
Shares on New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") at 10:00 pm CET (4:00 pm EST)
and the NOK/USD closing price at 4:00 pm CET as determined by Norges Bank,
each on the trading day immediately preceding the announcement of the Offer.
The value of each Consideration CB delivered in the Offer will  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t   \t\t\t5/53  \t\t

  

be the nominal amount of such Consideration CB. Each Songa Offshore
shareholder may elect to sell Songa Shares in the Offer for cash consideration
per Songa Share equal to the Offer Price for a total amount per Songa
Shareholder of up to NOK 125,000 (the "Cash Election") (to avoid doubt, this
shall mean that any Songa Shareholder holding Songa Shares valued at less than
NOK 125,000 based on the Offer Price may choose to receive 100% settlement in
cash). The number of Consideration Shares issued to (a) each Songa Offshore
shareholder who accepts the Offer and (b) following the completion of the
Offer, any Songa Offshore shareholder in connection with any mandatory offer
in accordance with the rules of chapter 6 of the Norwegian Securities Trading
Act 2007 or compulsory acquisition, in each case, will be rounded down to the
nearest whole number of Consideration Shares or Consideration CBs.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the aggregate Offer Price paid to each Songa
Offshore shareholder participating in the Offer shall be comprised, as near as
possible, of 50% Consideration Shares and 50% Consideration CBs, with any
exercise by such shareholder of the Cash Election being deducted first from
the aggregate number of Consideration CBs issued to such shareholder and
second to the aggregate number of Consideration Shares issued to such
shareholder. The number of Consideration Shares and Consideration CBs shall
each be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split,
reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into shares of Transocean Ltd. or Songa Shares, as
applicable), reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like
change (other than in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including any issuances of shares by Songa Offshore or Transocean
Ltd. permitted pursuant to Clause 4.1 or 4.2 of this Agreement) with respect
to the number of shares of Transocean Ltd. or Songa Shares outstanding after
the date hereof and prior to the completion of the Offer; provided, however,
that nothing in this Clause 2.1 shall be deemed to permit or authorize
Transocean Ltd. or Songa Offshore to effect any such change that it is not
otherwise authorized or permitted to undertake pursuant to this
Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t2.2 As promptly as reasonably practicable, and in any event
within ten U.S. business days after the date of this Agreement, each of the
Offeror and Songa Offshore shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
determine, in consultation with its respective legal counsel, whether the
Consideration Shares and the Consideration CBs may be issued without
registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities
Act") pursuant to Rule 802 promulgated under the Securities Act (an "Exempt
Exchange"). If the Offeror and Songa Offshore jointly conclude in their
collective reasonable judgment that the Consideration Shares and/or the
Consideration CBs may be issued pursuant to an Exempt Exchange, the Offeror
and Songa Offshore shall each use its commercially reasonable efforts to issue
the Consideration Shares and/or the Consideration CBs, as applicable, pursuant
to an Exempt Exchange upon the completion of the Offer and prior to the Long
Stop Date (as defined below).  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t2.3 If the Offeror and Songa Offshore do not jointly
conclude in their collective reasonable judgment that the Consideration Shares
and/or the Consideration CBs may be issued pursuant to an Exempt Exchange,
then the Offeror shall cause to be filed one or more Registration Statements
on Form S-4 (the "S-4 Registration Statements") with respect to the
Consideration Shares and the Consideration CBs as promptly as reasonably
practicable, and the Offeror shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
such registration statement to become effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as reasonably practicable following such filing, and in any event
before the Offer period expires, and thereafter use reasonable best efforts to
maintain the effectiveness thereof (the "Registered Exchange"). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t   \t\t\t6/53  \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t2.4 All Consideration Shares shall have equal rights in all
respects as the current issued shares of Transocean Ltd., and shall be listed
on the NYSE and be issued without any restrictions on transferability other
than those mandatorily applicable to any affiliates of the Offeror under the
Securities Act. The Offeror shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause all
Consideration CBs issued in the Offer, the Bond Offer and the Loan Exchange to
be listed on the NYSE or NASDAQ, as selected by the Offeror in its sole
discretion, within one month following the initial issuance of such
Consideration CBs and shall cause all Consideration CBs to be issued without
any restrictions on transferability or conversion other than those mandatorily
applicable to any affiliates of the Offeror under the Securities Act. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t2.5 Notwithstanding Clause 2.1, the Offeror may restrict
acceptance of the Offer from or otherwise restrict the distribution of Offer
documentation to jurisdictions where the Offeror reasonably determines, after
consultation with external counsel and Songa Offshore, that the making of the
Offer in or acceptance of the Offer from such jurisdiction would be in
violation of applicable laws or where the making of the Offer would require
filings, approvals or actions other than the approval of the Voluntary Offer
Document (as defined below) by Oslo Børs and the Financial Supervisory
Authority of Norway or the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC")
that are in the reasonable opinion of the Offeror, in consultation with and as
approved by Songa Offshore (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), unduly onerous. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t2.6 Transocean Ltd. shall prepare and file a preliminary and
definitive proxy statement with the SEC (the "Proxy Statement") in advance of,
and publish the Swiss law invitation to, the Transocean Ltd. Meeting at which
the shareholders of Transocean Ltd. shall vote on (i) the issuance of the
Consideration Shares in an ordinary share capital increase for purpose of
acquiring the Songa Shares and (ii) the creation of additional authorized
share capital of Transocean Ltd. pursuant to which Transocean Ltd.'s board of
directors is authorized to issue new registered shares of Transocean Ltd., at
par value CHF 0.10 each, in connection with a mandatory offer or compulsory
acquisition (if any) following the completion of the Offer, in each case with
the necessary majority under Swiss law and Transocean Ltd.'s Articles of
Association, (iii) the election of the Perestroika Designee to serve as
directors on the Transocean Ltd. board of directors, and (iv) the issuance of
the Consideration Shares and the Consideration CBs in connection with the
Offer, Bond Offer and the Loan Exchange pursuant to the rules of the NYSE (the
"Proxy Proposals"). Such approvals of the Proxy Proposals by Transocean Ltd.
shareholders are referred to in this Agreement as the "Transocean Ltd.
Shareholder Approvals." Transocean Ltd. shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to ensure that such Proxy Statement and other filings required to
obtain the Transocean Ltd. Shareholder Approvals are prepared and filed.
Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, Offeror shall (a) take all
action reasonably necessary in accordance with applicable law and its
applicable organizational documents to duly call, give notice of, convene and
hold a meeting of its shareholders as promptly as reasonably practicable after
the Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC, for the purpose of obtaining the
Transocean Ltd. Shareholder Approvals at the Transocean Ltd. Meeting, and (b)
use commercially reasonable efforts to solicit and obtain the Transocean Ltd.
Shareholder Approvals as promptly as reasonably practicable. Transocean Ltd.
shall, through Transocean Ltd.'s board of directors, recommend that Transocean
Ltd.'s shareholders approve the Transocean Ltd. Shareholder Approvals (the
"Transocean Board Recommendation") and include such Transocean Board

 \t\t

 \t\t\t2.10 The Offeror shall as soon as practically possible issue

voluntary offer document and prospectus (or a document providing similar
information) pursuant to chapters 6 and 7 of the Norwegian Securities Trading

contain terms and conditions for the Offer in all material respects consistent
with those set out in this Agreement and Appendix 1 to this Agreement.
Furthermore, the Parties will use commercially reasonable efforts to take the

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t2.11 Songa Offshore shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to provide such information and assistance as may be necessary and reasonably
requested by the Offeror in connection with the completion of the Voluntary

 \t\t

 \t\t\t2.12 Notwithstanding any information, assistance or comments

contained in the Voluntary Offer Document. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t2.13 In the event an S-4 Registration Statement is required to

such S-4 Registration Statement, and Songa Offshore shall furnish all
information concerning it, provide reasonable access to its employees and
auditors, and use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and furnish
information concerning the holders of its shares and bonds, in each case, as
the Offeror may reasonably request in connection with the preparation of such

and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for Songa
Offshore and (ii) assisting Offeror in its preparation of any pro forma

untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of

 \t\t

 \t\t\t2.14 The consolidated financial statements of the Offeror
supplied for inclusion or incorporation by reference in any S-4 Registration
Statement and the Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all material
respects with the accounting requirements and rules and regulations of the SEC
applicable to each party and fairly present the financial condition of the
Offeror as of the respective date thereof and the consolidated results of
operations and cash flows for the respective period then ended. Any audited

and unaudited consolidated interim financial statements provided for inclusion

representatives, including its counsel and auditors, reasonable opportunity
and time to review and provide comments to any S-4 Registration Statement and
Proxy Statement prior to the time the Offeror files such S-4 Registration
Statement and Proxy Statement with the SEC or any amendment or supplement
thereto and such document is made publicly available and shall consider in
good faith any comments so provided. Songa Offshore shall request its auditors
to provide the Offeror with all written consents (but does not warrant such
consents) in such form required by the SEC to authorize the Offeror to include
Songa Offshore\'s 2016, 2015 and 2014 annual financial statements and
unaudited consolidated interim financial statements in any S-4 Registration
Statement and the Proxy Statement, in each case, to be filed with the
SEC. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t2.15 The Offeror shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause any S-4 Registration Statement prepared to comply with the rules and
regulations promulgated by the SEC, to respond promptly as reasonably
practicable to any comments of the SEC or its staff and to have such S-4
Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly
as reasonably practicable after it is filed with the SEC. The Offeror will as
promptly as reasonably practicable provide in writing to Songa Offshore and
its counsel any comments, written or oral, of the SEC with respect to any S-4
Registration Statement and a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
any response thereto and consider in good faith any comments so provided, and
Songa Offshore shall reasonably cooperate with the Offeror in preparing
responses to such comments. All information supplied by or on behalf of the
Offeror or Songa Offshore for inclusion or incorporation by reference in any
S-4 Registration Statement will comply as to form in all material respects
with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act. The Offeror shall
also promptly as reasonably practicable file, use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause to become effective as promptly as reasonably practicable
and, if required, deliver to Songa Offshore's shareholders, any amendment to
any S-4 Registration Statement that becomes necessary after the date such S-4
Registration Statement is declared effective, including so as to ensure that
such S-4 Registration Statement does not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading. The Offeror will provide to
holders of Songa Shares the number of copies of the prospectus to any S-4
Registration Statement that are reasonably requested. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t2.16 In furtherance of the joint determination described in
Clause 2.2, Songa Offshore shall furnish all information concerning it and and
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t   \t\t\t10/53  \t\t

  

obtain and furnish information concerning the holders of its shares and bonds,
in each case, as the Offeror may reasonably request in connection with the
determination of whether the Consideration Shares and/or the Consideration CBs
may be issued pursuant to an Exempt Exchange, including requesting, pursuant
to a written letter approved in advance by the Offeror, information from
nominees holding any Songa Shares regarding any shares that may be held by a
U.S. holder. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t2.17 If between the date of signing of this Agreement and
completion of the Offer as contemplated by the Voluntary Offer Document and
any S-4 Registration Statement (as applicable), or, if relevant, expiry of a
subsequent mandatory offer, a consideration higher than the Offer Price is
paid or agreed to be paid pursuant to a direct or indirect acquisition of a
(directly or indirectly) Songa Share (in the open market or in privately
negotiated transactions or otherwise) by or on behalf of the Offeror or any
entity wholly owned directly or indirectly by Transocean Ltd., then the Offer
Price shall be increased to be at least equal to such higher consideration.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Offer Price shall not be increased pursuant
to this Clause 2.17 solely as a result of (i) the payment of cash
consideration (including the effect of any change in currency exchange rates)
in any subsequent mandatory offer in accordance with the minimum offer price
requirements as decided by Oslo Børs, (ii) share price fluctuations during or
after the Offer Period, or (iii) the application of calculation principles to
any subsequent mandatory offer that differ from the calculation principles
specified in Clause 2.1, whether applied by the Oslo Stock Exchange or any
other governmental or regulatory authority or pursuant to the requirements of
any applicable law (including applicable Cyprus law).  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t2.18 If the Offer is completed, the Offeror shall, as promptly
as reasonably practicable and in accordance with the applicable rules and
regulations, either make a mandatory offer for the remaining Songa Shares or,
if the conditions therefor are met, effectuate a compulsory acquisition of the
remaining Songa Shares according to applicable laws and regulations of
Cyprus. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t2.19 Subject to the Offeror making the Offer as set out in
Clause 2.1, the Offeror shall as promptly as reasonably practicable make an
offer (the "Bond Offer") to the holders (the "Bondholders") of bonds in SONG04
(ISIN NO 001 062875.3) ("SONG04 Bonds") and SONG05 (ISIN NO 001 064940.3)
("SONG05 Bonds", and together with SONG04 Bonds the "Bonds") to exchange (i)
each SONG04 Bond for Consideration CBs, cash or a combination thereof in a
total amount equal to 103.5% of the principal amount of such SONG04 Bonds and
(ii) each SONG05 Bond for Consideration CBs, cash or a combination thereof in
a total amount equal to 101% of the principal amount of such SONG05 Bonds, for
both (i) and (ii) plus accrued unpaid interest on the Bonds up to completion
of the Bond Offer. The Offeror acknowledges and agrees that (a) there will be
no conditions to the Bond Offer other than the conditions to the Offer, as
such conditions may be modified to be applicable to the Bond Offer, and (b) it
will not (I) waive any condition to the Offer unless any corresponding
condition to the Bond Offer is simultaneously waived and (II) waive any
condition to the Bond Offer unless any corresponding condition to the Offer is
simultaneously waived. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t2.20 Subject to the Offeror making the Offer as set out in
Clause 2.1, the Offeror shall exchange (the "Loan Exchange") with Perestroika
AS the USD 50 million loan (the "Loan") for Consideration CBs in a total
amount equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Loan (plus accrued unpaid
interest up to completion of the Loan Exchange) upon completion of the
Offer. \t\t

3. SONGA OFFSHORE BOARD RECOMMENDATION \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t3.1 The Songa Board undertakes to announce a (subject to any
disqualification or non-participation required by applicable Law) unanimous
recommendation of the Offer (the "Songa Board Recommendation") substantially
in the form attached in Appendix 7 to this Agreement or in such other form as
the Parties may agree in writing, subject as stated in Clause 3.3. The Offeror
may incorporate or refer to the Songa Board Recommendation in the Voluntary
Offer Document and any S-4 Registration Statement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t3.2 Due to the fact that the Offer is launched in agreement
with Songa Offshore, the Parties acknowledge that Oslo Børs will require that
a statement on behalf of Songa Offshore is made by an independent third-party,
ref. Section 6-16 (4) of the Norwegian Securities Trading Act 2007 (the
"Independent Statement"). ABG Sundal Collier ASA will, if approved by Oslo
Børs pursuant to Section 6-16 (4) of the Norwegian Securities Trading Act
2007, provide the form of Independent Statement substantially as set forth in
Appendix 8 to this Agreement and has confirmed to Songa Offshore that the
Independent Statement will be finalised for and shall be released
contemporaneously with the Songa Board Recommendation subject only to (i) its
confirmatory review of the Voluntary Offer Document, (ii) the Voluntary Offer
Document being made public and (iii) any change deemed required by ABG Sundal
Collier ASA due to developments between the date of this Agreement and the
date of the Independent Statement and in light of the requirements under
Section 6-16 of the Norwegian Securities Trading Act 2007. The Independent
Statement shall be included as an appendix to the Voluntary Offer Document or
made public through a stock exchange notice on the Songa Offshore
ticker. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t3.3 The Songa Board Recommendation shall not be withdrawn or
modified by the Songa Board unless (i) a Competing Offer (as defined in Clause
5.2) is made and the Songa Board determines in accordance with Clause 6.4 that
such Competing Offer is a Superior Proposal to the Offer or the Amended Offer
(as defined in Clause 6.2), as the case may be, or (ii) this Agreement is
terminated by Songa Offshore in accordance with the terms hereof.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t3.4 For purposes of this Agreement a "Superior Proposal"
shall mean a Competing Offer for all or a significant part of the Songa
Shares, on a fully diluted basis, or assets of Songa Offshore not solicited,
sought or initiated by Songa Offshore or its employees, directors, advisers
and representatives, directly or indirectly, in breach of Clause 5.1 on terms
that the Songa Board determines, in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisers and external legal counsel, would be more favourable from a
financial point of view to Songa Offshore's shareholders than the terms
contemplated by the Offer (or an Amended Offer, as the case may be).  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t4\. UNDERTAKINGS \t\t

may from time to time reasonably request, in all such cases subject to any
duty or obligation restricting the same;  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iii) promptly notify the Offeror if Songa Offshore becomes aware
that any act, matter or thing that is inconsistent with its obligations in

shall cause any of the conditions to the Offer not to be capable of
satisfaction;  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iv) no later than at the Announcement Date, Songa Offshore shall
take all actions it deems reasonably necessary to ensure that Offeror is

by the disclosure by Songa Offshore to Offeror of any information that
constitutes inside information (as defined by Section 3-2 of the Norwegian
Securities Trading Act) in respect of Songa Offshore or financial instruments
issued by Songa Offshore, including by, if and to the extent deemed necessary

that such new shares are issued promptly and if possible prior to the expiry
of the Offer period. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSonga Offshore undertakes to use its reasonable best efforts to comply
with all consent, notification and reporting obligations due to regulatory
requirements required to be complied with by Songa Offshore in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSonga Offshore, shall, and shall cause its direct and indirect
subsidiaries to give the Offeror the opportunity to reasonably participate in
the defense and settlement of the matters related to Opus, the Norwegian exit
tax case and the disputes with DSME (the "Specified Actions"), including
without limitation by providing the Offeror with all pleadings, motions,
memoranda (and other similar documents) and material correspondence, as well
as decisions or other actions by the applicable courts or arbitrators in the
Specified Actions, reasonable opportunity to review and comment in advance on
all pleadings, motions and memoranda (and other similar documents) to be filed
by Songa Offshore and/or its subsidiaries, and advance notice of any hearings

unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSonga Offshore may from time to time, for the purposes of requesting

delayed).  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) promptly notify Songa Offshore if the Offeror becomes aware
that any act, matter or thing that is inconsistent with its obligations in

shall cause any of the conditions to the Offer not to be capable of
satisfaction. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iii) no later than at the effective date of the S-4 Registration

Offshore\'s bank lenders, in each case, relating to Songa Offshore's business

Offshore's disputes with DSME). Notwithstanding the foregoing:  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) the Offeror may make any contact and/or maintain any dialogue
(whether through approach, initiation, solicitation or otherwise) that relates
to the Offeror's business.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) the Offeror may approach, initiate, solicit or maintain

employees' representatives if Songa Offshore (I) is given reasonable prior
written notice of such approach, initiation, solicitation or contact or

 \t\t

 \t\t\tPrior to completion of the Offer, Offeror will consult with, and take

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5\. NON-SOLICITATION  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.1 During the period from the date of this Agreement until
the earliest of (i) the termination of this Agreement, (ii) the lapsing or
withdrawal of the Offer, or (iii) the completion of the Offer, Songa Offshore
shall not, and shall cause its employees, directors, advisers and
representatives not to, directly or indirectly, solicit, seek or initiate (it
being understood that providing information in the ordinary course of business
to categories of persons to whom Songa Offshore routinely provides such
information will not, in and of itself, constitute any of the foregoing) the
making of any proposal or offer that constitutes a Competing Offer (as defined
in Clause 5.2).  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.2 A "Competing Offer" means any offer, proposal, inquiry or
indication of interest (other than an offer, proposal, inquiry or indication
of interest by the Offeror under this Agreement) contemplating or otherwise
relating to any Acquisition Transaction. An "Acquisition Transaction" means:
any transaction or series of transactions involving (A) any merger,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination, issuance of securities,
acquisition of securities, tender offer, exchange offer or other similar
transaction (1) in which Songa Offshore or any of its affiliates is a
constituent corporation, (2) in which a person or "group" (as defined in the
Exchange Act, as amended, and the rules promulgated thereunder) of persons
directly or indirectly acquires beneficial or record ownership of securities
representing more than 15% of the outstanding securities of any class of
voting securities of Songa Offshore or any of its subsidiaries, or (3) in
which Songa Offshore or any of its affiliates issues or sells securities
representing more than 15% of the outstanding securities of any class of
voting securities of Songa Offshore or any of its affiliates as of the date of
this Agreement; or (B) any sale (other than in the ordinary course of
business), lease (other than in the ordinary course of business), exchange,
transfer (other than in the ordinary course of business), license (other than
nonexclusive licenses in the ordinary course of business),  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t   \t\t\t19/53  \t\t

  

acquisition or disposition of any business or businesses or assets that
constitute or account for 15% or more of the consolidated net revenues, net
income or assets of Songa Offshore, or any of its businesses or
subsidiaries. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.3 For the avoidance of doubt, if Songa Offshore is
approached by an unsolicited bona fide third-party in relation to a possible
Competing Offer, it shall be entitled to enter into discussions with such
party and shall have the right to provide it with information necessary for
such third-party to carry out a due diligence of Songa Offshore if the Songa
Board determines in good faith that such discussions, if successful, may lead
to a Superior Proposal. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.4 Songa Offshore shall promptly inform the Offeror of the
receipt and all reasonable details (including the proposing party, the
proposed price and other significant terms, conditions and contingencies, as
well as any other information reasonably needed by the Offeror to evaluate the
proposal) of any Competing Offer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Songa
Offshore will not have to disclose the identity of such proposing party unless
and until the Songa Board has determined that such Competing Offer is a
Superior Proposal. If Songa Offshore enters into discussions with a third-
party in accordance with Clause 5.3, it shall inform and keep informed the
Offeror of all significant developments in such discussions (subject to the
immediately preceding sentence) and provide the Offeror with all non-public
information furnished to the proposing party which shall not have been
disclosed to the Offeror. Provided this obligation is observed, the Parties
acknowledge that public disclosure may be deferred pending the conclusion of
negotiations on a confidential basis with the potential bona fide third-
party. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t6\. COMPETING OFFERS - RIGHT TO AMEND \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t6.1 If a Competing Offer is made to the Songa Board and the
Songa Board determines that the Competing Offer is a Superior Proposal, Songa
Offshore shall without undue delay inform the Offeror in writing of this,
detailing the main terms of such Competing Offer. During a period of 72 hours
(provided that such period shall include at least 2 (two) U.S. business days)
from the time of such notice (or, if shorter until the Offeror notifies Songa
Offshore that it does not intend to make an Amended Offer) and subject to any
applicable law, the Parties shall not make any public statement or express any
public opinion relating to the Competing Offer (to avoid doubt, this shall not
preclude Songa Offshore from releasing a holding statement to comply with
fiduciary obligations).  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t6.2 If the Offeror notifies the Songa Board in writing within
the 72 hours provided in Clause 6.1 that it will amend the Offer (an "Amended
Offer"), the Songa Board shall carry out an assessment of whether the
Competing Offer is a Superior Proposal as compared to the Amended Offer.
 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t6.3 If the Offeror presents an Amended Offer in accordance
with Clause 6.2, and the Songa Board determines that the Competing Offer is no
longer a Superior Proposal, then the Songa Board shall, subject to as provided
in Clause 3, maintain its recommendation of the Offer (as amended). In such
circumstances, if the Competing Offer has been publicly announced, the Songa
Board shall publicly announce that it is maintaining its recommendation of the
Offer (as amended). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t6.4 If the Songa Board determines, without breach of this
Agreement, that the Competing Offer is a Superior Proposal to the Amended
Offer or the Offer (if an Amended Offer is not made within the deadline), the
Songa Board shall be free to (i) recommend the Competing Offer  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t   \t\t\t20/53  \t\t

  

and to withdraw the Songa Board Recommendation due to such Superior Proposal
and/or (ii) to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Clause 9.1(iii) in order
to pursue or enter into an acquisition or similar agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal; provided, however, that Songa Offshore shall not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Clause 9.1(iii) unless Songa Offshore has
complied with its obligations under this Clause 6 and Clause 9.1(iii). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t7\. COMPETITION FILINGS \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t7.1 The Offeror undertakes to use reasonable efforts to
ensure that any required competition approvals or clearances are obtained as
soon as reasonably possible, including by promptly as reasonably possible
carrying out all filings and applications in all relevant jurisdictions, and
complying with and responding to all requests for additional information made
by competition authorities within a reasonable time and the deadlines
specified by the relevant authorities. If and to the extent the granting of
such competition approvals or clearances is being made conditional upon the
acceptance by the Offeror of any restrictions or conditions, the Offeror shall
not be obliged to accept any such restrictions or conditions, unless clearly
insignificant in the context of (i) Transocean Ltd.'s existing business
operations in Norway or (ii) the expected benefits to Transocean Ltd. of the
Combination. Songa Offshore agrees to provide full and prompt assistance as
the Offeror reasonably requests in connection with seeking such competition
approvals or clearances, provided that in no event shall Songa Offshore be
obliged to accept any restrictions or conditions prior to completion of the
Offer in connection with such assistance to the Offeror. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t7.2 The Offeror shall coordinate all communications with the
applicable competition authorities regarding the competition approvals or
clearances referred to in Clause 7.1, and each Party shall inform the other
Party, and give it reasonable opportunity to review and provide comments and
shall consider in good faith any comments so provided by such other Party, (i)
prior to delivering any material communication to a governmental entity,
including to the initial filing, (ii) promptly after receiving any material
communication from a governmental entity, and (iii) before entering into any
proposed understanding, or agreement with any governmental entity regarding
any such filings, the Offer, or the transactions contemplated by the Offer,
except such parts of material communication, understandings or agreements
which in the Offeror's sole discretion contain confidential information not to
be disclosed to Songa Offshore (provided that the Offeror shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide such portion of the relevant
material communication, understanding or agreement to Songa Offshore in a form
and manner that would not disclose such confidential information). No Party
shall participate in any material communications (including any in-person
meeting but excluding any routine inquiries as to the status of the antitrust
review), with any governmental entity in respect of: (a) any governmental
filings or investigation or other inquiry concerning the Offer or the
underlying transactions; or (b) the resolution of any investigation of or
challenge to the Offer or the underlying transactions, in each case without
giving the other Party reasonable prior notice of the meeting (including the
subjects to be discussed). To the extent permitted by such governmental
entity, the noticing Party shall provide the noticed Party the opportunity to
attend and participate in any such meeting unless such meeting in the
Offeror's sole discretion may reveal confidential information not to be
disclosed to Songa Offshore (provided that the Offeror shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to facilitate Songa Offshore's participation in a manner
that would not result in the disclosure of such confidential information).
Nothing herein provides either Party the right to prohibit any properly
noticed material communication.  \t\t

8\. PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS, PRESS RELEASES ETC. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t8.1 Except as set forth in Clause 2.8, neither Party shall
make any public announcements in connection with the Offer without the prior
written consent of the other Party, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t8.2 Notwithstanding Clause 8.1, with respect to public
announcements in connection with the Offer: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) each Party shall be entitled to make such announcements as
are required by applicable laws, regulations or stock exchange rules, provided
that, in so far as it is lawful to do so prior to such disclosure, the
disclosing Party shall to the extent practicable consult with the other Party
on the proposed form, timing, nature and purpose of such disclosure; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) the Offeror shall be entitled to make such announcements as
it deems appropriate in response to any Competing Offer;  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iii) the Parties shall be entitled to make such announcements as
they deem appropriate if the Songa Board Recommendation is withdrawn or
modified in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; and \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iv) the Offeror shall be entitled to make such announcements as it
deems appropriate in connection with the notice of the Transocean Ltd. Meeting
to approve the Proxy Proposals, provided that, the Offeror shall consult with
Songa Offshore with respect to any such announcements and consider in good
faith any comments to such announcements provided by Songa Offshore.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tThis Agreement may be terminated: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) by the Offeror on written notice to Songa Offshore: (A) if
the Songa Board has modified or withdrawn the Songa Board Recommendation, (B)

and will not be waived by the Offeror, (E) the Pre-acceptances have not been
received; (F) following the Announcement Date, the Pre-acceptances cease to
remain for any reason in full force and effect; provided that, in the case of
this clause (F), if there are Pre-acceptances in full force and effect which

fully diluted basis at the time Offeror would terminate the Agreement, then
Offeror shall not be permitted to terminate the Agreement pursuant to this
clause (F), (G) following the Announcement Date, upon a material breach of a
Pre-acceptance by a shareholder, if such breach, if capable of being cured, is
not cured within five days of delivery of written notice of such breach by the

the Offeror (in its sole discretion) has made any findings based on its
confirmatory legal, financial, commercial and technical due diligence of Songa
Offshore that the Offeror has concluded in its sole discretion are material to
the business or the value of Songa Offshore; provided however that (x) such
due diligence shall not cover any of the items that were part of the Phase 1
Due Diligence and (y) subject to Songa Offshore's compliance with its
obligations under this Agreement relating to such due diligence (including
Clause 1.4), the Offeror may only exercise its right to terminate the

 \t\t\t(ii) by Songa Offshore on written notice to the Offeror: (A) upon

Offshore shall have breached any of its obligations under Clauses 5 and 6 in
any material respect in connection with such Superior Proposal; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iv) by either Party on written notice to the other Party: if the
Offer has not become or been declared unconditional before 11:59 p.m.,
Norwegian time, on January 31, 2018 (the "Long Stop Date"), provided however,
that (A) the right to terminate under this Clause 9.1(iv) shall not be

of the Offer to occur by the Long Stop Date and (B) the Long Stop Date may be
extended by Transocean Ltd. one time for no more than a total of 25 U.S.
business days to the extent that such extension is deemed necessary, in

confirmed the fulfilment of all other conditions for completion of the Offer
(other than under nos. 3, 4, and 9 under the item "Completion Conditions" in

"Completion Conditions" in Appendix 1, if a willful breach by Songa Offshore
of any agreement or covenant in this Agreement occurs solely on or after the
Long Stop Date, then such condition no. 10 under the item "Completion
Conditions" shall not be satisfied and, in such event, Offeror reserves all of

any event, change, fact, condition, circumstance, development, occurrence or
effect which, individually or together with any other event, change, fact,
condition, circumstance, development, occurrence or effect, has, or would
reasonably be expected to have, a material adverse effect upon (i) the
condition (financial or otherwise), business, assets, liabilities or results
of operations of Songa Offshore or Transocean Ltd., as the case may be, and
its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii) the ability of Songa Offshore or
Transocean Ltd. and the Offeror, as the case may be, to perform its

Change" shall not be deemed to include an event, change, fact, condition,
circumstance, development, occurrence or effect to the extent it relates to
(A) the announcement of the Offer and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; (B) the execution of, compliance with the terms of, or the
taking of any action required by this Agreement, or the completion of the
Offer and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (C) any
change in accounting requirements or principles or any change of laws of
general applicability or the interpretation thereof, except to the extent
disproportionally affecting Songa Offshore or Transocean Ltd., as the case may
be, relative to peer companies operating in the industry, (D) changes in
financial markets, interest rates, exchange rates, commodity prices or, except
to the extent that such matters have an impact on Songa Offshore or Transocean
Ltd., as the case may be, that to a material extent is disproportionate to the
effect on other peer companies operating in the industry, other general
economic conditions, (E) share price fluctuations or changes in third-party
analyst estimates or projections (provided that the underlying cause of any
such fluctuation or change may be considered in determining whether or not a
Material Adverse Change has occurred or would reasonably be expected to occur
to the extent not included in another exception herein), (F) acts of war,

information or audit statements solely due to conversion of financial
statements from IFRS to U.S. GAAP as part of the preparation or furnishing of
information pursuant to Clause 2.14 above (provided that the underlying cause
of any such changes (such as errors in accounting or material omissions) may
be considered in determining whether or not a Material Adverse Change has
occurred or would reasonably be expected to occur to the extent not included
in another exception herein).  \t\t

 \t\t\t9.2 Effect of Termination \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tIn the event that this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to
Clause 9.1, written notice thereof shall be given to the other Party or
Parties, specifying the provisions hereof pursuant to which such valid
termination is made and describing the basis therefor in reasonable detail,
and subject to compliance with this Clause 9 and Clause 10, this Agreement
shall forthwith become null and void and of no further force or effect
whatsoever without liability on the part of any Party hereto, and all rights
and obligations of any Party hereto shall cease; provided, however, that,
notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary (a) no such valid
termination shall relieve any Party hereto of any liability or damages
resulting from or arising out of fraud or any willful breach of this
Agreement; and (b) Clauses 8, 11, 12 and 15 and the definitions of all defined
terms appearing in such clauses shall survive any valid termination of this
Agreement pursuant to this Clause 9.2. For purposes of the foregoing,
"willful breach" shall mean a material breach that is a consequence of either
(i) an act knowingly undertaken by the breaching Party with the intent of
causing a breach of this Agreement or (ii) an act knowingly undertaken by the
breaching Party that was reasonably likely to result in a breach of this
Agreement (even if a breach of this Agreement was not the conscious object of
such act) and which in fact does cause a breach of this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tFor the avoidance of doubt, a valid termination of this Agreement will
have no effect on the validity or effectiveness of the irrevocable Pre-
acceptances given pursuant to Clause 1.5 and Appendix 5 to this Agreement
other than as explicitly set out therein, unless the Offer lapses due to any
of the Offeror's conditions for completing the Offer pursuant to Appendix 1 to
this Agreement becoming incapable of satisfaction and such condition is not
waived by the Offeror. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t10. SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t10.1 The Parties agree that if any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur, no adequate remedy at law
would exist and damages would be difficult to determine, and that the Parties
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to specific performance of the terms hereof, with the courts of
Oslo, Norway, as agreed exclusive legal venue, without necessity of posting
bond or other security (any requirements therefor being expressly waived).
 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t11. NOTICES \t\t

internationally recognised courier, to the address set out in this Clause 11
and in each case marked for the attention of the relevant Party set out in

 \t\t

original, but all of which together constitute one and the same
instrument. \t\t

agreement of the Parties. \t\t

 \t\t

and as of the completion of the Offer, to the other Party, that (a) it has

in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy insolvency and
other similar laws affecting the enforceability of creditors' rights
generally, general equitable principles and the discretion of course in
granting equitable remedies.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t14. FURTHER REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t14.1 Songa Offshore represents and warrants to Offeror, as of
the date hereof and as of the completion of the Offer, as follows: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t14.1.1 Songa Offshore has been duly organized and is validly
existing as a European public company limited by shares (or societas
europaea), duly registered and validly existing under the laws of Cyprus and
has corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and
to conduct its business as presently conducted. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t14.1.2 The only subsidiaries of Songa Offshore are those listed
in Appendix 9 to this Agreement, and Songa Offshore does not own any capital
stock, shares or other equity or similar interests in any other Person (as
defined below).  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t14.1.3 Since December 31, 2016 and except as has been publicly
disclosed in filings with the Oslo Børs, there has not occurred any Material
Adverse Change with respect to Songa Offshore. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t14.1.4 No action, suit or proceeding by or before any Governmental
Authority (as defined below) or any arbitrator involving Songa Offshore or any
of its subsidiaries or its or their property or assets is pending or, to the
best knowledge of Songa Offshore, threatened, other than those that would not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Change with respect to
Songa Offshore or which have been publicly disclosed. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t14.1.5 Except as previously disclosed by Songa Offshore to Offeror
prior to the date hereof, neither Songa Offshore nor any of its subsidiaries
has incurred any obligations or contingent obligations to brokers or similar
parties in connection with the Offer.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t14.1.6 Songa Offshore and its subsidiaries possess such permits,
licenses, approvals, consents and other authorizations (collectively,
"Governmental Licenses") issued by the appropriate Governmental Authorities
necessary to conduct the business contemplated to be operated by them; all of
the Governmental Licenses are valid and in full force and effect, except when
the invalidity of such Governmental Licenses or the failure of such
Governmental Licenses to be in full force and effect would not have a Material
Adverse Change; and neither Songa Offshore nor any of its subsidiaries has
received any notice of proceedings relating to the revocation or modification
of any such Governmental Licenses which, singly or in the aggregate, if the
subject of an unfavorable decision, ruling or finding, would reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Change. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t14.1.7 Except as previously disclosed by Songa Offshore to Offeror
prior to the date hereof, no consent, approval, authorization, filing with or
order of any Governmental Authority is required for Songa Offshore to enter
into and consummate this Agreement, or for Songa Offshore to perform its
obligations as set out herein.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t14.1.8 Each Songa Material Contract (as defined below) is in full
force and effect and Songa Offshore and each of its subsidiaries have
performed all obligations required to be performed by them to date under each
such contract to which it is a party, except where such failure to be binding
or in full force and effect or such failure to perform does not and is not
reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Change. Except for such
matters as do not and are not reasonably likely to result in a Material
Adverse Change, neither Songa Offshore nor any of its subsidiaries (x) knows
of, or has received written notice of, any breach of or violation or  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t   \t\t\t29/53  \t\t

  

default under (nor, to the knowledge of Songa Offshore, does there exist any
condition which with the passage of time or the giving of notice or both would
result in such a violation or default under) any Songa Material Contract or
(y) has received written notice of the desire of the other party or parties to
any such Songa Material Contract to cancel, terminate, modify or repudiate
such contract or exercise remedies thereunder. Except as would not be
reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Change, the completion of
the Offer and the transactions contemplated thereby will not breach or violate
any Songa Material Contract or permit any other party to a Songa Material
Contract to exercise rights adverse to Songa Offshore or any of its
subsidiaries. Each Songa Material Contract is enforceable by Songa Offshore or
a subsidiary of Songa Offshore in accordance with its terms, subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar
laws relating to creditors' rights and general principles of equity
(regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding at law or
in equity), except where such unenforceability is not reasonably likely to
result in a Material Adverse Change.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t14.1.9 Songa Offshore, its subsidiaries and each of their
respective Relevant Persons (as defined below) have not ever directly or
indirectly violated or taken any act in furtherance of violating any anti-
corruption or anti-bribery Laws applicable to any of Songa Offshore or any of
its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Anti-Corruption Laws").  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tNone of Songa Offshore, its subsidiaries or their respective Relevant
Persons have ever directly or indirectly taken any act in furtherance of any
payment, gift, bribe, rebate, loan, payoff, kickback or any other transfer of
value - or offer, promise or authorization thereof - to any Person (as defined
below), including any Government Official (as defined below), for the purpose
of: (i) improperly influencing or inducing such Person to do or omit to do
any act or to make any decision in an official capacity or in violation of a
lawful duty; (ii) inducing such Person to influence improperly his or her or
its employer, public or private, or any Governmental Authority, to affect an
act or decision of such employer or Governmental Authority, including to
assist any Person in obtaining or retaining business; or (iii) securing any
improper advantage (e.g., to obtain a tax rate lower than allowed by
applicable Law).  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tThere is no dispute, allegation, request for information, notice of
potential liability, or any other action regarding any actual or possible
violation by any of Songa Offshore or its subsidiaries of any Anti-Corruption
Law pending or, to the knowledge of Songa Offshore, threatened against any of
Songa Offshore or any of its subsidiaries.  \t\t

 \t\t\t\t\t\tTransocean Ltd., its wholly owned subsidiary Transocean Inc. (a
Cayman Islands exempted company) or a wholly owned direct or indirect
subsidiary of Transocean Ltd. (such company or companies, the "Offeror").
Settlement of any Offer made by any subsidiary of

Offshore").

 \t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t\t\tOffer Consideration

 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t|  \t\t\t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t\t\tThe Offeror shall offer (the "Offer") to exchange each share of
Songa Offshore (the "Songa Shares") for a consideration consisting of a
combination of (i) newly issued registered shares of Transocean Ltd. at par
value CHF 0.10 each (the "Consideration Shares"), (ii) senior unsecured
exchangeable bonds convertible into shares in Transocean Ltd. (the "Notes"),
and (iii) at the election of the holder of such Songa Share, cash as provided
below (the value of any cash and the value of the aggregate number of
Consideration Shares and Notes to be delivered per Songa Share, the "Offer
Price"). The Offer shall in all material respects be on the terms and subject
to the closing conditions set out in this Appendix 1 to the Transaction
Agreement (the "Agreement"), provided that one or more of such closing
conditions may be waived by the Offeror as set out in this Appendix 1. The
Offer Price shall be equal to NOK 47.50 per Songa Share and settled in
Consideration Shares and Notes. The value of each Consideration Share will be
determined based on the closing price of the RIG Shares on New York Stock
Exchange (the "NYSE") at 10:00 pm CET (4:00 pm EST) and the NOK/USD closing
price at 4:00 pm CET as determined by Norges Bank, each on the trading day
immediately preceding the announcement of the Offer (such price the "RIG
Closing Price"), and the value of each Note delivered in the Offer will be the
nominal amount of such Consideration CB. Each Songa Offshore shareholder may
elect to sell Songa Shares in the Offer for cash consideration per Songa Share
equal to the Offer Price for a total amount per Songa Shareholder of up to NOK
125,000 (the "Cash Election") (to avoid doubt, this shall mean that any Songa
Shareholder holding Songa Shares valued at less than NOK 125,000 based on the
Offer Price may choose to receive 100% settlement in cash). The number of
Consideration Shares and the number of Notes issued to each Songa Offshore
shareholder who accepts the Offer will be rounded down to the nearest whole
number of Consideration Shares or Notes, as applicable. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the

participating in the Offer shall be comprised, as near as possible, of 50%
Consideration Shares and 50% Notes, with any exercise by such shareholder of
the Cash Election being deducted first from the aggregate number of Notes
issued to such shareholder and second to the aggregate number of Consideration
Shares issued to such shareholder.

 \t\t\t\t\t\tHigher Consideration

 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t|  \t\t\t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t\t\tThe Offeror and any entity wholly owned directly or indirectly
by Transocean Ltd. shall not directly or indirectly acquire or enter into any
agreement to acquire Songa Shares (in the open market or in privately
negotiated transactions or otherwise) following announcement of the
contemplated Offer until (i) the lapsing or withdrawal of the Offer or (ii)
the completion of the Offer as contemplated by the Offer Document or, if
relevant, expiry of a subsequent mandatory offer, at a consideration higher
than the Offer Price, without increasing the Offer Price so as to be at least
equal to such higher consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Offer
Price shall not be increased pursuant to this section as a result of (i) the
payment of cash consideration (including the effect of any change in currency
exchange rates) in any subsequent mandatory offer in accordance with the
minimum offer price requirements as decided by Oslo Børs, (ii) share price
fluctuations during or after the Offer Period, or (iii) the application of
calculation principles by the Oslo Børs or any other governmental or
regulatory authority to any subsequent mandatory offer that differs from the
calculation principles specified in "Offer Consideration" above.

 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t 
 \t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t\t\tBlocking of tendered Songa Shares

 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t|  \t\t\t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t\t\tBy delivering a duly executed acceptance form, shareholders give
the receiving agent (the "Receiving Agent") an authorisation to block the
Songa Shares to which the acceptance form relates, in favour of the Receiving
Agent. The Receiving Agent is at the same time authorised to transfer such
Songa Shares to the Offeror against settlement of the cash pursuant to the
Cash Election and/or Consideration Shares and Notes at completion of the
Offer. In the event the Offer is cancelled, the blocking will be terminated.
It is not possible for the shareholder to dispose over the Songa Shares when
they are blocked. The shareholder is free to dispose over any other securities
registered in the same VPS-account as the blocked Songa Shares.

Offshore's shareholders.

 \t\t\t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t\t\tUnless the Agreement has been terminated in accordance with

to) extend the Offer for any period required by applicable U.S. federal
securities laws and the rules and regulations of the SEC and its staff with
respect thereto, NYSE, the Oslo Børs, applicable Norwegian law or applicable
laws and regulations of Cyprus, in each case, applicable to the Offer (but in
no event shall the Offeror be required to extend the Offer past the Long Stop
Date (as extended)) and (B) if at any scheduled date of expiration of the
Offer, the closing conditions set forth under the item "Completion Conditions"
below shall not have been satisfied or earlier waived, the Offeror may elect
to, and if reasonably requested by Songa Offshore, shall (and Transocean Ltd.
shall cause the Offeror to), extend the Offer to a date that is not more than
ten (10) U.S. business days after such previously scheduled date of
expiration; provided, however, that if, as of any date of expiration, the
closing conditions set forth under nos. 1 or 2 under the item "Completion
Conditions" below shall not have been satisfied, if the Offeror elects to, or
if Songa Offshore reasonably requests the Offeror to, extend the Offer
pursuant to sub-clause (B) of this sentence, the Offeror shall, subject to
applicable legal restrictions and applicable law, extend the Offer to a date
that is not more than twenty (20) U.S. business days after the then-scheduled
date of expiration (but which may in no event be later than the Long Stop Date
(as extended)).

 \t\t\t\t\t\tCompletion Conditions

 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t|  \t\t\t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t\t\tThe completion of the Offer shall be subject to the satisfaction
of the conditions set out below (the "Completion Conditions"), each one of
which may be waived by the Offeror fully or partly (at the Offeror's sole
discretion), provided, however that (1) can only be waived to the extent the
Offeror has received acceptances for more than 63% of the total share capital
of Songa Offshore on a fully diluted basis and (2), (6), (7), (8) or (11) can
only be waived with the prior written consent of Songa Offshore; provided,
further that, (12) shall only be a condition to the completion of the Offer on
or prior to September 17, 2017 (subject to Songa Offshore's compliance with
its obligations under the Agreement relating to such due diligence (including
Clause 1.4)):

 \t\t\t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t\t\t1.On or prior to the expiration of the Offer Period,
shareholders shall in the aggregate have accepted the Offer subject to the
terms and conditions of the Offer Document for a number of shares representing

bonds and other Songa Offshore securities convertible into or otherwise giving
rights to new shares in Songa have been exercised in full regardless of the
conditions for such exercise), and the same amount of votes which can be
exercised in the general meeting of Songa Offshore, and such acceptances shall
remain valid and binding.

 \t\t\t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t\t\t2.Any governmental, regulatory or other official approval and/or
clearance, under any applicable laws or regulations, which are necessary for
the completion of the Offer and the transactions contemplated hereunder, shall
have been duly obtained without any conditions, unless clearly insignificant
in the context of (i) Offeror's existing business operations in Norway or (ii)
the expected benefits to Transocean Ltd. of the Combination.

 \t\t\t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t\t\t3.No court or other governmental or regulatory authority of
competent jurisdiction shall have taken any form of legal action (whether
temporary, preliminary, or permanent) that restrains or prohibits the
completion of the Offer or shall in connection with the Offer have imposed
conditions upon the Offeror, Songa Offshore or any of their respective
subsidiaries, that the Offeror in its sole discretion determines to be unduly
burdensome.

 \t\t\t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t\t\t4.In the period from the announcement of the contemplated Offer
until the settlement of the Offer there shall have been no changes or
decisions to make changes to the share capital of Songa Offshore or its
subsidiaries other than issuances of shares as required by the exercise of
warrants or options or the conversion of convertible bonds and/or exercise of
any other Songa Offshore securities, which are made in accordance with the
terms of such agreements (which have been provided to the Offeror prior to the
entering into of the Agreement or the terms of which are otherwise publicly
available) underlying such warrants, options, convertible bonds and/or other
Songa Securities and no issue or decision to issue any rights which entitle
the holder to any form of equity interest in Songa Offshore or its
subsidiaries, and Songa Offshore shall not have declared or made any dividends
or other forms of distributions, in each case from the date of announcement of
the contemplated Offer.

 \t\t\t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t|  \t\t\t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t\t\tIf the Issuer is required by law to withhold any tax from any
payment in respect of the Bonds under the Finance Documents as a result of a
change in applicable law implemented after the date of the Bond terms, the
Issuer will have the right to offer to redeem all of the Bonds at a price
equal to 100 % of the Nominal Amount (the "Tax Event Put Offer"). The Issuer
shall give written notice of such offer to the Bond Trustee and the
Bondholders at least 20 business days prior to the relevant repayment date,
provided that no such notice shall be given earlier than 60 days prior to the
earliest date on which the Issuer would be obliged to withhold such tax were a
payment in respect of the Bonds then due. If the Issuer determines to make
such Tax Event Put Offer, all Bonds remaining outstanding after the relevant
repayment date shall no longer be subject to the tax gross-up provision set
forth under "Tax Gross-up" set forth above.

 \t\t\t\t\t\tThe Indenture shall include provisions on the Bond Trustee's
right to represent the Bondholders, including a customary "no action" clause,
meaning that no individual Bondholder may take any legal action against the
Issuer individually other than as permitted under the Indenture (as further
described in the Indenture). The Indenture will further contain provisions
regulating the duties of the Bond Trustee, procedures for obtaining
Bondholders' consents and applicable requirements for Bondholders' consent,
whereas a sufficient majority of Bondholders may materially amend the
provision of the Indenture or discharge the Bonds in part or in full without
the consent of all Bondholders, other than in respect of specified customary
terms requiring consent of each affected Bondholder (including those specified
in the Existing Unsecured Indenture and the rights described under
"Fundamental Change Events"), as well as other provisions customary for a bond
offering as described herein. Concurrently with any Tax Event Put Offer,
Bondholders shall have the right to exchange their Bonds at a decreased
exchange price calculated using the formula for reducing the exchange price in
connection with a Change of Control Event.

exemptions under the laws of any other jurisdiction. The applicable exemption
for any Bonds offered and sold as part consideration for the Issuer\'s
acquisition of the shares in Songa Offshore SE or in settlement (or partial

any related transfer restrictions, remain to be determined. Notwithstanding

Bondholder must ensure compliance with local laws and regulations applicable
at own cost and expense.

 \t\t\t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t\t\t(ii)Notwithstanding the above, a Bondholder which has purchased
the Bonds in contradiction to mandatory restrictions applicable may
nevertheless utilize its voting rights under the Bond terms provided that the
Issuer shall not incur any additional liability by complying with its
obligations to such Bondholder.

 \t\t\t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t\t\t(iii)Bondholders that are affiliates of the Issuer or Parent may
