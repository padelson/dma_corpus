Agreement to include provisions that implement an economic close "locked-
box" system that has a "locked-box date" effective as of 11:59 p.m. New York
time on August 31, 2018.

  



  

Section 2.5 _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

  



  

(a) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
deliver to Parent its calculation of the Purchase Price, together
with Purchaser's good faith proposed calculations of (i) the Working Capital
Adjustment, (ii) Closing Indebtedness, (iii) Closing Date Cash and (iv)
Closing Date Transaction Expenses, in each case, including the components
thereof and in accordance with IFRS and consistent with past practices and
the definitions thereof (which calculations shall collectively be referred to
herein from time to time as the " _Proposed Closing Date Calculations "_); it
being acknowledged and agreed that in order to avoid duplication, no
individual item or amount shall be taken into account in more than one of the
components of the Proposed Closing Date Calculations (or more than once in
any individual component of the Proposed Closing Date Calculation above) in
calculating the Proposed Closing Date Calculations. During the thirty (30)
day period immediately following delivery to Parent of the Proposed Closing
Date Calculations, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Transferred Entities
to, provide Parent and Parent's accountants, advisors and other
representatives with reasonable access during normal business hours to the
books and records (to the extent in the possession or control of Purchaser or
one of its Subsidiaries) to the extent relevant to the preparation of the
Proposed Closing Date Calculations and to the personnel employed by Purchaser
responsible for the preparation of the Proposed Closing Date Calculations in
order to respond to the inquiries of Parent related thereto, (x) Parent and
its accountants, advisors and other representatives shall execute any
customary releases or waivers in favor of Purchaser's and the Transferred
Entities' professional advisors in connection with such review and (y) such
review shall not interfere in any material respect with the normal business
operations of Purchaser or the Transferred Entities.

  



  

(b) Parent may dispute the amounts reflected on the line items of
the Proposed Closing Date Calculations (each, a " _Disputed Item_ "), but
only on the basis of (i) mathematical errors, or (ii) the Proposed Closing
Date Calculations not being calculated in accordance with Section 2.5(a);
_provided_ , _however_ , that in each case Parent shall notify Purchaser in
writing of each Disputed Item, and specify in reasonable detail the amount
thereof in dispute and the basis therefor, within thirty (30) days after
the Proposed Closing Date Calculations has been delivered to Parent. The
failure by Parent to provide a notice of Disputed Items to Purchaser within
such period will constitute Parent's final and binding acceptance of all items
in the Proposed Closing Date Calculations. Only those matters identified in a
timely delivered notice of Disputed Items shall be in dispute, and all other
matters included in the Proposed Closing Date Calculations shall be final and
binding upon the Parties.

  



    

 | -23-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) If a notice of Disputed Items shall be timely delivered pursuant
to Section 2.5(b), Parent and Purchaser shall, during the twenty (20)
Business Days following the date of such delivery (the " _Resolution Period_
"), negotiate in good faith to resolve the Disputed Items. If, during the
Resolution Period, the Parties reach an agreement with respect to the Disputed
Items, such agreement shall be evidenced in writing and the Proposed Closing
Date Calculations (as revised pursuant to such written agreement) shall
become final and binding on the date of such agreement. If, during the
Resolution Period, the Parties are unable to reach agreement with respect to
any of the Disputed Items, Parent and Purchaser shall refer all unresolved
Disputed Items to Ernst and Young or such other accounting firm upon which
Parent and Purchaser shall mutually agree (the " _Independent Accountant_
"). Parent and Purchaser agree to cooperate with the Independent Accountant
during its resolution of the Disputed Items (including by entering into a
customary engagement letter with the Independent Accountant). In resolving
such objections, the Independent Accountant shall only consider those items
in dispute as set forth in the Proposed Closing Date Calculations and
Parent's timely notice of Disputed Items, and shall be instructed to
otherwise not investigate matters independently. None of Purchaser, Parent,
Seller or any of their respective Affiliates shall have any _ex parte_
communications with the Independent Accountant. Parent and Purchaser shall
request that the Independent Accountant make a determination, acting as an
expert and not as an arbitrator, with respect to unresolved Disputed Items
within thirty (30) days after its engagement by Parent and Purchaser, which
determination shall be made in accordance with the rules set forth in this
Section 2.5. The Parties agree that the failure of the Independent Accountant
to strictly conform to any deadline or time period contained herein shall not
render the determination of the Independent Accountant invalid and shall not
be a basis for seeking to overturn any determination rendered by the
Independent Accountant. The Independent Accountant shall deliver to Parent
and Purchaser, within such thirty (30) day period, a written report setting
forth (i) its adjustments, if any, to the Proposed Closing Date Calculations,
and (ii) the calculations supporting such adjustment of the Closing
Indebtedness, the Working Capital Adjustment, the Closing Date Cash, the
Closing Date Transaction Expenses and the Purchase Price. Absent manifest
error, such report shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties and
the Parties agree that the procedures set forth in this Section 2.5 for
resolving disputes with respect to the Proposed Closing Date
Calculations shall be the sole and exclusive method for resolving such
disputes unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Parties. In
resolving all Disputed Items submitted to it in accordance with this Section
2.5, the Independent Accountant shall not assign a value to any item that is
greater than or less than the value that was claimed by either Party. Parent
and Purchaser shall initially share equally all costs incurred in connection
with the engagement of the Independent Accountant; _provided_ that such costs
shall ultimately be allocated between Purchaser and Parent in the same
proportion that the aggregate amount of the Disputed Items submitted to the
Independent Accountant that are unsuccessfully disputed by each such Party (as
finally determined by the Independent Accountant in accordance with this
Section 2.5(c)) bears to the total amount of such Disputed Items so submitted.

  



    

 | -24-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) If the Purchase Price as reflected in the Agreed Closing Date
Calculations is less than the Estimated Purchase Price, then Parent and
Seller, jointly and severally, shall pay to Purchaser, the amount of such
shortfall in accordance with Section 2.5(e). If the Purchase Price as
reflected in the Agreed Closing Date Calculations is greater than the
Estimated Purchase Price, then Purchaser and the Transferred Entities,
jointly and severally, shall pay to Parent the amount of the excess in
accordance with Section 2.5(e).

  



  

(e) All payments to be made under Section 2.5(d) will be paid or
caused to be paid by the Party obligated to make such payment under
this Section 2.5 (the "Paying Party") to the other Party (the "Receiving
Party"), for itself and as agent for its Affiliates (as applicable), within
ten (10) Business Days after the determination of the Agreed Closing Date
Calculations, in dollars by wire transfer of immediately available funds,
without interest, in accordance with written instructions given by the
Receiving Party to the Paying Party (which instructions shall be provided by
the Receiving Party promptly, and no later than three (3) Business Days,
after the determination of the Agreed Closing Date Calculations (or such later
time as may be agreed by Parent and Purchaser)).

  



  

Section 2.6 _Withholding_. Purchaser and each Transferred Entity
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amount payable pursuant to
this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld under
applicable Tax law; _provided_ , _however_ , that if Purchaser determines that
any such withholding is required, Purchaser shall provide the Parent and the
Seller written notice to that effect at least three (3) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date, and the Parties shall cooperate in good faith to minimize
any such withholding, provided that no such notification shall be required to
the extent such deduction or withholding is in respect of any payroll or
employment Taxes. Amounts withheld pursuant to this Section 2.6 and timely
paid to the appropriate taxing authority shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

Purchaser Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to have been disclosed with
respect to any section or subsection of this Agreement to which the relevance

Section 4.1 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_.
Purchaser is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
Laws of the jurisdiction of its organization or incorporation, and has all
requisite corporate or other organizational power and authority to own, lease
and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now
being conducted and is qualified to do business and is in good standing as a
foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or
operation of its properties or assets or conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except, where the failure to be so qualified or in good
standing would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate
(a) prevent, materially impede or delay the consummation of the Transactions
or (b) have a material adverse effect on Purchaser's ability to perform its
obligations under this Agreement.

  



  

Section 4.2 _Authority Relative to this Agreement_. Purchaser has
all necessary corporate or other power and authority, and has taken all
corporate or other action necessary, to execute, deliver and perform this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and to consummate the Transactions in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and such Ancillary Agreements,
except the Purchaser Stockholder Approval. This Agreement has been, and each
Ancillary Agreement to which Purchaser is a party when executed and delivered
will be, as applicable, duly and validly executed and delivered by Purchaser
and, assuming the due authorization (including the Purchaser Stockholder
Approval), execution and delivery of this Agreement or such Ancillary
Agreements by Seller and the other parties thereto, constitutes (or when so
executed and delivered shall constitute) a valid, legal and binding
agreement of Purchaser, enforceable against Purchaser in accordance with its
terms, subject, as to the enforcement of remedies, to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws
of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to
general equity principles. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority
of the issued and outstanding shares of Purchaser's capital stock entitled to
vote thereon to approve issuance of equity in connection with the
Transactions (the " _Purchaser Stockholder Approval_ ") is the only vote,
approval or consent of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of
Purchaser that is necessary in connection with the consummation of the
Transactions. Purchaser has delivered to Seller, concurrent with the
execution of this Agreement, a voting agreement with respect to the
Purchaser Stockholder Approval in favor of Parent representing 44.9% of the
issued and outstanding capital stock of Purchaser entitled to vote on the
Purchaser Stockholder Approval.

  



  

Section 4.3 _Consents and Approvals; No Violations_. No filing
with or notice to, and no permit, authorization, registration, consent or
approval of, any Governmental Entity is required on the part of Purchaser for
the execution, delivery and performance by Purchaser of this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements to which Purchaser is a party or the consummation by
Purchaser of the Transactions, except compliance with the applicable
requirements of any applicable Antitrust Laws. Assuming compliance with
the item described in the preceding sentence, neither the execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements to which
Purchaser is a party by Purchaser nor the consummation by Purchaser of the
Transactions will (a) conflict with or result in any breach, violation or
infringement of any provision of the respective articles of incorporation or
bylaws (or similar governing documents) of Purchaser, (b) result in a breach,
violation or infringement of, or constitute (with or without due notice or
lapse of time or both) a default (or give rise to the creation of any Lien,
except for Permitted Liens, or any right of termination, amendment,
cancellation or acceleration), give rise to a loss of benefit, or give rise to
a purchase right, under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any
material Contract to which Purchaser is a party or by which any of them or any
of its properties or assets may be bound or (c) violate, give rise to a loss
of benefit under or infringe any Law applicable to Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets, except in the
cases of clauses (b) and (c), for such breaches, violations, infringements or
Liens that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, (i) prevent, materially impede or delay the consummation of the
Transactions or (ii) have a material adverse effect on Purchaser's ability to
perform its obligations under this Agreement.

any other repayment or refinancing of debt in connection with the Sale,
payment of all amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation

Section 4.5 _Financing_. Purchaser has delivered to Seller true
and complete copies of the executed commitment letters and redacted fee
letters, each dated as of the date hereof, between Purchaser and each of Ares
Capital Management LLC and HPS Investment Partners, LLC and (y) Purchaser and
GSO Capital Partners LP (such agreements, as may be modified pursuant to, and
in accordance with, Section 5.14, the " _Debt Commitment Letters_ "),
pursuant to which each of Ares Capital Management LLC, HPS Investment
Partners, LLC and GSO Capital Partners LP have agreed, subject to the terms
and express conditions thereof, to provide Purchaser with debt financing in
the amounts set forth therein (the " _Debt Financing_ ") for the purpose of
funding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to occur at Closing
and paying related fees and expenses. Each of the Debt Commitment Letters, in
the form so delivered, is in full force and effect and is a legal, valid and
binding obligation of Purchaser and, to the knowledge of Purchaser, the other
parties thereto, in each case, except as such enforceability may be limited by
(a) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws
affecting or relating to creditors' rights generally and (b) the availability
of injunctive relief and other equitable remedies. The Debt Commitment
Letters have not been amended, supplemented or otherwise modified in any
respect prior to the date of this Agreement, and the respective commitments to
fund the Debt Financing thereunder have not been withdrawn, terminated or
rescinded in any respect prior to the date of this Agreement. As of the date
hereof, there are not any facts, events or other occurrences that make any of
the representations and warranties of Purchaser in any Debt Commitment Letter
inaccurate in any material respect (or in any respect with regard to amounts
and availability of funds, including conditionality). The obligations to make
the Debt Financing available to Purchaser pursuant to the terms of the Debt
Commitment Letters are not subject to any conditions precedent, other than as
expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters. As of the date of
this Agreement, there are no contracts or other agreements, arrangements or
understandings (whether oral or written) or commitments to enter into
agreements, arrangements or understandings (whether oral or written) to which
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates is a party related to the Debt Financing,
other than as expressly contained in the Debt Commitment Letters and delivered
to Seller prior to the date hereof, that could adversely affect the
conditionality, enforceability, availability and/or initial funding of the
Debt Financing at Closing. Purchaser has fully paid any and all commitment
fees or other fees required by the Debt Commitment Letters to be paid
thereunder on or prior to the date of this Agreement. No event has occurred
which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would
reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach on the part of
Purchaser under any of the Debt Commitment Letters. Assuming (x) the Debt
Financing is funded in accordance with the Debt Commitment Letters and (y)
the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 8.2 hereof, Purchaser
will have on the Closing Date funds sufficient to pay all amounts required to
be paid by Purchaser hereunder and under the Debt Commitment Letter in order
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby to occur on the Closing
Date (the " _Required Amount_ ").

entitled to any brokerage, finder's or other fee or commission to be paid by
Purchaser in connection with the Transactions based upon arrangements made by
or on behalf of Purchaser.

  



  

Section 4.7 _Acquisition of Purchased Units for Investment_.
Purchaser is purchasing the Purchased Units for investment for its own
account and not with a view to, or for sale in connection with, any
distribution thereof, except such views that would not cause Purchaser to be
considered an "underwriter" within the meaning of the Securities Act.
Purchaser (either alone or together with its advisors) has sufficient
knowledge and experience in financial and business matters so as to be
capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its investment in the Purchased
Units to the extent of the materials and information provided by Seller and
its Representatives to Purchaser and its Representatives and is capable of
bearing the economic risks of such investment.

business, operations, assets, Liabilities, results of operations, financial
condition and prospects of the Business, acknowledges that it and its
Representatives have been provided adequate access to the personnel,
properties, assets, premises, books and records, and other documents and data
of Seller and Parent for such purpose. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that
(a) in making its decision to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, Purchaser has relied solely upon its own
investigation and the express representations and warranties of Seller and
Parent set forth in Article IV of this Agreement (including related portions
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule) and of Seller and Parent in the Ancillary
Agreements and (b) neither Seller nor any other Person has made any
representation or warranty as to the Business, the Purchased Units, the
Purchased Assets, the Transferred Entities or this Agreement, except as
expressly set forth in Article IV of this Agreement (including the related
portions of the Seller Disclosure Schedule) and the other Ancillary
Agreements. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, the
Business, the Purchased Units, the Purchased Assets, the Transferred Entities
and the assets and properties of the Transferred Entities are furnished "AS
IS," "WHERE IS" AND, SUBJECT TO THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT
AND SELLER CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT ANY OTHER
REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ORAL
OR WRITTEN, AND IN PARTICULAR, WITHOUT ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION
AS TO CONDITION, MERCHANTABILITY OR SUITABILITY AS TO ANY OF THE PURCHASED
ASSETS OR THE ASSETS OR PROPERTIES OF THE TRANSFERRED ENTITIES. Purchaser
acknowledges that, except for the representations and warranties contained in
Article IV and in the Ancillary Agreements, neither Seller, Parent nor any
other person has made, and Purchaser has not relied on any other express or
implied representation or warranty, whether written or oral, by or on behalf
of Seller or Parent. Purchaser acknowledges that neither Seller, Parent nor
any other Person, directly or indirectly, has made, and Purchaser has not
relied on, any representation or warranty, including with respect to accuracy
or completeness, regarding pro-forma financial information, financial models
or modeling tools, budgets, financial projections or any other forward-looking
statements with respect to the Business or generated by any of Seller, Parent
or their respective Affiliates or Representatives, and Purchaser will make no
claim with respect thereto.

release, shall agree to substitute itself in the place of Seller, Parent and

Schedule by written notice to Purchaser no more than three (3) Business Days

Section 5.14 _Financing_.

  



  

(a) Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange, and close concurrently with
the Closing, the Debt Financing on and subject to the terms and conditions
described in the Debt Commitment Letters, including using commercially
reasonable efforts (i) to negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with
respect to the Debt Financing on the terms (including, to the extent required
by the Debt Financing Sources, the "market flex" provisions) and subject only
to the conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letters, (ii) to satisfy
on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Purchaser in such definitive
agreements, (iii) to comply with its obligations under the Debt Commitment
Letters and (iv) assuming all conditions precedent in the Debt Commitment
Letters have been satisfied (or duly waived), consummate or cause the
consummation of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letters at the Closing. Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
refrain from taking, directly or indirectly, any action that is reasonably
likely to result in the failure of any of the conditions contained in the Debt
Commitment Letters or in any definitive agreement related to the Debt
Financing to be satisfied (or duly waived) or the Debt Financing to be
available concurrently with the Closing. Purchaser shall give Parent prompt
notice upon becoming aware of any fact that would reasonably be expected to
give rise to any material breach by any party to the Debt Commitment Letters
or any breach that could impact the amount or availability of financing.
Purchaser shall, upon the reasonable request of Parent, provide Parent on a
prompt basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange
the Debt Financing and shall not permit any amendment or modification to be
made to, or any waiver of any material provision or remedy under, the Debt
Commitment Letters if such amendment, modification, waiver or remedy would
reasonably be expected to impact or delay in any material respect the ability
of Purchaser to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. For the
avoidance of doubt, Purchaser (x) may agree to or permit any amendment,
supplement or other modification of, or waive any of its rights under, any
Debt Commitment Letters or any definitive agreements related to the Debt
Financing to the extent such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver
would not (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (or the cash
proceeds available therefrom) below the Required Amount, (ii) impose any
material new or additional conditions precedent to the availability and/or
initial funding of the Debt Financing, or adversely amend or modify any of the
existing conditions precedent thereto, in a manner that would reasonably be
expected to result in any of the conditions precedent set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letters not being satisfied, or the Debt Financing not being
available to the Purchaser, on the Closing Date or (iii) otherwise reasonably
be expected to materially prevent, delay or impair the availability of any of
the Debt Financing or the ability of Purchaser to obtain the Debt Financing
in order to consummate the Transactions at Closing, in each case, as compared
to the Debt Commitment Letters as in effect on the date hereof and (y) shall
not terminate, or permit the termination of, any Debt Commitment
Letter, unless such Debt Commitment Letter is replaced with a new commitment
in accordance with paragraph (b) below that, were it structured as an
amendment to an existing Debt Commitment Letter, would satisfy the
requirements of the foregoing clause (x). Upon any such amendment, supplement
or modification of any Debt Commitment Letters in accordance with this Section
5.14(a), Purchaser shall provide a copy thereof to Seller, and references to
the "Debt Commitment Letters" shall include such documents as permitted to be
amended, supplemented or modified under this Section 5.14(a), and references
to the "Debt Financing" shall include the financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letters as permitted to be amended, supplemented or modified under
this Section 5.14(a).

  



  

   

 | -60-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the
terms and conditions (including the "market flex" provisions) contemplated in
the Debt Commitment Letters, Purchaser shall promptly notify Parent and shall
and Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use best efforts to
obtain, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event,
replacement commitments in amounts and on terms that will enable Purchaser to
consummate the Transactions at Closing; _provided_ that the terms of any such
replacement commitments (i) shall not be reasonably likely to materially
impair or delay the availability and/or funding of the Debt Financing or the
Closing and (ii) shall not have conditionality materially more onerous than
that in the Debt Commitment Letters. Purchaser shall deliver to Seller
complete and correct copies of all amendments, supplements, other
modifications or agreements (including redacted fee letters) pursuant to
which any amended, supplemented, modified or replacement commitments shall
provide Purchaser with any portion of the Debt Financing. Purchaser shall
promptly deliver to Parent true and complete copies of all commitment letters
and/or agreements relating to such alternative debt financing (which such
commitment letters shall also be deemed to constitute the Debt Commitment
Letters).

  



  

(c) Parent agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
Seller or any of its respective Affiliates (including legal and
accounting employees) to provide such cooperation as shall be reasonably
requested by Purchaser in connection with the Debt Financing, including: (i)
participating in a customary and reasonable number of meetings, presentations,
due diligence sessions, drafting sessions, road shows and sessions with
rating agencies and assisting Purchaser in obtaining ratings as contemplated
by the Debt Financing, (ii) assisting with the preparation of materials for
rating agency presentations, offering documents, lender presentations, bank
information memoranda and similar documents for the Debt Financing, including
execution and delivery of customary representation and/or
authorization letters in connection with bank information memoranda, (iii)
furnishing Purchaser with (y) all financial information regarding the
Transferred Entities and the Business reasonably requested and necessary for
Purchaser to prepare the pro forma financial statements required pursuant to
Section 5 of Exhibit A and clause (c) of Annex III, as applicable, of the Debt
Commitment Letters and (z) all other financial and pertinent information as
may be reasonably requested by Purchaser to satisfy the terms and conditions
set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters; (iv) providing any information
necessary to permit the preparation of the Definitive Documents and documents
to be delivered pursuant thereto, including the officer's certificates,
customary closing documents and or other financing deliverables, certificates
or documents for the Debt Financing as contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letters or as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser (including customary
consents of accountants for use of their reports in any materials relating to
the Debt Financing) or otherwise reasonably facilitating granting of security
and the pledging of collateral, (v) providing any information necessary for
the preparation and delivery of, as of the Closing Date, a certificate of the
chief financial officer (or other comparable officer) of Purchaser with
respect to solvency matters, (vi) assisting Purchaser to obtain waivers,
consents, estoppels and approvals from other parties to material leases,
encumbrances and contracts to which any Transferred Entity is a party and
arranging discussions among Purchaser and the Debt Financing Sources with
other parties to material leases, encumbrances and contracts as of the
Closing Date, (vii) taking all actions, subject to the occurrence of the
Closing Date, reasonably requested by Purchaser that are necessary or
customary to permit the consummation of the Debt Financing, and to permit the
proceeds thereof, together with cash at any Transferred Entity (not needed
for other purposes), to be made available to the Purchaser on the
Closing Date to consummate the Transactions, (viii) cooperating with
Purchaser in its efforts to obtain accountants' comfort letters, consents,
legal opinions, surveys, appraisals, engineering reports, environmental and
other inspections, title insurance and other third-party documentation and
items relating to the Debt Financing, as reasonably requested by Purchaser,
(ix) assisting in the obtainment of inventory appraisals and field
examinations as promptly as practicable, (x) taking all actions reasonably
necessary to permit the prospective lenders involved in the Debt Financing to
evaluate the Business's current assets, cash management and accounting
systems, policies and procedures relating thereto for the purpose of
establishing collateral arrangements to the extent customary and reasonable,
(xi) at least five business days prior to the Closing Date, provide
information regarding any Transferred Entities reasonably required by
regulatory authorities under applicable "know your customer" and anti-
money laundering rules and regulations, including the USA Patriot Act of
2001, to the extent requested in writing at least 10 business days prior to
the Closing Date, (xii) obtaining and facilitating the negotiation of the
payoff letters referenced in Section 2.4(b)(i)(G), (xiii) permitting the
reasonable use by Purchaser and its Affiliates of Parent's, its Affiliates'
and the Business's logos for syndication and underwriting, as applicable, of
the Debt Financing (subject to advance review of and consultation
with respect to such use) and (xiv) reasonably cooperating with the marketing
and syndication efforts of Purchaser in connection with all or any portion of
the Debt Financing, including reasonable direct contact between senior
management, on the one hand, and any actual and potential debt financing
sources, on the other hand, and any actions necessary to ensure that
Purchaser's marketing and syndication efforts benefit from Parent's and its
Affiliates' existing banking relationships; _provided_ that (x) such
requested cooperation shall not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of Parent and its Affiliates and (y) the board of directors (or
similar body), directors and officers of each of the Parent, the Seller and
their respective affiliates shall not be required, prior to the Closing, (A)
to adopt resolutions approving the agreements, documents and instruments in
connection with the Debt Financing, (B) to execute, prior to the Closing, any
agreements, documents or instruments in connection with the Debt Financing
that are effective prior to the Closing or (C) to take any action that would
subject them to actual or potential liability or make any other payment
(other than payments for which the Purchaser is obligated to reimburse the
Parent) or incur any other liability or provide or agree to provide any
indemnity, guarantee or pledge, in each case, in connection with the
Debt Financing. Purchaser shall, promptly upon request by Parent, reimburse
Parent for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs (in the case of
attorney's fees, limited to reasonable and documented fees in respect of one
firm of outside counsel) incurred by Parent or any of its Affiliates in
connection with such cooperation prior to the Closing Date. Purchaser shall
indemnify and hold harmless Parent and its Affiliates from and against any
Losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the
Debt Financing and any information utilized in connection therewith, in each

their respective representatives. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, the condition set forth in Section 8.2(b) as it applies to
Parent and Seller's obligations under this Section 5.14(c) shall be deemed
satisfied unless the Debt Financing has not been obtained primarily as a
result of Parent's or Seller's Willful Breach of its obligations under this

right or benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom, in each case,
included in the Purchased Assets) if (i) any assignment or transfer thereof
(whether by operation of law or otherwise), without the consent, waiver,
approval or other authorization of any Person other than Seller or its
Affiliates, would constitute a breach or other contravention thereof or be
ineffective with respect to any party thereto or would violate any applicable
Law and (ii) such consent, waiver, approval or other authorization has not
been obtained at or prior to the Closing (each such asset, other than those
referred to on Exhibit B of the Letter Agreement that are retained by Parent
(or its nominee) in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Letter
Agreement, a " _Deferred Asset_ ").

  



  

(b) With respect to any such Deferred Asset, Seller shall (and shall
cause its Affiliates to) cooperate with Purchaser and (i) use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, or cause to be obtained, all
consents, waivers, approvals or other authorizations required to assign or
transfer such Deferred Asset to Purchaser (or its designee) and (ii) upon
obtaining the requisite consents, waivers, approvals, other authorizations or
amendments thereto, assign all rights associated with such Deferred Asset to
Purchaser (or its designee), in each case, without the payment of any
consideration by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or agreement by any such
Person to any adverse amendments, modifications or waivers of any material
terms of any Purchased Assets in order to obtain such consents. Purchaser
shall (and shall cause it Subsidiaries to) cooperate with Seller and use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such consents, waivers, approvals
or other authorizations and approvals only to the extent that the
corresponding benefit is actually received by Purchaser or its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(c) If any consent or approval required to assign or transfer any
Deferred Asset is not obtained at or prior to Closing, then, for a period of
up to thirty-six (36) months following the Closing Date, (x) Seller and
Purchaser shall each use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Purchaser
and its Affiliates the maximum allowable use of the Deferred Assets (which
shall include, at a minimum, the economic benefits and burdens of such
Deferred Assets), including by establishing an agency type or other similar
arrangement reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser under which Purchaser would
obtain, to the fullest extent practicable, the claims, rights and
benefits and assume the corresponding liabilities and obligations thereunder
from and after the Closing in accordance with this Agreement (including by
means of any subcontracting, sublicensing or subleasing arrangement) and (y)
to the extent permitted by Law, Seller shall (and shall cause its Affiliates
to) exercise, enforce and exploit, only at the direction of and for the
benefit of Purchaser, any and all claims, rights and benefits of Seller or
its applicable Affiliate arising in connection with such Deferred Asset.
During such period and without further consideration, (i) Seller will (or will
cause its applicable Affiliates to) promptly pay, assign and remit to
Purchaser when received all monies and other consideration relating to the
period after the Closing Date received by it under any Contract or any claim,
right or benefit arising thereunder not transferred pursuant to this Section
5.15 and (ii) Purchaser will promptly pay, perform or discharge when due any
Liability (including any Tax Liability) arising thereunder after the Closing
Date.

offer or grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise) in order to obtain
any such consents, waivers, approvals or other authorizations.

that could reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition Transaction,
(ii) conduct any discussions, enter into any negotiations or submissions of
proposals or offers in respect of an Acquisition Transaction, (iii) other
than as required pursuant to applicable Laws or in connection with seeking to
obtain any Material Consents, provide any non-public financial or other

and any other financial information, projections or proposals regarding the
Business, the Transferred Entities, the Purchased Units or the Purchased
Assets) to any Person (other than the Parties and their Representatives) in
connection with a proposed Acquisition Transaction, or provide access to any

(c) Seller and Parent (on behalf of themselves and their
Representatives) agree and acknowledge that the time, scope and other
provisions of this Section 5.16 have been specifically negotiated by
sophisticated commercial parties and specifically hereby agree and

the circumstances and are necessary to induce Purchaser to enter into this
Agreement. It is further agreed that other remedies cannot fully compensate
Purchaser for a violation by Parent or its Affiliates, subsidiaries or
Representatives of the terms of this Section 5.16 and that Purchaser shall be
entitled to injunctive relief and specific performance in accordance with
Section 11.7 to prevent any such violation or threatened violation or
continuing violation by Parent (or any of its Affiliates, subsidiaries or
Representatives). It is the intent and understanding of each Party that if,
in any Action, any term, restriction, covenant or promise herein is found to
be unreasonable and for that reason unenforceable, then such term,
restriction, covenant or promise shall be deemed modified to the extent
necessary to make it enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by Law.

conditioned; and _provided_ that, such consent shall be deemed to have been
granted by Purchaser if it does not respond to Parent or Seller's written
notice of any such deviation within five (5) Business Days following
receipt thereof).

obligations that would otherwise constitute Assumed Liabilities.

reasonable best efforts to obtain, as promptly as reasonably possible (but
in any event with five (5) Business Days from the date of this Agreement),

Statement (and, in each case, any amendment or supplement thereto) will
comply with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and DGCL,
including the requirement that such documents do not contain any statement

earlier communication with respect to the same meeting or subject
matter which has become false or misleading.

Liabilities, that are covered by Parent's or Seller's or their Affiliates'
(other than the Transferred Entities) occurrence-based liability insurance

shall, to the extent permitted by such Occurrence Policies, make
claims thereunder on Purchaser's behalf; _provided that_ : (a) Purchaser
shall reimburse the Seller and Parent and their Affiliates for all increased
insurance costs incurred by Seller and Parent and their Affiliates as a result
of any such claims (including, without limitation, premium adjustments,
whether retrospective or otherwise), and (b) Purchaser shall bear (and neither
Seller nor Parent nor their Affiliates shall be responsible for) all
deductibles or retentions associated with any such claims. For the avoidance
of doubt, nothing in this Section 5.22 shall: (i) limit in any respect Seller

Article VII

  



  

TAX MATTERS

  



  

Section 7.1 _Tax Indemnity by Seller_.

  



  

(a) Seller or Parent shall pay or cause to be paid, and, jointly and
severally, shall indemnify Purchaser and its Affiliates (including
the Transferred Entities, effective from and after Closing) (each, a "
_Purchaser Tax Indemnitee_ ") and hold each Purchaser Tax Indemnitee harmless
from and against (i) any Excluded Taxes, (ii) any Taxes attributable to any
breach of any covenant or agreement of, or any representation or warranty in
Section 3.12 made by, Seller contained in this Agreement without regard to the
terms "material," "materiality," "Material Adverse Effect," and other similar
or correlative qualifications, (iii) any Transfer Taxes that Seller is
responsible for under Section 7.11 and (iv) all costs and expenses, including
reasonable advisory fees and expenses, attributable to any item described in
clauses (i) through (iii) of this Section 7.1(a).

  



  

(b) From and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall indemnify and
hold Seller and its Affiliates harmless from and against (i) any Taxes of the
Transferred Entities, Purchased Assets, or the Business other than amounts for
which a Purchaser Tax Indemnitee is indemnified under Section 7.1(a), to the
extent such Taxes relate solely to the Post-Closing Period (ii) any Taxes
resulting from a breach of any obligation of Purchaser and its Affiliates
(including the Transferred Entities, effective from and after Closing) set
forth in this Article VII, (iii) any Incremental Section 338 Liability and
(iv) all costs and expenses, including reasonable advisory fees and expenses,
attributable to any item described in clauses (i) through (iii) of this
Section 7.1(b).

  



  

Section 7.2 _Straddle Periods_. For purposes of this Agreement, in
the case of any Straddle Period, the Parties shall, to the extent permitted
or required under applicable Law, elect with the relevant Governmental Entity
to treat a portion of any Straddle Period as a short Tax period ending as of
the close of business on the Closing Date. For any Tax period that does not
close on the Closing Date, unless otherwise required under applicable Law,
(i) property Taxes or other ad valorem Taxes allocable to the Pre-Closing
Tax Period shall be equal to the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle
Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
calendar days during the Straddle Period that are in the Pre-Closing Tax
Period and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the
entire Straddle Period, and (ii) Taxes (other than those described in clause
(i)) allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be computed on a "closing
of the books" basis as if such Taxable period ended as of the end of the day
on the Closing Date; _provided_ that exemptions, allowances or deductions that
are calculated on an annual basis (including, but not limited to,
depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be allocated between the
period ending on the Closing Date and the period beginning after the Closing
Date in proportion to the number of days in each period. For purposes of the
foregoing, each Subsidiary of a Transferred Entity that is classified as a
"flow-through" entity shall be treated as if the taxable year of such entity
had ended as of the close of business on the Closing Date. For the absence of
doubt, in the case of a Straddle Period of a CFC, the amount includible under
Section 951(a) of the Code (and any related foreign Tax credit under Section
960 of the Code) in respect of such CFC that is attributable to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period portion of the Straddle Period shall be determined on a
"closing of the books" basis as if the taxable year of the CFC had ended as
of the close of business on the Closing Date.

Section 7.3 _Filing Responsibility_.

  



  

(a) Seller shall, at its own cost, timely prepare and file, or shall
cause to be timely prepared and filed, in accordance with applicable Law, (i)
any Combined Tax Return and (ii) any Tax Return required to be filed by or
with respect to any of the Transferred Entities, the Purchased Assets or the
Business that is due (including extensions) on or before the Closing Date (a "
_Seller Return_ "). Seller shall timely pay or shall cause the timely payment
of all Taxes shown to be due on the Seller Returns. Each Seller
Return described in clause (ii) of the second preceding sentence shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with past practice, accounting methods and
elections of the Transferred Entities, unless otherwise required by law.

  



  

(b) Subject to Section 7.3(c), Purchaser shall, at its own cost,
timely prepare and file, or shall cause to be timely prepared and filed,
in accordance with applicable Law, all Tax Returns required to be filed by or
with respect to the Transferred Entities, the Purchased Assets or the
Business other than any such Tax Returns that are the responsibility of Seller
under Section 7.3(a). In the case on any such Tax Return that (i) is for a
Pre-Closing Tax Period ending on or before the Closing Date (a " _Purchaser
Pre-Closing Tax Return_ ") or (ii) is for a Straddle Period (any Tax Return
described in clause (ii), a " _Purchaser Straddle Period Tax Return_ ," and
together with any Tax Return described in clause (i), the " _Purchaser Tax
Returns_ "), Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared any such
Purchaser Tax Return in a manner consistent with past practice,
accounting methods and elections of the members of the Seller Group and the
Transferred Entities prior to the Closing, except to the extent not
reflecting a position that is "more likely than not" correct. Notwithstanding
any other provision in this Agreement, Purchaser shall not, and shall cause
its Affiliates not to, amend or revoke after submission any Purchaser Tax
Return or Seller Return without the prior written consent of Seller (which
consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed).

  



  

(c) In the case of any Purchaser Tax Return, Purchaser shall, or
shall cause the Transferred Entities to, deliver to Seller for its
review, comment and approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably
conditioned, withheld or delayed) a copy of such proposed Purchaser Tax
Return (accompanied, in the case of any Purchaser Straddle Period Tax Return,
by an allocation between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing
Period of the Taxes shown to be due on such Tax Return) at least thirty (30)
Business Days prior to the due date therefor (taking into account
extensions). In the case of any such Purchaser Tax Return that is a Purchaser
Pre-Closing Tax Return, Purchaser shall accept and reflect on such Purchaser
Pre-Closing Tax Return any comments provided by Seller in writing at least
fifteen (15) Business Days (taking into account extensions) before such due
date (and, in the event no written comments have been so provided by Seller,
Seller shall be deemed to have approved the copy of the Tax Return delivered
pursuant to the preceding sentence). In the case of any such Purchaser Tax
Return that is a Purchaser Straddle Period Tax Return, Purchaser shall
accept and reflect on such Purchaser Straddle Period Tax Return any
reasonable comments provided by Seller in writing at least ten (10) Business
Days before such due date (and, in the event no written comments have been so
provided by Seller, Seller shall be deemed to have approved the copy of the
Tax Return delivered pursuant to the preceding sentence). If Purchaser
disputes any of Seller's comments to any such Purchaser Straddle Period Tax
Return, Purchaser shall notify Seller of such disputed items (or items)
and Seller and Purchaser shall act in good faith to resolve any such dispute
prior to the due date for filing the relevant Purchaser Straddle Period Tax
Return (taking into account extensions). If Seller and Purchaser cannot
resolve any disputed item, the item in question shall be resolved by an
accounting firm mutually acceptable to Seller and Purchaser in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement. The fees and expenses of such accounting firm
shall be borne equally by Seller and Purchaser. No later than five (5)
Business Days prior to the due date (taking into account extensions) of any
Purchaser Tax Return delivered to Seller pursuant to this Section 7.3(c),
Seller shall pay to Purchaser the amount of Excluded Taxes shown to be due
thereon.

Section 7.4 _Tax Contests_. (a) If any taxing authority asserts a
Tax Claim, then a Party to this Agreement first receiving notice of such Tax
Claim promptly shall provide written notice thereof to the other Party or
Parties to this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure of such
Party to give such prompt notice shall not relieve any other Party of any of
its obligations under this Article VII, except to the extent that the other
Party is actually prejudiced thereby. Such notice shall specify in reasonable
detail the basis for such Tax Claim and shall include a copy of the
relevant portion of any correspondence received from the taxing authority.

  



  

(b) Seller shall have the sole right to control any audit,
examination, contest, litigation or other proceeding by or against any taxing
authority (a " _Tax Proceeding_ ") with respect to (i) any Combined Tax
Return, (ii) any Tax Return of or Taxes imposed on or with respect to Seller,
any member of the Seller Group or any of their respective Affiliates
(including, prior to Closing the Transferred Entities), (iii) any Tax Return
of or Taxes imposed on or with respect to any of the Transferred Entities for
a taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date, and (iv) any Tax
Return or Taxes imposed on or with respect to the Purchased Assets, the
Assumed Liabilities or the Business for a taxable period ending on or before
the Closing Date, _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of a Tax
Proceeding described in clause (iii) or (iv), (A) Seller shall inform
Purchaser of its election to control such Tax Proceeding within 10 days of
receiving notice thereof and, thereafter, (B) Seller shall diligently
prosecute such Tax Proceeding in good faith, (C) Seller shall keep Purchaser
reasonably informed of the status of developments with respect to such Tax
Proceeding and (D) Seller shall not settle or concede any such Tax Proceeding
without the prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned) of Purchaser if such settlement or
concession could reasonably be expected to have the effect of materially
increasing the Tax Liability of (or materially decreasing any Tax asset
available to) a Purchaser Tax Indemnitee.

  



  

(c) Purchaser shall have the right to control any Tax Proceeding
involving the Transferred Entities other than any Tax Proceeding described in
Section 7.4(b); _provided_ that, in the case of any such Tax Proceeding with
respect to (i) any Tax Return of or Taxes imposed on or with respect to any
of the Transferred Entities for a Straddle Period, (ii) any Tax Return or
Taxes imposed on or with respect to the Purchased Assets, the Assumed
Liabilities or the Business for a Straddle Period or (iii) Excluded Tax,
(A) Purchaser shall inform Seller in a timely manner and in reasonable detail
about the conduct of such Tax Proceeding; (B) Purchaser shall consult with
Seller before taking any significant action in connection with such Tax
Proceeding and offer Seller an opportunity to comment before submitting any
written materials prepared or furnished in connection with such Tax
Proceeding, (C) Purchaser shall defend such Tax Proceeding diligently and in
good faith as if it were the only party in interest in connection with
such Tax Proceeding, (D) Seller shall be entitled, at its own expense, to
participate in such Tax Proceeding, and (E) Purchaser shall not settle,
compromise or abandon any such Tax Proceeding without obtaining the prior
written consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

Section 7.5 _Combined Returns and Seller Returns_. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, (a) Seller shall be entitled to
control in all respects, and neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall
be entitled to participate in, any Tax Proceeding with respect to any
Combined Tax Return or any other Tax Return of Seller, any other member of
the Seller Group or any of their respective Affiliates and (b) Seller shall
not be required to provide any person with any such Combined Tax Return or
other Tax Return of Seller, any other member of the Seller Group or any of
their respective Affiliates or copy thereof ( _provided_ , _however_ , that
to the extent that any such Tax Return would be required to be delivered but
for this Section 7.5, Seller shall instead deliver a pro forma Tax Return

Price under Section 2.5, Purchaser shall deliver a draft allocation of the
"aggregate deemed sales price" (" _ADSP_ ," and such allocation, the " _ADSP
Allocation_ ") with respect to the assets of the Transferred Entities to
Seller for Seller's review and consent. Such allocation shall be in

disagrees with the ADSP Allocation, then the parties shall attempt in good
faith to resolve their disagreement within ten (10) days following Seller's
notification to Purchaser of such disagreement. If Seller does not so notify
Purchaser within thirty (30) days of receipt of the draft allocation, or upon
resolution of the disputed items by the parties, such allocation shall become
final. If the parties are unable to resolve their disagreement within the ten
(10) days following any such notification by Seller, then the parties shall
submit all such disputed items for resolution to the Independent
Accountant, whose decision shall be final and binding upon the parties and
whose fees and expenses shall be borne equally by the parties. The parties
shall act in good faith to cause the Independent Accountant to determine the
final ADSP Allocation twenty (20) days after such submission.

  



  

(c) Upon notice by Seller, Purchaser shall, pay to Seller, in cash,
the amount of additional consideration necessary to cause Seller Group's net
after state and local income tax (but without regard to federal income tax)
consideration received from the sale of the stock of the Transferred Entities
with the Section 338(h)(10) Election to be equal to the net after state and
local income tax (but without regard to federal income tax) consideration
that would have been received by Seller Group pursuant to this Agreement had
the Section 338(h)(10) Election not been made, taking into account all
appropriate state and local Tax implications but without regard to
any federal income Tax implications, and as calculated in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 7.12(c) and Section 7.12(d) (the " _Incremental
Section 338 Liability_ "), provided, however, that the Incremental Section 338
Liability shall not be greater than $2,500,000 or less than zero.

  



  

(d) Within thirty (30) days after the ADSP Allocation becomes final,
Seller shall provide Purchaser with a schedule computing the amount of the
Incremental Section 338 Liability. Such schedule shall be consistent with the
final ADSP Allocation. In making such calculation, the highest corporate
state and local tax rates to which the applicable parent of the group (or
groups) of which the Transferred Entities are members for state and local tax
purposes is subject shall be used and any other items of income, deduction,
gain, loss, or credits of such group (or groups) shall be ignored. Seller
shall cooperate with the Purchaser in reviewing the calculations and shall
provide the Purchaser reasonable access to the supporting documentation for
the calculation of the Incremental Section 338 Liability.

  



  

(e) If the Purchaser disagrees with the Seller's calculation of the
Incremental Section 338 Liability and the parties are unable to resolve their
disagreement within twenty (20) days of receipt of the schedule, the parties
shall refer such dispute to the Independent Accountant whose decision shall
be final and binding and whose fees and expenses shall be borne equally by
Seller and Purchaser. The parties shall act in good faith to cause the
Independent Accountant to determine the Incremental Section 338 Liability
within twenty (20) days after such submission. Purchaser shall pay to Seller
the amount of such Incremental Section 338 Liability within ten (10) days
after the final determination of the Incremental Section 338 Liability.

(f) In connection with the Section 338(h)(10) Election (or as soon
thereafter as reasonably practicable), the Parties shall file all
federal, state, local and other forms necessary to make the Section
338(h)(10) Election jointly and shall make any required filings and take any
and all other reasonable actions necessary or appropriate to effect the
Section 338(h)(10) Election. Seller shall include in Seller's income Tax
Returns for the taxable period, which includes the Closing Date, any forms
that are required to be so included on account of the Section 338(h)(10)
Election. Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate fully, and in good faith,
with each other in making the Section 338(h)(10) Election. No later than
ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser and Seller shall sign and
date IRS Form 8023 or a signature schedule attached thereto, shall provide
their taxpayer identification numbers, shall sign any corresponding state or
local forms required in connection with the Section 338(h)(10) Election, and
shall provide any other information required by Form 8023 and any
corresponding state or local form. All such forms to be signed shall be

Section 9.3, Section 9.4, this Section 9.5, Section 11.7 and Section 11.9
(including, in each case, the limitations set forth therein), (A) if

for any reason or no reason or otherwise breaches this Agreement or any other
Ancillary Agreement (whether such breach is willful, intentional,

this Agreement and that, without these agreements, the other party would not
enter into this Agreement. If Parent fails to pay the Parent Termination Fee,
if, as and when due pursuant to Section 9.3, or Purchaser fails to pay the
Reverse Termination Fee or the Purchaser Termination Fee, if, as and when due

(d) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement to the contrary, the maximum aggregate liability of the Purchaser

other hand, under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, collectively
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, monetary damages for fraud or breach,
whether willful, intentional, unintentional or otherwise, or monetary damages
in lieu of specific performance), or in connection with the Transactions, or
in connection with the failure of such Transactions to be consummated, or in
respect of any representation made or alleged to be made in
connection herewith or therewith, whether in equity or at law, in contract,
in tort or otherwise, together with the payment of the Parent Termination
Fee, the Purchaser Termination Fee or the Reverse Termination Fee, as the case
may be, shall not exceed under any circumstances $5,000,000, together with
any amounts solely to the extent due by such Party pursuant to Section 9.5(c)
(subject to the limitations set forth therein)) (the " _Maximum Liability
Amount_ "), and in no event shall the Seller Related Parties or the Purchaser
Related Parties, as the case may be, seek, directly or indirectly, to recover
any damages whatsoever (including consequential, indirect or punitive
damages) in excess of the Maximum Liability Amount.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, each
of Parent and Seller (on behalf of itself, its Affiliates and the other
Seller Related Parties) hereby waives any rights or claims against any Debt
Financing Source in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing, the
Debt Commitment Letters, the definitive financing documentation, any other
document related thereto, any of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby or in respect of any oral or written representations made or alleged
to be made in connection herewith or therewith (whether in contract or in
tort, in law or in equity or otherwise), and each of Parent and Seller (on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents
and representatives), agrees not to commence any action or proceeding against
any Debt Financing Source in connection with this Agreement, the Debt
Financing, the Debt Commitment Letters, the definitive financing
documentation, any other document related thereto, any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or in respect of any oral or written
representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or
therewith (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity or otherwise)
and to cause any such action or proceeding asserted by Parent, Seller or
their respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents and
representatives to be dismissed or otherwise terminated. In furtherance and
not in limitation of the foregoing waiver, it is acknowledged and agreed that
no Debt Financing Source shall have any liability for any claims or damages
to Parent and Seller in connection with this Agreement, the Debt
Financing, the Debt Commitment Letters, the definitive financing
documentation, any other document related thereto or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. The provisions of this Section
9.5(e) shall inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, each Debt
Financing Source, its Affiliates and their respective successors and permitted
assigns, each of which is hereby intended to be an express third party
beneficiary of this Section 9.5(e).

Section 10.5 _Claims; Procedures for Claims_.

  



  

(a) Any Purchaser Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party
claiming it may be entitled to indemnification under Section 10.2 or
Section 10.4, as the case may be (the " _Indemnified Party_ "), shall give
prompt written notice to Parent (in the case of a Purchaser Indemnified
Party) or Purchaser (in the case of a Seller Indemnified Party) (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ " ) of each matter, action, cause of action, claim,
demand, fact or other circumstances upon which a claim for indemnification
(a " _Claim_ ") hereunder may be based. Such notice shall contain, with
respect to each Claim, such material facts and information as are then
reasonably available and that such Indemnified Party is permitted to disclose
under applicable Law, including the estimated amount of Losses (to the extent
known) and the basis for indemnification hereunder, to the extent
known. Failure to give prompt notice of a Claim hereunder shall not affect
the Indemnifying Party's obligations hereunder, except to the extent the
Indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced by such failure.

  



  

(b) Following delivery by an Indemnified Party of notice of any
Claim (A " _Claim Notice_ ") arising out of any third-party action, suit,
proceeding, claim, demand or assessment (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof
and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof at its expense with
counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party if it gives notice to the Indemnified Party within twenty
(20) Business Days after receipt of notice of such Third Party Claim from the
Indemnified Party of its intention to do so; _provided_ that the Indemnifying
Party shall not be entitled to assume or maintain control of the defense of
any Third Party Claim unless (i) the Third Party Claim does not relate to
Taxes, is not brought by a Governmental Entity, does not relate to criminal
charges, and is for monetary damages only and (ii) the Indemnifying Party
conducts the defense of the Third Party Claim in a commercially reasonable
and diligent manner, (iii) the Third Party Claim could not reasonably be
expected to adversely affect the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates, other
than as a result of monetary damages for which it would be entitled to relief
under this Agreement. If the Indemnifying Party does not assume such defense,
the Indemnifying Party shall continue to have the right to participate in the
defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from any
counsel employed by the Indemnified Party, it being understood that the
Indemnified Party shall control such defense. If the Indemnifying Party
assumes such defense, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense,
separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party, it being
understood, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall control such defense,
and the Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to indemnification for legal
expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with
the defense thereof; _provided_ that, subject to the limitations in this
Article X, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification for the
fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party (i) for any
period during which the Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense
thereof (or otherwise conducted such defense actively and diligently), (ii)
if the Indemnified Party has been advised by its outside counsel that there
may exist a conflict of interest that would make it inappropriate for the
same counsel to represent both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Party or (iii) if there are legal defenses available to an Indemnified Party
that are different from or additional to those available to the Indemnifying
Party. All the Parties that are party to, or an Indemnifying Party with
respect to, any Third Party Claim shall cooperate in the defense of such
Third Party Claim, at the Indemnifying Party's expense. Such cooperation shall
include: (x) retaining and providing to the Indemnifying Party reasonable
access to records and information which are reasonably relevant to the defense
of such Third Party Claim, (y) assisting with the collection and preparation
of discovery materials and (z) making employees and other representatives and
advisors available on a mutually convenient basis to prepare for or appear as
witnesses at depositions, court proceedings or trials and to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder;
_provided_ that such access shall be subject to customary confidentiality
obligations, and shall be granted following prior written notice, during
normal business hours, and shall be granted under conditions which shall not
unreasonably interfere with the business and operations of the
Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), settle or compromise any
Third Party Claim or permit a default or consent to entry of any
judgment with respect to such Third Party Claim unless (i) all monetary
Liabilities under such settlement or compromise will be paid or reimbursed by
the Indemnifying Party (except to the extent within the Deductible), (ii) the
terms of such settlement or compromise include an unqualified release of the
Indemnified Party from all Liability in respect of such Third Party Claim,
(iii) such settlement or compromise does not contain any admission of
Liability of, violation of Law, or wrongdoing by the Indemnified Party, and
(iv) such settlement or compromise does not impose any sanctions,
restrictions, injunctions or obligations (including the payment of money
damages, unless the Indemnifying Party will be solely responsible for all of
such money damages) on the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall
not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), settle or
compromise, or consent to the entry of any judgment of, any Third Party Claim
unless the Indemnifying Party shall not be subject to any indemnification
obligation with respect to such claim hereunder.

(c) Following delivery by an Indemnified Party of any Claim Notice
(other than regarding a Third Party Claim, which is addressed in Section
10.5), the Indemnifying Party shall, within twenty (20) days after receipt by
the Indemnifying Party of such Claim Notice, deliver to the Indemnified Party
a response notice (a " _Response Notice_ ") specifying (i) the items set forth
in the Claim Notice the Indemnifying does not dispute (such items, the "
_Agreed Claim Items_ ") and (ii) the items set forth in the Claim Notice the
Indemnifying Party disputes (such items, the " _Disputed Claim Items_ "),
specifying in reasonable detail the basis for any such disputes. In the event
no Response Notice is timely delivered, the Indemnifying Party shall, within
ten (10) Business Days of the date the Response Notice was otherwise due, pay
to the Indemnified Party an amount equal to the amount claimed in the Claim
Notice by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the bank account or
accounts designated by the Indemnified Party. In the event a Response Notice
is timely delivered, (x) with respect to the Agreed Claim Items, the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall promptly prepare and sign a
memorandum of agreement setting forth such agreement, and the Indemnifying
Party shall promptly (and in any event within ten (10) Business Days of
signing such memorandum) by wire transfer in immediately available funds to
the bank account or accounts designated by the Indemnified Party pay any and
all amounts due in connection therewith and (y) with respect to the Disputed
Claim Items, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall, during
the twenty (20) day period beginning on the date of receipt by the Indemnified
Party of such Response Notice, attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights
of the respective parties with respect to each of such Disputed Claim Item. If
the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall succeed in reaching
agreement on their respective rights with respect to all or any portion of
such Disputed Claim Items, the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party
shall promptly prepare and sign a memorandum of agreement setting forth such
agreement, and the Indemnifying Party shall promptly (and in any event within
ten (10) Business Days of signing such memorandum) by wire transfer in
immediately available funds to the bank account or accounts designated by the
Indemnified Party pay any and all amounts due in connection therewith. Should
the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party be unable to agree as to any
particular Disputed Claim Item within such time period, then the Indemnified
Party shall be permitted to submit such dispute in accordance with Section
11.2. Within 10 Business Days of the final determination of such dispute, the
Indemnifying Party shall pay, if applicable, to the Indemnified Party all
amounts due as determined in accordance with Section 11.2 by wire transfer in
immediately available funds to the bank account or accounts designated by the
Indemnified Party.

  



  

(d) Parent shall act on behalf of Seller and the Seller Group in the
case of all claims (including Third Party Claims) with respect to which a
Purchaser Indemnified Party is seeking indemnification pursuant to Section
10.2.

  



  

(e) The parties agree to treat any indemnity payment made pursuant
to this Article X as an adjustment to the Purchase Price to the
extent permitted by Law.

  



  

Section 10.6 _Losses Net of Tax Benefits and Insurance_. The amount
of any and all indemnification payments in respect of Losses under Section
7.1, Section 10.2 and Section 10.4 shall be determined net of (i) any Tax
benefit actually realized by an indemnified party by reason of such Losses,
determined on a "with" and "without" basis (and net of any Tax cost or
reduction in Tax benefits by reason of receipt of the indemnification
payment), and (ii) any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Party
under insurance policies, indemnities or other reimbursement arrangements
(other than in connection with any policy or Contract between or among
Indemnified Parties) (collectively, " _Alternative Arrangements_ ") with
respect to such Losses (net of any deductible or co-pay amounts and any other
costs or expenses reasonably incurred in connection therewith, including all
premiums and other costs of such insurance policies, or any increase in
premium payable by such Indemnified Party, or any retroactive adjustment
under any such policy, or costs or expenses incurred in connection with
pursuing a claim thereunder (" _Recovery Costs_ ")); _provided_ that no
Indemnified Party shall be subject to any obligation to pursue recovery in
respect of any indemnifiable Losses under any such Alternative Arrangement. If
an indemnification payment is received by an Indemnified Party, and such
Indemnified Party later (but within twelve (12) months of receipt of payment
from the Indemnifying Party) receives proceeds or recoveries from any
Alternative Arrangement in respect of the related Losses, the Indemnified
Party shall promptly pay to the Indemnifying Party a sum equal to the lesser
of (x) the actual amount of such proceeds or recoveries (net of Recovery
Costs) or (y) the actual amount of the indemnification payment previously paid
by the Indemnifying Party with respect to such Losses; _provided_ that no
payments under any Alternative Arrangement between or among
Indemnified Parties shall be considered proceeds or recoveries for purposes
of this sentence. For the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, no indemnification payment payable hereunder shall be
conditioned, withheld or delayed as a result of any Indemnified Party not
having sought, realized or received any insurance proceeds.

Section 10.7 _Other Limitations_.

  



  

(a) No Purchaser Indemnified Party shall have the right to recover
under Section 7.1(a), Section 7.1(b) or Section 10.2 with respect to any Loss
or alleged Loss to the extent the matter forming the basis for such Loss or
alleged Loss shall have been taken into account in the determination of
Closing Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Date Cash or Closing
Date Transaction Expenses.

  



  

(b) No Indemnified Party shall have the right to recover under
Section 7.1(a), Section 7.1(b) or Section 10.2 any indirect,
consequential, special, exemplary, incidental or punitive damages, lost
profits lost income, lost revenues, loss of use, diminution in
value, multiples of earnings, damage to goodwill or loss of business unless
(i) such Losses were reasonably foreseeable or (ii) such Losses are in
connection with any Third Party Claim.

  



  

(c) For purposes of calculating the amount of any indemnifiable
Losses arising from such breach, the representations, warranties,
covenants and obligations set forth in this Agreement and any certificate
delivered hereunder shall be read without regard to the terms
"material," "materiality," "Material Adverse Effect," and other similar or
correlative qualifications that may be contained therein as if such
qualification were deleted from such representation or warranty.

  



  

(d) Each Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to mitigate any Loss to the extent required by Law upon becoming aware of any
event or circumstance that would be reasonably expected to, or does, give rise
thereto, including incurring any commercially reasonable costs in respect of
such indemnifiable Loss.

  



  

Section 10.8 _Termination of Indemnification_. The rights of the
Indemnified Parties under this Article X or Section 7.1 in respect of a
breach of representation or warranty or covenant shall terminate when the
applicable representation or warranty or covenant terminates pursuant to
Section 10.1; _provided_ , _however_ , that such rights to recover shall not
terminate, and shall continue until any claim in respect of such breach is
fully and finally determined, with respect to any item as to which such
Indemnified Party shall have, prior to the expiration of the applicable
period, previously made a claim by properly delivering a written notice to
the Indemnifying Party in accordance with this Article IX; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that, if such written notice is given, any proceeding brought
with respect thereto shall be initiated no later than six months following
the termination of the relevant survival period, after which time period the
right to bring or maintain such claim shall terminate.

  



  

Section 10.9 _Exclusive Remedy_.

  



  

(a) Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that from and after
the Closing, its sole and exclusive monetary remedy with respect to any and
all claims relating, directly or indirectly, to the subject matter of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, regardless of the legal
theory under which such Liability or obligation may be imposed, whether
sounding in contract or tort, or whether at law or in equity, or otherwise,
shall be the provisions set forth in this Article X (subject to any
claims related to the matters described in Section 2.5, which shall be
resolved as expressly provided therein) or Section 7.1.

  



   

 | -86-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) The Parties agree that the provisions in this Agreement relating
to indemnification, and the limits imposed on remedies with respect to this

(whether based upon contract, tort or otherwise) (including any involving a
Debt Financing Source that is in any way related to this Agreement, the
acquisition contemplated hereunder or any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including but not limited to any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Debt Financing) shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the Laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts
executed and to be performed wholly within such State and without

application of the Laws of a different jurisdiction.

  



  

(b) Subject in all respects to Section 11.2(c) and Section 11.2(d),
all disputes, controversies or claims arising out of, relating to, or
in connection with this Agreement, including the breach, termination or

this Agreement, and hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of
such Action may be heard and determined in such New York state or federal

Parties further agree, to the extent permitted by Law, that final and
unappealable judgment against any of them in any claim, controversy or
dispute of the kind described in Section 11.2(a) shall be conclusive and may
be enforced in any other jurisdiction within or outside the United States by
suit on the judgment, a certified copy of which shall be conclusive evidence
of the fact and amount of such judgment. Without limiting the foregoing, with
respect to any claims related to the Debt Financing, each Party and the
Seller Related Parties agree that service of process on such Party as provided
in Section 11.5 shall be deemed effective service of process on such Party.

Section 11.7 _Specific Performance_.

  



  

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur, and that
the Parties would not have any adequate remedy at law, in the event that any
of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that,
subject in all respects to Section 11.7(b), the parties shall be entitled to
an injunction or injunctions to prevent any breaches of this Agreement and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement, without
proof of actual damages or otherwise, in addition to any other remedy to
which any Party is entitled at law or in equity. Each Party agrees to waive
any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with
such remedy. The Parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of
specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable
for any reason (other than such remedy is sought in violation of the terms
hereof, including Section 11.7(b), nor to assert that a remedy of
monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in Section 11.7(a) or otherwise in this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement to the contrary, it is acknowledged and
agreed that in no event shall Parent, Seller, their respective Affiliates or
any of their respective equity holders, partners, directors, officers,
employees or Representatives be entitled to specific performance or any other
equitable remedy to enforce or seek to enforce Purchaser's obligation to
cause Purchaser to take any action to effect the Closing in accordance with
Section 2.4 or consummate the Debt Financings or any other transaction
contemplated under any document or agreement contemplated hereby or otherwise
or pay any amounts that may become due hereunder (including the Purchase
Price) unless and only if (w) all of the conditions set forth in Section 8.1
and Section 8.2 have been satisfied or waived in writing by Purchaser (other
than those conditions that by their terms or nature are to be satisfied at
the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction of those conditions at the
Closing), (x) the Debt Financing has been received in full by Purchaser in
accordance with the terms thereof or such amount will be funded to Purchaser
at the Closing, (y) Seller has unconditionally confirmed in writing that all
of the conditions set forth in Section 8.3 have been satisfied (other than
those conditions that by their terms or nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction of those conditions at the Closing)
or waived, and if specific performance is granted and the Debt Financing is
funded, then they are each ready, willing and able to consummate the Closing
simultaneously with the drawdown of the Debt Financing and (z) Purchaser
fails to consummate the Closing within three Business Days after the delivery
of such unconditional written confirmation (which shall not have been
revoked, modified, withdrawn or conditioned during such three Business Day
period), it being expressly agreed and understood, however, that in the
circumstances described in this sentence, Parent and Seller shall be entitled
to an injunction, specific performance or any other equitable remedy to
enforce or seek to enforce Purchaser's or any of its Affiliate's obligations;
_provided_ that, notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Parent,
Seller, their respective Affiliates or any of their respective equity
holders, partners, directors, officers, employees or Representatives be
entitled to an injunction, specific performance or any other equitable remedy
requiring any such Person to commence an Action to enforce or seek to
enforce Purchaser's or any of its Affiliates' obligation to enforce
specifically their respective rights against the Debt Financing Sources under
or in connection with the Debt Commitment Letters.

  



  

(c) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that Seller may, subject in
all respects to Section 9.2, Section 9.3, Section 9.4, this Section 11.7
and Section 11.9 (including, in each case, the limitations set forth
therein), pursue both a grant of specific performance in accordance with this
Section 11.7 and the payment of the Reverse Termination Fee if, as and when
due pursuant to Section 9.4 and the payment of the Purchaser Termination Fee
if, as and when due pursuant to Section 9.4; _provided_ that, for the
avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any
document or agreement contemplated hereby or otherwise, under no
circumstances shall Parent, Seller, their respective Affiliates or any other
Person, directly or indirectly, be permitted or entitled to receive (i) both
(x) a grant of specific performance resulting in the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the terms
hereof or other equitable relief, on the one hand, and (y) payment of any
monetary damages whatsoever or payment of the Reverse Termination Fee or the
Purchaser Termination Fee, on the other hand or (ii) both payment of any
monetary damages whatsoever, on the one hand, and payment of the Reverse
Termination Fee or the Purchaser Termination Fee, on the other hand.

(including, in each case, the limitations set forth therein), pursue both a
grant of specific performance in accordance with this Section 11.7 and the
payment of the Parent Termination Fee, if, as and when due pursuant to
Section 9.3; _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in any document or agreement contemplated hereby or
otherwise, under no circumstances shall Purchaser, its Affiliates or any
other Person, directly or indirectly, be permitted or entitled to receive (i)
both (x) a grant of specific performance resulting in the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the terms
hereof or other equitable relief, on the one hand and (y) payment of any
monetary damages whatsoever or payment of the Parent Termination Fee, on the
other hand and (ii) both payment of any monetary damages whatsoever, on the
one hand, and payment of the Parent Termination Fee, on the other hand.

  



  

(e) From and after the Closing, in the event of any proceeding for a
grant of specific performance in accordance with this Section 11.7, if a
court of competent jurisdiction or arbitrator determines (in a judgment not
subject to further appeal or for which the time for appeal has expired),
grants an award of specific performance, then such Party so required to
specifically perform its obligations hereunder shall be liable for and pay
the reasonable legal fees of the other Parties incurred in connection with
such proceeding, including any appeal therefrom.

  



  

Section 11.8 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the
terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain
in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
Party. Upon such a determination, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to
the fullest extent possible.

this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or any document, certificate or

Affiliates, that all actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings

inducement to, any of the foregoing), (c) any breach or violation of this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement and (d) the failure of the Transactions
(including the Debt Financing), to be consummated, in each case may be made
