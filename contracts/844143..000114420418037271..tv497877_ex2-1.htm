and GSO Capital Partners LP (such agreements, as may be modified pursuant to, and in accordance with, Section 5.14, the &ldquo;<U>Debt
Commitment Letters</U>&rdquo;), pursuant to which each of Ares Capital Management LLC, HPS Investment Partners, LLC and GSO Capital
Partners LP have agreed, subject to the terms and express conditions thereof, to provide Purchaser with debt financing in the
amounts set forth therein (the &ldquo;<U>Debt Financing</U>&rdquo;) for the purpose of funding the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement to occur at Closing and paying related fees and expenses. Each of the Debt Commitment Letters, in the form so delivered,
is in full force and effect and is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Purchaser and, to the knowledge of Purchaser, the
other parties thereto, in each case, except as such enforceability may be limited by (a) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other similar Laws affecting or relating to creditors&rsquo; rights generally and (b) the availability of injunctive
relief and other equitable remedies. The Debt Commitment Letters have not been amended, supplemented or otherwise modified in
any respect prior to the date of this Agreement, and the respective commitments to fund the Debt Financing thereunder have not
been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect prior to the date of this Agreement. As of the date hereof, there are not
any facts, events or other occurrences that make any of the representations and warranties of Purchaser in any Debt Commitment
Letter inaccurate in any material respect (or in any respect with regard to amounts and availability of funds, including conditionality).
The obligations to make the Debt Financing available to Purchaser pursuant to the terms of the Debt Commitment Letters are not
subject to any conditions precedent, other than as expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters. As of the date of this
Agreement, there are no contracts or other agreements, arrangements or understandings (whether oral or written) or commitments

is a party related to the Debt Financing, other than as expressly contained in the Debt Commitment Letters and delivered to Seller
prior to the date hereof, that could adversely affect the conditionality, enforceability, availability and/or initial funding
of the Debt Financing at Closing. Purchaser has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees required by the Debt Commitment
Letters to be paid thereunder on or prior to the date of this Agreement. No event has occurred which, with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach on the part of Purchaser under
any of the Debt Commitment Letters. Assuming (x) the Debt Financing is funded in accordance with the Debt Commitment Letters and
(y) the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 8.2 hereof, Purchaser will have on the Closing Date funds sufficient
to pay all amounts required to be paid by Purchaser hereunder and under the Debt Commitment Letter in order to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby to occur on the Closing Date (the &ldquo;<U>Required Amount</U>&rdquo;).</P>

of all obligations of Seller, Parent and such Affiliates under each of the Letters of Credit that are described in Section 5.12(b)
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, following which the remaining terms of this Section 5.12 shall apply with respect to such Letters
of Credit as if they had been removed or released effective as of the Closing. Parent and Seller shall be permitted to update
Section 5.12 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule by written notice to Purchaser no more than three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date to reflect updates that have been incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice solely
to the extent that the aggregate sum of the obligations under the Letters of Credit shall not increase by virtue of such updates

Tax credit under Section 960 of the Code) in respect of such CFC that is attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period portion of
the Straddle Period shall be determined on a &ldquo;closing of the books&rdquo; basis as if the taxable year of the CFC had ended
