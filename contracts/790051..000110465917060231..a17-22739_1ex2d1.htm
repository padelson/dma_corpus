practicable, but in any event within sixty (60) days following the Closing
Date, the Buyer will prepare or cause to be prepared in good faith, and will
provide to the Seller, a consolidated balance sheet of the Acquired Companies

be final, conclusive and binding on the parties unless the Seller provides a
written notice (a " _Dispute Notice_ ") to the Buyer no later than forty-five
(45) days following delivery of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing
Statement setting forth in reasonable detail any item(s) or amount(s) on the
Closing Balance Sheet and/or the Closing Statement that are disputed by the
Seller (each, a " _Disputed Item_ "). Any item or amount to which no dispute
is raised in the Dispute Notice will be final, conclusive and binding on the
parties.

 



      
 

 



 

2.4.4. _Resolution of Disputes_. The Buyer and the Seller will attempt to
resolve the Disputed Items in good faith during the twenty (20) day period
following delivery of the Dispute Notice. During such twenty (20) day period,
the Buyer shall provide, and shall cause the Acquired Companies to provide,
the Seller and its Representatives with access to, and the opportunity to make
copies of, the work papers and other materials used or considered by the Buyer
in the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement, and
reasonable access to personnel and Representatives of the Buyer and the
Acquired Companies who assisted or were consulted in the preparation of the
Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement. Disputed Items resolved by
the Seller and the Buyer within such twenty (20) day period will be final,
conclusive and binding on the parties. If the Buyer and the Seller are unable
to resolve any Disputed Items in the Dispute Notice within such twenty (20)
day period, either the Buyer or the Seller may provide written notice to the
other (the " _Dispute Submission Notice_ ") that it is submitting the
remaining Disputed Items for resolution by the Independent Accountant. The
Buyer and the Seller will instruct the Independent Accountant to render its
decision within thirty (30) days (and in any event as soon as practicable)
following the submission to the Independent Accountant of their respective
final calculations of the Disputed Items as presented in the Buyers Closing
Balance Sheet and/or Closing Statement pursuant to _Section 2.4.2_ and the
Sellers Dispute Notice pursuant to _Section 2.4.3_ (which the Buyer and the
Seller shall submit to the Independent Accountant not later than ten (10) days
following the giving of the Dispute Submission Notice). Each of the Buyer and
the Seller shall, and the Buyer shall cause the Acquired Companies to, use
reasonable best efforts to comply with all reasonable requests by the
Independent Accountant for access to their respective work papers,
information, books, records and similar items, personnel and Representatives.
The Independent Accountant will review such final calculations of the Disputed
Items and will resolve the dispute with respect to each Disputed Item by
determining whether the Sellers final calculations thereof or the Buyers
final calculations thereof are more correct and, based on such determinations,
adopting either Sellers final calculations of such Disputed Item or all of
the Buyers final calculations of such Disputed Item. The Independent
Accountants determination will be (a) in writing and shall include a
reasonably detailed statement of the basis for the Independent Accountants
decision, (b) furnished to each of the Buyer and the Seller within thirty (30)
days, to the extent practicable, and in any event as promptly as practicable,
after the Sellers and the Buyers respective final calculations of the
Disputed Items have been submitted to the Independent Accountant, (c) limited
in scope to whether such final calculations of the Disputed Items were done in
accordance with this _Section 2.4_ and the Accounting Principles and/or
contained mathematical errors and (d) final, conclusive and binding on the
parties, and judgment on such decision may be entered in any court of
competent jurisdiction. The fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant
with respect to any dispute referred to the Independent Accountant pursuant to
this _Section 2.4.4_ shall be allocated between the Buyer, on the one hand,
and the Seller, on the other hand, based upon the percentage of the aggregate
dollar value

 



      
 

 



 

of the Disputed Items not awarded to the Buyer and the Seller , respectively,
bears to the amount actually contested by such party. For example, if the
Seller claims that the appropriate adjustments are $1,000 greater than the
amount determined by the Buyer and if the Independent Accountant ultimately
resolves such items by awarding to the Seller $300 of the $1,000 contested,
then the fees, costs and expenses of the Independent Accountant will be
allocated 30% (i.e., 300 ÷ 1,000) to the Buyer and 70% (i.e., 700 ÷ 1,000) to
the Seller. Neither the Buyer nor the Seller will disclose to the Independent
Accountant, and the Independent Accountant will not consider for any purpose,
the fact or content of any settlement discussions or settlement offer made by
or on behalf of the Buyer or the Seller, whether during the twenty (20) day
period referred to in this _Section 2.4.4_ or otherwise, unless otherwise
agreed by the Buyer and the Seller in writing.

 



 

2.4.5. _Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment_. As promptly as possible, but
in any event no later than the fifth (5th) Business Day following the final
determination, in accordance with _Section 2.4.3_ and/or _Section 2.4.4_, of
Working Capital, Cash on Hand, Company Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses
(respectively, the " _Final Working Capital Amount_ ", " _Final Cash on Hand
Amount_ ", " _Final Company Indebtedness_ ," and " _Final Transaction
Expenses_ ), the Closing Date Purchase Price shall be adjusted as follows:

 



 

(a) if (i) the sum of (A) the Final Working Capital Amount, _plus_ (B) the
Final Cash on Hand Amount, _minus_ (C) the Final Company Indebtedness, _minus_
(D) the Final Transaction Expenses is _less than_ (ii) the sum of (A) the
Estimated Working Capital Amount, _plus_ (B) the Estimated Cash on Hand
Amount, _minus_ (C) the Estimated Company Indebtedness, _minus_ (D) the
Estimated Transaction Expenses, _then_ (x) the Closing Date Purchase Price
will be reduced by an amount equal to such shortfall, which amount shall be
paid to the Buyer from the Adjustment Escrow Funds in accordance with the
terms of the Escrow Agreement by wire transfer of immediately available funds;
_provided_ , that, if the amount of the Adjustment Escrow Funds is
insufficient to cover such shortfall, the Seller will pay an amount equal to
the uncovered balance of such shortfall to the Buyer; and (y) if any of the
Adjustment Escrow Funds remain after such payment (if any) to the Buyer, the
Escrow Agent shall distribute such remaining Adjustment Escrow Funds, to the
Seller; or

 



 

(b) if (i) the sum of (A) the Final Working Capital Amount, _plus_ (B) the
Final Cash on Hand Amount, _minus_ (C) the Final Company Indebtedness, _minus_
(D) the Final Transaction Expenses is _greater than_ (ii) the sum of (A) the
Estimated Working Capital Amount, _plus_ (B) the Estimated Cash on Hand
Amount, _minus_ (C) the Estimated Company Indebtedness, _minus_ (D) the
Estimated Transaction Expenses, _then_ (x) the Closing Date Purchase Price
will be increased by an amount equal to such excess and the Buyer will pay
such excess to the Seller, and (y) the Escrow Agent shall distribute the
Adjustment Escrow Funds to the Seller.

 



      
 

 



 

Upon determination of the Final Working Capital Amount, the Final Cash on Hand
Amount, the Final Company Indebtedness and the Final Transaction Expenses
pursuant to this _Section 2.4_, each of the Buyer and the Seller shall
execute joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow
Agent to disburse any then remaining undisputed portions of the Adjustment
Escrow Funds in accordance with this _Section 2.4.5_.

action since January 1, 2017 with respect to any Employee Plan currently
maintained by an Acquired Company or with respect to any Employee Plan of any
corporation, trust, partnership or other entity that at any relevant time

the Code.

accelerate the time of payment or vesting or materially increase the amount of
compensation or benefits due to any employee, officer, director, or other
individual service provider of the Acquired Companies. Except as set forth on
_Schedule 3.10.6_ , neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor

good standing under the Legal Requirements of the jurisdiction of its
organization and (b) duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned,
leased or licensed by it or the nature of its business makes such
qualification, licensing or good standing necessary, except, in the case of
this subclause (b), where the failure to be so qualified or licensed or in
good standing has not had, and would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth
on _Schedule 4.1_ , the Seller was formed for the purpose of holding the
Equity Interests of the Company, has never conducted any business operations
and holds no material assets other than the Acquired Securities.

 



 

4.2. _Power and Authorization_. The Seller has the limited liability company
power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its
obligations hereunder. The Seller has taken all limited liability company
actions or proceedings required to be taken by or on the part of the Seller to
authorize and permit the execution and delivery by the Seller of this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the other documents and instruments
required to be executed and delivered by it pursuant hereto and thereto, and
the performance by the Seller of its obligations hereunder and the
consummation by the Seller of the Transactions. This Agreement has been (or in
the case of the Escrow Agreement, will be) duly executed and delivered by the
Seller, and assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by each of
the other parties hereto or thereto, constitutes (or will constitute) the
legal, valid and binding obligation of the Seller, enforceable against it in
accordance with its terms, except as the enforceability thereof may be limited
by (a) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or
similar Legal Requirements in effect which affect the enforcement of
creditors rights generally or (b) general principles of equity, whether
considered in a proceeding at law or in equity.

 



 

4.3. _Capitalization_. Seller is the record and beneficial owner of the
Acquired Securities (which, as of the Closing, will represent all of the

arrangement or agreement made by or on behalf of the Buyer or any of its

has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and business matters so
as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its investment in the
Acquired Securities and is capable of bearing the economic risks of such
investment. The Buyer is an informed and sophisticated purchaser, and has
engaged expert advisors, experienced in the evaluation and purchase of
investments such as the Acquired Securities as contemplated hereunder.

 



 

5.9. _Investigation_. The Buyer (a) has conducted its own independent review
and analysis of, and, based thereon, has formed an independent judgment
concerning, the business, assets, condition, operations and prospects of the
Acquired Companies, and (b) has been furnished with or given full access to
such key employees, documents, facilities and other information about the
Acquired Companies and their respective businesses and operations as it and
its Representatives have deemed necessary to enable it to make an informed
decision with respect to the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the Transactions. The Buyer has received all materials relating
to the business of the Acquired Companies that it has requested and has been
afforded the opportunity to obtain any additional information necessary to
verify the accuracy of any such information or of any representation or
warranty made by or regarding the Acquired Companies herein or to otherwise
evaluate the merits of the Transactions. The Company has answered, and the
Company has caused the other Acquired Companies to answer, to the Buyers
satisfaction all inquiries that the Buyer and its Representatives have made
concerning the business of the Acquired Companies or otherwise relating to the
Transactions. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in connection
with the Buyers investigation of the Acquired Companies, the Buyer or the
Buyers Representatives have received from or on behalf of the Acquired
Companies certain estimates and projections for the fiscal year 2017 and for
subsequent fiscal years, certain forecasts and certain business plan
information for such fiscal year and subsequent fiscal years. The Buyer
acknowledges that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such
estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans, that the Buyer is
familiar with such uncertainties, that the Buyer is taking full responsibility
for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates,
projections and other forecasts and plans so furnished to it (including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections and
forecasts), and that, except to the extent of inaccuracies in, or breaches of,
the representations and warranties of the Company and the Seller contained in
_Articles 3_ and _4_ , the Buyer shall have no claim against the Seller, any
Acquired Company, or any other Person with respect thereto. Accordingly, the
Buyer acknowledges and agrees that (i) representations and warranties of the
Company and the Seller contained in _Articles 3_ and _4_ are the only
representations and warranties made by the Acquired Companies and the Seller,
as applicable, in connection with the Transactions and supersede any and all
previous written and oral statements, if any, made by the Company, the Seller
or any of their respective Representatives, including those contained in, and
the underlying assumptions of, such estimates, projections, forecasts and
plans furnished to the Buyer; and (ii) the Seller and the Acquired Companies
expressly disclaim any representations or warranties of any kind or nature,
whether written or oral, express or implied, as to the condition, value or
quality of the securities or businesses or assets of any Acquired Company, and
the Acquired Company, and the Seller specifically disclaims any representation
or warranty of merchantability, usage, suitability or fitness for any
particular purpose with respect to such assets, any part thereof, the
workmanship thereof, and the absence of any defects therein, whether latent or
patent, and the Buyer shall rely solely on

 



      
 

 



 

its own examination and investigation thereof as well as the representations
and warranties of the Company and the Seller set forth in _Articles 3_ and
_4_.

of a non-disclosure agreement or undertaking with a third party, (b) that may
constitute privileged attorney-client communications or attorney work product,
the transfer of which, or the provision of access to which, as determined in
good faith by the Company after consultation with counsel, would reasonably be
expected to constitute a waiver of such privilege or (c) if the provision of
access to such document (or portion thereof) or information, as determined by
the Company in good faith after consultation with counsel, would reasonably be
expected to conflict with applicable Legal Requirements, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if the Company is so restricted, it shall, unless prohibited
or restricted under applicable Legal Requirements, notify the Buyer that
information or records are being withheld and take reasonable actions to
remove such restrictions and, to the extent possible, provide the Buyer with
as much information as permissible with respect to such document or
information.

generality of the foregoing, without the prior consent of the Buyer (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), prior to the
Closing Date, no Acquired Company will:

 



 

8.2.1. increase the compensation (including bonuses other than bonuses

premiums are in full force and effect;

 



 

8.2.13. merge, combine or consolidate with any Person; or

8.3.1. _Confidentiality Agreement_. The provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement, to the extent not inconsistent with the express terms of this
Agreement, are hereby ratified, confirmed and agreed to as though fully set

the Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (including, from and after the
Closing, the Acquired Companies) and its and their respective Representatives
to, keep confidential and not use or disclose documents and information
concerning any of the Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Acquired
Companies) furnished to the Buyer or its Affiliates or its or their respective
Representatives in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions and (b)
the Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and its and their respective
Representatives to, keep confidential and not use or disclose documents and
information concerning the business and operations of any Acquired Company.
Within thirty (30) days of the Closing, the Seller will change its limited
liability company name to eliminate "Accella Performance Materials" from its
name and will cease using such name in printed materials, signage, websites or
similar identifying materials that contain the name or trademark of any
Acquired Company.

 



 

8.3.2. _Announcements_. Any public announcements, reports, statements or press
releases by any party hereto or any of its Affiliates (including, from and
after the Closing, the Acquired Companies) regarding this Agreement or the
Transactions must be approved in advance (as to form, content, timing and
manner of distribution) by each of the Buyer and the Seller, which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any party may issue a press release or make a public
announcement to the extent necessary for such party to comply with applicable
Legal Requirements, and, to the extent practicable, shall provide a copy to
the other parties in advance of its release; _provided_ , _further_ , that the
foregoing shall not restrict communications between any party and its
Affiliates and their respective lenders, investors, potential investors and
other financing sources in the ordinary course of business.

 



 

8.3.3. _Permitted Disclosures_. No provision of this _Section 8.3_ will be
construed to prohibit (a) disclosures by any of the Acquired Companies to
suppliers, customers, lenders, employees, agents and independent contractors
of the Acquired Companies to the extent reasonably necessary or desirable, in
such Acquired Companys reasonable judgment, to preserve its business or
operations or to facilitate the Transactions; (b) confidential disclosures to
legal counsel, accounting advisors, financial advisors, investors or limited
partners, who shall be required to maintain such confidentiality with respect
to any such disclosure; (c) disclosures pursuant to the requirements of a

(d) disclosures required in connection with legal proceedings between the
parties, including to the extent reasonably necessary to enforce the parties
respective rights hereunder; or (e) disclosures of information that is
publicly available other than as a result of disclosures made in breach
hereof.

 



 

8.4. _Preparation for Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof,
each of the Company and the Buyer agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary or desirable under applicable Legal Requirements to
consummate the Transactions as promptly as practicable, including preparing
and filing as promptly as practicable with the applicable Governmental
Authorities all documentation to effect all necessary filings, notices,
petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information, applications
and other documents necessary to consummate the Transactions. In furtherance
(and not in limitation) of the foregoing:

 



 

8.4.1. _Antitrust Matters_. Each of the Company and the Buyer agrees to file
all appropriate notifications and filings pursuant to the HSR Act or any
applicable non-U.S. antitrust and competition laws with respect to the
Transactions in the most expeditious manner reasonably practicable (and, as to
the HSR Act, within ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof) and to
supply promptly any additional information and documentary material that may
be requested of such party by the relevant Governmental Authorities in
connection with the HSR Act or any applicable non-U.S. antitrust and
competition laws. Each of the Company and the Buyer agrees to use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain early termination of the waiting period
under the HSR Act. The Buyer agrees to take, and to cause its Affiliates to
take, any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate as soon as possible
each and every impediment under the HSR Act or any applicable non-U.S.
antitrust and competition laws that may be asserted by any U.S. or non-U.S.
governmental antitrust authority so as to enable the parties to expeditiously
consummate the Transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, nothing
in this _Section 8.4.1_ or otherwise in this Agreement shall require the Buyer
or any of its Affiliates (a) to propose, negotiate, effect, or agree to, the
sale, divestiture, license, or other disposition of any assets or businesses
of the Buyer, of any of its Affiliates or of the Company, or to take any other
action that limits the freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to
retain any of the businesses, product lines or assets of the Buyer, any of its
Affiliates or the Company, (b) to respond to a request for additional
information or documentary material issued by the U.S. Federal Trade
Commission or the U.S. Department of Justice pursuant to the HSR Act in
connection transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which request extends
the waiting period under the HSR Act until 30 days after both parties have
substantially complied with such request, or (c) to institute any legal
proceeding against any U.S. or non-U.S. governmental antitrust authority. The
Buyer shall pay all filing fees associated with the HSR filings and any
applicable non-U.S. antitrust and competition Legal Requirements. Each of the
Company and the Buyer agrees not to participate in any substantive meeting or
discussion, either in person or by telephone, with any U.S. or non-U.S.
governmental antitrust authority in connection with the Transactions unless it
consults with the other party in advance, if at all possible,

 



      
 

 



 

and, to the extent not prohibited by such governmental antitrust authority,
gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate. The Company
and the Buyer will supply each other with copies of all correspondence,
filings or communications with governmental antitrust authorities with respect
to the Transactions, and in the case of communications from a party to a
governmental antitrust authority shall do so in advance, with a reasonable
opportunity for review and comment thereon and for such review and comments to
be considered in good faith; _provided_ , _however_ , (a) that to extent any
of the documents or information are commercially or competitively sensitive,
the Company or the Buyer, as the case may be, may satisfy its obligations by
providing such documents or information to the other partys outside antitrust
counsel, with the understanding and agreement that such antitrust counsel
shall not share such documents and information with its client, and (b) that
neither party shall be required to produce documents or information relating
to its valuation of the Acquired Securities or the Company. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Buyer shall, on behalf of the
parties, control and lead all communications and strategy relating to the
Antitrust Laws and litigation matters relating to antitrust and competition
Legal Requirements, subject to good faith consultations with the Company and
the inclusion of the Company at meetings with Governmental Authorities with
respect to any discussion related to the Transactions under antitrust and
competition Legal Requirements.

 



 

8.4.2. _Certain Filings, Etc_. Each of the Buyer and the Company shall
cooperate with one another (a) in determining whether any action by or in
respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Authority is required, or any
actions, consents, approvals or waivers are required to be obtained from third
parties to any Leases or Material Contracts, in connection with the
consummation of the Transactions and (b) in taking such actions or making any
such filings, furnishing information required in connection therewith and
seeking timely to obtain any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers.

 



 

8.5. _Business Records_. The Buyer acknowledges that the Seller may from time
to time from and after the Closing require access to the Records, and agrees
that upon reasonable prior notice, it will, and will ensure that the Acquired
Companies will, during normal business hours, provide the Seller with either
access to or copies of the Records (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Tax
records relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period); _provided_ , _however_ , that
access to the Records shall not unreasonably interfere with the normal
operations of the Acquired Companies. If the Acquired Companies shall desire
to dispose of any such Records prior to the seventh (7th) anniversary of the
Closing Date, the Company shall, prior to any such disposition, notify the
Seller and provide the Seller a reasonable opportunity, at the Sellers
expense, to make copies of or remove such Records.

 



 

8.6. _Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

8.6.1. The Buyer and the Acquired Companies agree that all rights to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from liability for or
in connection with acts or omissions occurring at any time prior to or on the
Closing

 



      
 

 



 

Date, that now exist in favor of any Person who prior to or on the Closing
Date is or was a current or former director, officer or employee of an
Acquired Company, or who at the request of an Acquired Company served prior to
or on the Closing Date as a director, officer, member, manager, employee,
trustee or fiduciary of any other entity of any type (each a " _D andO
Indemnified Person_"), including as provided in the Organizational Documents
of an Acquired Company, will survive the Closing and will continue in full
force and effect for the six (6) year period following the Closing Date. In
furtherance (and not in limitation of) the foregoing, for the six (6) year
period following the Closing Date, the Buyer will cause the Acquired Companies
to, and the Acquired Companies will continue to contain in the Organizational
Documents of each of the Acquired Companies provisions with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from liability that
in each such respect are at least as favorable to each DandO Indemnified Person
as those contained in each Acquired Companys respective Organizational
Documents, as applicable, as in effect on the date hereof, which provisions
will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of any DandO Indemnified Person.

 



 

8.6.2. In addition to the other rights of each DandO Indemnified Person provided
for in this _Section 8.6_ and not in limitation thereof, from and after the
Closing, for the six (6) year period following the Closing Date, the Buyer

liabilities, awards, orders, decrees, rulings, judgments, fines, penalties,
settlement agreements, amounts paid in settlement, costs, charges, expenses
and fees (including attorneys and experts fees and expenses) based upon,
arising out of, in respect of or in connection with any threatened, pending or
completed claim, subpoena or other legal process, demand, action, arbitration,
suit or proceeding, whether criminal, civil, administrative or investigative,
based upon, arising out of, in respect of or in connection with any actual or
claimed acts or omissions occurring at any time prior to or on the Closing
Date (excluding any actual or claimed acts or omissions based upon, arising
out of, in respect of or in connection with the negotiation or approval of
this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions or a claim for
indemnification made pursuant to this Agreement) (each, a " _D andO
Indemnifiable Claim_") and (b) advance to such DandO Indemnified Persons all
costs, charges, expenses and fees (including attorneys and experts fees and
expenses) paid or incurred by a DandO Indemnified Person in connection with any
DandO Indemnifiable Claim, promptly following receipt of reasonable supporting
documentation thereof. Any DandO Indemnifiable Claim, and any claim for
advancement, in each case pending or asserted prior to or within the six (6)
year period following the Closing Date shall continue to be covered by this
_Section 8.6_ until the later of such time that such DandO Indemnifiable Claim
is fully and finally disposed of with no further exposure of a DandO Indemnified
Person of any kind or all settlement agreements,

 



       
 

 



 

judgments, orders, awards, decrees or other rulings in connection with such
DandO Indemnifiable Claim are fully and finally satisfied.

 



 

8.6.3. On or before the Closing Date, the Company will obtain, and pay any
premium payable with respect thereto, for the Acquired Companies, and, for a
six (6) year period following the Closing Date, the Buyer will cause the
Acquired Companies to maintain in effect, with no lapse in coverage, one or
more "tail" or "runoff" directors and officers liability and employment
practices liability insurance policies covering actual or claimed acts or
omissions of any DandO Indemnified Person occurring on or before the Closing
Date, in each case on terms with respect to coverage, retentions, amounts and
other material terms at least as favorable to such DandO Indemnified Persons as
those of such policies in effect on the date hereof.

 



 

8.6.4. If any Acquired Company (or any of its successors or assigns) (a)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person, or (b) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any other Person (including
by dissolution, liquidation, assignment for the benefit of creditors or
similar action), then, and in each such case, the Buyer will cause proper
provision to be made so that such other Person fully assumes the obligations
set forth in this _Section 8.6_.

 



 

8.6.5. The provisions of this _Section 8.6_ shall survive the Closing. This
_Section 8.6_ shall be for the irrevocable benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each DandO Indemnified Person and his or her respective heirs,
executors, administrators, estates, successors and assigns, and each such
Person shall be an express intended third party beneficiary of this Agreement
for such purposes. Buyer shall pay, or shall cause the Acquired Companies to
pay, as and when incurred by any Person referred to in the immediately
preceding sentence, all reasonable fees, costs, charges, and expenses incurred
by such Person in enforcing such Persons rights under this _Section 8.6_.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the obligations
under this _Section 8.6_ shall not be terminated, revoked, modified or
amended in any way so as to adversely affect any Person referred to in the
second sentence of this _Section 8.6.5_ without the written consent of such
Person. With respect to any right to indemnification or advancement for actual
or claimed acts or omissions occurring prior to or on the Closing Date, each
Acquired Company, as applicable, shall be the indemnitor of first resort,
responsible for all such indemnification and advancement that any DandO
Indemnified Person may otherwise have rights to from any direct or indirect
holder of Equity Interests of any of the Acquired Companies (or any Affiliate
of such holder of Equity Interests). Each of the Acquired Companies and the
Buyer further agrees that no advance or prepayment by any party other than the
Acquired Companies as the primary indemnitor on behalf of any DandO Indemnified
Person with respect to any claim for which such DandO Indemnified Person has
sought indemnification from any of the Acquired Companies shall affect the
foregoing and that any such secondary indemnitor shall have a right of
contribution and/or be subrogated to the extent of such advancement or payment
to all the rights of recovery of the DandO Indemnified Person against the
Acquired

 



      
 

 



 

Companies and the Acquired Companies hereby irrevocably release any such
secondary indemnitor from, and irrevocably waive and relinquish any right to
assert against any such secondary indemnitor, any and all claims for
contribution, subrogation or any other recovery of any kind in respect
thereof. Each of the Acquired Companies, the Buyer and the DandO Indemnified
Persons agree that the secondary indemnitors are express third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 8.6.5_.

 



 

8.7. _Employees_.

 



 

8.7.1. _WARN, Etc_. The Buyer will indemnify the Seller and its respective
Affiliates and defend and hold each of them harmless from and against any
losses that may be incurred by any of them under WARN or under other
applicable Legal Requirement with respect to a plant closing, layoff or
relocation or the like or with respect to any obligation to provide notice,
payment or any other benefit as a result of or arising out of any termination
of employment following the Closing Date.

 



 

8.7.2. _Employment of Employees_. For a period of twelve (12) months following
the Closing, the Buyer will provide each of Employees the following: (a) a
base rate of pay and severance opportunity not less than the base rate of pay
and severance opportunity available to such Employee as of the Closing; and
(b) bonus opportunities and benefits inclusive of severance that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to the benefits available to such
Employee immediately prior to the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , nothing
contained herein shall require the continuation of any benefit program not
otherwise offered by the Buyer. The Buyer will, and will cause the Acquired
Companies to, credit service rendered by the Employees prior to the Closing
for eligibility and vesting purposes (and solely with respect to vacation and
severance benefits, benefit accrual under all employee benefit plans,
programs, policies and arrangements of the Buyer and its Subsidiaries
(including the Acquired Companies) from and after the Closing to the same
extent as such service was taken into account under corresponding plans of the
Acquired Companies for such purposes, unless such service credit results in
duplication of benefits. Without limiting the foregoing, to the extent
permitted under the Buyers insurance arrangements with third parties, the
Buyer will provide that the Employees will not be subject to any pre-existing
condition or other limitation under any health or welfare plans of the Buyer
and its Subsidiaries (including the Acquired Companies) for any condition for
which such Employee would have been entitled to coverage under the
corresponding plan of the Acquired Companies in which such Employee
participated immediately prior to the Closing. The Buyer will cause such
Employees to be given credit under such plans for co-payments and other out-
of-pocket expenses made, and deductibles satisfied, for the plan year in which
the Closing occurs. Nothing set forth in this _Section 8.7.2_, express or
implied, is intended to confer upon any employee any right to continued
employment for any period, limit the Buyers ability to terminate the
employment of any employee at any time and for any reason, including without
cause or constitute the establishment of, or an amendment or other
modification to, any employee benefit or compensation plan,

 



      
 

 



 

program, policy, agreement or arrangement of the Buyer or any of the Acquired
Companies.

 



 

8.7.3. _Collective Bargaining Agreements_. The Buyer shall assume or will
cause the Acquired Companies to assume all collective bargaining agreements to
which any Acquired Company is subject immediately prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

8.7.4. _COBRA_. For the maximum period that a "qualifying beneficiary" (as
defined in Section 4980B(g)(1) of the Code and Section 607(3) of ERISA) is
eligible to elect COBRA continuation coverage, the Buyer shall, if and as
applicable, provide COBRA notices and, subject to timely election and
appropriate payment, COBRA coverage to all "MandA qualified beneficiaries" as
described in COBRA and the applicable Treasury Regulations thereunder.

 



 

8.8. _Tax Matters_.

 



 

8.8.1. _Transfer Taxes_. The Buyer and the Seller shall each be responsible
for one-half of all Transfer Taxes, if any, in connection with the
Transactions. Each of the parties hereto shall fully cooperate with the other
party with respect to the preparation and filing of any Tax Returns and other
filings relating to any such Transfer Taxes as may be required.

 



 

8.8.2. _Refunds and Credits_. Following the Closing Date, the amount of any
refunds (including, for the avoidance of doubt, overpayments of estimated
Taxes) or credits of Taxes (including any interest paid or credited with
respect thereto) of, or with respect to, the Acquired Companies that are
attributable or allocable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period (including the portion
of a Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date as determined pursuant to
_Section 8.8.6)_, will be payable by the Buyer to the Seller to the extent
not reflected in the calculation of the Final Working Capital, but shall be
reduced by the Buyer for any Taxes or other reasonable costs and expenses
incurred by the Acquired Companies in connection with claiming or receiving
such refund, credit or similar benefit. The Buyer will, if the Seller so
requests and at the Sellers expense, cause the relevant Acquired Company to
file any Tax Return (including any amended Tax Return) for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period or any portion of a Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date to claim
any refunds or credits to which the Seller may be entitled hereunder,
including through the prosecution of any proceeding which the Seller chooses
to direct such Acquired Company to pursue (such as a carryback claim). All
other Tax refunds, credits or similar benefits of the Acquired Companies shall
be solely the property of the Buyer.

 



 

8.8.3. _Cooperation and Tax Record Retention_. The Buyer and the Seller, shall
cooperate, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in
connection with the preparation and filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this
Section 8.8 and any Tax audit or administrative or judicial proceeding or of
any demand or claim on the Acquired Companies. Such cooperation shall include
signing any

 



      
 

 



 

Tax Returns, amended Tax Returns, claims or other documents necessary to
settle any Tax Proceeding, the retention and (upon the other Partys request)
the provision of records and information which are reasonably relevant to any
such Tax Proceeding or other proceeding and making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided hereby; provided that the obligations of the parties
pursuant to this _Section 8.8.3_ shall be subject to the provisions of
_Sections 8.8.6_ and _10.6_ of this Agreement.

 



 

8.8.4. _FIRPTA Certificate_. Prior to the Closing, Seller will deliver to the
Buyer a certificate dated as of the Closing Date, stating that Seller is not a
"foreign person" within the meaning of Section 1445(f)(3) of the Code, which
certificate shall set forth all information required by, and shall otherwise
be executed in accordance with, Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2(b)(2)
(the " _FIRPTA Certificate_ ").

 



 

8.8.5. _Straddle Periods_. For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any
Tax period that begins before and ends after the Closing Date (a " _Straddle
Period_ "), the amount of Taxes allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall
be deemed to be (i) in the case of Taxes imposed or Tax items determined on an
annual or periodic basis (such as real or personal property Taxes and
deductions or depreciation for real estate), the amount of such Taxes for the
entire period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number
of calendar days in the Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing
Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire
relevant Straddle Period, and (ii) in the case of Taxes not described in
clause (i) above (such as franchise Taxes or Taxes that are based upon or
related to income, payments or receipts, payroll, use or sales), the amount of
any such Taxes shall be determined as if such Tax period ended as of the close
of business on the Closing Date.

 



 

8.8.6. _Pre-Closing Tax Returns_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall, at the Companys expense, prepare or cause to be
prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns required to be filed by
the Acquired Companies (including such Tax Returns filed pursuant to any valid
extension of time to file and any amendments thereto) prior to the Closing
Date. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared in accordance with past practice of
the Acquired Companies unless otherwise required by Legal Requirements. No
later than ten (10) days prior to the due date (including extensions) for
filing such Tax Returns, the Seller shall deliver the Tax Returns described in
this Section 8.8.6(a) to the Buyer for its review and comment, and shall make
all such changes as are reasonably requested by the Buyer no later than five
(5) days prior to the due date (including extensions) for filing such Tax
Returns. The federal, state, local, and foreign income Tax Returns of the
Acquired Companies for the taxable year ending December 31, 2016 (the " _2016
Income Tax Returns_ ") shall be filed on or before the Closing Date, and the
amount agreed to and shown on the 2016 Income

 



      
 

 



 

Tax Returns shall be paid by the Acquired Companies on or prior to the Closing
Date to the extent not previously paid by the Acquired Companies. If Seller
does not agree to any change requested by Buyer for the 2016 Income Tax
Returns, Buyer and Seller shall immediately submit the disputed items to the
Independent Accountant for resolution. If the Independent Accountant makes a
determination with respect to the disputed item or items prior to the due date
of the 2016 Income Tax Returns, then such 2016 Income Tax Returns shall be
filed reflecting the determination of the Independent Accountant regarding the
disputed or items. If the Independent Accountant has not resolved the disputed
item or items prior to the due date of such 2016 Income Tax Returns, then such
Tax Returns shall be filed as prepared by the Seller, including any changes to
which Buyer and Seller have agreed; provided, that (i) upon determination of
the disputed item or items by the Independent Accountant, Buyer and Seller
shall cooperate to file amended 2016 Income Tax Returns reflecting such
determination, and (ii) if the determination of the Independent Accountant
occurs after the Closing Date, any additional income Taxes resulting from the
disputed items shall be reflected in the Estimated Taxes Payable at Closing.

 



 

(b) The Seller shall, at the Sellers expense, prepare or cause to be prepared
all Tax Returns for the Acquired Companies for all taxable periods ending on
or prior to the Closing Date that are due after the Closing Date. All such Tax
Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practice of the
Acquired Companies, to the extent such past practice complies with applicable
Law and, to the extent applicable, with the method of accounting for items on
the 2016 Income Tax Returns, including any changes included or to be included
on such 2016 Income Tax Returns as a result of an agreement of Buyer and
Seller or a determination by the Independent Accountant pursuant to this
Section _8.8.6(a) _of this Agreement. No later than thirty (30) days prior
to the due date (including extensions) for filing such Tax Returns, the Seller
shall deliver the Tax Returns described in this _Section 8.8.6(b)_ to the
Buyer for its review and comment. The Seller shall make all such changes as
are reasonably requested by the Buyer, and shall deliver the Tax Returns,
completed as approved by the Buyer and duly executed by an authorized Person,
to the Buyer no later than ten (10) days prior to the due date (including
extensions) for filing such Tax Returns. The Buyer or its Affiliate shall file
or cause to be filed all such Tax Returns on or prior to the due date
(including extensions) for filing such Tax Returns, and shall timely pay all
Taxes due as reflected on such Tax Returns. The Seller shall remit to the
Buyer, no later than five (5) days prior to the due date (including
extensions) for filing such Tax Returns, the amount of any Taxes due as
reflected on such Tax Returns (as approved and delivered by Seller pursuant to
this _Section 8.8.6(b)_) to the extent such Taxes are not specifically
reflected in the calculation of Estimated Taxes Payable or the Final Working
Capital Amount. Not less than ten (10) days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall prepare and deliver to the Buyer a detailed itemization and
description of any Taxes due or owed which the Company seeks to include in the
calculation of Estimated Taxes Payable. Buyer shall have seven (7) days to
dispute calculation of Estimated Taxes Payable. If Seller does not agree to
any change requested by Buyer to the calculation of

 



      
 

 



 

Estimated Taxes Payable, the Parties shall immediately submit the disputed
items to the Independent Accountant for resolution. If the Independent
Accountant makes a determination with respect to the disputed item or items
prior to the Closing Date, the items shall be reflected in the calculation of
Estimated Taxes Payable as determined by the Independent Accountant, to the
extent not already paid by the Acquired Companies. If the Independent
Accountant has not resolved the disputed item or items prior to the Closing
Date, then amount of the disputed item or items shall be included in the
calculation of Estimated Taxes Payable until a determination is made with
respect to disputed item or items by the Independent Accountant.

 



 

(c) The Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed any Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies for any Straddle Period (the "
_Straddle Returns_ "). All Straddle Returns shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with past practices of the Company, to the extent such past
practice complies with applicable Law. No later than thirty (30) days prior to
the due date (including extensions) for filing the Straddle Returns, the Buyer
shall deliver the Straddle Returns to the Seller for review and comment. The
Buyer shall make all changes with respect to Straddle Returns as are
reasonably requested by the Seller, shall file or cause to be filed the
Straddle Returns on or prior to the due date (including extensions) for filing
such Straddle Returns, and shall timely pay all Taxes due as reflected on such
Straddle Returns. The Seller shall remit to the Buyer an amount equal to the
Taxes due as reflected on such Straddle Returns, to the extent that such Taxes
(i) are apportioned to a Pre-Closing Tax Period and (ii) are not specifically
reflected in the calculation of Estimated Taxes Payable or the Final Working
Capital Amount, at least five (5) days prior to the due date (including
extensions) for filing such Straddle Returns.

 



 

(d) To the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, the parties
hereto agree to report the deductibility of the Transaction Tax Deductions on
the Companys Tax Returns filed for Pre Closing Tax Periods or (or otherwise
allocate the deductibility of the Transaction Tax Deductions to Pre-Closing
Tax Periods).

 



 

8.8.7. _Close of Tax Year_. The parties hereto shall, to the extent permitted
or required under applicable Legal Requirements, treat the Closing Date as the
last day of the taxable period of the Acquired Companies for all Tax purposes.

 



 

8.8.8. _Post-Closing Tax Covenants_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, the Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates
(including the Acquired Companies) not to, with respect to any Acquired
Company, (i) file an election under Section 338 of the Code, unless requested
to do so by Seller, (ii) file an amended Tax Return for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period except pursuant to Section 8.8.2 of this Agreement, or (iii) apply to
any Taxing Authority for any binding or non-binding opinion, ruling, or other
determination, or voluntarily initiate any discussion or make any voluntary
disclosure with any Taxing Authority, with respect to the Acquired Companies
in relation to any act,

 



      
 

 



 

matter, or transaction that occurred on or before the Closing Date or that
relates to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period; _provided_ , that
any disclosure required under a continuous audit or similar agreement with a
Taxing Authority shall not constitute a voluntary disclosure or otherwise be
subject to this _Section 8.8.8(iii)_.

 



 

8.8.9. _280G Waivers and Shareholder Vote_. The Company shall submit to Seller
(subject to Treasury Regulations Section 1.280G-1 Q/A-7(b)(3)) promptly after
the date hereof, for approval by a vote of such sole member of the Company as
is required pursuant to Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder (the " _280G Shareholder Vote_ "), any severance or
retention payments, accelerated vesting payments, benefits, options and/or
stock, or other payments that may separately or in the aggregate constitute
"parachute payments" under Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code and the applicable
rulings and Treasury Regulations thereunder (" _Parachute Payments_ ") such
that, if the 280G Shareholder Vote is received approving such Parachute
Payments, such Parachute Payments shall not be deemed to be "excess parachute
payments" under Section 280G of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder. Prior to such 280G Shareholder Vote, the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to obtain, from each person who might receive or have
the right or entitlement to receive any Parachute Payment, a written waiver
(in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer) pursuant to which
such person agrees to waive any and all right or entitlement to such Parachute
Payment, to the extent such payment would not be deductible pursuant to
Section 280G of the Code (each, a " _280G Waiver_ " and collectively, the "
_280G Waivers_ "). Such 280G Waivers shall cease to have any force or effect
with respect to any item covered thereby to the extent the 280G Shareholder
Vote for such item is obtained. The form of 280G Waiver, solicitation of
approval, and disclosure materials shall be reasonably satisfactory to Buyer,
which shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity review such documents and any
analysis with respect to Parachute Payments before the 280G Waivers and 280G
Shareholder Vote are sought. Not less than five (5) days prior to the Closing
Date, the Company shall provide Buyer with properly completed and executed
280G Waivers and approval documents to the extent obtained, and shall provide,
whether or not the 280G Shareholder Vote is obtained approving the Parachute
Payments, an updated analysis with respect to the Parachute Payments. To the
extent that an executive has waived such payments or benefits and the 280G
Shareholder Vote is not obtained approving such payments or benefits, the
Company shall not pay any such payments or benefits.

 



 

8.9. _Further Assurances_. Each of the Seller and the Buyer, upon the request
of the other from time to time following the Closing, and at the expense of
the requesting party but without further consideration, shall sign such
documents and take such actions as may be necessary or otherwise reasonably
requested to make more fully effective the consummation of the Transactions.

 



 

8.10. _Exclusivity_. During the period from the date of this Agreement through
the Closing or the earlier termination of this Agreement pursuant to the terms
and conditions

 



      
 

 



 

hereof, none of the Acquired Companies, the Seller or their respective
Affiliates shall take or permit any other Person on its behalf to take any
action to encourage, initiate or engage in discussions or negotiations with,
or provide any information to, any Person (other than Buyer and Buyers
Representatives) concerning any purchase of the Acquired Securities, any
merger or recapitalization involving the Acquired Companies, any sale of all
or substantially all of the assets of the Acquired Companies or similar
transaction involving the Acquired Companies (other than assets sold in the
ordinary course of business, subject to the provisions of _Section 8.2_). The
Seller shall, and shall cause all of the Acquired Companies and their
respective Representatives to, immediately terminate any and all negotiations
or discussions with any third party regarding any proposal concerning any
purchase of the Acquired Securities, any merger or recapitalization involving
the Acquired Companies, any sale of all or substantially all the assets of the
Acquired Companies or other similar transaction and terminate the access of
any Person (other than Buyer or its Representatives) to any electronic or
virtual data room maintained in connection with any of the foregoing. The
Company shall promptly (and in any event within 48 hours of the occurrence of
the relevant event) notify the Buyer orally and in writing if any bona fide
inquiries, proposals or requests for information concerning any purchase of
the Acquired Securities, any merger or recapitalization involving the Acquired
Companies, any sale of all or substantially all the assets of the Acquired
Companies or other similar transaction are received by the Company or any
Representatives of the Company.

 



 

8.11. _R andW Insurance Policy_. Subject to the other provisions of this
_Section 8.11_, the Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
promptly bind the RandW Insurance Policy for representations and warranties set
forth in _Article 3_ and _Article 4_ as of the Closing Date on terms not
materially less favorable to the Buyer in the aggregate than the terms set
forth on _Exhibit A_ (assuming for the purposes hereof that any matter
described in Item 6 of _Exhibit A_ (whether described in Item 6 as an
exclusion or as an area of heightened risk) will be excluded from coverage
under the RandW Insurance Policy). The costs and expenses of the RandW Insurance
Policy shall be borne by the Buyer. If, within ten (10) days of the date
hereof, the Buyer has been unable to obtain such RandW Insurance Policy, then
the Seller must elect within twenty-one (21) days following such ten (10) day
period, in its discretion, to either (i) provide notice to the Buyer of its
intent to terminate this Agreement by providing the Buyer with at least five
(5) Business Days prior written notice of such intention to terminate (the "
_Termination Notice_ "), (ii) if the Buyer has proposed a RandW Insurance Policy
that is materially less favorable to the Buyer in in the aggregate than the
terms set forth on _Exhibit A_, provide the Buyer notice of its intent to
accept the Buyers proposed RandW Insurance Policy by providing the Buyer with
at least five (5) Business Days prior written notice of such intent to accept,
or (iii) obtain the RandW Insurance Policy with an aggregate premium not to
exceed $1,865,000 for the benefit of the Buyer, the costs and expenses of
which shall be borne as provided in the foregoing sentence except that the
Seller may at its election pay the amount of the aggregate premium which
exceeds $1,865,000. In the event the Seller accepts the Buyers proposed RandW
Insurance Policy pursuant to clause (ii) above or obtains a RandW Insurance
Policy pursuant to clause (iii) above, the Seller shall indemnify the Buyer
for any Losses incurred by the Buyer to the extent such Losses would have been
covered by the RandW Insurance Policy but for specific exclusions under the RandW
Insurance Policy that that are not included as an exclusion or an area of
heightened risk in Item 6 of _Exhibit A_, which indemnification liability
shall be limited to recovery of Indemnification Escrow Funds,

 



      
 

 



 

if any, in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. In the event
that the Seller provides a Termination Notice to the Buyer, the Buyer shall
have the right to notify the Seller, within five (5) Business Days of its
receipt of the Termination Notice, that it has agreed to purchase a RandW
Insurance Policy on terms no less favorable to the Buyer in any respect than
the terms set forth on _Exhibit A_ or waives its right to obtain a RandW
Insurance Policy and seeks to close the Transactions (but subject to the
satisfaction and waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article 6_). In the
event the Buyer delivers such a notice to the Seller, the Termination Notice
shall be automatically rescinded and of no force and effect. Any termination
of this Agreement resulting from this _Section 8.11_ shall be treated as a
termination pursuant to _Section 9.1.1_ of this Agreement for all purposes
of this Agreement. While Buyer will use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain a RandW Insurance Policy that may be bound promptly, the inability to
procure a RandW Insurance Policy that cannot be bound until some later date, up
to and including Closing, shall not make the RandW Insurance Policy
nonconforming for purposes of this provision.

_Section 8.4_.

 



 

9.1.6. The Seller may terminate this Agreement, with no need to allow any
additional cure period, by delivering written notice to the Buyer at any time
prior to the Closing in the event that all of the conditions set forth in
_Article 6_ have been satisfied and remain satisfied (other than those
conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, which
conditions shall be capable of being satisfied if the Closing were to occur),
the Seller has confirmed in writing to the Buyer that the Seller is ready,
willing and able to consummate the Closing upon the satisfaction or waiver of
those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing and
the Buyer fails to complete the Closing on the date the Closing should have
occurred pursuant to _Section 2.2_ (other than as a result of the failure to
satisfy those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the
Closing) (a " _Buyer Failure to Close_ ").

 



 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Buyer may not
terminate this Agreement following any Buyer Failure to Close.

 



 

9.2. _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Section 9.1_, all rights and obligations of the parties hereunder will
terminate without any liability of any party or any Affiliate thereof;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (a) the rights and obligations under _Section
8.3_ (Confidentiality), this _Section 9.2_ (Effect of Termination), _Article
1_ (Definitions), _Article 11_ (Miscellaneous) and the Confidentiality
Agreement, will, in each case, survive termination of this Agreement and
remain valid and binding obligations, and (b) nothing herein will relieve any
party to this Agreement from liability (i) pursuant to the sections specified
in this _Section 9.2_ that survive such termination or (ii) for any willful
and material breach of any covenant or agreement contained herein occurring
prior to termination.

 



 

 **10.** **SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION.**

 



 

10.1. _Survival_. The representations and warranties of the Company contained
in _Article 3_, the representations and warranties of the Seller contained in
_Article 4_ and representations and warranties of Buyer contained in _Article
5_ shall survive the Closing until

 



       
 

 



 

11:59 p.m. (New York time) on the date that is twelve (12) months following
the Closing, except that Fundamental Representations and the representations
and warranties of the Buyer in _Section 5.8_ shall survive the Closing until
11:59 p.m. (New York time) on November 30, 2021. The covenants and agreements
in this Agreement, to the extent performance or fulfillment thereof is
required by its terms to be accomplished at or prior to the Closing, shall
survive the Closing until 11:59 p.m. (New York time) on the date that is
twelve (12) months following the Closing. The covenants and agreements in this
Agreement, to the extent performance or fulfillment thereof is required by its
terms to be accomplished following the Closing, shall survive the Closing in
accordance with their respective terms only for such period as shall be
required for the party required to perform under such covenant to complete the
performance required thereby. To the extent the ability to bring a claim
within any of the foregoing survival periods is limited by Section 8106(c) of
Title 10 of the Delaware Code, the survival period applicable to such claim
will be limited to the maximum period permitted by such section.

 



 

10.2. _Indemnification by the Seller; Limitations_.

 



 

10.2.1. Subject to _Sections 10.1_, _10.2.2_ , _10.2.3_ and _10.2.4_ , from

Indemnified Parties_ "), shall be reimbursed, indemnified and held harmless by
the Seller from and against any and all costs, losses, damages, liabilities,
demands, actions or causes of action (including third party claims), charges,
interest, judgments, sanctions, fines, penalties, settlements, and reasonable
fees and expenses (including reasonable legal, accounting and investigation
fees and expenses) in connection with any of the foregoing or similar damages
incurred, sustained or suffered by them (collectively, " _Losses_ ") arising
out of or attributable to (a) any failure of any representation or warranty of
the Company in _Article 3_ or any representation or warranty of the Seller in
_Article 4_ to be true and correct on the date of this Agreement and as of
the Closing Date as if made on and as of the Closing Date, except that any
such representations and warranties which by their express terms are made
solely as of a specified earlier date need be true and correct only as of such
specified earlier date, in each case without giving effect to any
qualifications as to materiality, Material Adverse Effect or similar
qualifications contained in such representations and warranties, (b) any
failure by the Company to perform any of the covenants or agreements of the
Company contained in this Agreement, to the extent to be performed prior to
the Closing, (c) any failure by the Seller to perform any of the covenants or
agreements of the Seller contained in this Agreement, (d) subject to Sections
_8.8.8_ and _10.4.1_ , Taxes with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period (or
the non-payment thereof) of, or attributable to, (A) the Acquired Companies,
(B) any Person (other than the Acquired Companies) for which the Acquired
Companies may be liable pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or
any similar Legal Requirements), as a transferee or successor, by Contract or
otherwise or (C) the corporate restructuring transactions described on
_Schedule 10.2.1(d)_ or (e) the matters set forth on _Schedule 10.2.1(e)_
(for the avoidance of doubt, no exception, qualification or limitation to the
representations and warranties of the Company in _Article 3_ or the Seller in

 



      
 

 



 

 _Article 4_ which is set forth on, or otherwise reflected in, the Disclosure
Schedules shall operate to limit or otherwise adversely affect the rights of
the Buyer Indemnified Parties under this _Section 10.2.1_ in respect of the
matters set for on _Schedule 10.2.1(e))_.

 



 

10.2.2. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
other than for Losses resulting from claims brought on the basis of Fraud,
none of the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to be reimbursed,
indemnified and held harmless from and against Losses under _Section
10.2.1(a)_ unless and until the aggregate amount of such Losses suffered,
sustained or incurred by all of the Buyer Indemnified Parties, collectively,
under _Section 10.2.1(a)_ with respect to which the Buyer Indemnified Parties
would otherwise be entitled to be reimbursed, indemnified and held harmless
exceeds the Basket Amount, in which case the obligations to reimburse,
indemnify and hold harmless the applicable Buyer Indemnified Party shall be
only for the amount of such Losses in excess of such amount; _provided_ ,
_that_ , such limitation shall not apply to Losses arising out of or
attributable to any failure of the Fundamental Representations to be true and
correct and the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to be reimbursed,
indemnified and held harmless from the first dollar with respect to such
Losses.

 



 

10.2.3. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
other than for Losses resulting from claims brought on the basis of Fraud, (a)
recovery by the Buyer Indemnified Parties from Seller for Losses under
_Section 10.2.1(a)_ which are not excluded from coverage under the RandW
Insurance Policy shall be limited to $3,350,000 and (b) recovery by the Buyer
Indemnified Parties from Seller for any Losses under _Section 10.2.1_ shall
be limited to recovery of Indemnification Escrow Funds, if any, in accordance
with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

 



 

10.2.4. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
other than for Losses resulting from claims brought on the basis of Fraud, the
indemnification obligation of Seller for Losses for Taxes covered by clauses
(d)(A) and (d)(B) of _Section 10.2.1_ shall be limited to Losses for such
items that arise out of or are attributable to an assessment or audit
initiated by a Governmental Authority, or administrative or court proceeding
resulting from an assessment or audit initiated by a Governmental Authority
and shall not include any Losses that arise out of or result from the Buyer or
any of its Affiliates taking any of the actions set forth in _Section
8.8.8(ii)_ or _(iii)_ of this Agreement. If the Buyer or any of its
Affiliates receives any payment from Seller for Losses for Taxes covered by
clause (d)(B) of _Section 10.2.1_ or as a result of a breach of the
representations and warranties in _Section 3.7.4_, the Acquired Companies and
the Buyer and its Affiliates shall, to the extent applicable, assign any
contractual indemnification or similar rights to seek recovery for such Losses
from another Person to the Seller and shall be subrogated to the Seller.

 



      
 

 



 

10.3. _Indemnification by the Buyer; Limitations_.

 



 

10.3.1. Subject to _Sections 10.1_ , _10.3.2_ and _10.3.3_ , from and after
the Closing, the Seller and its Affiliates, officers, directors, stockholders,
agents and other representatives (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified
Parties_ "), shall be reimbursed, indemnified and held harmless by the Buyer
from and against any and all Losses arising out of or attributable to (a) any
failure of any representation or warranty of the Buyer in _Article 5_ to be
true and correct on the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date as
if made on and as of the Closing Date, except that any such representations
and warranties which by their express terms are made solely as of a specified
earlier date need be true and correct only as of such specified earlier date,
in each case without giving effect to any qualifications as to materiality,
Material Adverse Effect or similar qualifications contained in such
representations and warranties, and (b) any failure by the Buyer to perform
any of the covenants or agreements of the Buyer contained in this Agreement.

 



 

10.3.2. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
other than for Losses resulting from claims brought on the basis of Fraud,
none of the Seller Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to be reimbursed,
indemnified and held harmless from and against Losses under _Section
10.3.1(a)_ unless and until the aggregate amount of such Losses suffered,
sustained or incurred by all of the Seller Indemnified Parties, collectively,
under _Section 10.3.1(a)_ with respect to which the Seller Indemnified
Parties would otherwise be entitled to be reimbursed, indemnified and held
harmless exceeds the Basket Amount, in which case the obligations to
reimburse, indemnify and hold harmless the applicable Seller Indemnified Party
shall be for the amount of such Losses in excess of such amount.

 



 

10.3.3. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
other than for Losses resulting from claims brought on the basis of Fraud, the
maximum aggregate liability of the Buyer to Seller Indemnified Parties for any
Losses under _Section 10.3.1_ shall not exceed $25,000,000.

 



 

10.4. _Additional Limitations on Indemnification_.

 



 

10.4.1. The amount of any Losses suffered, sustained or incurred by any
Indemnified Party shall be reduced by the amount such Indemnified Party
actually recovers (after deducting all attorneys fees, expenses and other
costs of recovery (including any deductible amount), any resultant increase in
insurance premiums of the Indemnified Party) from any insurer (excluding
coverage under any self-insurance or captive insurance) or other Person then
liable for such Losses and, in the case of Tax related items on _Schedule
10.2.1(d)_ or _Schedule 10.2.1(e)_, amounts already taken into account in
determining the Final Working Capital Amount or Estimated Taxes Payable and
amounts paid pursuant to _Sections 8.8.6(b)_ and _(c)_. No Indemnified Party
shall be permitted to recover Losses in respect of a claim for which such
Indemnified Party has otherwise been compensated for such matter pursuant to,
or the Loss was taken into account under, any other provision of this
Agreement, so as to avoid duplication or "double counting" of the same Loss.

 



      
 

 



 

10.4.2. If any Indemnified Party receives any amounts under insurance coverage
or from any Person with respect to Losses sustained at any time subsequent to
any payment to such Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Article 10_ then such
Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the applicable Indemnifying Parties
for any payment made up to such amount received under insurance coverage with
respect to such Losses (subject to the limitations set forth in _Section
10.4.1_ above).

 



 

10.4.3. In connection with any Losses for which a Buyer Indemnified Party
makes a claim, such Buyer Indemnified Party agrees to promptly submit the
claim for such Losses against insurance coverage (including the RandW Insurance
Policy and any environmental policy or policies) maintained by such Buyer
Indemnified Party, to the extent such Buyer Indemnified Party reasonably
concludes that coverage may be available thereunder. Following the submission
of such claim for Losses, the Buyer Indemnified Parties covenant and agree to
use good faith commercially reasonable efforts to recover the fullest extent
of the Losses.

 



 

10.5. _Notice and Determination of Claims_. If a claim for Losses is to be
made by any Indemnified Party that does not involve a third party, such
Indemnified Party shall give written notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to the
Seller if the Claim Notice is being given by a Buyer Indemnified Party and to
the Buyer if the Claim Notice is being given by an Seller Indemnified Party,
in each case, within a reasonable time after such Indemnified Party becomes
aware of any Losses for which indemnification may be sought under this
_Article 10_. The Claim Notice shall specify in reasonable detail, to the
extent reasonably known and practicable at such time, the amount of the claim
and the basis for indemnification. The failure of any Indemnified Party to
give timely notice hereunder shall not affect such Indemnified Partys rights
to indemnification hereunder, except to the extent the applicable Indemnifying
Parties are actually prejudiced by such delay or failure, in which case the
amount of reimbursement to which the Indemnified Party is entitled shall be
reduced by the amount, if any, by which the Indemnified Partys Losses would
have been less had such Claim Notice been timely given. If the applicable
Indemnifying Parties notify the Indemnified Party that they do not dispute the
claim described in such Claim Notice or fail to respond within thirty (30)
days following receipt of such Claim Notice, the Losses identified in the
Claim Notice will be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party
under _Section 10.2_ or _Section 10.3_, as applicable. If the applicable
Indemnifying Parties dispute in writing their liability with respect to such
claim or the estimated amount of such Losses pursuant to this _Section 10.5_
within thirty (30) days following receipt of such Claim Notice, the parties
shall attempt in good faith to resolve such dispute; _provided_ , that if such
dispute has not been resolved within sixty (60) days following receipt of such
Claim Notice, then the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party may seek
legal redress in accordance with _Article 11_.

 



 

10.6. _Third Party Claims_.

 



 

10.6.1. If any Indemnified Party receives notice of the assertion or
commencement of any suit, action, claim, audit, arbitration or proceeding by a
third party with respect to a matter subject to indemnity hereunder (a "
_Third Party_

 



      
 

 



 

 _Claim_ "), such Indemnified Party shall give written notice thereof (a "
_Third Party Notice_ ") to the Seller if the Third Party Notice is being given
by a Buyer Indemnified Party and to the Buyer if the Third Party Notice is
being given by a Seller Indemnified Party, in each case, within a reasonable
time after such Indemnified Party becomes aware of such Third Party Claim. The
Third Party Notice shall specify in reasonable detail, to the extent
reasonably known and practicable at such time, the amount of the Third Party
Claim to which the Third Party Notice pertains and the basis for
indemnification, and will include copies of all notices and documents
(including court papers) served on or received by the Indemnified Party in
connection with the Third Party Claim. The failure of any Indemnified Party to
give timely notice hereunder shall not affect such Indemnified Partys rights
to indemnification hereunder, except to the extent such delay or failure
actually prejudices the Indemnifying Parties ability to defend such Third
Party Claim, and the amount of reimbursement to which the Indemnified Party is
entitled shall be reduced by the amount, if any, by which the Indemnified
Partys Losses would have been less had such Third Party Notice been timely
delivered. After receipt of a Third Party Notice, the Indemnifying Parties
shall have the right, subject in all instances to the terms of the RandW
Insurance Policy (including the ability of the insurer thereunder to direct
and control the defense of any claims), but not the obligation, by providing
written notice to the Indemnified Party, subject to _Section 10.6.3_, to (A)
take control of the defense and investigation of such Third Party Claim at the
Indemnifying Partys sole costs and expense, (B) employ and engage attorneys
of its, his or her own choice (subject to the approval of the Indemnified
Party, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)
to handle and defend the same, at the Indemnifying Parties sole cost and
expense, and (C) compromise or settle such claim, which compromise or
settlement shall be made only with the written consent of the Indemnified
Party; _provided_ , that such consent will not be required if such settlement
includes an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party and provides solely
for payment of monetary damages for which the Indemnified Party will be
indemnified in full under this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the
Third Party Claim involves an audit or proceeding related to Taxes for a
Straddle Period, the Buyer shall control the defense of the Tax audit or
proceeding, in which case the Buyer will keep the Seller reasonably informed
of the status of the Tax audit or proceeding and not settle any matters
related to the Tax audit or proceeding that will result in an Indemnification
obligation of the Seller without the prior written consent of the Seller, not
to be unreasonably withheld.

 



 

10.6.2. In the event that the Indemnifying Party desires to defend the
Indemnified Party against a Third Party Claim, (A) the Indemnifying Party
shall use its reasonable best efforts to defend diligently such Third Party
Claim, (B) the Indemnified Party, prior to the period in which the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of such matter, may take such
reasonable actions to preserve any and all rights with respect to such matter,
without such actions being construed as a waiver of the Indemnified Partys
rights to defense and indemnification pursuant to this Agreement, but with
such actions not being determinative of the amount of

 



      
 

 



 

any Losses, and (C) the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have agreed that
it shall indemnify the Indemnified Party for all Losses resulting from such
Third Party Claim pursuant to and subject to the conditions of this _Article
10_. The Indemnified Party shall cooperate in all reasonable respects, at the
Indemnifying Parties request, with the Indemnifying Parties and their
attorneys in the investigation, trial and defense of such Third Party Claim
and any appeal arising therefrom, in each case, at the expense of the
Indemnifying Parties. The Indemnified Party may, at its own sole cost and
expense, monitor and further participate in (but not control) the
investigation, trial and defense of such Third Party Claim and any appeal
arising therefrom; _provided_ , _however_ , that if (1) the employment of
counsel shall have been authorized in writing by the Indemnifying Parties in
connection with the defense of such Third Party Claim, or (2) such Indemnified
Party shall have reasonably concluded that a conflict or potential conflict
exists between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Parties or there may
be defenses available to the Indemnified Party that are contrary to, or
inconsistent with, those available to the Indemnifying Parties and such
Indemnified Party has not elected to defend such Third Party Claim pursuant to
_Section 10.6.3_, then, in any such event, the fees and expenses of not more
than one additional counsel for the Indemnified Party shall be borne by the
Indemnifying Parties.

 



 

10.6.3. Notwithstanding the foregoing in this _Section 10.6_, if (A) the
Indemnifying Party elects not to assume such defense and investigation or does
not acknowledge in writing within a reasonable period, but no later than ten
(10) days, after receipt of the Third Party Notice, its obligation to
indemnify the Indemnified Party against any Losses arising from such Third
Party Claim, (B) the Indemnifying Party fails to actively and diligently, with
legal counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party, conduct the
defense of such Third Party Claim, (C) such Third Party Claim seeks an
injunction or other equitable remedies in respect of the Indemnified Party or
its business or involves any Governmental Authority, (D) such Third Party
Claim is reasonably likely to result in liabilities that, taken with other
then-existing claims under this _Article 10_, would not be fully indemnified
hereunder, (E) the Indemnified Party has been advised by counsel that an
actual or potential conflict exists between the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Parties in connection with the defense of the Third Party Claim,
(F) such Third Party Claim seeks a finding or admission of a violation of any
Legal Requirement or violation of the rights of any Person by the Indemnified
Party or any of its Affiliates, or (G) such Third Party Claim relates to any
ongoing business of the Indemnified Party (which, in the case of the Buyer,
shall include the Company), then the Indemnified Party shall have the right,
but not the obligation (upon delivering notice to such effect to the
Indemnifying Parties) to retain counsel of its choosing, defend such Third
Party Claim and have the sole power to direct and control such defense (all at
the cost and expense of the Indemnifying Parties); it being understood that
the Indemnified Partys right to indemnification for a Third Party Claim shall
not be adversely affected by assuming the defense of such Third Party Claim.

 



      
 

 



 

10.6.4. The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to avoid production of confidential
information (consistent with Legal Requirements), and to cause all
communications among employees, counsel and others representing any party to a
Third Party Claim to be made so as to preserve any applicable attorney-client
or work-product privileges.

 



 

10.7. _Release of Indemnification Escrow Funds_. The Escrow Agreement shall
provide that (a) on each of the escrow step-down dates set forth in _Schedule
10.7_ (the " _Escrow Step-Down Dates_ "), all funds then-remaining in the
Indemnity Escrow Account in excess of an amount equal to (X) the escrow
retention amount set forth next to the corresponding Escrow Step-Down Date in
_Schedule 10.7_ _plus_ (Y) the amount of any Losses determined by the Buyer
reasonably and in good faith arising out of any then unresolved claims for
indemnification pursuant to _Section 10.2_ that have been timely and properly
made and delivered to the Seller prior to such Escrow Step-Down Date and (b)
on November 30, 2021 (the " _Escrow Release Date_ "), all funds then-remaining
in the Indemnity Escrow Account (less the amount of any Losses determined by
Buyer reasonably and in good faith arising out of any then unresolved claims
for indemnification pursuant to _Section 10.2_ that have been timely and
properly made and delivered to the Seller prior to the Escrow Release Date)
shall be released to the Seller.

 



 

10.8. _Indemnification Payments_. Any payment under this _Article 10_ shall
be treated as an adjustment to the purchase price for Tax purposes and shall
be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds.

 



 

10.9. _Exclusive Remedy_. The parties acknowledge and agree that, following
the Closing, (a) the indemnification obligations of the Seller under this
_Article 10_ and the remedies set forth herein shall constitute the sole and
exclusive remedies of the Buyer Indemnified Parties for any breach of or
inaccuracy in any representation or warranty of the Company or the Seller set
forth in this Agreement, and any breach, non-fulfillment or default in the
performance of any covenant or agreement of the Company or the Seller set
forth in this Agreement and (b) the indemnification obligations of the Buyer
under this _Article 10_ and the remedies set forth herein shall constitute
the sole and exclusive remedies of the Seller Indemnified Parties for any
breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty of the Buyer set
forth in this Agreement, and any breach, non-fulfillment or default in the
performance of any covenant or agreement of the Buyer set forth in this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the limitations set forth above shall
not apply to the remedies provided in _Section 11.12_, the remedies provided
in _Section 2.4_, any claims brought on the basis of Fraud pursuing remedies
as may be available to such party under applicable Legal Requirements in the
event of any Indemnifying Partys failure to comply with its indemnification
obligations hereunder.

equity, whether in contract, tort, statute or otherwise) arising in whole or
in part out of, related to, based upon, or in connection herewith or the
subject matter hereof will be governed by and construed and enforced in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving

 



      
 

 



 

effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule that would cause the
application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.

 



 

11.9. _Consent to Jurisdiction_. Each party to this Agreement, by its
execution hereof, hereby irrevocably (a) submits, except for the purposes of
_Section 2.4_, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the

otherwise) in any such action or proceeding, or otherwise in any forum, any
claim that service of process made in accordance with clause (x) or clause (y)

foregoing, a party may commence an action or proceeding in any other forum to
enforce any order or judgment made, issued or entered by one of the above-
named courts.

 



 

11.10. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE
LEGAL REQUIREMENTS WHICH CANNOT BE WAIVED, EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
WAIVES, AND AGREES TO CAUSE EACH OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES TO WAIVE, AND COVENANTS
THAT NEITHER IT NOR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES SHALL ASSERT (WHETHER AS
PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT OR OTHERWISE) ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY FORUM IN
RESPECT OF ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING DESCRIBED IN _SECTION 11.9_. ANY PARTY
HERETO MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS _SECTION 11.10_
WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF EACH SUCH PARTY TO THE
WAIVER OF ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

 



 

11.11. _Reliance_. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that it has been
informed by each other party that the provisions of _Sections 11.9_ and
_11.10_ constitute a material inducement upon which such party is relying and
will rely in entering into this

 



       
 

 



 

Agreement, and each such party agrees that any breach by such party of any of
the provisions of _Sections 11.9_ or _11.10_ above would constitute a
material breach of this Agreement.

 



 

11.12. _Specific Enforcement_. Subject to this _Section 11.12_, each of the
parties acknowledges and agrees that the other parties would be damaged
irreparably in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached
or violated. Accordingly, each of the parties agrees that, without posting
bond or similar undertaking, each of the other parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or violations of the provisions
of this Agreement by the breaching party, and to specific performance of this
Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof in any action or proceeding
commenced pursuant to _Section 11.9_ in addition to any other remedy to which
such party may be entitled, at law or in equity. Each party further agrees
that, in the event of any action or proceeding for specific performance in
respect of such breach or violation, it shall not assert the defense that a
remedy at law would be adequate.

 



 

11.13. _No Waiver_. No failure or delay on the part of any party hereto in the
exercise of any right hereunder will impair such right or be construed to be a
waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement herein, nor will any single or partial exercise of any
such right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other
right. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall
constitute a waiver of any other provision hereof (whether or not similar), or
shall constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly provided. No
waiver of any right or remedy hereunder shall be valid unless the same shall
be in writing and signed by the party against whom such waiver is intended to
be effective.

 



 

11.14. _Negotiation of Agreement_. The parties have participated jointly in
the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the parties and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of
any of the provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

11.15. _Disclosure Schedules_. The inclusion of any information in the
Disclosure Schedules will not be deemed an admission or acknowledgment to any
third party that such information is required to be listed in the Disclosure
Schedules or that such items are material. The Disclosure Schedules are
arranged in sections corresponding to the sections contained in this Agreement
merely for convenience, and the disclosure of an item in one section of the
Disclosure Schedules as an exception to a particular covenant, agreement,
representation or warranty will be deemed adequately disclosed as an exception
with respect to all other covenants, agreements, representations and
warranties to the extent that the relevance of such item to such other
covenants, representations, agreements or warranties is reasonably apparent on
its face, notwithstanding the presence or absence of an appropriate cross-
reference thereto.

 



 

11.16. _Representation of the Seller; Attorney-Client Privilege_. The Buyer
hereby waives and agrees to not assert, and agrees to cause the Acquired
Companies to waive and not assert, any actual or potential conflict of
interest arising out of or relating to the

 



      
 

 



 

representation, after the Closing Date, of the Seller or any of its respective
Affiliates in any dispute with the Buyer or any of the Acquired Companies
involving the Transactions, by DLA Piper LLP (US) and Benesch, Friedlander,
Coplan and Aronoff LLP (" _Pre-Closing Company Counsel_ ") in connection with
the Transactions, even though the interests of such Person(s) may be directly
adverse to the Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including, from and after the
Closing, any Acquired Company) and even though such Pre-Closing Company
Counsel may have represented any Acquired Company in a matter substantially
related to such dispute. Buyer and the Acquired Companies also further agree
that, as to all communications among any Pre-Closing Company Counsel and any
of the Acquired Companies, the Seller or the Sellers Affiliates and their
respective Representatives, that relate in any way to this Agreement, the
negotiation thereof, or the Transactions, the attorney-client privilege and
the expectation of client confidence belongs to the Seller and shall be
controlled by the Seller and shall not pass to or be claimed by the Buyer or
any of its Affiliates (including, from and after the Closing, any Acquired
Company). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises
after the Closing between the Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including, from
and after the Closing, any Acquired Company), on the one hand, and a third
party other than (and not an Affiliate of) a party to this Agreement, on the
other hand, an Acquired Company may assert the attorney-client privilege to
prevent disclosure of confidential communications by Pre-Closing Company
Counsel to such third party; _provided_ , _however_ , that such Acquired
Company may not waive such privilege without the prior written consent of the
Seller. This _Section 11.16_ shall be irrevocable, and no term of this
_Section 11.16_ may be amended, waived or modified, without the prior written
consent of the Seller. The Buyer acknowledges that it has consulted with
independent counsel of its own choosing with respect to the meaning and effect
of this _Section 11.16_.

 



 

11.17. _No Recourse Against Third Parties_. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, no claim (whether at law or in equity, whether in
contract, tort, statute or otherwise) may be asserted by the Buyer, any
Affiliate of the Buyer (including, from and after the Closing, any Acquired
Company), or any Person claiming by, through or for the benefit of any of
them, against any Person who is not party to this Agreement, including any
partners, members, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees,
incorporators, managers, agents, Representatives, or Affiliates of any
Acquired Company, equityholder or the heirs, executors, administrators,
successors or assigns of any of the foregoing (or any Affiliate of any of the
foregoing) (each a " _Nonparty Affiliate_ " and, collectively, the " _Nonparty
Affiliates_ ") with respect to matters arising in whole or in part out of,
related to, based upon, or in connection with the Acquired Companies, this
Agreement or its subject matter or the Transactions or with respect to any
actual or alleged inaccuracies, misstatements or omissions with respect to
information furnished by or on behalf of the Acquired Companies or any
Nonparty Affiliate in any way concerning the Acquired Companies, this
Agreement or its subject matter or the Transactions.

 



 

11.18. _Translation of Currencies_. To the extent the parties need to convert
currencies for purposes of determining the Working Capital and Cash on Hand,
the relevant exchange rate shall be determined based on the rate in effect as
of the Determination Time as published on reuters.com.

 



      
 

 



 

11.19. _Headings_. The headings contained in this Agreement are inserted only
for reference as a matter of convenience and in no way define, limit or
describe the scope or intent of this Agreement, and will not affect in any way
the construction, meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

 



 

11.20. _Counterparts; Electronic Signature_. This Agreement may be executed in
any number of counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original for all purposes and
all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument. This
Agreement may be executed by facsimile or .pdf signature by any party and such
signature will be deemed binding for all purposes hereof without delivery of
an original signature being thereafter required.
