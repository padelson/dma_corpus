Business Day would otherwise occur anytime during the final fifteen (15) days
of a fiscal quarter of Acquirer, then Acquirer may, in its discretion, delay

Business Day, so long as, as of the date the Closing would have otherwise
occurred but for this proviso; or (ii) such other time as Acquirer and the
Company agree. The date on which the Closing occurs is sometimes referred to

1.3 _Effect on Capital Stock and Options_.

 

(a) _Treatment of Company Capital Stock and Company Options and Company
Warrants_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, at
the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part
of any party hereto, any Company Stockholder, any Company Optionholder, any
Company Warrantholder or any other Person:

 

(i) _Company Preferred Stock_. Each share of Company Preferred Stock (other
than Dissenting Shares and Disregarded Shares) held by a Converting Holder
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be deemed converted to Company
Common Stock without any further action by such holder in accordance with the
Certificate of Incorporation, immediately prior to the Effective Time and
shall be treated in accordance with Section 1.3(a)(ii).

(ii) _Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock, including
any Company Preferred Stock deemed converted into Company Common Stock
pursuant to Section 1.3(a)(i) above, held by a Converting Holder immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares and Disregarded
Shares) shall be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to
receive, subject to and in accordance with Section 1.4, an amount in cash,
without interest, equal to the Common Per Share Consideration (the aggregate
amount payable in respect of each such share of Company Common Stock, the "
_Closing Stock Consideration_ "). The amount of cash each Converting Holder
holding shares of Company Common Stock, including any Company Preferred Stock
deemed converted into Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.3(a)(i)
above, is entitled to receive for such shares of Company Common Stock shall be
rounded to the nearest cent on a Certificate-by-Certificate basis. The
payment of cash pursuant to this Section 1.3(a)(ii) in exchange for Unvested
Company Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be subject to the same restrictions and vesting arrangements that were
applicable to such Unvested Company Shares immediately prior to or at the
Effective Time (and no vesting acceleration shall occur by reason of the
Merger or any subsequent event, such as termination of employment), except as
may be specifically set forth in any offer letter between the holder and the
Acquirer. Therefore, cash otherwise payable pursuant to this Section
1.3(a)(ii) in exchange for the Unvested Company Shares issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time ( _"_ _Unvested Cash_ ") shall not
automatically be payable by Acquirer at the Effective Time, and shall instead
become payable by Acquirer on the date that such Unvested Company Shares
would have become vested under the vesting schedule in place for such shares
immediately prior to or at the Effective Time (subject to the restrictions and
other terms of such vesting schedule). Acquirer may in its discretion make
all such required payments to holders of Unvested Cash no later than the 15th
day of the calendar month immediately following the calendar month in which
such Unvested Cash would have become vested under the original vesting
schedule, and in its discretion may make such payments through a paying agent
authorized by Acquirer to administer such payments on Acquirers behalf or
through Acquirers (or the Surviving Corporations) payroll system and in
accordance with standard payroll practices (including withholding for
applicable Taxes). All amounts payable pursuant to this Section 1.3(a)(ii)
shall be subject to any required withholding of Taxes and shall be
paid without interest. A portion of such newly vested cash so distributed
will be treated as imputed interest to the extent required under the Code and
the regulations promulgated thereunder. All outstanding rights to repurchase
Unvested Company Shares that the Company may hold or similar restrictions in
the Companys favor immediately prior to the Effective Time (all such rights,
the " _Repurchase Rights_ ") shall be assigned to Acquirer in the Merger and
shall thereafter be exercisable by Acquirer upon the same terms and subject
to the same conditions that were in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, except that Repurchase Rights may be exercised by Acquirer retaining the
Unvested Cash into which such Unvested Company Shares have been

 



4

    

 converted and paying to the former holder thereof the repurchase price in
effect for each such share subject to that Repurchase Right immediately prior
to the Effective Time. No Unvested Cash, or right thereto, may be pledged,
encumbered, sold, assigned or transferred (including any transfer by operation
of law), by any Person, other than Acquirer, or be taken or reached by any
legal or equitable process in satisfaction of any Liability of such Person,
prior to the distribution to such Person of such Unvested Cash in accordance
with this Agreement. The payment of cash pursuant to this Section 1.3(a)(ii)
in exchange for Unvested Company Shares issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be subject to the same
restrictions and vesting arrangements that were applicable to such Unvested
Company Shares immediately prior to or at the Effective Time.

 

(iii) _Company Options_.

 

(A) _In the Money Options_. Each In the Money Option shall, without further
action on the part of any holder thereof, be cancelled and automatically
converted into the right to receive, subject to and in accordance with Section
1.4, an amount in cash, without interest, for such holders Company Common
Stock subject to such In the Money Option equal to (1) (A) the Common Per
Share Consideration; _multiplied_ (B) by the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such In the Money Option held by such holder; _minus_
(2) the aggregate purchase price for the exercise of the In the Money Option
with respect to all shares of Company Common Stock subject to such In the
Money Option (the aggregate amount payable in respect of each such In the
Money Option, the " _Closing Option Consideration_ ").

 

(B) _Unvested Options_. Except where prohibited by Applicable Law, each
Unvested Option held by a Continuing Employee shall, on the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, be assumed and converted by
Acquirer (such Unvested Options assumed hereunder, the " _Assumed Options_ ")
in accordance with Section 409A of the Code and Section 424 of the Code, and
the attendant Treasury Regulations under such Code sections, and in accordance
with Section 5.12. As set forth in Section 5.12, subject to any agreement
entered into by such Continuing Employee with Acquirer or the Surviving
Corporation, each Assumed Option shall be subject to the same vesting
arrangements (including with respect to any acceleration existing as of the
date hereto) that were applicable to such Assumed Option immediately prior
to or at the Effective Time, except that (i) such Assumed Option shall be
exercisable for that number of whole shares of Acquirer Class A Common Stock
equal to the product (rounded down to the next whole number of shares of
Acquirer Class A Common Stock, with no cash being payable for any fractional
share eliminated by such rounding) of the number of shares of Company Common
Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such option immediately prior to the
Effective Time and the Option Exchange Ratio, (ii) the per share exercise
price for the shares of Acquirer Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise
of such Assumed Option shall be equal to the quotient (rounded up to the next
whole cent) obtained by dividing the exercise price per share of Company
Common Stock at which such option was exercisable immediately prior to the
Effective Time by the Option Exchange Ratio and (iii) subject to obtaining any
consent required under the Company Option Plan from such Company
Optionholder, no Assumed Option may be "early exercised" (i.e., an Assumed
Option may be exercised for shares of Acquirer Class A Common Stock only to
the extent the Assumed Option is vested at the time of exercise pursuant to
the applicable vesting schedule). Acquirer will not assume any Unvested
Options held by Persons that do not become Continuing Employees as of the
Effective Time, and each such Unvested Option that is not an Assumed Options
shall be cancelled for no consideration.

(iv) _Company Restricted Stock Units_. At the Effective Time, each
Company Restricted Stock Unit held by a Continuing Employee that is
unexpired, unexercised and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
be assumed and converted by Acquirer in accordance with Section

 



5

    

 5.13. As set forth in Section 5.13, each assumed Company Restricted Stock
Unit that immediately prior to the Effective Time was not fully vested shall
be subject to the same vesting arrangements that were applicable to such
Company Restricted Stock Unit immediately prior to or at the Effective Time,
and no vesting acceleration shall occur by reason of the Merger or any
subsequent event, such as termination of employment. Acquirer will not assume
any Company Restricted Stock Units held by Persons that are not Continuing
Employees.

(v)  _Company Warrants_. Each Outstanding Warrant shall, without further
action on the part of any holder thereof, be cancelled and, subject to and in
accordance with Section 1.4, automatically converted into the right to receive
an amount in cash, without interest, for such holders Company Common Stock
(including any Company Preferred Stock exercisable from such Outstanding
Warrant deemed converted into Company Common Stock pursuant to Section
1.3(a)(i) above) exercisable from such Outstanding Warrant equal to (1) (A)
the Common Per Share Consideration; _multiplied_ by (B) the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Outstanding Warrant; _minus_
(2) the aggregate purchase price for the exercise of such Outstanding Warrant
with respect to all shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Outstanding
Warrant (the aggregate amount payable in respect of each such Outstanding
Warrant, the " _Closing Warrant Consideration_ ").

(vi) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in no event
shall the aggregate amount of cash to be paid by Acquirer to the Company
Securityholders (including the Merger Consideration, but excluding the
Employee RSUs) exceed the Stockholder Consideration.

 

(b) _Treatment of Company Capital Stock Owned by the Company_. At the
Effective Time, all shares of Company Capital Stock that are owned by the
Company as treasury stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof or payment of any
cash or other property or consideration therefor and shall cease to exist (all
such shares of Company Capital Stock, the " _Disregarded Shares_ ").

(c) _Treatment of Merger Sub Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Acquirer, Merger Sub or
any other Person, each share of capital stock of Merger Sub that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation (and the
shares of the Surviving Corporation into which the shares of Merger Sub
capital stock are so converted shall be the only shares of the
Surviving Corporations capital stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately after the Effective Time). From and after the Effective Time, each
certificate evidencing ownership of a number of shares of Merger Sub capital
stock will evidence ownership of such number of shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

(d) _Adjustments_. In the event of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into capital stock), reorganization, reclassification,
combination, recapitalization or other like change with respect to the Company
Capital Stock occurring after the Agreement Date and prior to the Effective
Time, all references herein to specified numbers of shares of any class or
series affected thereby, and all calculations provided for that are based upon
numbers of shares of any class or series (or trading prices therefor)
affected thereby, shall be equitably adjusted to the extent necessary to
provide the parties the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement
prior to such stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend,
reorganization, reclassification, combination, recapitalization or other like
change.

 



6

    

(e) _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, any Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into the right to
receive the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration, but shall instead
be converted into the right to receive such consideration as may be determined
to be due with respect to any such Dissenting Shares pursuant to the DGCL or
the CCC. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who, pursuant to the DGCL or the
CCC, becomes entitled to payment thereunder for such shares shall receive
payment therefor in accordance with the DGCL or the CCC (but only after the
value therefor shall have been agreed upon or finally determined pursuant to
such provisions). If, after the Effective Time, any Dissenting Shares shall
lose their status as Dissenting Shares, then any such shares
shall immediately be deemed to have converted at the Effective Time into the
right to receive the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration in respect
of such shares as if such shares never had been Dissenting Shares, and
Acquirer shall issue and deliver to the holder thereof, at (or as promptly as
reasonably practicable after) the applicable time or times specified in
Section 1.4, following the satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth
in Section 1.4, the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration as if such
shares never had been Dissenting Shares. The Company shall provide to Acquirer
(i) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal or purchase received by the
Company, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments related to
such demands served pursuant to the DGCL or the CCC and received by the
Company and (ii) the right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands under the DGCL or the CCC. The Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Acquirer, or as otherwise required
under the DGCL or the CCC, voluntarily make any payment or offer to make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any claim or demand in
respect of any Dissenting Shares. The payout of consideration under this
Agreement to the Converting Holders (other than in respect of Dissenting
Shares, which shall be treated as provided in this Section 1.3(e) and under
the DGCL or the CCC) shall not be affected by the exercise or potential
exercise of appraisal rights or dissenters rights under the DGCL or the CCC
by any other Company Stockholder.

 

(f) _Rights Not Transferable_. The rights of the Company Securityholders under
this Agreement as of immediately prior to the Effective Time are personal to
each such Company Securityholder and shall not be transferable for any reason,
other than by operation of law, will or the laws of descent and distribution
without action taken by or on behalf of such Company Securityholder.
Any attempted transfer of such right by any holder thereof (other than as
permitted by the immediately preceding sentence) shall be null and void.

 

(g) _No Interest_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
no interest shall accumulate on any cash payable in connection with the
consummation of the Merger or the other Transactions.

1.4 _Payment Procedures_.

 

(a) _Delivery of Letter of Transmittal_. As promptly as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time, to the extent not previously delivered, Acquirer
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate
or certificates that evidenced outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Certificates_ ") or the
Outstanding Warrants, in each case (i) a letter of transmittal in customary
form (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title to the Certificates and the Outstanding Warrants shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates and/or the Outstanding Warrants to
the Paying Agent, and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as
Acquirer may reasonably specify and agree to release the Company and the
Surviving Corporation from any claims, rights, Liabilities and causes of
action whatsoever based upon, relating to or arising out of the Certificates,
the Outstanding Warrants, the Merger and/or the Transactions) (the " _Letter
of Transmittal_ ") and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates and the Outstanding Warrants in exchange for payment
therefor.

 



7

    

(b) _Closing Date Payments_. As soon as reasonably practicable (but in no
event later than one (1) Business Day) after the Closing, Acquirer shall
make, or cause to be made, the following payments in cash by wire transfer of
immediately available funds:

 

(i) to Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company or other bank or trust
company as Acquirer may choose in its discretion (the " _Paying Agent_ "),
the sum of (A) the Closing Stock Consideration for further distribution to the
Company Stockholders pursuant to Section 1.4(c) and (B) the Closing Warrant
Consideration for further distribution to the Company Warrantholders pursuant
to Section 1.4(c); and

(ii) to the Surviving Corporation (as directed by the Company in the
Spreadsheet), the aggregate Closing Option Consideration for further payment
to the Company Optionholders that held In the Money Options immediately prior
to the Effective Time.

 

(c) _Paying Agent Payments_. Promptly upon receipt of written confirmation of
the effectiveness of the Merger from the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware, Acquirer will instruct the Paying Agent to pay to each Converting
Holder by check or wire transfer of same day funds the aggregate amount of
cash payable to such Converting Holder pursuant to Sections 1.3(a)(ii)
(after application of 1.3(a)(i)) and 1.3(a)(v), as applicable, other than in
respect of Dissenting Shares to holders thereof, as promptly as practicable
and no later than three (3) Business Days following the submission of a
Certificate or Company Warrant (or, in the case of any lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate or Company Warrant, compliance with Section 1.4(d)), as
applicable, to the Paying Agent and a duly executed Letter of Transmittal by
such Converting Holder.

 

(d) _Lost Certificates/Company Warrants_. If any Certificate or Company
Warrant shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon (i) the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such document to be lost, stolen
or destroyed and (ii) if required by Acquirer or the Paying Agent, the
execution and delivery of a customary indemnity agreement against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such lost document (but without
any requirement that a bond or other security be posted), the Paying Agent
will pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed document the
applicable portion of the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section
1.3(a)(ii) (after application of Section 1.3(a)(i)) and 1.3(a)(v), as
applicable, in respect of their shares of Company Capital Stock or Company
Warrant, as applicable.

 

(e) _Transfers of Ownership_. If any cash amount payable pursuant to Section
1.3(a) is to be paid to a Person other than the Person to which the
Certificate, Company Option or Company Warrant surrendered in exchange
therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of the payment thereof that
such Certificate, Company Option or Company Warrant shall be properly endorsed
and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
exchange shall have paid to Acquirer or any agent designated by Acquirer any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment of cash in any name
other than that of the registered holder of such Certificate, Company Option
or Company Warrant, or established to the satisfaction of Acquirer or any
agent designated by Acquirer that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
1.4, no party hereto shall be liable to any Person for any amount properly
paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Applicable Law.

 



8

    

(g) _Unclaimed Consideration_. Each holder of a Certificate, Company Option or
Company Warrant who has not theretofore complied with the exchange procedures
set forth in and contemplated by this Section 1.4 shall look only to Acquirer
(subject to abandoned property, escheat and similar Applicable Law) for its
claim, only as a general unsecured creditor thereof, to any portion of the
Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 1.3(a) in respect of such
Certificate, Company Option or Company Warrant. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, if any Certificate, Company Option or Company
Warrant has not been surrendered prior to the earlier of the first anniversary
of the Effective Time and such date on which the applicable portion of the
Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 1.3(a) in respect of such
Certificate, Company Option or Company Warrant would otherwise escheat to, or
become the property of, any Governmental Entity, any amounts payable in
respect of such Certificate, Company Option or Company Warrant shall, to the
extent permitted by Applicable Law, become the property of Acquirer, free and
clear of all claims or interests of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(h) _Option Payments_. As soon as reasonably practicable following the
Closing, and no later than the Companys second regularly scheduled payroll
date following the Closing, Acquirer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
pay the Company Optionholders that held In the Money Options (i) in respect of
Employee Options through a payroll system (such payment to be net
of applicable withholding Tax) of the Company and (ii) in respect of Non-

Date; _provided_ that nothing herein shall limit the at-will nature of the
Company employees employment, or limits the ability of the Acquirer, the
Company or the Surviving Corporation to terminate or modify the employment
of the Continuing Employees. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the
foregoing, with the exception of the Key Employees, none of Acquirer, Merger
Sub and the Surviving Corporation shall have any obligation to make an offer
of employment to any employee of the Company. With respect to matters
described in this Section 5.10, the Company will consult with Acquirer (and
will consider in good faith the advice of Acquirer) prior to sending any
notices or other communication materials to its employees.

(b) For at least one year following the Closing Date, Acquirer agrees that
each Continuing Employee shall be provided with (i) a rate of cash
compensation (including salary and target bonus) that is not less favorable
than the rate of cash compensation (including salary and target bonus) paid by
the Company to such Continuing Employee on the date hereof and (ii) other
benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the benefits
provided by the Company to such Continuing Employee on the date hereof. As
soon as commercially reasonable after the Closing Date, Acquirer shall enroll
the Continuing Employees in Acquirers employee benefit plans for which such
employees are eligible (the " _Acquirer Plans_ "), including its medical plan,
dental plan, life insurance plan and disability plan, on
substantially similar terms applicable to employees of Acquirer who are
similarly situated based on levels of responsibility and working location, to
the extent permitted by the terms of the applicable Acquirer Plans; _provided_
, _however_ , that Acquirer shall not be obligated to enroll any Continuing
Employee in Acquirer Plans if Acquirer maintains in effect a comparable
Company Employee Plan for the benefit of such employee following the Closing
Date. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, for Continuing
Employees so enrolled in Acquirer Plans, Acquirer shall recognize the prior
service with the Company of each of the Continuing Employees for purposes of
eligibility, and, to the extent permitted by the terms of the applicable
Acquirer Plans, for purposes of accrual of vacation, severance and time off
benefits, in each case to the extent such Acquirer Plans provide for such
benefits; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such crediting of service
shall result in any duplication of benefits. In addition, for purposes of
each Acquirer Plan providing health or welfare benefits for the benefit of any
Continuing Employees, Acquirer will cause all pre-existing condition
exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements, waiting periods and
actively-at-work requirements of such Acquirer Plan to be waived (except
that, for insured benefit plans, to the extent

 



42

    

 permitted under the terms of the insurance policy) for such employee and his
or her covered dependents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all Continuing
Employees will be "at-will" (except for non-United States Continuing Employees
located in a jurisdiction that does not recognize the "at will" employment
concept, if any). Nothing contained herein, express or implied, (x) is
intended to confer upon any Continuing Employee any right to continued
employment for any period or continued receipt of any specific employee
benefit, or shall constitute an amendment to or any other modification of any
benefit plan, (y) shall alter or limit Acquirers or the Companys or their

(c) The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
delivery to Acquirer of a true, correct and complete copy of each election
statement under Section 83(b) of the Code filed by each Person who acquired
Unvested Company Shares after the Agreement Date (or prior to the Agreement
Date to the extent not previously provided by the Company), at or prior to
the Closing, in each case together with evidence of timely filing of such
election statement with the appropriate IRS Center.

(d) This Section 5.10 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit
of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section 5.10,
express or implied, shall confer upon any other Person, including any
Continuing Employee, any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or
by reason of this Section 5.10. Nothing contained herein, express or implied,
shall be construed to establish, amend or modify any Company Employee Plan or
any other plan, program, arrangement, agreement, policy or commitment. The
parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the terms set forth in this Section
5.10 shall not create any right in any Continuing Employee or any other Person
to continued employment with the Company, Acquirer, the Surviving Corporation
or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates.

5.11 _Termination of Benefit Plans_. Effective as of the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date, the Board shall adopt resolutions terminating the
401(k) Plan effective as of the date immediately preceding the Closing Date
and contingent upon the Closing unless Acquirer has requested that such
401(k) Plan not be terminated by providing written notice to the Company no
later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date. The Company shall
provide Acquirer with evidence that such 401(k) Plan has been terminated
(effective no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date)
pursuant to such resolutions of the Board or any applicable committee thereof.
The form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to review and
approval by Acquirer.

5.12 _Assumption of Unvested Options_. At the Effective Time, each Unvested
Option held by a Continuing Employee that is unexpired, unexercised and
outstanding as of the Effective Time, shall, on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, become an Assumed Option. Each such
Assumed Option shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and
conditions (including, if applicable, the vesting arrangements and other terms
and conditions set forth in the Company Option Plan and the applicable stock
option agreement for such Unvested Options) as are in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time, except that (a) subject to obtaining any consent
required under the Company Option Plan from such Company Optionholder, all
Assumed Options that are currently "early exercisable" (or exercisable before
such Assumed Options vest) will no longer be "early exercisable" following
the Effective Time, and will only become exercisable when such Assumed Options
vest, (b) the Assumed Options will be subject to any agreement entered into by
such Continuing Employee with Acquirer or the Surviving Corporation,
including any modification to the vesting or acceleration of such Assumed
Options that is agreed to by such parties, (c) such Assumed Option shall be
exercisable for that number of whole shares of Acquirer Common Stock equal to
the product (rounded down to the next whole number of shares of Acquirer
Common Stock, with no cash being payable for any fractional share eliminated
by such 

 



43

    

 rounding) of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable
upon exercise of such Assumed Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
and the Option Exchange Ratio and (d) the per share exercise price for the
shares of Acquirer Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Assumed Option
shall be equal to the quotient (rounded up to the next whole cent) obtained by
dividing the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock at which such
Assumed Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the
Option Exchange Ratio. It is the intent of the parties hereto that to the
extent permitted by Applicable Law, all Assumed Options that prior to the
Effective Time were treated as incentive or non-qualified stock options under
the Code shall from and after the Effective Time continue to be treated as
incentive or non-qualified stock options, respectively, to the extent such
Assumed Options continue to qualify for such treatment under the Code and the
parties hereto shall act consistently with this intention. Consistent with
the terms of the Company Option Plan and the documents governing the
outstanding Unvested Options under such plan as in effect on the Agreement
Date, the Merger shall not terminate any of the outstanding Company Options
held by Continuing Employees under such plan or accelerate the exercisability
or vesting of such options or the shares of Acquirer Common Stock that shall
be subject to those options upon Acquirers assumption of the Unvested Options
in the Merger. Promptly after the Closing Date, but in no event later than
twenty (20) Business Days after the Closing Date, Acquirer shall issue to each
Continuing Employee with Assumed Options a document evidencing the foregoing
assumption of such Assumed Option by Acquirer.

5.13 _Company Restricted Stock Units_. Between the Agreement Date and the
Closing, the Company will issue Company restricted stock units having an
aggregate value of not greater than $15,000,000 (calculated based on the
Common Per Share Consideration) (the " _Company Restricted Stock Units_ ")
under the Company 2013 Equity Incentive Plan, subject to the prior review and
approval of the Acquirer, such approval not to be unreasonably denied. The
Company Restricted Stock Units will have a vesting schedule that conforms with
the vesting schedule used for other Acquirer restricted stock units. At the
Effective Time, each Company Restricted Stock Unit held by a Continuing
Employee that is unexpired, unexercised and outstanding as of the Effective
Time, whether vested or unvested, shall, on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, be assumed by Acquirer. Each such
Company Restricted Stock Unit so assumed by Acquirer under this Agreement
shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions
(including, if applicable, the vesting arrangements and other terms and
conditions set forth in the plan under which such Company Restricted Stock
Units were issued and the applicable notice of grant of stock unit or other
applicable agreement) as are in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, except that such Company Restricted Stock Unit shall be settled by the
issuance of that number of whole shares of Acquirer Common Stock equal to the
product (rounded down to the next whole number of shares of Acquirer Common
Stock, with no cash being payable for any fractional share eliminated by such
rounding) of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable
upon exercise of such option immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by the Option Exchange Ratio. The Merger shall not terminate any
of the outstanding Company Restricted Stock Units held by Continuing Employees
under such plan or accelerate the exercisability or vesting of such Company
Restricted Stock Units or the shares of Acquirer Common Stock that shall be
subject to those Company Restricted Stock Units upon Acquirers assumption in
the Merger. Promptly after the Closing Date, Acquirer shall issue to each
Continuing Employee who immediately prior to the Effective Time was a holder
of an outstanding Company Restricted Stock Unit a document evidencing the
foregoing assumption by Acquirer.

 

5.14 _Form S-8_. Acquirer will use commercially reasonable efforts to file
with the SEC a Form S-8 (or any successor form) so that the Acquirer Common
Stock issuable upon exercise of the assumed awards pursuant to Section 5.12
for which a Form S-8 registration statement is available to be registered
with the SEC on Form S-8, will exercise commercially reasonable efforts to
maintain the effectiveness such registration statement for so long as such
awards remain outstanding and will reserve a sufficient number of shares of
Acquirer Common Stock for issuance upon exercise or settlement thereof. The
Company and its counsel shall reasonably cooperate with and assist Acquirer in
the preparation of such registration statement. The Form S-8 registration
statement shall not cover the shares of Acquirer Common Stock subject to any
Company Options assumed by Acquirer that are held by Persons who are
not Continuing Employees.

 



44

    

5.15 _Acquirer RSUs_. Following the Closing Date, in accordance with
Acquirers standard equity award policies, Acquirer will grant Acquirer RSUs
to Continuing Employees (including the Key Employees) with respect to a number
of shares of Acquirers common stock having an aggregate fair market value as
of the date of grant of not less than $50,000,000 (the " _Employee RSUs_ "),
which Employee RSUs shall be allocated as determined by Acquirer, after
receiving and considering input from the Companys CEO regarding such
allocation. The Employee RSUs will be subject to all of the terms and
conditions set forth in Acquirers 2012 Equity Incentive Plan, and in a
restricted stock unit agreement to be entered into between the recipients of
such Employee RSUs and Acquirer, setting forth vesting terms that are in
accordance with Acquirers policies for retention awards.

5.16 _Certain Closing Certificates and Documents_. The Company shall prepare
and deliver to Acquirer a draft of the Spreadsheet not later than five (5)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date and a final version of the Spreadsheet
to Acquirer not later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date.
In the event that Acquirer notifies the Company in good faith that there are
reasonably apparent errors in the drafts of the Spreadsheet, Acquirer and the
Company shall discuss such errors in good faith and the Company shall correct
such errors prior to delivering the final versions of the same in accordance
with this Section 5.16. Without limiting the foregoing or Section 5.8, the
Company shall provide to Acquirer, together with the Spreadsheet, such
supporting documentation, information and calculations as are reasonably
necessary for Acquirer to verify and determine the calculations, amounts and
other matters set forth in the Spreadsheet.

 

5.17 _Tax Matters_. The Company agrees to, and to cause the Subsidiaries to,
cooperate with Acquirer and provide any relevant factual information
requested by Acquirer that is reasonably necessary for Acquirer to determine
the limitations, if any, on the Companys or any Subsidiarys Tax loss
carryforwards under Section 382 of the Code or any similar provision
of Applicable Law of any other jurisdiction applicable to the Company or any
of the Subsidiaries. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge that
the Company makes no representation as to the amount of, or limitations on,
any net operating losses, Tax credits, Tax basis or other Tax attributes that
it may have after the Closing Date.

5.18 _280G Stockholder Approval_. Promptly following the execution of this
Agreement (and no later than the deadline to deliver the Stockholder Notice),
the Company shall submit to the Company Stockholders for approval (in a manner
reasonably satisfactory to Acquirer), by such number of holders of Company
Stockholders as is required by the terms of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code,
any payments and/or benefits that may separately or in the aggregate,
constitute "parachute payments" pursuant to Section 280G of the Code ("
_Section_ __ _ 280G Payments_") (which determination shall be made by the
Company and shall be subject to review and approval by Acquirer, such approval
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), such that such
payments and benefits shall not be deemed to be Section 280G Payments, and
prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Acquirer notification and
documentation reasonably satisfactory to Acquirer that (i) a vote of the
holders of Company Capital Stock was solicited in conformance with Section
280G of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder and the requisite
stockholder approval was obtained with respect to any payments and/or
benefits that were subject to the stockholder vote (the " _280G Stockholder
Approval_ ") or (ii) that the 280G Stockholder Approval was not obtained and
as a consequence, that such payments and/or benefits shall not be made or
provided to the extent they would cause any amounts to constitute Section 280G
Payments, pursuant to the Parachute Payment Waivers that were executed by the
affected individuals prior to the solicitation of the vote of the holders of
Company Capital Stock pursuant to this Section 5.18.

5.19 _Director and Officer Indemnification_.

 

(a) If the Merger is consummated, then until the sixth anniversary of the
Closing Date, Acquirer will cause the Surviving Corporation to fulfill and
honor in all respects the obligations of the Company and each of the
Subsidiaries to their respective present and former directors and officers
(the " _Company Indemnified Parties_ ") pursuant to any
indemnification agreements with the Company or such Subsidiary made available
to Acquirer and any indemnification or advancement provisions under the
Companys or such Subsidiarys certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or
equivalent organizational documents), in each case, in effect on the
Agreement Date (the " _Company Indemnification Provisions_ ") with respect to
their acts and omissions as directors and officers of the Company or such
Subsidiary occurring prior to the Effective Time, in each case, subject to
Applicable Law. From and after the Effective Time, such obligations shall be
the joint and several obligations of Acquirer and the Surviving Corporation.
The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation will
contain provisions with respect to advancement, exculpation and
indemnification that are at least as favorable in the aggregate to the Company
Indemnified Parties as those contained in the certificate of incorporation
and bylaws of the Company (or equivalent organizational documents) as in
effect on the Agreement Date, which provisions will not be amended, repealed
or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in
any manner that adversely affects the rights thereunder of the Company
Indemnified Parties, unless such modification is required by Applicable Law.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Company
Indemnification Provisions, no Company Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
coverage under any Acquirer director and officer insurance policy or errors
and omission policy unless such Company Indemnified Party is separately
eligible for coverage under such policy pursuant to Acquirers policies and
procedures and the terms of such insurance policy.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase tail
insurance coverage (the " _Tail Insurance Coverage_ ") for the Company
Indemnified Parties in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Company and
Acquirer, which shall provide the Company Indemnified Parties with coverage
for six (6) years following the Closing Date in an amount not less than the
existing coverage and that shall have other terms not materially less
favorable to the insured persons than the directors and officers liability
insurance coverage maintained by the Company as of the Agreement Date.
Acquirer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain the Tail Insurance
Coverage in full force and effect and continue to honor the obligations
thereunder until the sixth anniversary of the Closing Date.

(c) This Section 5.19 (i) shall survive the consummation of the Merger, (ii)
is intended to benefit each Company Indemnified Party and their respective
heirs, (iii) is in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights
to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have against
Acquirer or the Surviving Corporation first arising after the earlier of the
Closing Date and the termination of this Agreement by contract or otherwise,
(iv) shall be enforceable by the Company Indemnified Parties and (v) shall not
be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights
of any Company Indemnified Party under this Section 5.19 without the written
consent of such affected Company Indemnified Party; _provided_ that recourse
shall first be against the Tail Insurance Coverage until it is exhausted
before recovery against Acquirer shall take place.

(d) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, the
obligations of Acquirer and the Surviving Corporation contained in this
Section 5.19 shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of Acquirer and
the Surviving Corporation. In the event Acquirer or the Surviving Corporation
(or any of their respective successors or assigns) (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that such
continuing or surviving corporation or entity or transferee of such assets, as
the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this
Section 5.19.

by the Company or waived by Acquirer and (iii) at the time of such
termination, each of the other conditions in Section 6.1 and Section 6.3

satisfied at the Closing; _provided_ that such conditions were then capable of
being satisfied), then Acquirer shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Company
an amount equal to $30,000,000 (the " _Reverse Termination Fee_ ").

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) if
Acquirer fails to effect the Closing when required by Section 1.1(c), or
otherwise breaches this Agreement (whether willfully, intentionally,
unintentionally or otherwise), then (A) a decree or order of specific
performance or an injunction or other equitable relief or (B) the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(e) and receipt of the Reverse
Termination Fee (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include any
interest payments thereon) pursuant to the last sentence of Section 7.3(d),
shall be the sole and exclusive remedies (whether at law, in equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise) of the Company (and any other Person) against
the Acquirer for any breach, cost, expense, loss or damage suffered as a
result thereof or in connection therewith or related thereto. For the
avoidance of doubt, nothing shall prohibit the Company from seeking an
injunction, specific performance and/or other equitable relief pursuant
to Section 8.9.

(c) Upon proper payment of the Reverse Termination Fee pursuant to Section
7.3(a) and in any case subject to Section 7.3(b), Acquirer will not have any
further liability or obligation to the Company (or any other Person) relating
to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions (except that the

negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, (iii) any breach of
this Agreement and (iv) any failure of the Merger or the other Transactions
contemplated hereby, may be made only against the Persons that are expressly
identified as parties to this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, while
the Company may pursue both a grant of specific performance in accordance with
Section 8.9 and the payment of the Reverse Termination Fee under Section
7.3(a), under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to
receive both a grant of specific performance to cause the Closing to be
consummated in any case subject to the terms of Section 8.9 and all or any
portion of the Reverse Termination Fee.

 



50

    

(d) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained
in this Section 7.3 are an integral part of the Transactions, (ii) the
Reverse Termination Fee is not a penalty, but is liquidated damages, in a
reasonable amount that will compensate the Company in the circumstances in
which the Reverse Termination Fee is payable for the efforts and resources
expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in

with respect to Acquirer and/or Merger Sub, signed by Acquirer. Without
limiting the generality or effect of the preceding sentence, no failure to

other provision herein.

counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same instrument
and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by

hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written
and oral, among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof,

under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by
operation of law or otherwise by any of

 



53

hereto, and any such assignment without such prior written consent shall be
null and void, except that Acquirer and/or Merger Sub may assign its rights
and delegate its obligations under this Agreement to any direct or indirect
wholly owned subsidiary of Acquirer without the prior consent of any other
party hereto; _provided_ that notwithstanding any such assignment, Acquirer

Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable
by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

8.8 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement shall continue in full force and effect and shall be interpreted so
as reasonably necessary to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The
parties hereto shall use all reasonable efforts to replace such void or
unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable
provision that shall achieve, to the greatest extent possible, the economic,
business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

8.9 _Remedies Cumulative; Specific Performance_. Except as otherwise provided
herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party hereto
shall be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy
conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a
party hereto of any one remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any other
remedy and nothing herein shall be deemed a waiver by any party hereto of any
right to specific performance or injunctive relief. It is accordingly agreed
that the parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity, and the parties hereto hereby waive the
requirement of any posting of a bond in connection with the remedies described
herein.

(a) EXCEPT FOR CLAIMS REGARDING EITHER ACQUIRERS OR THE COMPANYS
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, TO WHICH THIS
SECTION WILL NOT APPLY, IN THE EVENT THAT A RESOLUTION IS NOT REACHED AMONG
THE PARTIES HERETO WITHIN 60 DAYS AFTER WRITTEN NOTICE OF A DISPUTE, THE
DISPUTE SHALL BE FINALLY SETTLED BY BINDING ARBITRATION IN SAN FRANCISCO,
CALIFORNIA. SUCH ARBITRATION SHALL BE CONDUCTED IN ENGLISH IN ACCORDANCE WITH
THE RULES OF THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION BY ONE ARBITRATOR APPOINTED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUCH RULES. THE ARBITRATOR SHALL ALLOW SUCH DISCOVERY AS IS

TIMING OF DISCOVERY. THE AWARD OF ARBITRATION SHALL BE FINAL AND BINDING UPON
THE PARTIES HERETO. THE ARBITRATOR WILL AWARD TO THE PREVAILING PARTY ALL
COSTS, FEES AND EXPENSES RELATED TO THE ARBITRATION, INCLUDING REASONABLE FEES
AND EXPENSES OF ATTORNEYS, ACCOUNTANTS AND OTHER PROFESSIONALS INCURRED BY
THE PREVAILING PARTY, AND JUDGMENT ON THE AWARD RENDERED BY THE ARBITRATOR MAY

(b) Subject to the foregoing, the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to
the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware and the
Federal courts of the United States of America located in the State of
Delaware, in respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions
of this Agreement and of the documents referred to herein, and in respect of
the Transactions, and hereby

 



54

    

 waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or
proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement hereof or thereof, that it is
not subject thereto or that such action, suit or proceeding may not be
brought or is not maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof may
not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any such document may not be
enforced in or by such courts, and the parties hereto irrevocably agree
that all claims with respect to such action or proceeding shall be heard and
determined in such a Delaware State or Federal court. The parties hereto
hereby consent to and grant any such court jurisdiction over the person of
such parties and over the subject matter of such dispute and agree that
mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such action or
proceeding in the manner provided in Section 8.1 or in such other manner as
may be permitted by Applicable Law, shall be valid and sufficient service
thereof. With respect to any particular action, suit or proceeding, venue
shall lie solely in the state of Delaware. A party hereto may apply either to
a court of competent jurisdiction or to an arbitrator, if one has been
appointed, for prejudgment remedies and emergency relief pending final
determination of a claim pursuant to this Section 8.10. The appointment of an
arbitrator does not preclude a party hereto from seeking prejudgment remedies
and emergency relief from a court of competent jurisdiction.

8.11 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, all acts and transactions
pursuant hereto and all obligations of the parties hereto shall be governed
by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without
reference to such states principles of conflicts of law that would refer a
matter to a different jurisdiction; _provided_ that any matters related to
the effectiveness of the Merger shall be governed by the laws of the State of
Delaware without reference to such states principles of conflicts of law that
would refer a matter to a different jurisdiction.

8.12 _Rules of Construction_. The parties hereto have been represented by
counsel during the negotiation, preparation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefore, hereby waive, with respect to this Agreement, each Schedule
and each Exhibit attached hereto, the application of any Applicable Law or
rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other
document shall be construed against the party drafting such agreement or
document.

8.13 _C_ _ompany Disclosure Letter_. The Company Disclosure Letter has been
arranged, for purposes of convenience only, as separate parts corresponding to
the subsections of _Article II_ of this Agreement. The representations and
warranties contained in _Article II_ of this Agreement are subject to (a) the
exceptions and disclosures set forth in the part of the Company Disclosure
Letter corresponding to the particular subsection of _Article II_ in which
such representation and warranty appears; (b) any exceptions or disclosures
explicitly cross-referenced in such part of the Company Disclosure Letter by
reference to another part of the Company Disclosure Letter; and (c) any
exception or disclosure set forth in any other part of the Company Disclosure
Letter to the extent it is reasonably apparent that such exception or
disclosure is intended to qualify such representation and warranty. No
reference to or disclosure of any item or other matter in the Company
Disclosure Letter shall be construed as an admission or indication that such
item or other matter is material (nor shall it establish a standard of
materiality for any purpose whatsoever) or that such item or other matter is
required to be referred to or disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter. The
information set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter is disclosed solely for
the purposes of this Agreement, and no information set forth therein shall be
deemed to be an admission by any party hereto to any third party of any
matter whatsoever, including of any violation of Law or breach of any
agreement. The Company Disclosure Letter and the information and disclosures
contained therein are intended only to qualify and limit the representations,
warranties and covenants of the Company contained in this Agreement. Nothing
in the Company Disclosure Letter is intended to broaden the scope of any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or create any
covenant. Matters reflected in the Company Disclosure Letter are not
necessarily limited to matters required by the Agreement to be reflected in
the Company Disclosure Letter. Such additional matters are set forth for
informational purposes and do not necessarily include other matters of a
similar nature.
