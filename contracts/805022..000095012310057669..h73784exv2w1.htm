Section&nbsp;14.2, the General Partner, or in the event the General Partner has withdrawn from the
Partnership, been removed or dissolved or become bankrupt (as defined in Section&nbsp;14.1), a
liquidator or liquidating committee approved by a Majority Interest shall be the liquidator of the
Partnership (the &#147;Liquidator&#148;). The Liquidator (if other than the General Partner) shall be
entitled to receive such compensation for its services as may be approved by a Majority Interest.
The Liquidator shall agree not to resign at any time without 15&nbsp;days&#146; prior written notice and (if
other than the General Partner) may be removed at any time, with or without cause, by notice of
removal approved by a Majority Interest. Upon dissolution, resignation or removal of the
Liquidator, a successor and substitute Liquidator (who shall have and succeed to all rights, powers
and obligations of the original Liquidator) shall, within 30&nbsp;days thereafter, be approved by a
Majority Interest. Except as expressly provided in this Article&nbsp;XIV, the Liquidator approved in

of this Agreement (but subject to all of the applicable limitations, contractual and otherwise,
upon the exercise of such powers, other than the restrictions set forth in Article&nbsp;XVII) to the
extent appropriate or necessary in the good faith judgment of the Liquidator to carry out the
duties and functions of the Liquidator hereunder for and during such period of time as shall be
reasonably required in the good faith judgment of the Liquidator to complete the winding-up and
liquidation of the Partnership as provided for herein. The Liquidator shall liquidate the assets
of the Partnership and apply and distribute the proceeds of such liquidation in the following order
of priority, unless otherwise required by mandatory provisions of applicable law:

sole discretion, defer for a reasonable time the liquidation of any assets except those necessary
to satisfy liabilities of the Partnership and may, in its sole discretion, distribute to the
Partners, or to specific classes of Partners, as tenants in common, in lieu of cash, and as their
