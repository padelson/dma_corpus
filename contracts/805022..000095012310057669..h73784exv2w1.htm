 (a) All of the limited liability company interests in MergerCo outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become a 100% limited partner interest in Holdings, which limited partner interest shall be duly authorized and validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable (except to the extent such non-assessability may be affected by Sections 17-303, 17-607 and 17-804 of the DRULPA), and Partners, as the holder of such limited partner interest, shall be admitted as the sole limited partner of Holdings.

   #####

 (d) All Common Units and Management Units, when converted in the Merger, shall cease to be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and cease to exist. At the Effective Time, each holder of a certificate representing Common Units or Management Units (a "Certificate") and each holder of non-certificated Common Units or Management Units represented by book-entry ("Book-Entry Units") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive (i) the Merger Consideration, (ii) any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional New LP Unit in accordance with Section 3.3(e) and (iii) any distributions in accordance with Section 3.3(c), and in each case to be issued or paid in consideration therefor in accordance with Section 3.3. 

  

 Section 3.2 _Rights As Unitholders; Unit Transfers._ At the Effective Time, holders of Common Units and Management Units shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as, unitholders of Holdings, other than to receive (a) any distribution with respect to such Common Units and Management Units with a record date occurring prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or made by Holdings on such Common Units and Management Units in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or prior to the date hereof and which remains unpaid at the Effective Time and (b) the consideration provided under this Article III. After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the unit transfer books of Holdings with respect to the Common Units or Management Units. 

  

 Section 3.3 _Exchange of Certificates._  

  

 (a) _Exchange Agent._ Partners shall deposit or shall cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of Common Units and Management Units, for exchange in accordance with this Article III, through the Exchange Agent, the New LP Units and cash as required by this Article III. Partners agrees to make available to the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay any distributions pursuant to Section 3.2(a) and Section 3.3(c) and to make payments in lieu of any fractional New LP Units pursuant to Section 3.3(e). Any cash and New LP Units deposited with the Exchange Agent (including as payment for any fractional New LP Units in accordance with Section 3.3(e) and any distributions in accordance with Section 3.3(c)) shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Exchange Fund." The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be paid for Common Units or Management Units pursuant to this Agreement out of the Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated by Sections 3.3(c) and 3.3(e), the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. 

  

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Partners shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each record holder of Common Units or Management Units (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that in respect of certificated units, delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and shall be in customary form and agreed to by Partners and Holdings prior to the Effective Time) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Units in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Common Units or Management Units represented by such Certificates or Book- 

   ##### 

  

 

Entry Units. Promptly after the Effective Time, upon surrender of
Certificates, if any, for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with
such letters of transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, and such
other documents (including in respect of Book-Entry Units) as may be required
pursuant to such instructions, the holders of Common Units or Management Units
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) New LP Units
representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of New LP Units that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to this Article III (after taking
into account all Common Units and Management Units then held by such holder)
and (B) a check in the amount equal to the aggregate amount of cash that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to this Article III, including cash
payable in lieu of any fractional New LP Units pursuant to Section 3.3(e) and
distributions pursuant to Section 3.3(c). No interest shall be paid or
accrued on any Merger Consideration or on any unpaid distributions payable to
holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Units. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Common Units or Management Units that is not registered in the
transfer records of Holdings, the Merger Consideration payable in respect of
such Common Units or Management Units may be paid to a transferee, if the
Certificate representing such Common Units or Management Units or evidence
of ownership of the Book-Entry Units are presented to the Exchange Agent, and
in the case of both certificated and book-entry Common Units or Management
Units, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange
Agent in advance any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the
delivery of the Merger Consideration in any name other than that of the
record holder of such Common Units or Management Units, or shall establish to
the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Taxes have been paid or are
not payable. Until the required documentation has been delivered
and Certificates, if any, have been surrendered, as contemplated by this
Section 3.3, each Certificate or Book-Entry Unit shall be deemed at any time
after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Common Units
or Management Units and any distributions to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 3.2. 

   

 (c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Common Units_. No distributions declared or made with respect to LP Units with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any Common Units or Management Units with respect to the New LP Units that such holder would be entitled to receive in accordance herewith and no cash payment in lieu of fractional New LP Units shall be paid to any such holder until such holder shall deliver the required documentation and surrender any Certificate as contemplated by this Section 3.3. Subject to applicable Law, following compliance with the requirements of Section 3.3(b), there shall be paid to such holder of the New LP Units issuable in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly after the time of such compliance, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of fractional New LP Units to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.3(e) and the amount of distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to the New LP Units and payable with respect to such New LP Units, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such compliance payable with respect to such New LP Units. 

  

 (d) _Further Rights in Holdings Units_. The Merger Consideration issued upon conversion of a Common Unit or Management Unit in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid pursuant to Section 3.2, Section 3.3(c) or Section 3.3(e)) shall be 

   ##### 

  

 

deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such Common Unit or Management Unit, respectively. 

   

 (e) _Fractional LP Units_. No certificates or scrip of the New LP Units representing fractional New LP Units or book entry credit of the same shall be issued upon the exchange of Common Units or Management Units in accordance with Section 3.3(b), and such fractional interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights as a holder of any New LP Units. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of Common Units or Management Units exchanged in the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a New LP Unit (after taking into account all Common Units or Management Units exchanged by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest rounded up to the nearest whole cent) in an amount equal to the product of (i) the closing sale price of the LP Units on the NYSE as reported by _The Wall Street Journal_ on the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Effective Time shall occur and (ii) the fraction of a New LP Unit that such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to this Article III. As promptly as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of fractional interests, the Exchange Agent shall so notify Partners, and Partners shall, or shall cause the Surviving Entity to, deposit such amount with the Exchange Agent and shall cause the Exchange Agent to forward payments to such holders of fractional interests subject to and in accordance with the terms hereof. 

  

 (f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund constituting New LP Units or cash that remains undistributed to the holders of Common Units or Management Units after 180 days following the Effective Time shall be delivered to Partners upon demand and, from and after such delivery, any former holders of Common Units or Management Units who have not theretofore complied with this Article III shall thereafter look only to Partners for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such Common Units or Management Units, any cash in lieu of fractional New LP Units to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 3.3(e) and any distributions with respect to the New LP Units to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 3.3(c), in each case, without any interest thereon. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Common Units or Management Units immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any governmental entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Partners, free and clear of any Liens, claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

  

 (g) _No Liability_. Neither Partners, Holdings, nor the Surviving Entity shall be liable to any holder of Common Units or Management Units for any LP Units (or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

  

 (h) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Partners, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Partners may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Common Units or 

   ##### 

  

 

Management Units represented by such Certificate and any distributions to
which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 3.2. 

   

 (i) _Withholding_. Each of Partners, the Surviving Entity and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Common Units or Management Units such amounts as Partners, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold under the Code or any provision of state, local, or foreign Tax Law, with respect to the making of such payment; provided, however, that Partners, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, shall provide reasonable notice to the applicable holders of Common Units or Management Units prior to withholding any amounts pursuant to this Section 3.3(i). To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by Partners, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Common Units or Management Units in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by Partners, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be. 

  

 (j) _Book Entry and Admission of Holders of New LP Units as Additional Limited Partners of Partners_. All New LP Units to be issued in the Merger shall be issued in book entry form, without physical certificates. Upon the issuance of New LP Units to the holders of Common Units or Management Units in accordance with this Section 3.3 and the compliance by such holders with the requirements of Section 12.4 of the Partners Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement, Partners GP shall consent to the admission of such holders as limited partners of Partners and reflect such admission on the books and records of Partners. 

  

 Section 3.4 _Anti-Dilution Provisions._ In the event of any subdivisions, reclassifications, recapitalizations, splits, combinations or distributions in the form of equity interests with respect to the Common Units, Management Units and the LP Units (in each case, as permitted pursuant to Section 4.3), the number of New LP Units to be issued in the Merger and the average closing sales prices of the LP Units determined in accordance with Section 3.3(e) will be correspondingly adjusted.

COVENANTS 

  

 Holdings hereby covenants to and agrees with Partners, and Partners hereby covenants to and agrees with Holdings, that:

In complying with the foregoing, neither it nor its Subsidiaries shall be required to take measures that would have a Material Adverse Effect on it and such Subsidiaries taken as a whole. 

  

 Section 6.2 _Equityholder Approvals._ Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of them shall take, in accordance with applicable Law, applicable stock exchange rules and the Holdings Partnership Agreement, in the case of Holdings, and the Partners Partnership Agreement, in the case of Partners, all action necessary to call, hold and convene, respectively, an appropriate meeting of the holders of Common Units and Management Units of Holdings to consider and vote upon the approval of the Merger, the approval and adoption of this Agreement, and any other matters required to be approved by Holdings unitholders for consummation of the Merger (including any adjournment or postponement, the "Holdings Meeting") and an appropriate meeting of the holders of the LP Units of Partners to consider and vote upon the approval of this Agreement and the Merger Transactions and any other matters required to be approved by them for consummation of the Merger (including any adjournment or postponement, the "Partners Meeting"; and each of the Holdings Meeting and Partners Meeting, a "Meeting"), respectively, promptly after the date hereof.

The Partners Audit Committee shall recommend approval of this Agreement and the Merger Transactions to the holders of LP Units (the "Partners Recommendation"), and the Partners Audit Committee shall take all reasonable lawful action to solicit such approval of the holders of the LP Units. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining Partners Unitholder Approval, the 

   ##### 

  

 

Partners Audit Committee may withdraw, modify or qualify in any manner adverse
to Holdings the Partners Recommendation (any such action being referred to as
a "Partners Change in Recommendation") if it has concluded in good faith,
after consultation with, its outside legal counsel and financial advisors,
that a failure to make a Partners Change in Recommendation would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under the Partners Partnership
Agreement and applicable Law;  _provided, however_ , that the Partners Audit
Committee shall not be entitled to exercise its rights to make a Partners
Change in Recommendation pursuant to this sentence unless Partners has
provided to Holdings three (3) Business Days prior written notice advising
Holdings that the Partners Audit Committee intends to take such action and
specifying the reasons therefor in reasonable detail, including, if
applicable, the terms and conditions of any proposed transaction that is the
basis of the proposed action. Any Partners Change in Recommendation shall not
change the approval of this Agreement or any other approval of the Partners
Audit Committee, including in any respect that would have the effect of
causing any state (including Delaware) takeover statute or other
similar statute to be applicable to the matters contemplated hereby. The
obligation of Partners to call, hold and convene the Partners Meeting shall
not be affected by a Partners Change in Recommendation and the obligation of
Holdings to call, hold and convene the Holdings Meeting shall not be
affected by a Holdings Change in Recommendation. 

   

 Section 6.3 _Registration Statement._  

  

 (a) Each of Partners and Holdings agrees to cooperate in the preparation of a registration statement on Form S-4 (the "Registration Statement") (including the joint proxy statement and prospectus and other proxy solicitation materials of Partners and Holdings constituting a part thereof (the "Joint Proxy Statement") and all related documents) to be filed by Partners with the SEC in connection with the issuance of New LP Units in the Merger as contemplated by this Agreement. Provided Holdings has cooperated as required above, Partners agrees to file the Registration Statement with the SEC as promptly as practicable. Each of Holdings and Partners agrees to use all commercially reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after filing thereof. Partners also agrees to use commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of Partners and Holdings agrees to furnish to the other party all information concerning Partners, Partners GP and its Subsidiaries or Holdings, Holdings GP and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, and the officers, directors and unitholders of Partners and Holdings and any applicable Affiliates, as applicable, and to take such other action as may be reasonably requested in connection with the foregoing. 

  

 (b) Each of Holdings and Partners agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries, that (i) none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Registration Statement will, at the time the Registration Statement and each amendment or supplement thereto, if any, becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date of mailing to unitholders and at the times of the Partners Meeting and Holdings Meeting, not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to 

   ##### 

  

 

state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. Each of Holdings and Partners further agrees that if it shall
become aware prior to the Closing Date of any information that would cause
any of the statements in the Registration Statement to be false or misleading
with respect to any material fact, or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not false or misleading, it will promptly inform the
other party thereof and take the necessary steps to correct such information
in an amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement. 

   

 (c) Partners will advise Holdings, promptly after Partners receives notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, of the issuance of any stop order or the suspension of the qualification of the New LP Units for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or threat of any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by the SEC for the amendment or supplement of the Registration Statement or for additional information. 

  

 (d) Each of Partners and Holdings will use its commercially reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to its unitholders as soon as practicable after the effective date of the Registration Statement. 

  

 Section 6.4 _Press Releases._ Prior to a (a) Holdings Change in Recommendation, if any, or (b) Partners Change in Recommendation, if any, each of Holdings and Partners will not, without the prior approval of the Holdings GP Board in the case of Holdings and the Partners Audit Committee in the case of Partners, issue any press release or written statement for general circulation relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, except as otherwise required by applicable Law or the rules of the NYSE, in which case it will consult with the other party before issuing any such press release or written statement. 

  

 Section 6.5 _Access; Information._  

  

 (a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, each party shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, afford the other parties and their officers, employees, counsel, accountants and other authorized representatives, access, during normal business hours throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to all of its properties, books, contracts, commitments and records, and to its officers, employees, accountants, counsel or other representatives, and, during such period, it shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to such Person and its representatives (i) a copy of each material report, schedule and other document filed by it pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities law (other than reports or documents that Holdings or Partners or their respective Subsidiaries, as the case may be, are not permitted to disclose under applicable Law) and (ii) all other information concerning the business, properties and personnel of it as the other may reasonably request. Neither Holdings nor Partners nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or control of such information or contravene any Law, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under the circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) Partners and Holdings, respectively, will not use any information obtained pursuant to this Section 6.5 (to which it was not entitled under Law or any agreement other than this Agreement) for any purpose unrelated to (i) the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) the matters contemplated by Section 6.6 in accordance with the terms thereof, and will hold all information and documents obtained pursuant to this Section 6.5 in confidence. No investigation by either party of the business and affairs of the other shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement, or the conditions to either partys obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 Section 6.6 _Acquisition Proposals; Change in Recommendation._  

  

 (a) None of Holdings GP, Holdings and its Subsidiaries shall, and they shall use their commercially reasonable best efforts to cause their Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) knowingly initiate, solicit or encourage the submission of any Acquisition Proposal, or (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any non-public information with respect to, any Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to the limitations in Section 6.6(b), nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit Holdings from furnishing any information to, including information pertaining to Partners, or entering into or participating in discussions or negotiations with, any person that makes an unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a knowing and intentional breach of this Section 6.6 (a "Receiving Party"), if (i) the Holdings GP Board, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, determines in good faith (A) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is likely to result in a Superior Proposal, and (B) that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under the Holdings Partnership Agreement and applicable Law and (ii) prior to furnishing any such non-public information to such Receiving Party, Holdings receives from such Receiving Party an executed Confidentiality Agreement, _provided, however,_ that if Holdings receives an Acquisition Proposal that includes a Partners Acquisition Proposal, Holdings may, in its discretion, respond to a Receiving Party to indicate that Holdings cannot entertain an Acquisition Proposal that includes a Partners Acquisition Proposal. 

  

 (b) Holdings may provide any Receiving Party with any non-public information or data pertaining to Partners (the "Partners Non-Public Information") only if Holdings has not knowingly and intentionally breached this Section 6.6 and then only if (i) the Holdings GP Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors that the provision of such Partners Non-Public Information to the Receiving Party could possibly lead to a Holdings Change in Recommendation and (ii) Holdings shall have first (A) required the Receiving Party to execute a Confidentiality Agreement, (B) furnished a copy of such Confidentiality Agreement to Partners and (C) notified Partners of the identity of such Receiving Party. Holdings shall promptly provide or make available to Partners any non-public information concerning Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries that is provided or made available to any Receiving Party pursuant to this Section 6.6 which was not previously provided or made available to Partners. Partners shall provide to Holdings and any Receiving Party that has executed a Confidentiality Agreement any Partners Non-Public Information that Holdings reasonably requests in exercising its rights under this Section 6.6. Holdings shall not provide to any Receiving Party, and Partners shall not be required to provide to any Receiving Party, in 

   ##### 

  

 

each case pursuant to this Section 6.6, any information pertaining to Partners
where Holdings knows that the provision of such information would (x)
jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or
control of such information or (y) contravene any Law or binding agreement
entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. 

   

 (c) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 6.6(c), the Holdings GP Board shall not (1) (a) withdraw, modify or qualify in any manner adverse to Partners the Holdings Recommendation or (b) publicly approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (any action described in this clause (1) being referred to as a "Holdings Change in Recommendation"); or (2) approve, adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, adopt or recommend, or allow Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement, or other similar contract or any tender or exchange offer providing for, with respect to, or in connection with, any Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Holdings Unitholder Approval, the Holdings GP Board (including, in the absence of a Superior Proposal, a majority of the members of the Holdings Audit Committee) may make a Holdings Change in Recommendation if it has concluded in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that failure to make a Holdings Change in Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under the Holdings Partnership Agreement and applicable Law;  _provided, however_ , that the Holdings GP Board shall not be entitled to exercise its right to make a Holdings Change in Recommendation pursuant to this sentence unless Holdings and Holdings GP have: (x) complied in all material respects with this Section 6.6, (y) provided to Partners and the Partners Audit Committee three (3) Business Days prior written notice (such notice, a "Notice of Proposed Recommendation Change") advising Partners that the Holdings GP Board intends to take such action and specifying the reasons therefor in reasonable detail, including, if applicable, the terms and conditions of any Superior Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action and the identity of the Person making the proposal and contemporaneously providing a copy of all relevant proposed transaction documents for such Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the terms of any such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Proposed Recommendation Change and an additional three (3) Business Day period), and (z) if applicable, provided to Partners all materials and information delivered or made available to the Person or group of persons making any Superior Proposal in connection with such Superior Proposal (to the extent not previously provided). Any Holdings Change in Recommendation shall not change the approval of this Agreement or any other approval of the Holdings GP Board, including in any respect that would have the effect of causing any state (including Delaware) corporate takeover statute or other similar statute to be applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including the Merger. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, Partners and Partners GP shall maintain, and cause their Representatives to maintain, the confidentiality of all information received from Holdings pursuant to this Section 6.6, subject to the exceptions contained in the Confidentiality Agreement. 

  

 (d) In addition to the obligations of Holdings set forth in this Section 6.6, Holdings shall as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 24 hours after receipt) advise Partners orally and in writing of any Acquisition Proposal or any matter giving rise to a Holdings Change in Recommendation and the material terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal or 

   ##### 

  

 

any matter giving rise to a Holdings Change in Recommendation (including any
changes thereto) and the identity of the Person making any such Acquisition
Proposal. Holdings shall keep Partners informed on a reasonably current basis
of material developments with respect to any such Acquisition Proposal or any
matter giving rise to a Holdings Change in Recommendation. 

   

 (e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Holdings or the Holdings GP Board from taking and disclosing to the holders of Common Units a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to limited partners) or from making any legally required disclosure to unitholders. Any "stop-look-and-listen" communication by Holdings or the Holdings GP Board to the limited partners of Holdings pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to the limited partners of Holdings) shall not be considered a failure to make, or a withdrawal, modification or change in any manner adverse to Partners of, all or a portion of the Holdings Recommendation. 

  

 Section 6.7 _Affiliate Arrangements._  

  

 (a) Not later than the 15th day after the mailing of the Joint Proxy Statement, Holdings shall deliver to Partners a schedule of each person that, to the best of its knowledge, is or is reasonably likely to be, as of the date of the relevant Meeting, deemed to be an "affiliate" of Holdings (a "Rule 145 Affiliate") as that term is used in Rule 145 under the Securities Act. 

  

 (b) Holdings shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to cause its Rule 145 Affiliates not to sell any securities received under the Merger in violation of the registration requirements of the Securities Act, including Rule 145 thereunder. 

  

 Section 6.8 _Takeover Laws._ Neither party shall take any action that would cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be subject to requirements imposed by any Takeover Laws, and each of them shall take all necessary steps within its control to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement from, or if necessary challenge the validity or applicability of, any rights plan adopted by such party or any applicable Takeover Law, as now or hereafter in effect, including, without limitation, Takeover Laws of any state that purport to apply to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 Section 6.9 _No Rights Triggered._ Each of Holdings and Partners shall take all steps necessary to ensure that the entering into of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and any other action or combination of actions, or any other transactions contemplated hereby, do not and will not result in the grant of any Rights to any person (a) in the case of Holdings under the Holdings Partnership Agreement, and in the case of Partners under the Partners Partnership Agreement or (b) under any material agreement to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party. 

  

 Section 6.10 _New LP Units Listed._ In the case of Partners, Partners shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to list, prior to the Closing, on the NYSE, upon official notice of issuance, the New LP Units. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 6.11 _Third Party Approvals._  

  

 (a) Partners and Holdings and their respective Subsidiaries shall cooperate and use their respective commercially reasonable best efforts to prepare all documentation, to effect all filings, to obtain all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to comply with the terms and conditions of such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations and to cause the Merger to be consummated and the Partners Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement to be effective as expeditiously as practicable. Each of Partners and Holdings shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult with the other, in each case subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, with respect to, all material written information submitted to any third party or any Regulatory Authorities in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto agrees to act reasonably and promptly. Each party hereto agrees that it will consult with the other parties hereto with respect to the obtaining of all material permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Regulatory Authorities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and each party will keep the other parties apprised of the status of material matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 (b) Each party agrees, upon request, to furnish the other party with all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and unitholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Registration Statement, the Joint Proxy Statement or any filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of such other party or any of such Subsidiaries to any Regulatory Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 Section 6.12 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance._ 

  

 (a) Without limiting any additional rights that any director, officer, trustee, employee, agent, or fiduciary may have under any employment or indemnification agreement or under the Holdings Partnership Agreement, the limited liability company agreement of Holdings GP, or this Agreement or, if applicable, similar organizational documents or agreements of any of Holdings Subsidiaries, from and after the Effective Time, Partners and the Surviving Entity, jointly and severally, shall: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each person who is at the date hereof or during the period from the date hereof through the date of the Effective Time serving as a director or officer of Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries or as a fiduciary under or with respect to any employee benefit plan (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA) (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by applicable Law, as now or hereafter in effect, in connection with any Claim and any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, Indemnification Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of any thereof) resulting therefrom; and (ii) promptly pay on behalf of or, within ten (10) days after any request for advancement, advance to each of the Indemnified Parties, any Indemnification Expenses incurred in defending, serving as a witness with respect to or otherwise participating with respect to any Claim in advance of the final disposition of such Claim, including payment on behalf of or advancement to the Indemnified Party of any 

   ##### 

  

 

Indemnification Expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with
enforcing any rights with respect to such indemnification and/or advancement,
in each case without the requirement of any bond or other security). The
indemnification and advancement obligations of Partners and the Surviving
Entity pursuant to this Section 6.12(a) shall extend to acts or omissions
occurring at or before the Effective Time and any Claim relating thereto
(including with respect to any acts or omissions occurring in connection with
the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the consideration and
approval thereof and the process undertaken in connection therewith and any
Claim relating thereto), and all rights to indemnification and advancement
conferred hereunder shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a
director or officer of Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries or as a fiduciary
under or with respect to any employee benefit plan (within the meaning of
Section 3(3) of ERISA) after the date hereof and shall inure to the benefit of
such persons heirs, executors and personal and legal representatives. As
used in this Section 6.12(a): (x) the term "Claim" means any threatened,
asserted, pending or completed action, whether instituted by any party
hereto, any Governmental Authority or any other person, that any Indemnified
Party in good faith believes might lead to the institution of any action or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or other,
including any arbitration or other alternative dispute resolution mechanism
("Action"), arising out of or pertaining to matters that relate to such
Indemnified Partys duties or service as a director or officer of Holdings,
any of its Subsidiaries, or as a fiduciary under or with respect to any
employee benefit plan (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA)
maintained by any of the foregoing at or prior to the Effective Time; and (y)
the term "Indemnification Expenses" means reasonable attorneys fees and all
other reasonable costs, expenses and obligations (including experts fees,
travel expenses, court costs, retainers, transcript fees, duplicating,

being a witness in or participating in (including on appeal), or preparing to
investigate, defend, be a witness in or participate in, any Claim for which
indemnification is authorized pursuant to this Section 6.12(a), including any
Action relating to a claim for indemnification or advancement brought by an
Indemnified Party. Neither Partners nor the Surviving Entity shall
settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any actual or
threatened Action in respect of which indemnification has been or could be

Any indemnification pursuant to this Section 17 shall be made only out of the assets of the Partnership, it being agreed that the General Partner shall not be personally liable for such indemnification and shall have no obligation to contribute or loan any monies or property to the Partnership to enable it to effectuate such indemnification. 

  

 (b) To the fullest extent permitted by law, expenses (including legal fees and expenses) incurred by an Indemnitee who is indemnified pursuant to Section 17(a) in defending any claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding shall, from time to time, be advanced by the Partnership prior to a determination that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified upon receipt by the Partnership of any undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay such amount if it shall be determined that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified as authorized in this Section 17. 

  

 (c) The indemnification provided by this Section 17 shall be in addition to any other rights to which an Indemnitee may be entitled under any agreement, pursuant to any vote of the Limited Partner, as a matter of law or otherwise, both as to actions in the Indemnitees capacity as an Indemnitee and as to actions in any other capacity, and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to serve in such capacity and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, successors, assigns and administrators of the Indemnitee. 

  

 (d) For purposes of this Section 17, the Partnership shall be deemed to have requested an Indemnitee to serve as fiduciary of an employee benefit plan whenever the performance by it of its duties to the Partnership also imposes duties on, or otherwise involves services by, it to the plan or participants or beneficiaries of the plan; excise taxes assessed on an Indemnitee with respect to an employee benefit plan pursuant to applicable law shall constitute " _fines_ " within the meaning of Section 17(a); and action taken or omitted by it with respect to any employee benefit plan in the performance of its duties for a purpose reasonably believed by it to 

   ##### 

  

 

be in the best interest of the participants and beneficiaries of the plan
shall be deemed to be for a purpose that is in the best interests of the
Partnership. 

   

 (e) An Indemnitee shall not be denied indemnification in whole or in part under this Section 17 because the Indemnitee had an interest in the transaction with respect to which the indemnification applies if the transaction was otherwise permitted by the terms of this Agreement. 

  

 (f) The provisions of this Section 17 are for the benefit of the Indemnitees, their heirs, successors, assigns and administrators and shall not be deemed to create any rights for the benefit of any other Persons. 

  

 (g) No amendment, modification or repeal of this Section 17 or any provision hereof shall in any manner terminate, reduce or impair the right of any past, present or future Indemnitee to be indemnified by the Partnership, nor the obligations of the Partnership to indemnify any such Indemnitee under and in accordance with the provisions of this Section 17 as in effect immediately prior to such amendment, modification or repeal with respect to claims arising from or relating to matters occurring, in whole or-in part, prior to such amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of when such claims may arise or be asserted. 

  

 (h) Subject to the rights of the Indemnitees in Section 17(g), which shall remain in full force and effect, the Limited Partner may, by 14 days notice to the General Partner, terminate this Section 17 (together with its guarantee thereof) on a prospective basis only, following the later of (a) the date the General Partner no longer has the right to cause the Partnership to appoint at least one Director and (b) the Applicable Date (as defined in the Support Agreement, dated as of June 10, 2010, by and among the Limited Partner, BGH GP Holdings, and certain other parties). Notwithstanding Section 13, prior to the effective date of such termination, the General Partner shall have the right to require the Limited Partner (or a wholly owned Subsidiary of the Limited Partner designated by the Limited Partner) to purchase the interests of the General Partner in the Partnership for $1,000, effective as of the date of termination of this Section 17. 

  

 18\. _Liability of Indemnitees_. 

   

 (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no Indemnitee shall be liable for monetary damages to the Partnership, the Limited Partner or any other Persons who have acquired interests in the Partnership, for losses sustained or liabilities incurred as a result of any act or omission of an Indemnitee unless there has been a final and non-appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that, in respect of the matter in question, the Indemnitee acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud, willful misconduct or, in the case of a criminal matter, acted with knowledge that the Indemnitees conduct was criminal. 

  

 (b) The General Partner shall not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any agent which exercised the powers granted to the General Partner pursuant to the Prior Agreement and appointed by the General Partner in good faith.

 (d) Any amendment, modification or repeal of this Section 18 or any provision hereof shall be prospective only and shall not in any way affect the limitations on the liability of the Indemnitees under this Section 18 as in effect immediately prior to such amendment, modification or repeal with respect to claims arising from or relating to matters occurring, in whole or in part, prior to such amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of when such claims may arise or be asserted, and provided such Person became an Indemnitee hereunder prior to such amendment, modification or repeal.

Section 5.1 _Capital Accounts_  

   

 (a) The Partnership shall maintain for each Partner a separate Capital Account with respect to its Partnership Interests in accordance with the regulations issued pursuant to Section 704 of the Code. The Capital Account of any Partner shall be increased by (i) the Net Agreed Value of all Capital Contributions made by such Partner in exchange for its Partnership Interest and (ii) all items of income and gain computed in accordance with Section 5.1(b) and allocated to such Partner pursuant to Section 5.1(c) and reduced by (iii) the Net Agreed Value of all distributions of cash or property made to such Partner with respect to its Partnership Interest and (iv) all items of deduction and loss computed in accordance with Section 5.1(b) and allocated to such Partner pursuant to Section 5.1(c). 

  

 (b) For purposes of computing the amount of each item of income, gain, loss or deduction to be reflected in the Capital Accounts, the determination, recognition and classification of such item shall be the same as its determination, recognition and classification for federal income tax purposes, provided that: 

   

 (i) Any deductions for depreciation, cost recovery or amortization attributable to any Partnership property shall be determined as if the adjusted basis of such property was equal to the Carrying Value of such property. Upon an adjustment to the Carrying Value of any Partnership property subject to depreciation, cost recovery or amortization pursuant to Sections 5.1(e) or 7.8, any further deductions for such depreciation, cost recovery or amortization attributable to such property shall be determined as if the adjusted basis of such property was equal to the Carrying Value of such property immediately following such adjustment. 

   

 (ii) If the Partnerships adjusted basis in property subject to depreciation, cost recovery or amortization is reduced for federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 48(q)(1) of the Code, the amount of such reduction shall be deemed to be an additional item of deduction in the year such property is placed in service. Any restoration of such basis pursuant to Section 48(q)(2) of the Code shall be deemed to be an additional item of income in the year of restoration. 

   

 (iii) Any income, gain or loss attributable to the taxable disposition of any Partnership property shall be determined by the Partnership as if the adjusted basis of such property as of such date of disposition was equal in amount to the Carrying Value of such property as of such date. 

   

 (iv) All fees and other expenses incurred by the Partnership to promote the sale of (or to sell) a Partnership Interest that can neither be deducted nor amortized under Section 709 of the Code shall be treated as items of deduction. 

   

 (v) The computation of all items of income, gain, loss and deduction shall be made without regard to any election under Section 754 of the Code which may be made 

   ##### 

  

    

by the Partnership and, as to those items described in Section 705(a)(1)(B) or
Section 705(a)(2)(B) of the Code, without regard to the fact that such items
are not includible in gross income or are neither currently deductible nor
capitalizable for federal income tax purposes. 

  

 (c) (i) After giving effect to the special allocations set forth in Section 5.1(c)(ii)-(iv) for purposes of maintaining the Capital Accounts, each item of income, gain, loss and deduction (computed in accordance with Section 5.1(b)) shall be allocated to the Partners in accordance with their respective Percentage Interests. 

   

 (ii) If any Partner unexpectedly receives any adjustment allocation or distribution described in Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), 1.704-1 (b)(2)(ii)(d)(5), or 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(6), items of Partnership income and gain shall be specially allocated to such Partner in an amount and manner sufficient to eliminate a deficit in its Capital Account created by such adjustment, allocation or distribution as quickly as possible. 

   

 (iii) To preserve uniformity of Units, the General Partner may make special allocations of income or deduction pursuant to Section 6.1(c) that do not have a material adverse effect on the Limited Partners and are consistent with the principles of Section 704 of the Code. 

   

 (iv) If there is a net decrease in Partnership minimum gain, within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b) (4) (iv), during a Partnership taxable year, all Partners with deficit balances in their Capital Accounts, computed as described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(4)(iv)(c) at the end of such year, will be allocated items of Partnership income and gain for such year (and, if necessary, subsequent years) in the amounts and in the proportions needed to eliminate such deficits as quickly as possible, before any other allocations are made under Section 704(b) of the Code. 

   

 (v) (A) In the event the Carrying Value of Partnership property is adjusted pursuant to Section 5.1(e), this Section 5.1(c)(v) is intended to cause the respective Capital Accounts of the Partners to return to, over time, the relative proportionality of the Capital Account balances of the Partners if the prior adjustment to the Carrying Value of Partnership property had not occurred. To effectuate the intent of this Section 5.1(c)(v)(A), the General Partner may allocate that portion of the deductions, cost recovery or amortization attributable to an adjustment to the Carrying Value of a Partnership property pursuant to Section 5.1(e) in the same manner that the Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss attributable to such property is allocated pursuant to Section 5.1(e). 

   

 (B) In making the allocations required under this Section 5.1(c)(v), including the allocations that may result from the sale or other taxable disposition of any Partnership property that has been subject to an adjustment to the Carrying Value of such Partnership property, the General Partner may apply whatever 

   ##### 

  

    

conventions or other methodology it determines will satisfy the purpose of
this Section 5.1(c)(v). 

  

 (d) (i) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 5.1(d), a transferee of LP Units shall, upon becoming a Limited Partner, succeed to the portion of the transferors Capital Account maintained with respect to the Units transferred. 

   

 (ii) If a transfer of Units causes a termination of the Partnership under Section 708(b)(1)(B) of the Code, the Partnership properties shall be deemed to have been distributed in liquidation of the Partnership to the Partners (including the transferee of the Units) pursuant to Sections 14.4 and 14.5 and recontributed by such Partners and transferees in reconstitution of the Partnership. The Capital Accounts of such reconstituted Partnership shall be maintained in accordance with this Article V. 

  

 (e) If any additional LP Units (or other Partnership Interests) are to be issued pursuant to Section 4.3, or if any Partnership Property is to be distributed, the Capital Accounts of the Partners (and the Carrying Values of all Partnership properties) shall, immediately prior to such issuance or distribution, be adjusted (consistent with the provisions hereof and of Section 704(b) of the Code) upwards or downwards to reflect any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss attributable to all Partnership properties (as if such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss had been recognized upon an actual sale of such properties immediately prior to such issuance). In determining such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss, the fair market value of Partnership properties, as of any date of determination, (i) shall, in the case of the issuance of additional LP Units, be deemed to be equal to (A) the number of Units outstanding, as of the date of determination, times the Issue Price for which such additional LP Units are so issued, plus (B) the fair market value of any Partnership Interests not otherwise valued pursuant to Section 5.1(e)(i)(A) and (C) the amount of any Partnership indebtedness outstanding as of the date of determination, (ii) shall, in the case of an issuance of other Partnership Interests, be deemed to be equal to (A) the number of Units outstanding, as of the date of determination, times the last reported sales price per LP Unit on the principal National Securities Exchange on which such LP Units are listed, plus (B) the fair market value of any Partnership Interests not otherwise valued pursuant to Section 5.1(e)(ii)(A) and (C) the amount of any Partnership indebtedness outstanding as of the date of determination, and (iii) shall, in the case of the distribution of Partnership property, be determined in the manner provided in Section 14.3. 

  

Section 5.2 _Distributions in Respect of Partnership Interests_  

   

 (a) From time to time, not less often than quarterly, the General Partner shall review the Partnerships accounts to determine whether distributions are appropriate. The General Partner may make such cash distributions as it may determine, without being limited to current or accumulated income or gains, from any Partnership funds, including, without limitation, Partnership revenues, Capital Contributions or borrowed funds. The General Partner may also distribute to the Partners other Partnership property, additional Units or other securities of the Partnership or other entities. 

   ##### 

  

  

 All distributions in respect of Units shall be made concurrently to all Record Holders on the Record Date set for purposes of such distribution and shall be prorated in accordance with such Record Holders respective Percentage Interests as of such Record Date. 

  

 (b) Amounts paid pursuant to Section 7.4, any Management Agreement or any Operating Partnership Agreement shall not be deemed to be distributions with respect to a Partnership Interest for purposes of this Agreement.

Section 6.1 _Tax Allocations_  

   

 (a) Except as otherwise provided herein, for federal income tax purposes, each item of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit of the Partnership shall be allocated among the Partners in the manner in which the correlative item of "book" income, gain, loss or deduction is computed in accordance with Section 5.1(b) and allocated pursuant to Section 5.1(c), except that the General Partner shall have the authority to make such other allocations as are necessary and appropriate to comply with Section 704 of the Code and the regulations issued pursuant thereto. 

  

 (b) Gain resulting from the sale or other taxable disposition of Partnership assets and allocated to (or recognized by) a Partner (or its successor in interest) for federal income tax purposes shall be deemed to be Recapture Income to the extent such Partner has been allocated or has claimed any deduction directly or indirectly giving rise to the treatment of such gain as Recapture Income.

 (d) Items of Partnership income, gain, loss, deduction and credit shall, for federal income tax purposes, be determined on a monthly basis (or other basis, as required or permitted by Section 706 of the Code) and shall be allocated to the Persons who are Record Holders of Units as of the close of business on the first day of such month; provided, however, that gain or loss on a sale or other disposition of all or a substantial portion of the assets of the Partnership shall be allocated to the Persons who are Record Holders of Units as of the close of business on the date of sale.

Each Limited Partner hereby waives any and all defenses or other remedies which may be available against such Person to contest, negate or disaffirm any action of the General Partner in connection with any such dealing. In no event shall any Person dealing with the General Partner or its representatives be obligated to ascertain that the terms of this Agreement have been complied with or to inquire into the necessity or expedience of any act or action of the General Partner or its representatives.

Section 7.5 _Purchase or Sale of LP Units and Other Partnership Securities_

Section 7.7 _Outside Activities; Contracts with Affiliates; Loans to or from

No member of the Partnership Group nor any of the Partners shall have any rights by virtue of this Agreement or the partnership relationship governed hereby in any such business interests. 

  

 (c) Each of the Limited Partners hereby approves, ratifies and confirms the execution, delivery and performance of the Operating Partnership Agreements, and the Management Agreements and agrees that the General Partner is authorized to execute, deliver and perform the 

   ##### 

  

 

other agreements, acts, transactions and matters described therein on behalf
of the Partnership without the approval or vote of any Limited Partners,
notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the Operating
Partnership Agreements. 

   

 (d) The Partnership may lend or contribute to any Group Member, and any Group Member may borrow from the Partnership, funds on terms and conditions established by the General Partner; provided, however, that the Partnership may not charge the Group Member interest at a rate less than the rate that would be charged to the Group Member (without reference to the Group Members financial abilities or guarantees) by unrelated lenders on comparable loans. The foregoing authority shall be exercised by the General Partner shall not create any right or benefit in favor of any Group Member or any other Person. 

  

Section 7.8 _Tax Basis and Value Determinations_  

   

 To the extent that the General Partner is required pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement to establish fair market values or allocate amounts realized, tax basis, Agreed Values or Net Agreed Values, the General Partner shall establish such values and make such allocations in a manner that is reasonable and fair to the Limited Partners, taking into account all applicable laws, governmental regulations, rulings and decisions. The General Partner may modify or revise such allocations in order to comply with such laws, governmental regulations, rulings or decisions or to the extent it otherwise deems such modification or revision appropriate or necessary. The General Partner is authorized, to the extent deemed by it to be appropriate or necessary, to utilize the services of an independent appraiser in establishing such values or allocations and the General Partner shall in such cases be entitled to rely on the values or allocations established by such independent appraiser. 

  

Section 7.9 _Resolution of Conflicts of Interest; Standard of Care_  

   

 (a) Unless otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated hereby, whenever a conflict of interest exists or arises between the General Partner or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Partnership or any Limited Partner, on the other hand, any resolution or course of action by the General Partner or such Affiliate in respect of such conflict of interest shall be permitted and deemed approved by all Partners, and shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement or of any agreement contemplated hereby, or of a duty stated or implied by law or equity, if the resolution or course of action is, or by operation of this Agreement is deemed to be, fair and reasonable to the Partnership; provided that any conflict of interest and any resolution of such conflict of interest shall be conclusively deemed fair and reasonable to the Partnership if such conflict of interest or resolution is (i) approved by Special Approval (as long as the material facts known to the officers and directors of the General Partner regarding any proposed transaction were disclosed to the Audit Committee at the time of its approval), (ii) on terms objectively demonstrable to be no less favorable to the Partnership than those generally being provided to or available from unrelated third parties, or (iii) fair to the Partnership, taking into account the totality of the relationships among the parties involved (including other transactions that may be particularly favorable or advantageous to the Partnership). For the avoidance of doubt, in connection with its resolution of a conflict of interest the General Partner is authorized but not required to seek Special Approval and may adopt a resolution or course of action that has not received Special Approval. In connection with 

   ##### 

  

 

the determination by the General Partner (or the Audit Committee in connection
with Special Approval, as applicable) of what is fair and reasonable to the
Partnership in connection with its resolution of a conflict of interest, the
General Partner (or the Audit Committee) shall be authorized to consider (A)
the relative interests of each party to such conflict, agreement, transaction
or situation, and the benefits and burdens relating to such interests; (B)
any customary or accepted industry practices, and any customary or historical
dealings with a particular Person; (C) any applicable generally accepted
accounting or engineering practices or principles; and (D) such additional
factors as the Audit Committee determines to be relevant, reasonable or
appropriate under the circumstances. Nothing contained in this Agreement,
however, is intended to, nor shall it be construed to require the General
Partner (or the Audit Committee) to consider the interests of any Person
other than the Partnership. In the absence of bad faith by the General
Partner, the resolution, action or terms so made, taken or provided by the
General Partner in compliance with this Section 7.9 shall not constitute a
breach of this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated hereby or a
breach of any standard of care or duty imposed hereby or under the Delaware
Act or any other applicable law, rule or regulation. 

   

 (b) Whenever a particular transaction, arrangement or resolution of a conflict of interest is required under this Agreement or any agreement contemplated hereby to be fair and/or reasonable to any Person, the fair and/or reasonable nature of such transaction, arrangement or resolution shall be considered in the context of similar or related transactions. 

  

 (c) Whenever the General Partner makes a determination or takes or declines to take any other action, whether under this Agreement, or any other agreement contemplated hereby or otherwise, then unless another express standard is provided for in this Agreement, the General Partner shall make such determination or take or decline to take such other action in good faith and shall not be subject to any other or different standards imposed by this Agreement, any other agreement contemplated hereby or under the Delaware Act or any other law, rule or regulation or at equity. In order for a determination or other action to be in "good faith" for purposes of this Agreement, the Person or Persons making such determination or taking or declining to take such other action must believe that the determination or other action is in the best interests of the Partnership. 

  

Section 7.10 _[ Reserved]_ 

   

Section 7.11 _Other Matters Concerning the General Partner_

 (b) The General Partner (including the Audit Committee) may consult with legal counsel, accountants, appraisers, management consultants, investment bankers and other consultants and advisors selected by it and shall be fully protected in relying on any opinion or advice of any such Person as to matters which the General Partner (including the Audit Committee) believes to be within such Persons professional or expert competence in connection with any action taken or suffered or omitted by the General Partner (including the Audit Committee) hereunder in good faith and in accordance with such opinion or advice. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) The General Partner (including the Audit Committee) may exercise any of the powers granted to it by this Agreement and perform any of the duties imposed upon it hereunder either directly or by or through its agents, and the General Partner (including the Audit Committee) shall not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any such agent appointed by the General Partner in good faith. 

  

Section 7.12 _Limited Liability; Indemnification_  

   

 (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, and except to the extent required by applicable law, no Indemnitee shall be liable to the Partnership or any Partner for any action taken or omitted to be taken by such Indemnitee in its capacity as a person of the type described in the definition of the term, "Indemnitee," provided that such Indemnitee acted in good faith and such action or omission does not involve the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of _nolo contendere_ , or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that an Indemnitee did not act in good faith or that an action or omission involves gross negligence or willful misconduct. 

  

 (b) The Partnership shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, indemnify each Indemnitee against expenses (including legal fees and expenses), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement, actually and reasonably incurred by such Indemnitee, in connection with any threatened, pending or completed claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding to which such Indemnitee was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party, by reason of (i) such Indemnitees status as a General Partner, any Affiliate of the General Partner, any Person who is or was a director, officer, manager, member, employee or agent of the General Partner or any such Affiliate, or any Person who is or was serving at the request of the General Partner or any such Affiliate as a director, officer, manager, member, partner, trustee, employee or agent of another Person (including any Person serving in such a role at Services Company) or (ii) any action taken or omitted to be taken by such Indemnitee in any capacity referred to in clause (i) of this Section 7.12(b), relating to this Agreement or the property, business, affairs or management of the Partnership Group or Services Company (provided that the Indemnitee acted in good faith and the act or omission which is the basis of such claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding does not involve the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee). 

  

 (c) Expenses (including legal fees and expenses) incurred in defending any claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding subject to Section 7.12(b) shall be paid by the Partnership in advance of the final disposition of such claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking (which need not be secured) by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined, by a court of competent jurisdiction, that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Partnership as authorized hereunder. 

  

 (d) The indemnification provided by Section 7.12(b) shall be in addition to any other rights to which an Indemnitee may be entitled, and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to serve in a capacity for which the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, successors, assigns, administrators and personal representatives of the Indemnitee. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (e) To the extent commercially reasonable, the Partnership shall purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of the Indemnitees against any liability which may be asserted against or expense which may be incurred by an Indemnitee in connection with the Partnership Groups activities, whether or not the Partnership would have the power to indemnify an Indemnitee against such liability under the provisions of this Agreement. 

  

 (f) An Indemnitee shall not be denied indemnification in whole or in part under Section 7.12(b) because the Indemnitee had an interest in the transaction with respect to which the indemnification applies if the transaction was otherwise permitted by the terms of this Agreement or any predecessor agreement thereto, including a transaction involving the General Partner, any Affiliate thereof or any member, partner, officer, director, employee, agent, manager, or trustee of any Group Member, Services Company, the General Partner or any Affiliate of any Group Member. 

  

 (g) The provisions of this Section 7.12 are for the benefit of the Indemnitees and the heirs, successors, assigns, administrators and personal representatives of the Indemnitees and shall not be deemed to create any rights for the benefit of any other Persons. 

  

 (h) For purposes of this Section 7.12, the Partnership shall be deemed to have requested an Indemnitee to serve as fiduciary of an employee benefit plan whenever the performance of duties by such Indemnitee for the Partnership also imposes duties on, or otherwise involves services by, such Indemnitee to the plan or participants or beneficiaries of the plan; excise taxes assessed on an Indemnitee with respect to an employee benefit plan pursuant to applicable law shall constitute "fines" within the meaning of Section 7.12(b); and action taken or omitted by an Indemnitee with respect to any employee benefit plan in the performance of duties by such Indemnitee for a purpose reasonably believed by such Indemnitee to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of the plan shall be deemed to be for a purpose which does not involve gross negligence or willful misconduct. 

  

 (i) In no event may an Indemnitee subject the Limited Partners to personal liability by reason of the indemnification provisions set forth in this Agreement. 

  

 (j) No amendment, modification or repeal of this Section 7.12 or any provision hereof shall in any manner terminate, reduce or impair the right of any past, present or future Indemnitee to be indemnified by the Partnership, nor the obligations of the Partnership to indemnify any such Indemnitee under and in accordance with the provisions of this Section 7.12, or any predecessor thereto, however numbered, as in effect immediately prior to such amendment, modification or repeal with respect to claims arising from or relating to matters occurring, in whole or in part, prior to such amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of when such claims may arise or be asserted and provided that such Person became an Indemnitee hereunder prior to such amendment, modification or repeal.

 If a successor General Partner is approved pursuant to Sections 13.1 or 14.2 or the proviso to Section 14.1, such successor shall purchase the GP Interest of the former General Partner for an amount in cash equal to the fair market value thereof, determined as of the date the successor General Partner is admitted pursuant to Section 12.3. The fair market value of the GP Interest shall include the value of all rights associated with being the General Partner. The value of the GP Interest shall be reduced by the value of the assumption by the successor General Partner or its Affiliate of the obligations of the General Partner and its Affiliates pursuant to Section 13.1(b)(iii). Such fair market value shall be determined by agreement between the former General Partner and its successor or, failing agreement within 30 days after the date the successor General Partner is so admitted, by a firm of independent appraisers jointly selected by the former General Partner and its successor (or, if the former General Partner and its successor cannot agree on the selection of such a firm within 45 days after the date the successor General Partner is so admitted, by a firm of independent appraisers selected by two firms, one of which will be selected by the former General Partner and the other of which will be selected by the successor).

DISSOLUTION AND LIQUIDATION 

  

Section 14.1 _Dissolution_  

   

 The Partnership shall be dissolved, and its affairs shall be wound up, upon: 

  

 (a) expiration of the term as provided in Section 2.5; 

  

 (b) withdrawal of the General Partner pursuant to Section 13.1 (unless a Person becomes a successor General Partner prior to or on the effective date of such withdrawal); 

  

 (c) bankruptcy or dissolution of the General Partner, or any other event that results in the General Partner ceasing to be a general partner in the Partnership (other than by reason of a withdrawal or removal pursuant to Section 13.1); or 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) an election by the General Partner to dissolve the Partnership which is approved by a Two-Thirds Interest; 

 

provided, however, that the Partnership shall not be dissolved upon an event
described in Sections 14.1(b) or 14.1(c) if, within 90 days of such event,
all Partners agree in writing to continue the business of the Partnership and
to the appointment of a successor General Partner. 

   

 For purposes of this Section 14.1, bankruptcy of the General Partner shall be deemed to have occurred when (i) it commences a voluntary proceeding seeking liquidation, reorganization or other relief under any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect, (ii) it seeks, consents to or acquiesces in the appointment of a trustee, receiver or liquidator for it or for all or any substantial part of its properties, (iii) it is adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent, or has entered against it a final and nonappealable order for relief, under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law now or hereafter in effect, (iv) it executes and delivers a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors, (v) it files an answer or other pleading admitting or failing to contest the material allegations of a petition filed against it in any involuntary proceeding of the nature described in clause (i) above, or (vi) (1) any involuntary proceeding of the nature described in clause (i) above has not been dismissed 120 days after the commencement thereof, (2) the appointment without its consent or acquiescence of a trustee, receiver or liquidator for it or for all or any substantial part of its properties has not been vacated or stayed within 90 days of such appointment, or (3) such appointment has been stayed but is not vacated within 90 days after the expiration of any such stay. 

  

Section 14.2 _Reconstitution_  

   

 Upon dissolution of the Partnership in accordance with Sections 14.1(b) or 14.1(c), and a failure of all Partners to agree to continue the business of the Partnership and to the appointment of a successor General Partner as provided in the proviso to Section 14.1, then within 180 days after the event described in Sections 14.1(b) or 14.1(c), a Majority Interest may elect to reconstitute the Partnership and continue its business by forming a new partnership on terms identical to those set forth in this Agreement and having as a general partner a Person approved by a Majority Interest. Upon any such election by a Majority Interest, all Partners shall be bound thereby and shall be deemed to have consented thereto. Unless such an election is made within such 180-day period, the Partnership shall conduct only activities necessary to wind up its affairs. If such an election is made within such 180-day period, then (a) the reconstituted partnership shall continue until the end of the term set forth in Section 2.5 unless earlier dissolved in accordance with this Article XIV and (b) all necessary steps shall be taken to cancel this Agreement and the Certificate of Limited Partnership and to enter into a new partnership agreement and certificate of limited partnership, and the successor general partner may for this purpose exercise the powers of attorney granted the General Partner pursuant to this Agreement; provided that the right of a Majority Interest to reconstitute and to continue the business of the Partnership shall not exist and may not be exercised unless the Partnership has received an Opinion of Counsel that (i) the exercise of the right would not result in the loss of limited liability of any Limited Partner and (ii) neither the Partnership nor the reconstituted partnership would be treated as an association taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes. 

   ##### 

  

  

Section 14.3 _Liquidation_  

   

 Upon dissolution of the Partnership, unless the Partnership is reconstituted pursuant to Section 14.2, the General Partner, or in the event the General Partner has withdrawn from the Partnership, been removed or dissolved or become bankrupt (as defined in Section 14.1), a liquidator or liquidating committee approved by a Majority Interest shall be the liquidator of the Partnership (the "Liquidator"). The Liquidator (if other than the General Partner) shall be entitled to receive such compensation for its services as may be approved by a Majority Interest. The Liquidator shall agree not to resign at any time without 15 days prior written notice and (if other than the General Partner) may be removed at any time, with or without cause, by notice of removal approved by a Majority Interest. Upon dissolution, resignation or removal of the Liquidator, a successor and substitute Liquidator (who shall have and succeed to all rights, powers and obligations of the original Liquidator) shall, within 30 days thereafter, be approved by a Majority Interest. Except as expressly provided in this Article XIV, the Liquidator approved in the manner provided herein shall have and may exercise, without further authorization or approval of any of the parties hereto, all of the powers conferred upon the General Partner under the terms of this Agreement (but subject to all of the applicable limitations, contractual and otherwise, upon the exercise of such powers, other than the restrictions set forth in Article XVII) to the extent appropriate or necessary in the good faith judgment of the Liquidator to carry out the duties and functions of the Liquidator hereunder for and during such period of time as shall be reasonably required in the good faith judgment of the Liquidator to complete the winding-up and liquidation of the Partnership as provided for herein. The Liquidator shall liquidate the assets of the Partnership and apply and distribute the proceeds of such liquidation in the following order of priority, unless otherwise required by mandatory provisions of applicable law: 

  

 (a) to creditors of the Partnership (including Partners); and 

  

 (b) to the Partners, in proportion to and to the extent of the positive balances in their respective Capital Accounts; 

 

provided, however, that the Liquidator may place in escrow a reserve of cash
or other assets of the Partnership for contingent liabilities in an amount
determined by the Liquidator to be appropriate for such purposes. 

   

Section 14.4 _Distribution in Kind_  

   

 Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 14.3 requiring the liquidation of the assets of the Partnership, but subject to the order of priorities set forth therein, if on dissolution of the Partnership the Liquidator determines that an immediate sale of part or all of the Partnerships assets would be impractical or would cause undue loss to the Partners, the Liquidator may, in its sole discretion, defer for a reasonable time the liquidation of any assets except those necessary to satisfy liabilities of the Partnership and may, in its sole discretion, distribute to the Partners, or to specific classes of Partners, as tenants in common, in lieu of cash, and as their interests may appear in accordance with the provisions of Section 14.3(b), undivided interests in such Partnership assets as the Liquidator deems not suitable for liquidation. Any distributions in kind shall be subject to such conditions relating to the disposition and management thereof as the 

   ##### 

  

  

Liquidator deems reasonable and equitable and to any joint ownership
agreements or other agreements governing the ownership and operation of such
properties at such time. The Liquidator shall determine the fair market value
of any property distributed in kind using such reasonable method of valuation
as it may adopt. 

   

Section 14.5 _Cancellation of Certificate of Limited Partnership_  

   

 Upon the completion of the distribution of Partnership property pursuant to Sections 14.3 and 14.4, the Partnership shall be terminated, and the Liquidator (or the Limited Partners if necessary) shall cause the cancellation of the Certificate of Limited Partnership and all qualifications of the Partnership as a foreign limited partnership in jurisdictions other than the State of Delaware and shall take such other actions as may be necessary to terminate the Partnership. 

  

Section 14.6 _Return of Capital_  

   

 The General Partner shall not be personally liable for the return of the Capital Contributions of the Limited Partners, or any portion thereof, it being expressly understood that any such return shall be made solely from Partnership assets. 

  

Section 14.7 _Waiver of Partition_  

  

 Each Partner hereby waives any rights to partition of the Partnership property. 

   

Section 14.8 _Certain Prohibited Acts_  

   

 Without obtaining Special Approval, the General Partner shall not take any action to cause the Partnership to (i) make or consent to a general assignment for the benefit of the Partnerships creditors; (ii) file or consent to the filing of any bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization petition for relief under the United States Bankruptcy Code naming the Partnership or otherwise seek, with respect to the Partnership, relief from debts or protection from creditors generally; (iii) file or consent to the filing of a petition or answer seeking for the Partnership a liquidation, dissolution, arrangement, or similar relief under any law; (iv) file an answer or other pleading admitting or failing to contest the material allegations of a petition filed against the Partnership in a proceeding of the type described in clauses (i)  (iii) of this Section 14.8; (v) seek, consent to or acquiesce in the appointment of a receiver, liquidator, conservator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator, custodian or any similar official for the Partnership or for all or any substantial portion of its properties; (vi) sell all or substantially all of its assets, except in accordance with Section 17.3; (vii) dissolve or liquidate, except in accordance with this Article XIV; or (viii) merge or consolidate.

 (c) a change to divide outstanding Units into a greater number of Units, to combine outstanding Units into a smaller number of Units or to reclassify Units in a manner that in the good faith opinion of the General Partner, does not adversely affect any class of Limited Partners in any material respect; 

  

 (d) a change that the General Partner deems appropriate or necessary to (i) satisfy any requirements, conditions or guidelines contained in any order, rule or regulation of any federal or state agency or contained in any federal or state statute or (ii) facilitate the trading of any Units or comply with any rule, regulation, requirement, condition or guideline of any National Securities Exchange on which any Units are or will be listed or admitted to trading; 

  

 (e) a change that is appropriate or necessary, as stated in an Opinion of Counsel, to prevent the Group Members and their respective directors and officers from in any manner being subjected to the provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, or "plan asset" regulations adopted under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, whether or not substantially similar to plan asset regulations currently applied or proposed by the United States Department of Labor; 

  

 (f) a change that is required or contemplated by any provision of this Agreement, including, without limitation, Sections 4.3, 12.3 and 12.5;

Section 15.2 _Other Amendments_  

   

 Amendments to this Agreement may be proposed only by the General Partner. Subject to Section 15.3, a proposed amendment (other than amendments adopted pursuant to Section 15.1) shall be effective only when approved by a Majority Interest. Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 15.1 and 15.3, no amendment of (i) the definitions of "Audit Committee," or "Special Approval," (ii) Section 7.6, (iii) Section 17.3, (iv) Section 7.9(a), (v) Section 14.8, or (vi) any other provision of this Agreement requiring that Special Approval be obtained as a condition to any action, shall be effective without first obtaining Special Approval. 

  

Section 15.3 _Amendment Requirements_  

   

 Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 15.1 and 15.2, (i) the approval of an Eighty Percent Interest shall be required for any amendment unless the Partnership has received an Opinion of Counsel that such amendment would not result in the loss of limited liability of any Limited Partner or result in the Partnership or any Operating Partnership being treated as an association taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, (ii) no provision of this Agreement which establishes a percentage of the Limited Partners required to take or approve any action shall be amended in any respect which would have the affect of reducing the voting requirement, unless such amendment is approved by at least such percentage of Limited Partners, and (iii) this Section 15.3 shall be amended only with the approval of an Eighty Percent Interest.

MEETINGS 

  

Section 16.1 _Meetings_  

   

 (a) Special meetings of Limited Partners may be called by the General Partner or by Limited Partners holding an aggregate of at least 20% of the outstanding LP Units. Within 60 days after receipt by the General Partner of a written proposal to call a meeting signed by Limited Partners holding the requisite number of LP Units and indicating the purpose for which the meeting is to be called (or such longer period as shall be reasonably required by the General Partner in order to prepare documents required therefor), the General Partner shall cause a notice of the meeting to be given to each Limited Partner. A special meeting shall be held at a time and place determined by the General Partner within 60 days after the giving of notice of the meeting. 

  

 (b) (i) An annual meeting of the Limited Partners for the election of Public Directors by the Public Limited Partners and such other matters as the Board of Directors shall submit to a vote of the Limited Partners shall be held in [ _ _] of each year, beginning in 2011, or at such other date and time as may be fixed from time to time by the General Partner at such place within or without the State of Delaware as may be fixed from time to time by the General Partner and all as stated in the notice of the meeting. Notice of the annual meeting shall be given in accordance with Section 16.2 not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days prior to the date of such meeting. 

  

 (ii) The Public Limited Partners shall vote together as a single class for the election of Public Directors. The Public Limited Partners entitled to vote shall elect by a 

      ##### 

  

    

plurality of the votes cast at such meeting (not counting abstentions) persons
to serve as Public Directors on the Board of Directors who are nominated in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 16.1(b). The exercise by a
Limited Partner of the right to elect the Public Directors and any other
rights afforded to a Limited Partner under this Section 16.1(b) shall be in
such Limited Partners capacity as a limited partner of the Partnership and
shall not cause a Limited Partner to be deemed to be taking part in the
management and control of the business and affairs of the Partnership so as
to jeopardize such Limited Partners limited liability under the Delaware
Act or the law of any other state in which the Partnership is qualified to do
business. 

   

 (iii) Each Limited Partner shall be entitled to one vote for each LP Unit that is registered in the name of such Limited Partner on the record date for such meeting. 

   

 (iv) As of the date hereof, after giving effect to the Merger and the adoption of the Holdco Partnership Agreement (and the Holdco Partnership Agreement shall also provide): 

    

 (A) on an ongoing basis, the Public Limited Partners have the right to elect all of the Directors other than the Directors appointed by Holdco GP; 

   

 (B) for so long as BGH GP Holdings, ArcLight Capital Partners, LLC and Kelso and Company and their Affiliates (directly and indirectly), collectively, own 85.0% or more of the number of LP Units owned by such Persons immediately after the Effective Time, Holdco GP shall have the right to designate two Directors; 

   

 (C) for so long as BGH GP Holdings, ArcLight Capital Partners, LLC and Kelso and Company and their Affiliates (directly and indirectly), collectively, own 42.5% or more of the number of LP Units owned by such Persons immediately after the Effective Time, but less than 85.0% of the number of LP Units owned by such Persons immediately after the Effective Time, Holdco GP shall have the right to designate one Director; 

   

 (D) upon BGH GP Holdings, ArcLight Capital Partners, LLC and Kelso and Company and their Affiliates (directly and indirectly), collectively, ceasing to own 85.0% or more of the number of LP Units owned by such Persons immediately after the Effective Time, Holdco GP shall designate one of the two Holdco GP Directors to be removed, and Holdco shall cause such Holdco GP Directors to resign or be removed from the Board of Directors; and 

   

 (E) upon BGH GP Holdings, ArcLight Capital Partners, LLC and Kelso and Company and their Affiliates (directly and indirectly), collectively, ceasing to own 42.5% or more of the number of LP Units owned by such Persons immediately after the Effective Time, Holdco shall cause any remaining Holdco GP Director(s) to resign or be removed from the Board of Directors, and thereafter the Board of Directors shall consist only of Public Directors. 

  

 (v) With respect to the election of Directors to the Board of Directors, if at any time any Person or group (as defined for purposes of Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) beneficially owns 20% or more of the outstanding LP Units, then all LP Units owned by such 

      ##### 

  

    

Person or group in excess of 20% of the outstanding LP Units shall not be
voted, and in each case, the foregoing LP Units shall not be counted when
calculating the required votes for such matter and shall not be deemed to be
outstanding for purposes of determining a quorum for such meeting (but such
LP Units shall not, however, be treated as a separate class of
Partnership Securities for purposes of this Agreement). Notwithstanding the
foregoing sentence, the Board of Directors may, by action specifically
referencing votes for the election of Directors under this Section 16.1(b),
determine that the limitation set forth in the preceding sentence shall not
apply to a specific Person or group. 

   

 (vi) The number of Directors that shall constitute the whole Board of Directors shall not be less than three and not more than nine as shall be established from time to time by a resolution adopted by a majority of the Directors. The Public Directors shall be divided into three classes, Class I, Class II, and Class III. The number of Public Directors in each class shall be the whole number contained in the quotient arrived at by dividing the authorized number of Public Directors by three, and if a fraction is also contained in such quotient, then if such fraction is one-third, the extra director shall be a member of Class I and if the fraction is two-thirds, one of the extra directors shall be a member of Class I and the other shall be a member of Class II. Each Public Director shall serve for a term ending as provided herein; provided, however, that the Public Directors designated in the General Partner Agreement to Class I shall serve for an initial term that expires at the annual meeting of Limited Partners held in 2011, the Directors designated in the General Partner Agreement to Class II shall serve for an initial term that expires at the annual meeting of Limited Partners held in 2012, and the Directors designated in the General Partner Agreement to Class III shall serve for an initial term that expires at the annual meeting of Limited Partners held in 2013. At each succeeding annual meeting of Limited Partners beginning with the annual meeting held in 2011, successors to the class of Directors whose term expires at that annual meeting shall be elected for a three-year term. 

   

 (vii) If the number of Directors is changed, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned among the classes of Public Directors so as to maintain the number of Public Directors in each class as nearly equal as possible and any additional Public Director of any class elected to fill a vacancy resulting from an increase in such class shall hold office for a term that shall coincide with the remaining term of that class, but in no case will a decrease in the number of Directors shorten the term of any incumbent Director and no decrease in the number of Holdco GP Directors shall be made except as described in Section 16.1(b)(iv). If a Holdco GP Director is removed or resigns pursuant to Section 16.1(b)(iv)(D) or (E), the number of Directors that shall constitute the whole Board of Directors shall automatically be reduced appropriately. A Public Director shall hold office until the annual meeting of the Limited Partners of the year in which his term expires and until his successor shall be elected and shall qualify, subject, however, to death, resignation or removal from office. Any vacancy among the Public Directors (including, without limitation, any vacancy caused by an increase in the number of Directors on the Board of Directors) may only be filled by a majority of the Public Directors then in office, even if less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining Public Director. Any Public Director elected to fill a vacancy not resulting from an increase in the number of Directors shall have the same remaining term as that of his predecessor. A Public Director may be removed only for cause and only upon a vote of the majority of the remaining Public Directors then in office. 

       ##### 

  

     

 (viii) (A) (1) Nominations of persons for election as Public Directors may be made at an annual meeting of the Limited Partners only (a) by or at the direction of the Public Directors or any committee thereof or (b) by any Public Limited Partner who was a Record Holder at the time the notice provided for in this Section 16.1(b)(viii) is delivered to the General Partner, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 16.1(b)(viii). 

    

 (2) For any nominations brought before an annual meeting by a Public Limited Partner pursuant to clause (b) of paragraph (A)(1) of this Section 16.1(b)(viii), the Public Limited Partner must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the General Partner. To be timely, a Public Limited Partners notice shall be delivered to the General Partner not later than the close of business on the ninetieth (90th) day, nor earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth (120th) day, prior to the first anniversary of the preceding years annual meeting (provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than thirty (30) days before or more than seventy (70) days after such anniversary date, notice by the Public Limited Partner must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth (120th) day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the Partnership or the General Partner). For purposes of the 2011 annual meeting, the first anniversary of the preceding years annual meeting shall be deemed to be [ _ _], 201[1]. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a Public Limited Partners notice as described above. Such Public Limited Partners notice shall set forth: (a) as to each person whom the Public Limited Partner proposes to nominate for election as a Public Director (i) all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to and in accordance with Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act and (ii) such persons written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a Public Director if elected; and (b) as to the Public Limited Partner giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination is made (i) the name and address of such Public Limited Partner, as they appear on the Partnerships books and records, and of such beneficial owner, (ii) the number of LP Units which are owned beneficially and of record by such Public Limited Partner and such beneficial owner, (iii) a description of any agreement, arrangement or understanding with respect to the nomination between or among such Public Limited Partner and such beneficial owner, any of their respective Affiliates or associates, and any others acting in concert with any of the foregoing, (iv) a description of any agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any derivative or short positions, profit interests, options, warrants, stock appreciation or similar rights, hedging transactions, and borrowed or loaned LP Units) that has been entered into as of the date of the Public Limited Partners notice by, or on behalf of, such Public Limited Partner and such beneficial 

   ##### 

  

    

owners, the effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss to, manage risk
or benefit of LP Unit price changes for, or increase or decrease the voting
power of, such Public Limited Partner and such beneficial owner, with respect
to LP Units, (v) a representation that the Public Limited Partner is a Record
Holder entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by
proxy at the meeting to propose such nomination, and (vi) a representation
whether the Public Limited Partner or the beneficial owner, if any, intends
or is part of a group which intends (a) to deliver a proxy statement and/or
form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the Partnerships LP
Units required to elect the nominee and/or (b) otherwise to solicit proxies
from Public Limited Partners in support of such nomination. The General
Partner may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as
it may reasonably require to determine the eligibility of such proposed
nominee to serve as a Public Director. 

   

 (3) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of paragraph (A)(2) of this Section 16.1(b)(viii) to the contrary, in the event that the number of Public Directors to be elected is increased effective at the annual meeting and there is no public announcement by the Partnership or the General Partner naming the nominees for the additional directorships at least one hundred (100) days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding years annual meeting, a Public Limited Partners notice required by this Section 16.1(b)(viii) shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for the additional directorships, if it shall be delivered to the General Partner not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the Partnership or the General Partner. 

   

 (B) Nominations of persons for election as Public Directors may be made at a special meeting of Limited Partners at which Public Directors are to be elected pursuant to the General Partners notice of meeting (1) by or at the direction of the Public Directors or any committee thereof or (2) provided that the Directors or the Limited Partners pursuant to Section 16.1(a) hereof have determined that Public Directors shall be elected at such meeting, by any Public Limited Partner who is a Record Holder at the time the notice provided for in this Section 16.1(b)(viii) is delivered to the General Partner, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and upon such election and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 16.1(b)(viii). In the event the General Partner calls a special meeting of Public Limited Partners for the purpose of electing one or more Public Directors, any Public Limited Partner entitled to vote in such election of Public Directors may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be) for election to such position(s) as specified in the General Partners notice of meeting, if the Public Limited Partners notice required by paragraph (A)(2) of this Section 16.1(b)(viii) shall be delivered to the General Partner not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth (120th) day prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such special meeting or the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Public Directors to be elected at such meeting. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or 

   ##### 

  

    

postponement of a special meeting commence a new time period (or extend any
time period) for the giving of a Public Limited Partners notice as described
above. 

   

 (C) (1) Only such persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 16.1(b)(viii) shall be eligible to be elected at an annual or special meeting of Public Limited Partners to serve as Public Directors. Except as otherwise provided by law, the chairman designated by the General Partner pursuant to Section 16.3 shall have the power and duty (a) to determine whether a nomination was made in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 16.1(b)(viii) (including whether the Public Limited Partner or beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination is made solicited (or is part of a group which solicited) or did not so solicit, as the case may be, proxies in support of such Public Limited Partners nominee in compliance with such Public Limited Partners representation as required by clause (A)(2)(b)(vi) of this Section 16.1(b)(viii)) and (b) if any proposed nomination was not made in compliance with this Section 16.1(b)(viii), to declare that such nomination shall be disregarded. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 16.1(b)(viii) unless otherwise required by law, if the Public Limited Partner (or a qualified representative of the Public Limited Partner) does not appear at the annual or special meeting of Public Limited Partners to present a nomination, such nomination shall be disregarded notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the General Partner or the Partnership. For purposes of this Section 16.1(b)(viii), to be considered a qualified representative of the Public Limited Partner, a person must be a duly authorized officer, manager or partner of such Public Limited Partner or must be authorized by a writing executed by such Public Limited Partner or an electronic transmission delivered by such Public Limited Partner to act for such Public Limited Partner as proxy at the meeting of Public Limited Partners and such person must produce such writing or electronic transmission, or a reliable reproduction of the writing or electronic transmission, at the meeting of Limited Partners. 

   

 (2) For purposes of this Section 16.1(b)(viii), "public announcement" shall include disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or other national news service or in a document publicly filed by the Partnership or the General Partner with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. 

   

 (3) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 16.1(b)(viii), a Public Limited Partner shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 16.1(b)(viii); provided however, that any references in this Agreement to the Exchange Act or the rules promulgated thereunder are not intended to and shall not limit any requirements applicable to nominations pursuant to this Section 16.1(b)(viii) (including paragraphs A(1)(c) and B hereof), and compliance with paragraphs A(1)(c) and B of this Section 16.1(b)(viii) shall be the exclusive means for a Public Limited Partner to make nominations. 

  

 (ix) This Section 16.1(b) shall not be deemed in any way to limit or impair the ability of the Board of Directors to adopt a "poison pill" or unitholder or other similar rights plan 

      #####
