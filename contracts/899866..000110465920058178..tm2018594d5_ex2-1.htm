been validly terminated in accordance with _Section 8.01_ , as promptly as
practicable after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and in no event
later than fifteen (15) Business Days after the date of this Agreement,
Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, commence (within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated by the SEC under the Exchange Act) the
Offer to purchase Shares at a price per Share equal to the Per Share Amount
to the holder of the Share in cash, without interest and subject to any
withholding Tax in accordance with _Section 2.10_ , on the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

  



  

(b)   _Terms and Conditions of the Offer_. The obligations of
Merger Sub to, and of Parent to cause Merger Sub to, irrevocably accept for

prior satisfaction or waiver of the Minimum Tender Condition, the Termination
Condition and the other conditions set forth in _Annex A_ (collectively, the
" _Offer Conditions_ "). Merger Sub expressly reserves the right (but is not
obligated to) at any time and from time to time in its sole discretion to
waive, in whole or in part, any Offer Condition or modify the terms of the
Offer (including by increasing the Per Share Amount) in each case only (and
Merger Sub shall not do so except) in a manner not inconsistent with the
terms of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , without the prior written
consent of the Company, Merger Sub shall not (i) reduce the number of Shares
subject to the Offer, (ii) reduce the Per Share Amount (except to the extent
required pursuant to _Section 2.09_ ), (iii) amend, modify, supplement or
waive the Minimum Tender Condition or the Termination Condition, (iv) add to
or amend, modify or supplement any Offer Condition, (v) directly or
indirectly amend, modify or supplement any other term of the Offer in any

materially delay the consummation of the Offer or the Merger or impair the
ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Offer, (vi) extend or
otherwise change the Offer Expiration Time (except as expressly required or
permitted by the other provisions of this _Section 2.01_ ), (vii) change the
form of consideration payable in the Offer, (viii) provide for any "subsequent
offering period" (or any extension of any thereof) within the meaning of Rule
14d-11 under the Exchange Act or (ix) take any action (or fail to take any
action) that would result in the Merger not being permitted to be effected
pursuant to Section 251(h) of the DGCL.

  



  

(c)   _Expiration and Extension of the Offer_. The expiration
date and time for the Offer, as the same may be extended from time to time,
is hereinafter referred to as the " _Offer Expiration Time_." The initial
Offer Expiration Time shall be scheduled to expire at one minute following
11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on the twentieth (20th) Business Day following
the commencement of the Offer (determined pursuant to Exchange Act Rule
14d-1(g)(3)); _provided_ that the Offer Expiration Time shall not be prior to
July 1, 2020 and if such twentieth (20th) Business Day is a date prior to July

(i)  extend the Offer for any period required by any
applicable rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or
the staff thereof or Nasdaq (including in order to comply with Exchange Act
Rule 14e-1(b) in respect of any change in the Per Share Amount) or as may be
necessary to resolve any comments of the SEC or the staff or Nasdaq, in each
case, as applicable to the Offer, the Schedule 14D-9 or the Offer Documents;
and

  



  

(ii)  if, as of any then-scheduled Offer Expiration Time, any
Offer Condition is not satisfied and has not been waived by Parent or Merger
Sub (to the extent permitted hereunder), extend the Offer (x) on one or more
occasions in consecutive increments of up to ten (10) Business Days each (or
such longer or shorter period as the parties hereto may agree) or (y) if any
then-scheduled Offer Expiration Time is ten (10) or fewer Business Days
before the End Date, until 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the day before
the End Date (or such other date and time as the parties hereto may agree);

  



  

   

18

 



    



  

 _provided_  that, without the Company's written consent, Merger Sub shall
not extend the Offer, and without Parent's prior written consent, Merger Sub
shall not be required (and Parent shall not be required to cause Merger Sub)
to extend the Offer, in each case, beyond the earlier of the End Date or the
valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.01_.

in accordance with _Section 8.01_. In the event that this Agreement is validly
terminated pursuant to _Section 8.01_ prior to any scheduled expiration of
the Offer, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, promptly
(but in any event not more than one (1) Business Day after such termination),
irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer. If the Offer is
terminated or withdrawn by Merger Sub, Merger Sub shall promptly return, and
shall cause any depository acting on behalf of Merger Sub to return, all
tendered Shares to the record holders thereof in accordance with
Applicable Law.

Offer (determined pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 14d-2), Parent and Merger Sub

Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer, which Tender
Offer Statement shall contain an offer to purchase and a related letter of

the holders of Shares, not to contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, except that no covenant is made by
Parent or Merger Sub with respect to information supplied by the Company in
writing specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Offer
Documents. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall promptly correct
any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the

SEC or dissemination of such documents to the stockholders of the Company and
Parent and Merger Sub shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to
any comments made by the Company and its counsel. Parent and Merger Sub shall

(and shall give the Company and its counsel prompt telephonic notice of any

promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer
Documents.

  



  

(g)   _Guaranteed Delivery_. For purposes of this Agreement and
the Offer, unless mutually agreed by Parent and the Company, any Shares

tendered into the Offer unless and until the Shares underlying such notices
of guaranteed delivery are "received" (as defined by Section 251(h) of the
DGCL) by Merger Sub or by an agent of Merger Sub.

  



  

(h)   _Notification of Offer Status_. Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to keep the Company reasonably informed on a
reasonably current basis of the status of the Offer, including with respect to
the number of Shares that have been validly tendered and not validly
withdrawn in accordance with the terms of the Offer, and with respect to any
material developments with respect thereto and, upon the Company's written
request, use its reasonable best efforts to provide the Company as soon
as practicable with the most recent report then available from the Depository
Agent detailing the number of Shares that have been validly tendered and not
validly withdrawn in accordance with the terms of the Offer.

as amended or supplemented from time to time and including any exhibits
thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ ") and, unless previously withdrawn in
accordance with _Section 6.02(d)_ or _Section 6.02(e)_ , shall include in the

Section 262 of the DGCL and (ii) cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be disseminated
to holders of Shares as and to the extent required by Rule 14d-9 promulgated
under the Exchange Act and any other Applicable Law, including by setting the
date of the list used to determine the Persons to whom the Offer Documents and
the Schedule 14D-9 are first disseminated as the record date for purposes of
receiving the notice required by Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL. Parent and
Merger Sub shall promptly furnish the Company with all information concerning

Schedule 14D-9, and all other information concerning Parent and Merger Sub as
reasonably requested by the Company for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9. The

stockholders of the Company and the Company shall give reasonable and good
faith consideration to any comments made by Parent and its counsel. The

Company shall instruct its transfer agent to furnish Merger Sub (x) promptly
after the date of this Agreement and (y) from time to time thereafter as
requested by Parent, with a list of its stockholders and mailing labels
containing the names and addresses of the record holders of Shares as of the
most recent practicable date and of those persons becoming record holders
subsequent to such date, together with copies of all lists of stockholders,
security position listings and computer files and all other information in
the Company's possession regarding the beneficial owners of the Shares, and

Parent may reasonably request in communicating the Offer to the holders of
Shares. Subject to Applicable Law, and except for such steps as are necessary
to communicate the Offer to the holders of Shares, Parent and Merger Sub and
their Representatives shall (i) hold in confidence such lists, files and
information and will use such information only in connection with the Offer
and the Merger and (ii) if this Agreement is terminated, promptly either
deliver to the Company or destroy, and shall cause their Representatives to

Subsidiary of Parent, and the separate corporate existence of the Company,
with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises, shall
continue unaffected by the Merger. Without limiting the generality of the

set forth in _Article 7_ (other than those conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
waiver (to the extent permitted hereunder and by Applicable Law) of such

(a)  except as otherwise provided in _Section 2.05(b)_ , _Section
2.05(c)_ , _Section 2.05(d)_ , or _Section 2.07_ , each Share issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than Shares
irrevocably accepted for purchase in the Offer shall (i) be converted
automatically into the right to receive the Per Share Amount in cash, without
interest and subject to any withholding Tax in accordance with _Section 2.10_
(the " _Merger Consideration_ ") and (ii) upon conversion thereof in
accordance with this _Section 2.05(a)_ , cease to be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and cease to exist and each holder of a Certificate

Consideration with respect thereto in accordance with _Section 2.06_ or
_Section 2.08(i)_ , as applicable;

  



  

(b)  each Share owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or

the Effective Time (other than Shares irrevocably accepted for purchase by
Merger Sub in connection with the Offer) shall be canceled and cease to
exist, and no consideration shall be paid or delivered in exchange therefor
and each holder of a Certificate representing any such Shares shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto;

  



  

(c)  each Share held in the Company's treasury immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be canceled and cease to exist, and no consideration
shall be paid or delivered in exchange therefor and each holder of a
Certificate representing any such Shares shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto;

  



  

(d)  each Share owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into such number of Shares of the Surviving Corporation such that
each such Subsidiary of the Company shall own the same percentage of the
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation immediately
following the Effective Time as such Subsidiary of the Company owned
immediately prior to the Effective Time; and

  



  

(e)  each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into one fully paid, nonassessable share of common stock,

Corporation as of immediately following the Effective Time.

  



  

   

23

 



    



  

Section 2.06. _Surrender and Payment_.

  



  

(a)   _Depository Agent, Paying Agent and Payment Fund_. Prior to
the expiration of the Offer, Parent shall appoint a paying agent reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the " _Depository Agent_ ") for the
holders of Shares to receive the aggregate Per Share Amount to which holders
of such Shares shall become entitled pursuant to _Section 2.01(d)_  and to
act as agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the holders of Shares to receive the
aggregate Merger Consideration to which holders of such Shares shall become
entitled pursuant to _Section 2.05(a)_. Promptly after the expiration of
the Offer, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, (i) with the
Depository Agent an amount of cash sufficient to make the payment of the
aggregate Per Share Amount payable pursuant to _Section 2.01(d)_ and (ii) with
the Paying Agent an amount of cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration payable pursuant to _Section 2.05_ (together with the
amount deposited pursuant to clause (i), the " _Payment Fund_ "). To the
extent such fund diminishes for any reason below the level required to make
prompt payment of any outstanding Per Share Amounts to be paid in exchange for
Shares accepted for payment pursuant to _Section 2.01(d)_ or any outstanding
Merger Consideration to be paid in exchange for Shares converted in the
Merger pursuant to _Section 2.05(a)_ , Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall promptly replace or restore the lost portion of such fund so as to
ensure that it is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make such
payments. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than to
pay the aggregate Per Share Amount in the Offer and the Merger Consideration
in the Merger. The Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as
directed by the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ that such investments shall
be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America in
commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors
Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporation, respectively, in certificates
of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker's acceptances of commercial
banks with capital exceeding $1 billion, or in money market funds having a
rating in the highest investment category granted by a recognized credit
rating agency at the time of acquisition or a combination of the foregoing
and, in any such case, no such instrument shall have a maturity exceeding
three (3) months. Promptly after the Effective Time and in any event no later
than five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time, Parent shall send,
or shall cause the Paying Agent to send, to each record holder of Shares at
the Effective Time, in each case whose Shares were converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.05(a)_ , a letter
of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that delivery of the
Shares shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon
proper delivery or transfer of the certificate representing the Shares (the "
_Certificates_ "; _provided_ , _however_ , that any references herein to
"Certificates" are deemed to include references to effective affidavits of
loss in accordance with _Section 2.12_ or to book-entry account statements
relating to the ownership of Shares, as applicable) to the Paying Agent and
shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably
specify (after due consultation with the Company) prior to the consummation
of the Offer) for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates in exchange
for payment of the Per Share Amount for each Share.

  



  

   

24

 



    



  

(b)   _Surrender of Shares_. Each holder of Shares that have been
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of the Shares
represented by a Certificate promptly upon (i) surrender to the Paying Agent
of the Certificate ( _provided_ , _however_ , that delivery of a book-entry
statement shall not be required in respect of any uncertificated Shares held
of record in book-entry), together with a duly completed and validly executed
letter of transmittal and such other documents as may reasonably be requested
by the Paying Agent, or (ii) receipt of an "agent's message" by the Paying
Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may
reasonably request) in the case of the exchange of book-entry Shares. Until
so surrendered or transferred, each such Certificate shall represent
after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive such
Merger Consideration. No interest shall be paid or accrued on the cash
payable upon the surrender or transfer of such Certificate.

  



  

(c)   _Unregistered Transferees_. If any portion of the aggregate
Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of any Certificate is to be paid
to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is
registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) either such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form
for transfer and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall either pay to
the Paying Agent any transfer or other similar Tax required as a result of
such payment being made to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or otherwise establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent
that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

  



  

(d)   _No Other Rights_. The Merger Consideration paid upon the
surrender of Certificates or book-entry Shares in accordance with the terms
hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate or book-
entry Share, and, from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall not permit any further registration of transfers of Shares on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation. If, after the Effective Time,
any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the
Paying Agent for transfer, the holder of such Certificates shall be given a
copy of a letter of transmittal and instructed to comply with the instructions
therein in order to receive the Merger Consideration to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to the Merger. From and after the Effective Time, the
holders of the Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares except to receive,
upon surrender of a Certificate or book-entry Share pursuant to and in
accordance with this _Section 2.06_ , the Merger Consideration in respect of
each Share represented thereby, except as otherwise provided herein or by
Applicable Law.

  



  

(e)   _Termination of the Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment
Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of Shares at any time following
the date that is twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged
Shares for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this _Section 2.06_
prior to that time shall, subject to abandoned property, escheat or other
Applicable Laws, thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject
to _Section 2.11_ ) as general creditors thereof for payment of the Merger
Consideration.

  



  

   

25

 



    



  

Section 2.07. _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding _Section 2.06_ or
any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Shares issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded
Shares) and held by a holder who is entitled to demand appraisal and who has
properly demanded appraisal of such Shares in accordance with Section 262 of
the DGCL and, as of the Effective Time, has neither effectively withdrawn nor
lost such holder's right to appraisal pursuant to the DGCL with respect to
such Shares (any such Shares, " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted
into a right to receive the Merger Consideration but instead shall be
entitled only to such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, if, after the Effective Time, such holder
fails to perfect, withdraws, waives or otherwise loses such holder's right to
appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or if a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief
provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, then the right of such holder to be paid
the fair value of such Dissenting Shares shall cease and such holder's Shares
shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.05(a)_ ,
without interest thereon and less any amounts entitled to be deducted or
withheld pursuant to _Section 2.10_ , upon surrender of such Certificate
formerly representing such Shares. The Company shall provide Parent with
prompt written notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of
any Shares, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice or
instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL that relates to such demand, and Parent shall have the
opportunity and right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to such demands. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, or if
required by Applicable Law, the Company shall not make any payment with
respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands.

  



  

Section 2.08. _Company Stock Options; Company RSUs; Company PSUs;
Company ESPP_. 

  



  

(a) _Company Vested In-The-Money Stock Options_. Each Company In-
The-Money Stock Option that is vested and outstanding as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time (" _Vested In-The-Money Option_ ") shall be canceled
immediately prior to, and contingent upon, the Effective Time, and each
holder thereof shall be entitled to receive in consideration for such
cancelation an amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the number of
Shares that are subject to such Vested In-The-Money Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time and (B) the excess of the Merger Consideration
over the exercise price per Share subject to such Vested In-The-Money Option,
which amount shall be payable to such holder at or as soon as reasonably
practicable following the Effective Time.

  



  

(b)   _Company Accelerated In-The-Money Stock Options_. Each
Company In-The-Money Stock Option held by a Qualified Holder that is unvested
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become fully
vested immediately prior to, and contingent upon, the Effective Time ("
_Accelerated In-The-Money Option_ "); provided, however, that in the case of
Company In-The-Money Stock Options subject to performance-based vesting
conditions (" _Performance In-The-Money Options_ "), such Performance In-The-
Money Options will vest assuming performance is achieved at target (it being
understood that target is two-thirds (2/3) of the number of Shares subject to
the award). All Accelerated In-The-Money Options shall be canceled as of
immediately prior to, and contingent upon, the Effective Time, and each
Qualified Holder thereof shall be entitled to receive in consideration for
such cancelation an amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the number of
Shares that are subject to such Accelerated In-The-Money Options immediately
prior to the Effective Time and (B) the excess of the Merger Consideration
over the exercise price per Share subject to such Accelerated In-The-Money
Options, which amounts shall be payable to such Qualified Holder at or as soon
as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time. For the avoidance of
doubt, the remaining 1/3 of each Performance In-The-Money Option shall be
forfeited for no consideration and shall cease to be outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

In-The-Money Stock Option held by a holder who is not a Qualified Holder ("
_Non-Qualified Holder_ ") that is unvested and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (" _Rollover In-The-Money Stock Option_ ") shall be
converted at the Effective Time into an option to acquire, on substantially
the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Rollover In-The-
Money Stock Option (but excluding any performance conditions), the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share),
determined by multiplying the number of Shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Rollover In-The-Money Stock Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time (in the case of Rollover In-The-Money Stock Options subject to
performance-based vesting conditions, assuming performance achieved at target
(it being understood that target is two-thirds (2/3) of the number of Shares
of Company Common Stock subject to the award)) by the Exchange Ratio, at an
exercise price per Share of Parent Common Stock (rounded up to the
nearest whole cent) equal to (A) the exercise price per Share of Company
Common Stock applicable to such Rollover In-The-Money Stock Option divided by
(B) the Exchange Ratio.

  



  

(d)   _Company Underwater Stock Options_. Each Company Underwater
Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether
vested or unvested, shall become fully vested and shall be canceled and
terminated without any cash payment being made in respect thereof as of
immediately prior to, and contingent upon, the Effective Time.

  



  

(e)   _Company Cash-Out RSUs_. Each Company Cash-Out RSU
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become fully vested
and shall be canceled as of immediately prior to, and contingent upon, the
Effective Time in exchange for the right to receive a lump-sum cash payment
in an amount equal to the product of (x) the number of Shares deliverable
under such Company Cash-Out RSU multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration.

  



  

(f)   _Company Rollover RSUs_. Each Company Rollover RSU
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into a
restricted stock unit, subject to substantially the same terms and conditions
as were applicable under such Company Rollover RSU, with respect to the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock determined by multiplying the total
number of Shares deliverable under such Company Rollover RSU as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio (rounded to the
nearest whole share).

  



  

(g)   _Company PSUs_. Each Company PSU outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into a restricted stock unit,
subject to substantially the same terms and conditions as were applicable
under such Company PSU (including the applicable vesting requirements but
excluding the performance conditions), with respect to the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock determined by multiplying the total number of Company
PSUs as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (assuming performance
achieved at target (it being understood that target is two-thirds (2/3) of
the number of Shares of Company Common Stock subject to the award)) by (y)
the Exchange Ratio (rounded to the nearest whole share), and shall vest as set
forth in _Section 2.08(g)_ of the Disclosure Letter. For the avoidance of
doubt, the remaining 1/3 portion of each Company PSU award shall be forfeited

each participant under the Company ESPP as of immediately prior to the Offer
Expiration Time shall, to the extent not used to purchase Shares in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Company ESPP (as amended

the Company Board and the Compensation Committee of the Company Board, as
applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions that are

28

 



    



  

(l) To the extent a payment pursuant in this _Section 2.08_ would
trigger a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code, such payment shall
be made on the earliest date that payment would not trigger such Tax or
penalty.

  



  

Section 2.09. _Adjustments_. If, during the period between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company shall occur, including by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, consolidation, stock split

respect of any cash from the Payment Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to and in accordance with any applicable abandoned property, escheat

immediately prior to such date on which any amounts payable pursuant to this
_Article 2_ would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any

corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the
Applicable Law of the State of Delaware. The Company is duly licensed and

Date. The Company has full power and authority required (i) to carry on its
business as currently conducted and (ii) to own, lease and operate the assets
and properties that it purports to own, lease and operate, except, in each
case, where any failure thereof (A) has not had, and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect or (B) would reasonably be expected to prevent, materially
impede or materially delay the consummation of the Transactions on a timely
basis and in any event on or before the End Date.

  



  

Section 4.02. _Organizational Documents_. The Organizational Documents
that are incorporated by reference as exhibits to the Company's Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 are true, correct
and complete copies of the Organizational Documents of the Company as of the
date of this Agreement, and contain and reflect any and all amendments
thereto, and (i) the Organizational Documents of the Company are in full
force and effect and (ii) the Company is not in violation of any provision of
such Organizational Documents.

  



  

Section 4.03. _Corporate Authorization_. 

  



  

(a)   _Authority; Enforceability_. (i) The Company has all
requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and,
assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of Parent and
Merger Sub set forth in _Section 5.10_ , to consummate the Transactions on
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein and (ii) the

the Transactions have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action
on the part of the Company subject, in the case of the Merger, to the filing
with the Delaware Secretary of the Certificate of Merger as required by the
DGCL. The Company has duly executed and delivered this Agreement and, assuming
due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub, this
Agreement constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Company
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms without
requiring any further corporate proceedings on the part of the
Company, except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other similar
laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights, and
by general principles of equity (the  " _Bankruptcy and Equity Exceptions_
").

  



  

   

31

 



    



   



  

(b)   _Company Board Approval and Company Board Recommendation_. The
Company Board, at a meeting thereof duly called and held, duly and
unanimously adopted resolutions (which, as of the execution and delivery of
this Agreement by the parties hereto, have not been rescinded, modified or
withdrawn in any way) (i) determining that this Agreement and the
Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, are advisable, fair to, and
in the best interests of, the Company and the Company's stockholders, (ii)

apply to the Company with respect to or as a result of this Agreement or the
Transactions. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of
Parent and Merger Sub set forth in _Section 5.10_ , and the Merger is effected
under Section 251(h) of the DGCL, no vote of the holders of Shares or any
other equity interests of the Company will be required to adopt this Agreement
or to approve and consummate the Transactions. Assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in 
_Section 5.10_ , the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
voting power of the Shares, voting together as a class, is the only vote of
the holders of any class or series of the Company's capital stock that, absent
251(h) of the DGCL, that would have been necessary under applicable Law and
the Organizational Documents of the Company to adopt this Agreement
and consummate the Merger.

Company of the Transactions require no action by or in respect of, consent,

Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to, any Third Party in connection
with, or for the purpose of encouraging or facilitating, or otherwise
knowingly cooperate in any way with any Third Party (or any Representative
thereof) with respect to, a Takeover Proposal, (iii) publicly recommend or
enter into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement or (iv) approve, authorize,
agree or publicly announce an intention to do any of the foregoing. Promptly
following the execution of this Agreement, and in any event within one (1)
Business Day of the date of this Agreement, the Acquired Companies shall, and
shall direct their respective Representatives to, (A) cease and cause to be
terminated any solicitation and any and all existing discussions or
negotiations with any Person (other than Parent and its Representatives)
conducted heretofore with respect to any Takeover Proposal, (B) request that
each Person and its Representatives (other than Parent and its
Representatives) that has, prior to the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, executed a confidentiality agreement or otherwise received non-
public information about the Company from, or on behalf of, the Company, in
each case, in connection with such Person's consideration of a Takeover
Transaction, to promptly return or destroy all non-public information
furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary prior to the date of this Agreement and (C) terminate access by
any Third Party to any physical or electronic data room relating to any
potential Takeover Transaction. The Company shall not modify, amend or
terminate, or waive, release or assign, any provisions of, any
confidentiality or standstill agreement (or any similar agreement) to which
the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party relating to any
Takeover Proposal and shall enforce the provisions of any such agreement;
_provided_ that the Company shall be permitted on a confidential basis to
release or waive any explicit or implicit standstill obligations solely to the
extent necessary to permit the party referred therein to submit a Takeover
Proposal to the Company Board on a confidential basis and solely to the extent
failure to grant such release or waiver would reasonably be expected to
constitute a breach of the Company Board's fiduciary duties under
Applicable Law. The Company shall provide written notice to Parent of waiver
or release of any standstill by the Company within twenty-four (24) hours of
such waiver or release, including disclosure of the identities of the parties
thereto and circumstances relating thereto. The Company agrees that it shall
promptly inform its Representatives of the obligations undertaken in this
_Section 6.02_. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is
understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this _Section
6.02(a)_ by any Representative of the Company shall be deemed to constitute a
breach of this _Section 6.02(a)_  by the Company.

  



  

(b)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, if prior to the consummation of the Offer, the Company receives a
_bona fide_ written Takeover Proposal (which Takeover Proposal was made after
the date of this Agreement and did not result from a breach in a material
respect of _Section 6.02(a)_ ), and the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial advisor
of national reputation, that such Takeover Proposal constitutes, or would
reasonably be expected to result in, a Superior Proposal, then the Company and
its Representatives may, in each case subject to compliance with _Section
6.02(f)_ : (i) furnish any information with respect to the Acquired Companies
and provide access thereto to any Third Party making such Takeover Proposal
(and its Representatives and financing sources); _provided_ that (A) prior to
furnishing any such information, the Company receives from such Third Party an
executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and (B) any such non-public
information so furnished has been previously provided or Made Available to
Parent or is concurrently provided (including through the Data Rooms) to
Parent; and (ii) participate or engage in negotiations or discussions
with, and only with, the Third Party making such Takeover Proposal and its
Representatives and financing sources regarding such Takeover Proposal.

  



  

   

72

 



    



  

(c)  Except as set forth in this _Section 6.02_ (including
_Section 6.02(d)_ , ( _e_ ) and ( _g_ )), neither the Company Board nor any
committee thereof shall (or resolve or agree to) (i) (A) withhold or withdraw
(or modify, amend or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), or
propose publicly to withhold or withdraw (or modify, amend or qualify in a
manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), the Company Board Recommendation,
(B) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose publicly to approve,
recommend or declare advisable, any Takeover Proposal, (C) fail to include the
Company Board Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9 when disseminated to the
Company's stockholders or (D) if any Takeover Proposal has been made public,
fail to reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation upon request of Parent
within ten (10) Business Days after Parent requests such reaffirmation (
_provided_ _,_ _however_ _,_ that Parent may make such request only once with
respect to each such Takeover Proposal unless such Takeover Proposal is
subsequently publicly modified in any material respect in which case Parent
may make such request once each time such modification is made) (any action
described in this clause (i) being referred to as an "
_Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) approve, recommend, declare
advisable or cause or permit the Company to enter into any Contract, letter
of intent, acquisition agreement, agreement in principle, memorandum of
understanding, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
agreement or other agreement constituting or with respect to any Takeover
Proposal, other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (an "
_Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ").

  



  

(d)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, at any time prior to the consummation of the Offer, the Company
Board may make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening
Event if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of national reputation, that
the failure to do so would no longer reasonably be expected to constitute a
breach of the Company Board's fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, only if
all of the following conditions are satisfied:

  



  

(i)  the Company shall have first provided Parent prior
written notice (the " _Intervening Event Notice_ ") at least four (4)
Business Days in advance (as modified, extended or continued by this _Section
6.02(d)_ , the " _Intervening Event Notice Period_ ") advising Parent that
the Company intends to make an Adverse Recommendation Change and
specifying, in reasonable detail, the Intervening Event;

  



  

(ii)  during the applicable Intervening Event Notice Period (or
any extension or continuation thereof), the Company and its
Representatives shall have, to the extent requested by Parent, negotiated in
good faith with Parent and its officers, directors and other
Representatives regarding any changes to the terms of this Agreement and any
other proposals made by Parent so that a failure to effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change in response to such Intervening Event would
reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of the Company Board's
fiduciary duties under Applicable Law;

  



  

   

73

 



    



  

(iii)  Parent shall not have made changes to the terms of this
Agreement or any other proposals, during the applicable Intervening Event
Notice Period, that in the reasonable good faith judgment of the Company Board
(after consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of
national reputation), would cause the failure to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to such Intervening Event to no longer
reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of the Company Board's fiduciary
duties under Applicable Law (it being understood and agreed that any material
change in any event, occurrence or facts relating to such Intervening Event
(other than in respect of any revisions proposed or proposals made by Parent
as referred to above) shall require a new Intervening Event Notice with a new
Intervening Event Notice Period of three (3) Business Days); and

  



  

(iv)  following the Intervening Event Notice Period, the Company
Board shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of national reputation) that the
failure to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to such
Intervening Event would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of the
Company Board's fiduciary duties under Applicable Law.

  



  

(e)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, at any time prior to the consummation of the Offer if, in response
to a _bona fide_ written Takeover Proposal made by a Third Party after the
date of this Agreement which did not arise from a breach in a material
respect of _Section 6.02(a)_ and has not been withdrawn, the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and a financial advisor of national reputation) that (1) such Takeover
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (2) the failure to take an action
set forth in clause (x) or (y) would reasonably be expected to constitute a
breach of the Company Board's fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, then (x)
the Company Board may make an Adverse Recommendation Change or (y) the
Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(d)(i)_  in
order to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal, _only if_ , in either such case, all of the following
conditions are satisfied:

  



  

(i)  the Company shall have first provided to Parent prior
written notice (the " _Superior Proposal Notice_ ") at least four (4)
Business Days in advance (as modified, extended or continued by this _Section
6.02(e)_ , the " _Superior Proposal Notice Period_ ") advising Parent that
the Company Board is prepared to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change in
response to a Superior Proposal, or to terminate this Agreement in accordance
with _Section 8.01(d)_ , as applicable (and specifying, in reasonable detail,
the material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal, including the
identity of the Third Party making any such Superior Proposal) and shall have
complied with the Company's obligations under _Section 6.02(f)_ ;

  



  

(ii)  during the applicable Superior Proposal Notice Period,
prior to its effecting an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating this
Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.01(d)_ , the Company and its
Representatives, to the extent requested by Parent, shall negotiate in good
faith with Parent and its officers, directors and other Representatives
regarding changes to the terms of this Agreement and any other proposals made
by Parent intended by Parent to cause such Takeover Proposal to no longer
constitute a Superior Proposal;

  



  

   

74

 



    



  

(iii)  Parent shall not have made, within the applicable Superior
Proposal Notice Period, a proposal that would, in the reasonable good faith
judgment of the Company Board (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and a financial advisor of national reputation), cause the offer
previously constituting a Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior
Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any material amendment or
material modification of such Takeover Proposal shall require a new
Superior Proposal Notice with a new Superior Proposal Notice Period of three
(3) Business Days);

  



  

(iv)  following the Superior Proposal Notice Period, the Company
Board shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of national reputation) that, in
light of such Superior Proposal and taking into account any revised terms
proposed by Parent, (x) such Takeover Proposal continues to constitute a
Superior Proposal, and (y) the failure to make the Adverse Recommendation
Change, or to terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.01(d)_
, as applicable, would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of the
Company Board's fiduciary duties under Applicable Law.

  



  

(f)  In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in
paragraphs _(a)_ , _(b)_ , _(c)_ , _(d)_ and  _(e)_ of this _Section 6.02_ ,
the Company shall, as promptly as practicable and in any event within twenty-
four (24) hours following the receipt or delivery thereof, (i) notify Parent
orally and in writing of (x) the receipt of any Takeover Proposal or any
request for information or inquiry that contemplates or that could reasonably
be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal, (y) to the extent not set forth
in writings or media provided pursuant to clause (ii) below, the terms and
conditions of such Takeover Proposal, request or inquiry (including any
subsequent or other modification to such terms and conditions) and (z) the
identity of the Person making any such Takeover Proposal, request or inquiry
and (ii) provide Parent (or its outside legal counsel) with unredacted copies
of all writings or media (whether or not electronic) containing any terms or
conditions of any proposals or proposed transaction agreements (including any
drafts thereof and all schedules and exhibits thereto) relating to any
Takeover Proposal. Commencing upon the provision of any notice referred to
above, the Company (or its outside counsel) shall (A) keep Parent (or
its outside counsel) reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis
regarding the status and terms of discussions and negotiations relating to
any such Takeover Proposal, request or inquiry and (B) provide to Parent as
promptly as practicable and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours
following receipt or delivery thereof unredacted copies of all correspondence
and other writings or media (whether or not electronic) exchanged between the
Company and any Person containing any of the terms or conditions of any
Takeover Proposal, including any proposed transaction agreements (and any
drafts thereof and all schedules and exhibits thereto).

  



  

(g)  Nothing contained in this Agreement, including any
provision of this _Section 6.02_ , shall prohibit the Company or the Company
Board, directly or indirectly, through their respective Representatives, from
(i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company any position
contemplated by Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act, (ii) making a "stop-look-and-listen"
communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act or (iii) making
any disclosure to the stockholders of the Company that the Company Board has
determined in its good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel) is required by Applicable Law; provided that _this Section 6.02(g)_
shall not be deemed to permit the Company Board to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change except to the extent permitted by _Section 6.02(d)_ -(
_e_ ).

  



  

   

75

 



    



  

Section 6.03. _Approval of Merger_. The Merger shall be governed by
Section 251(h) of the DGCL and shall be effected by Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company as soon as practicable following the consummation of the Offer,
without a vote of the stockholders of the Company, pursuant to Section 251(h)
of the DGCL.

  



  

Section 6.04. _Access to Information_.

  



  

(a)  Upon reasonable notice to the Company, the Acquired
Companies shall, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause
their Representatives to, afford Parent's and Merger Sub's officers and
Parent's and Merger Sub's other authorized Representatives reasonable access
as reasonably requested by Parent, during normal business hours throughout the
Pre-Closing Period, to their respective Representatives, properties, assets,
facilities, books, Contracts, Permits, records (including Tax
Returns), reports, correspondence and any other documents and information of
the Acquired Companies (whether in physical or electronic form),  _provided_
, that, in each case, such access may be limited to the extent the Company
reasonably determines, in light of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic
(taking into account any "shelter-in-place" or similar order issued by a
Governmental Authority), that such access would jeopardize the health and
safety of any Acquired Company's employee; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow for such access or as
much of such access as is possible in a manner that does not jeopardize the
health and safety of such employees. In addition, the Acquired Companies
shall, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause their Representatives
to, furnish Parent and Merger Sub all financial, operating and other data and
information, in each case, as Parent and Merger Sub through their officers,
employees or other Representatives, may reasonably request. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Acquired Companies shall not be required to disclose any
information to Parent to the extent the Company reasonably determines such
disclosure (i) would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege, (ii) would
reasonably be expected to result in a loss of Trade Secret protection or (iii)
would contravene any Applicable Law; _provided_  that the Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts (A) to allow for such access or disclosure in a
manner that does not result in a loss of attorney-client privilege or (B) to
develop an alternative to providing such information so as to address such
matters that is reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company. With respect
to all information provided to Parent or any of its Representatives by the
Company or any of its Representatives in connection with this Agreement and
the consummation of the Transactions (including any information disclosed
pursuant to this _Section 6.04_ ) Parent agrees that all information provided
to it or any of its Representatives in connection with this Agreement and the
consummation of the Transactions shall be deemed to be Confidential
Information (as such term is used in the Confidentiality Agreement) and shall
be treated in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

  



  

(b)  No information or knowledge obtained by Parent or Merger
Sub pursuant to _Section 6.02_ or this _Section 6.04_  or otherwise shall
affect or be deemed to affect or modify any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement contained in this Agreement, the conditions to the obligations
of the parties to consummate the Transactions, including the Merger, in
accordance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement or otherwise
prejudice in any way the rights and remedies of Parent or Merger
Sub hereunder, nor shall any such information, knowledge or investigation be
deemed to affect or modify Parent's or Merger Sub's reliance on the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements made by the Company in
this Agreement.

  



  

   

76

 



    



  

(c)  Subject to Applicable Law and _Section 6.04(a)_ , the
Company and Parent shall, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause
their respective officers, directors, employees, and other Representatives to
cooperate to ensure an orderly transition and integration process in
connection with the Transactions in order to minimize the disruption to, and
preserve the value of, the business of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries.

  



  

Section 6.05. _Employee Benefit Plan Matters_.

  



  

(a)  From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall honor, and
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor all Company Employee Plans in
effect immediately before the Effective Time that by their terms provide a
contractual entitlement to any employee or service provider party to or
participating in such arrangements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
herein, other than _Section 6.05(b)_ and _Section 6.05(d)_ and the terms of
such arrangements, including the contractual rights of such
participants, shall prevent Parent from amending or terminating any Company
Employee Plan or providing compensation or benefits in its discretion.

  



  

(b)  For a period of one (1) year following the Effective Time,
Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each Continuing
Employee who remains employed, base salary (or base wages, as the case may be)
and short-term cash incentive compensation opportunities, each of which is no
less favorable than that in effect for such Continuing Employee as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Until December 31, 2020, Parent
shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each Continuing Employee who
remains employed, welfare benefits (other than severance benefits) that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to, at Parent's election in its
sole discretion, the welfare benefits provided to such Continuing Employees
immediately prior to the Effective Time or the welfare benefits provided to
similarly situated employees of Parent. Nothing herein shall require Parent to
continue the employment of any Continuing Employee for any period of time
following the Closing.

  



  

(c)  In the event that the Closing occurs prior to the Company
paying annual cash incentives in respect of 2020, the Company shall pay to
each participant in an annual bonus plan or program of the Company who is
terminated by Parent or one of its Affiliates without cause following the
Closing but prior to the payment date a bonus in respect of 2020 equal to such
participant's target annual bonus, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of days between January 1, 2020 and the date on which the
termination occurs (or, if earlier, December 31, 2020), and the denominator of
which is 365, subject to such participant's execution of an effective release
of claims, payable either, in Parent's discretion, at the same time as all
such other annual bonuses or following the effective date of the release of
claims. For the avoidance of doubt, any bonuses paid pursuant to this Section
6.05(c) shall not be paid to the extent a bonus payment is already payable to
a participant with respect to the same period of time pursuant to any
severance agreements, arrangements, policies or otherwise entered into with
the Company or Parent.

  



  

   

77

 



    



  

(d)  Prior to the Effective Time, unless otherwise directed by
Parent in writing not less than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law and the terms of the
applicable plan or arrangement, the Company shall cause the Company 401(k)
Plan (the " _Company 401(k) Plan_ ") to be terminated effective immediately
prior to the Effective Time. The Company shall provide Parent with evidence
that the Company 401(k) Plan has been terminated (the form and substance of
which shall be subject to review and approval by Parent) not later than the
day immediately preceding the Effective Time. Prior to the termination of the
Company 401(k) Plan, each participant in the Company 401(k) Plan who has not
yet been credited with the full five percent (5%) Company matching
contribution for the plan year will be credited with a "true-up"
contribution, such that after the making of such contribution, the
participant will have received an amount equal to the full matching
contribution. Commencing on the 120th day following the Effective Time,
Parent shall permit the "rollover" of amounts held in Company 401(k) Plan
accounts, as well as any notes evidencing loans under the Company 401(k) Plan,
into a tax-qualified 401(k) plan maintained by Parent.

  



  

(e)  From and after the Closing Date, with respect to Continuing
Employees, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the service
of each such Continuing Employee with the Acquired Companies prior to the
Closing Date to be recognized for purposes of eligibility to participate,
levels of benefits (but not for benefit accruals or participation eligibility
under any defined benefit pension plan or plan providing post-retirement
medical benefits, subsidized early retirement benefits, or any other
similar benefits) and vesting under each compensation, vacation, fringe or
other welfare benefit plan, program or arrangement of the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates (collectively, the " _Parent
Benefit Plans_ ") in which any Continuing Employee is or becomes eligible to
participate, but solely to the extent that service was credited to such
employee for such purposes under a comparable Company Employee Plan
immediately prior to the Closing Date and to the extent that such credit would
not result in a duplication of benefits. From and after the Closing Date,
with respect to Continuing Employees, Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause any deductible, co-insurance and covered out-of-pocket
expenses paid on or before the Closing Date by any Continuing Employee (or
eligible dependent thereof) to be taken into account for purposes of
satisfying the corresponding deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-
pocket provisions from and after the Closing Date under any applicable Parent
Benefit Plan in the same plan year in which the Closing Date occurs.

  



  

(f)  From and after the Closing Date, with respect to each
Parent Benefit Plan that is an "employee welfare benefit plan" as defined in
Section 3(1) of ERISA in which any Continuing Employee is or becomes eligible
to participate, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each
such Parent Benefit Plan to waive all limitations as to pre-existing
conditions, waiting periods, required physical examinations and exclusions
with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable under such
Parent Benefit Plan for such Continuing Employees and their eligible
dependents to the same extent that such pre-existing conditions, waiting
periods, required physical examinations and exclusions would not have applied
or would have been waived under the corresponding Company Employee Plan in
which such Continuing Employee was a participant immediately prior to his
commencement of participation in such Parent Benefit Plan.

  



  

   

78

 



    



  

(g)  Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation
acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this _Section 6.05_
are included for the sole benefit of the respective parties to this Agreement
and shall not create any right in any other Person, including any Company
Employee, any participant in any Company Employee Plan or Parent Benefit Plan
or any beneficiary thereof or any right to continued employment with Parent,
Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates. Nothing in
this _Section 6.05_ shall be deemed to amend any Company Employee Plan, any
Parent Benefit Plan or to require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their Affiliates to permit any Person to participate in any particular benefit
plan sponsored or maintained by Parent or any of its Affiliates, or to
continue or amend any particular benefit plan, before or after the
consummation of the Transactions, and any such plan may be amended or
terminated in accordance with its terms and Applicable Law.

  



  

Section 6.06. _State Takeover Laws_. If any "control share
acquisition," "business combination," "fair price," "moratorium" or other
anti-takeover Applicable Law may become or is deemed or purports to be
applicable to any Transaction, then the Company and the Company Board shall
take all such actions as are reasonably necessary to ensure that the
Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and otherwise act to render such anti-takeover Applicable
Law (or, in the case of Section 203 of the DGCL, the restrictions on business
combinations provided therein) inapplicable to, or to minimize the effects of
the foregoing on, the Transactions.

  



  

Section 6.07. _Obligations of Parent_. Parent shall cause Merger Sub to
perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the
Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, on the terms and conditions
set forth in this Agreement. Parent, in its capacity as the sole
stockholder of Merger Sub, shall approve and adopt this Agreement by written
consent immediately following its execution.

  



  

Section 6.08. _Director and Officer Liability_.

  



  

(a)  Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the
current or former directors, officers or employees of the Acquired Companies
(collectively, " _Indemnified Persons_ ") as provided in their respective
certificates of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational
documents) and any indemnification or other agreements of the Company as in
effect on the date of this Agreement and set forth in _Section 6.08_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter, or pursuant to any such Contract entered into
after the execution of this Agreement with Parent's prior written consent,
shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further
action, at the Effective Time, and shall survive the Merger, shall be observed
by the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to the fullest extent
available under Applicable Laws for a period of six (6) years from the
Effective Time (and any claim made pursuant to such rights within such six
(6)-year period shall continue to be subject to this _Section 6.08(a)_ and
the rights provided under this _Section 6.08(a)_ until disposition of such
claim) and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms (and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of such Indemnified
Persons), and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to comply with and
honor the foregoing obligations.

  



  

   

79

 



    



  

(b)  Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to purchase (through a nationally recognized insurance broker
approved by Parent (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed)) a "tail" insurance policy with a claims period of six (6) years
from the Effective Time with respect to directors' and officers'
liability insurance for the benefit of the Indemnified Persons who are
currently covered by such existing policy with respect to their acts and
omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time in their capacities as
directors and officers of the Company (as applicable), on terms with respect
to coverage, deductibles and amounts no less favorable in the aggregate than
the policy in effect on the date of this Agreement and at a price, with
respect to the entire six (6)-year period following the Effective Time, not to
exceed 300% of the annual premium currently payable by the Company with
respect to such current policy. If the Company fails to purchase such "tail"
policy prior to the Closing, Parent shall purchase, or cause to be purchased a
"tail" insurance policy with a claims period of six (6) years from the
Effective Time with respect to directors' and officers' liability insurance
for the benefit of the Indemnified Persons who are currently covered by such
existing policy with respect to their acts and omissions occurring prior to
the Effective Time in their capacities as directors and officers of the
Company (as applicable), on terms with respect to coverage, deductibles and
amounts no less favorable in the aggregate than the policy in effect on
the date of this Agreement; _provided_ that, that in no event shall Parent be
required to pay an amount, with respect to the entire six (6)-year period
following the Effective Time, in excess of 300% of the annual premium
currently payable by the Company with respect to such current policy, it
being understood that if the annual premiums payable for such insurance
coverage exceeds such amount, Parent shall be obligated to cause the
Surviving Corporation to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available
for a cost equal to such amount. For a period of six (6) years after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect any such
insurance policy.

  



  

(c)  In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, Parent
shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of
the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations set forth in this
_Section 6.08_.

  



  

(d)  The provisions of this _Section 6.08_ shall survive the
consummation of the Merger and are intended to be for the benefit of, and
will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person, his or her heirs and his or
her representatives and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have
by contract or otherwise. This _Section 6.08_ may not be amended, altered or
repealed after the consummation of the Offer and the Merger in such a
manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified Person or any of
their heirs and Representatives without the prior written consent of the
affected Indemnified Person or applicable heir or Representative.

Section 6.09. _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

  



  

(a)  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
including the proviso to the first sentence of _Section 6.09(d)_ , the
Company and Parent shall (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to)
each use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the
other parties in doing all things necessary, proper or advisable under
Applicable Law to (i) obtain all necessary actions, waivers, registrations,
permits, authorizations, orders, consents and approvals from Governmental
Authorities, the expiry or early termination of any applicable waiting

pursuant to this _Section 6.09_ , each of Parent and the Company shall (i)
prepare and file any notification and report forms and related material
required under the HSR Act and any other applicable Antitrust Laws with
respect to the Transactions (if any), and any additional filings or
notifications and related material that are necessary, proper or advisable to

each other in connection with any filing or submission with a Governmental
Authority in connection with the Transactions and in connection with any
investigation or other inquiry by or before a Governmental Authority relating
to the Transactions, including any proceeding initiated by a private person,
(ii) to the extent legally permissible, have the right to review in
advance, and to the extent practicable each shall consult the other on, any
material filing made with, or written materials to be submitted to, any
Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions and of any material
communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a
private Person, in each case regarding any of the Transactions, (iii) promptly
inform each other of any material communication (or any other material
correspondence or memoranda) received from, or given to, the DOJ or the FTC or

and the requirements of Governmental Authorities, the Company and Parent shall
(with respect to any in-person discussion or meeting, remote video meeting or

practicable (with respect to any other telephonic discussion or meeting),
provide the other party and its counsel with advance notice of and the

_Section 6.09_ , materials provided to the other party or its counsel may be
redacted to remove references concerning the valuation of the Acquired
Companies and as necessary to address reasonable attorney-client or other
privilege concerns.

(d)  In furtherance of the undertakings of Parent pursuant to
_Section 6.09(a)_ and _Section 6.09(b)_ , Parent and the Company (if
requested by Parent), along with their respective Subsidiaries, shall use
their reasonable best efforts to obtain clearance under any applicable
Antitrust Laws so as to enable the parties hereto to consummate the
Transactions as promptly as practicable, and in any event prior to the End
Date, which shall include using reasonable best efforts to propose, negotiate,
commit to and effect, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise,
the sale, divestiture, disposition, license or other disposition of such of
its and its Subsidiaries' assets, properties or businesses or of the assets,
properties or businesses to be acquired by Parent pursuant hereto, and enter
into such other arrangements, as are necessary or advisable in order to avoid
the entry of, and the commencement of litigation seeking the entry of, or to
effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or
other Order in any Proceeding by a Governmental Authority or any other Person
under Antitrust Laws that would otherwise have the effect of preventing or
materially delaying the consummation of the Transactions. The Company shall
not, unless requested to do so by Parent, commit to or effect any action
contemplated in the immediately preceding sentence. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this _Section 6.09(d)_ or any other provision of this
Agreement, in no event shall Parent or any of its Subsidiaries be required to
take or agree to (nor shall the Company or any Company Subsidiaries be
permitted to take or agree to unless Parent so directs them (and they shall,
if Parent so directs, take or agree to, so long as such agreements are
conditioned upon the Closing)) any action, concession or undertaking (i)

(ii) to the extent it would constitute or result in, or would reasonably be
expected to constitute or result in, individually or in the aggregate, a
Substantial Detriment.

shall not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, directly or
indirectly, acquire or agree to acquire any assets, business or any person,
whether by merger, consolidation, purchasing a substantial portion of the
assets of or equity in any person or by any other manner or engage in any
other transaction, if the entering into of an agreement relating to or the
consummation of such acquisition, merger, consolidation or purchase or other
transaction would reasonably be expected to (i) impose any material delay in
the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period or impose any
material delay in the obtaining of, or materially increase the risk of not
obtaining, any authorization, consent, clearance, approval or order of a
Governmental Authority, including any approvals and expiration of waiting
periods pursuant to the HSR Act or any other applicable Antitrust Law, (ii)
materially increase the risk of any Governmental Authority entering,
or materially increase the risk of not being able to remove or successfully
challenge, any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction or other order,
decree, decision, determination or judgment that would materially delay,
materially restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit Closing or (iii)
otherwise materially delay or materially impede the consummation of any of the
Transactions.

comment on all material filings or responses to be made by the Company and
shall discuss in advance any material discussions or communications proposed
to be held by the Company with any third party in connection with any such
Transaction Litigation (and the Company shall in good faith take any comments
or feedback provided by Parent into account), and give Parent the opportunity
to participate in the defense and settlement of, any such Transaction
Litigation and (b) if Parent does not exercise such right to participate,
keep Parent reasonably and promptly informed with respect to the status of
such Transaction Litigation. No compromise or full or partial settlement of

prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

release, or scheduling a press conference or conference call with investors
or analysts, and shall use reasonable best efforts to consult with each other
before making any other public statement, in each case, with respect to this
Agreement or the Transactions, and shall not issue any such press release or
make any such other public statement relating to this Agreement or the
Transactions without the consent of the other party, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, except for any such release
or announcement that Parent or the Company determines, after consultation
with outside legal counsel, is required by Applicable Law or any listing
agreement with or rule of any national or foreign securities exchange or
association upon which the securities of the Company or Parent, as
applicable, are listed, in which case the party required to make the release
or announcement shall provide notice to and, to the extent
reasonably practicable, consult with the other party about, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to allow the other party reasonable time (taking into
account the circumstances) to comment on, such release or announcement in
advance of such issuance, and the party will consider any such reasonable
comments that are timely provided in good faith; _provided_ , _however_ , each
party may, without such consultation or consent, make any public statement in
response to questions from the press, analysts, investors or those attending
industry conferences, make internal announcements to employees and make
disclosures in Company SEC Documents and any documents, reports, statements,
forms or other filings required to be made by Parent with the SEC, so long as
such statements, announcements and disclosures substantially reiterate (and
are not inconsistent with) previous press releases, public disclosures or
public statements approved in advance by the other party; _provided_ ,
_further_ , no party hereto shall have any obligation to consult with, or
obtain the prior written consent of, any other party with respect to any press
release, public statement or filing relating to any Takeover Proposal,
Takeover Transaction or Adverse Recommendation Change.

Company (including any deemed dispositions or cancellations and any
derivative securities with respect to any equity securities of the Company)
held by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of

and the instructions thereto as an "employment compensation, severance or
other employee benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2)

best efforts to obtain waivers (in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent)

acknowledges and agrees that obtaining any such waiver shall not be a
condition to the Offer or the Merger; _provided_ , _further_ , that the
Company shall not, and shall cause each Company Subsidiary not to, contribute
capital, pay any consideration in any form (including any letter of credit,
guaranty or other financial or commercial accommodation) to any Person, amend
any Contract, grant any concession (in any form) or propose or agree to any
of the foregoing in order to obtain such waivers, in each case, without the
prior written consent of Parent (provided that the Company shall not be
required to make any such concession unless either (a) the Company
reimbursed or indemnified for by Parent for such concession or (b) such
concession is subject to the occurrence of the consummation of the Offer).

instruments of discharge providing for the payoff, discharge and termination
on the Closing Date of all then-outstanding indebtedness under the Funding

taken by the Company or Company Subsidiaries shall be subject to consultation
with, and prior written approval by, Parent; _provided_ , that Parent will
indemnify and hold harmless the Company with respect to any fees, losses,
expenses, liabilities or Taxes incurred as a result of any such actions taken

Company in this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect, or of any failure by the Company to comply with or satisfy in any
material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement, in each case if and only to the
extent that such untruth, inaccuracy or failure would reasonably be
expected to cause any of the conditions to the obligations of Parent and
Merger Sub to consummate the Offer set forth on _Annex A_  or to consummate
the Merger set forth in _Section 7.01_ to fail to be satisfied; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) no such notification shall affect the representations,

material respect, or of any failure by Parent or Merger Sub to comply with or
satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by either pursuant to this Agreement, in each case
if and only to the extent that such untruth, inaccuracy or failure would
reasonably be expected to cause any of the conditions to the obligations of
the Company to consummate the Merger set forth in _Section 7.01_  to fail to
be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall affect
the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or obligations of the

contrary, nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to
confer on any Person other than the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns any rights, remedies, obligations or
liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement, except (i) from and after

provisions of  _Section 6.08_ , which shall be enforceable by the Persons or
entities benefiting therefrom and (iii) the provisions of  _Section 9.04(e)_
, which shall be enforceable by the Company Related Parties.

  



  

Section 9.06. _Governing Law_. This Agreement and any Proceedings
arising out of or related hereto or the Transactions or to the inducement of
any party hereto to enter into this Agreement (whether for breach of
contract, tortious conduct or otherwise and whether predicated on common
law statute or otherwise) shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the conflicts of
law rules of such state.

  



  

   

91

 



    



  

Section 9.07. _Jurisdiction_. The parties hereto hereby irrevocably
agree (i) that any Proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on
any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the
Transactions shall be brought in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware
and any state appellate court therefrom, or, if the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware does not have subject matter jurisdiction over the matter,
the Superior Court of the State of Delaware or the Federal District Court for
the District of Delaware located in Wilmington, Delaware, and any appellate
courts therefrom and (ii) not to commence any such Proceeding in any court
except such courts. Each party hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of such court in respect of any legal or equitable Proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions, or relating
to enforcement of any of the terms of this Agreement, and hereby waives, and
agrees not to assert, as a defense in any such Proceeding, any claim that it
is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of such court, that the
Proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the
Proceeding is improper or that this Agreement or the Transactions may not be
enforced in or by such courts. Each party agrees that notice or the service
of process in any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the Transactions shall be properly served or delivered if delivered in the
manner contemplated by _Section 9.01_ or in any other manner permitted by
Applicable Law.

  



  

Section 9.08. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING ARISING
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT
(I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND
HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS
VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS
_Section 9.08_.

  



  

Section 9.09. _Specific Performance; Remedies_. The parties agree that
irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be
an adequate remedy, would occur and that the parties would not have any
adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that (a) the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance, or other
equitable relief, to prevent breaches or threatened or anticipated breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in the courts described in _Section 9.07_ , without proof of
damages or otherwise, and (b) the right of specific performance is
an integral part of the Transactions and without that right, neither the
Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement. Each of the
parties agrees that it waives the defense of adequacy of a remedy at law and
will not oppose the granting of an injunction or injunctions, specific
performance or other equitable relief on the basis that the other parties have
an adequate remedy at law. The parties acknowledge and agree that any party
seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in
accordance with this _Section 9.09_ shall not be required to provide any bond
or other security in connection with any such order or injunction.

Section 9.10. _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance
of the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such a holding, the parties
agree to negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable
manner, in order that the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions be
consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

  



  

Section 9.11. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, including the
exhibits and annexes to this Agreement, the Company Disclosure Letter and the
Parent Disclosure Letter and any documents delivered by the parties in
connection herewith and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire
agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties with respect thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall not be superseded, shall survive any
termination of this Agreement and shall continue in full force and effect
until the earlier to occur of (a) the Effective Time and (b) the date on
which the Confidentiality Agreement expires in accordance with its terms
or is validly terminated by the parties thereto.

acknowledges that it has been represented by counsel of its choice throughout
all negotiations that have preceded the execution of this Agreement, and that
it has executed the same with the advice of said independent counsel.
Each party and its counsel cooperated and participated in the drafting and
preparation of this Agreement and the documents referred to in this
Agreement, and any and all drafts relating thereto exchanged among the parties
shall be deemed the work product of all of the parties and may not be

each of the parties hereto. Any matter set forth on the Company Disclosure
Letter shall not be deemed to constitute an admission by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, or to otherwise imply, that any such matter is material,
is required to be disclosed by the Company under this Agreement or falls
within relevant minimum thresholds or materiality standards set forth in this
Agreement, nor shall be construed as an admission or indication to any
Third Party that any breach or violation exists or has actually occurred.

Section 9.13. _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be
signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with
the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same
instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto
shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties
hereto, _it being understood_ and agreed that all parties hereto need not

The obligation of Merger Sub to irrevocably accept for purchase and pay for

subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in clauses "(a)"
through "(h)" below. Accordingly, notwithstanding any other term of the Offer
or the Agreement to the contrary, Merger Sub shall not be required to
irrevocably accept for purchase or, subject to any applicable rules and
regulations of the SEC, including Exchange Act Rule 14e-l(c) (relating to
Merger Sub's obligation to pay for or return tendered Shares promptly after
the termination or withdrawal of the Offer), pay for, and may delay the
acceptance for payment of or, subject to such rules and regulations, the
payment for, any tendered Shares and, if permitted by the Merger Agreement,
may terminate the Offer: (i) if the Merger Agreement has been
validly terminated in accordance with _Section 8.01_ ; or (ii) at any
scheduled Offer Expiration Time (as the Offer may have been extended pursuant
to, and subject to any requirements to extend the Offer pursuant to, _Section
2.01(c)_ of the Merger Agreement), if, with respect to clause (ii) only: (x)
the Minimum Tender Condition or the Termination Condition shall not be
satisfied by the Offer Expiration Time; or (y) any of the additional
conditions set forth below shall not be satisfied or (to the extent permitted
by Applicable Law) waived in writing by Parent:

  



  

(a)  there shall have been validly tendered in the Offer and not
validly withdrawn that number of Shares that (together with any Shares owned
by Parent and its Affiliates and excluding any Shares tendered pursuant to
guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been "received" (as such
term is defined in Section 251(h)(6)(f) of the DGCL)) represent at least a
majority of the Shares at the Offer Expiration Time (the " _Minimum Tender
Condition_ ");

  



  

(b)  (i) any waiting period (or any extension thereof) under the
HSR Act applicable to the Transactions shall have expired or been terminated
and (ii) the governmental approvals, consents or authorizations under any
other applicable Antitrust Law set forth on _Section 6.09_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter (the " _Required Approvals_ ") shall have been obtained;

  



  

(c)  no Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over any
party hereto shall have issued any Order or legal restraint or
prohibition, nor any Applicable Law shall be in effect, in each case, as of
immediately prior to the Offer Expiration Time, that makes consummation of
the Offer or the Merger illegal or otherwise prohibited;

  



  

(d)  since the date of the Merger Agreement, there shall not
have been any Company Material Adverse Effect of which the existence or
consequences are still continuing as of immediately prior to the Offer
Expiration Time;

  



  

(e)  (i) the representations and warranties of the Company set
forth in _Section 4.11(c)_ (Absence of Certain Changes) shall be true and
correct in all respects as of the date of the Merger Agreement and as of the
consummation of the Offer, as if made at such time,

  



  

   

 | i| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(ii) each of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
_Section 4.01_ (Corporate Existence and Power),  _Section 4.02_
(Organizational Documents), _Section 4.03_ (Corporate Authorization), _Section
4.06(c)_ - _(d_ )(Capitalization),  _Section 4.07_ (Subsidiaries), _Section
4.29_ (Broker's Fees) and _Section 4.30_ (Opinion of Financial Advisor) of
the Merger Agreement shall be true and correct in all material respects as of
the date of the Merger Agreement and as of the consummation of the Offer, as
if made at such time, except to the extent such representation or warranty
expressly relates to a specific date (in which case on and as of such
specific date),

  



  

(iii) the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in _Section
4.06(a)_ (Capitalization) (other than the penultimate sentence thereof)
shall be true and correct except for any inaccuracies that individually or in
the aggregate are  _de minimis_ as of the date of the Merger Agreement and as
of the consummation of the Offer, as if made at such time, except to the
extent any such representation or warranty expressly relates to a specific
date (in which case on and as of such specific date), and

  



  

(iv) each of the other representations and warranties of the Company set
forth in the Merger Agreement shall be true and correct as of the date of the
Merger Agreement and as of the consummation of the Offer, as if made at such
time, except to the extent any such representation or warranty
expressly relates to a specific date (in which case on and as of such
specific date), other than, in the case of this clause (iv), for
such failures to be true and correct that have not had or would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect ( _it being
understood_ that for this purpose all references to the term "Company Material
Adverse Effect" and other qualifications based on the word "material," set
forth in any such representations and warranties shall be disregarded);

  



  

(f)   the Company shall have complied in all material respects
with each of the covenants, obligations and agreements it is required to
comply with or perform at or prior to the Offer Expiration Time; _provided_ ,

the Offer expires certifying that the conditions specified in clauses (d), (e)
and (f) have been satisfied; and

  



  

(h)  the Merger Agreement shall not have been terminated in
accordance with its terms (the " _Termination Condition_ ").

  



  

   

 | ii| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub
and, except for the Minimum Tender Condition and the Termination Condition
(each of which may only be waived with the prior written consent of the
Company), may be waived by Parent or Merger Sub in whole or in part at
any time and from time to time and in the sole discretion of Parent or Merger
Sub, subject in each case to the terms of the Merger Agreement and Applicable
Law. The foregoing conditions shall be in addition to, and not a limitation
of, the rights and obligations of Parent and Merger Sub with respect to
extending, terminating or modifying the Offer pursuant to the terms and
conditions of the Merger Agreement or Applicable Law. The failure by Parent,
Merger Sub or any other Affiliate of Parent at any time to exercise any of
the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right, the
waiver of any such right with respect to particular facts and circumstances
shall not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and circumstances
and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at
any time and from time to time.

  



  

Capitalized terms used in this _Annex A_  but not defined herein shall have
the meanings set forth in the Agreement to which it is attached, except that
the term " _Merger Agreement_ " shall be deemed to refer to the Agreement to
which this _Annex A_ is attached.
