</FONT>The Company maintains, and since January 1, 2017 has maintained, a system of internal control over financial reporting (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of the Company&rsquo;s financial reporting and the preparation of the Financial Statements for external purposes in accordance
with GAAP, and includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and that receipts
and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the Company Board; and (iii) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the assets of the Company
that could have a material effect on the financial statements. The Company&rsquo;s management has completed an assessment of the
effectiveness of the Company&rsquo;s system of internal controls over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, and, except as set forth in the Company SEC
Documents filed prior to the date of this Agreement, that assessment concluded that those controls were effective and disclosed
to the Company&rsquo;s independent public accounting firm and audit committee of the Company Board (i) all significant deficiencies
and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to
adversely affect the Company&rsquo;s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (ii) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the Company&rsquo;s internal
control over financial reporting. Since December 31, 2019, neither the Company nor, to the Company&rsquo;s Knowledge, the Company&rsquo;s
independent registered public accounting firm, has identified or been made aware of any &ldquo;significant deficiencies&rdquo;
or &ldquo;material weaknesses&rdquo; (as such terms are defined by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board) in the design
or operation of such internal control over financial reporting utilized by the Company that would reasonably be expected to be
adverse to the Company&rsquo;s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and any fraud, whether or
