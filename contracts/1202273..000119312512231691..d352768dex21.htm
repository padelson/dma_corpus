ARTICLE III __

 

 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock;_

_Exchange of Certificates; Transfer of Uncertificated Shares_

3.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger and without any action on the part of any of the Parties or the holder
of any shares of capital stock of Purchaser, Merger Sub or the Company:

 

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per
share, of the Company (the " _Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a " _Share_ " and collectively,
the " _Shares_ ") (other than (i) Shares owned by Purchaser or any direct
or indirect Subsidiary of Purchaser, (ii) Shares owned by the Company or

 



3  any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company and (iii)
Shares owned by any Stockholder who has perfected and not withdrawn a demand
for or lost appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (each such
Stockholder, a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") (each Share referred to in
clauses (i) through (iii) being an " _Excluded Share_ " and collectively,
the " _Excluded Shares_ ")), shall be converted into the right to receive
$6.10 per Share in cash, without interest (the " _Per Share Merger
Consideration_ ", and the aggregate amount for all Shares (other
than Excluded Shares), the " _Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective
Time, all of the Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and
shall cease to exist, and (A) each certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") formerly
representing any Share (other than any Excluded Share) and each uncertificated
Share (an " _Uncertificated Share_ ") (other than any Excluded Share) shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration and (B) each Certificate formerly representing Shares or
Uncertificated Shares owned by a Dissenting Stockholder shall thereafter
represent only the right to receive the payment to which reference is made in
_Section 3.2(f)_.

(b) _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into one (1) share of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

3.2 _Exchange of Certificates; Transfer of Uncertificated Shares_. (a)
_Paying Agent_. At the Effective Time and from time to time thereafter to the
extent necessary, Purchaser shall make available or cause to be made available
to a paying agent selected no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date by Purchaser with the Companys prior approval (the " _Paying
Agent_ "), amounts sufficient in the aggregate to provide all funds necessary
for the Paying Agent to make payments of the Merger Consideration as required
by _Section 3.1(a)_ (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_ "). Purchaser shall appoint the Paying Agent pursuant to and
on the terms and conditions set forth in an agreement in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to the Company. Purchaser shall be responsible for all
fees and expenses of the Paying Agent. The Exchange Fund, once deposited with
the Paying Agent, shall, pending its disbursement to the Stockholders, be held
in trust for the benefit of the Stockholders and shall not be used for any
other purpose. The Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as directed by
Purchaser; _provided,_ that such investments shall be in obligations of or
guaranteed by the United States of America or in money market funds investing
solely in the foregoing. Any interest and other income resulting from any
investment of the Exchange Fund as directed by Purchaser shall become a part
of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable under 
_Section 3.1(a)_ shall be promptly returned to Purchaser.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any
event within three (3) Business Days following the Effective Time), the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Stockholder
of record (other than holders of Excluded Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal
specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares, as the case may be, shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in _Section 3.2(e)_) or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the
Paying Agent, such letter of transmittal to be in customary form and have such
other provisions as Purchaser and the Company may agree, and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in

 



4  lieu thereof as provided in _Section 3.2(e)_) or transfer of the
Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon (A)
surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided
in _Section 3.2(e)_) or (B) receipt of an "agents message by the Paying
Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may
reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated
Shares, to the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate or transferred
Uncertificated Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a
cash amount in immediately available funds (after giving effect to any
required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 3.2(g)_) equal to the
product of (x) the number of (1) Shares represented by such Certificate
(or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section 3.2(e)_) or
(2) such transferred Uncertificated Shares, multiplied by (y) the Per Share
Merger Consideration, and such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued
on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates or transfer of
Uncertificated Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that
is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check for any
cash to be exchanged upon due surrender of the Certificate or transfer of the
Uncertificated Shares, as the case may be, representing such transferred
Shares may be issued to the transferee of such Shares if the Certificate
formerly representing such Shares is presented or such Uncertificated Shares
are properly transferred, as the case may be, to the Paying Agent, accompanied
by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to
evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are not
applicable.

(c) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificate or Uncertificated Share is presented to the Surviving
Corporation, Purchaser or the Paying Agent for transfer, such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share shall be cancelled and exchanged for the cash amount in
immediately available funds to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant
to this _Article III_.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by
the Stockholders for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered
to the Surviving Corporation. Any Stockholder (other than a holder of Excluded
Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this _Article III_ shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger
Consideration (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in _Section 3.2(g)_) upon due surrender of its Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section 3.2(e)_), or
transfer of its Uncertificated Shares, as the case may be, without any
interest thereon.

 

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Purchaser, the posting by such Person of a bond
in reasonable amount and upon such terms as may be reasonably required
by Purchaser as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or
the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent
will issue a check in an amount (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in  _Section 3.2(g)_) equal to the product of (x)
the number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
multiplied by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration.

 



5 (f) _Appraisal Rights_. No Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to receive
the Per Share Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares owned by such
Person unless and until such Person shall have effectively withdrawn or lost
such Persons right to appraisal under the DGCL. Each Dissenting Stockholder
shall be entitled to receive only the payment provided by Section 262 of the
DGCL with respect to Shares owned by such Dissenting Stockholder. The Company
shall give Purchaser prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal,
attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served
pursuant to applicable Law that are received by the Company relating to
stockholders rights of appraisal. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Purchaser, voluntarily make any payment with respect
to any demands for appraisal, offer to settle or settle any such demands or
approve any withdrawal of any such demands.

(g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Purchaser, Merger Sub and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Stockholder, Company
Option holder or Company Award holder such amounts as it is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ") or any other applicable
state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by
the Surviving Corporation, Merger Sub or Purchaser, as the case may be, such
withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by Purchaser, Merger Sub or the
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity
and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Stockholder, Company Option holder or Company Award holder in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving
Corporation, Merger Sub or Purchaser, as the case may be.

(h)  _No Liability_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Company, the
Surviving Corporation, Purchaser, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall
be liable to any other Person in respect of any Per Share Merger Consideration
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws.

3.3 _Treatment of Stock Plan Treatment of Options_. (a) Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall take or cause to be taken all action
reasonably necessary to ensure that, at the Effective Time, each outstanding
option to purchase Shares granted under the Stock Plan (vested or unvested)
(each, a " _Company Option_ "), shall be cancelled and shall only entitle the
holder thereof to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable (but not later
than five (5) Business Days) after the Effective Time and in accordance with
applicable law, the Stock Plan and the applicable award agreement(s), from
Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation, solely an amount in cash equal to the
product of (x) the total number of Shares subject to such Company Option
multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger Consideration
over the exercise price per Share under such Company Option (the aggregate
amount of such cash payable to the holders of all Company Options, the "
_Option Consideration_ ") less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with
respect to such payment as provided in _Section 3.2(g)_.

 



6 (b) _Treatment of Company Awards_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take or cause to be taken all action reasonably necessary to ensure
that, at the occurrence of the Effective Time, (i) each outstanding deferred
stock unit issued pursuant to a Deferred Stock Unit Award Agreement (a " _DSU
Award Agreement_ "), (ii) each performance share award issued pursuant to a
Performance Share Award Agreement (a " _Performance Share Award Agreement_ ")
and (iii) each outstanding restricted stock unit award issued pursuant to a
Restricted Stock Award Agreement (" _RSU Award Agreement_ "), in each case
under the Stock Plan (each, a " _Company Award_ " and collectively, the "
_Company Awards_ "), shall be cancelled and shall entitle the holder thereof
to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable (but not later than five (5)
Business Days) after the Effective Time and in accordance with applicable Law,
the Stock Plan and the applicable award agreement(s), from Purchaser or the
Surviving Corporation, solely an amount in cash equal to the product of (x)
the number of Shares subject to such Company Award immediately prior to the
Effective Time (for this purpose, the number of Shares subject to Company
Awards under Performance Share Award Agreements shall be the number of Earned
Performance Shares within the meaning of _Section 4(a)_ of each of the
Performance Share Award Agreements (as determined by the Company Board in
accordance with the Stock Plan prior to the Effective Time based on the most
recently available relevant Company financial information at the time of such
determination), multiplied by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration (or, if
such Company Award contemplates the payment of a specified exercise price, the
excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger Consideration over such exercise
price) (the aggregate amount of such cash payable to the holders of
all Company Awards, the " _Company Award Consideration_ "), less applicable
Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment as provided in
_Section 3.2(g)_.

 

(c) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser, Merger
Sub and the Company shall cooperate in taking all actions reasonably
necessary or advisable to effectuate the provisions of _Section 3.3(a)_ and
_Section 3.3(b)_ (without expenditure of funds). The Company shall take
actions (without expenditure of funds) necessary to ensure that from and
after the Effective Time neither Purchaser nor the Surviving Corporation will
be required pursuant to any Company Award to deliver Shares of Common Stock or
other capital stock of the Company to any Person and that the Stock Plan
and any other Share based plan, agreement or arrangement is terminated and of
no force or effect.

3.4 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. If the Company changes the number of
Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for
Shares, issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock
dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or exchange
offer, or other similar transaction, the Per Share Merger Consideration, and
any other dependent items, as applicable, shall be equitably adjusted and so
adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event be the Per Share Merger
Consideration or other dependent item, as applicable.

"Risk-Factors" and (y) in any other section relating to forward-looking
statements or risk factors, in each case referred to in _clauses (x)_ and
_(y)_ to the extent such disclosures are non-specific and are primarily
cautionary or predictive in nature) but only to the extent the relevance of
any such disclosure as an exception or qualification to a representation and
warranty in this _Section 4.1_ is reasonably apparent on the face of such
disclosure; or (ii) as set forth in the corresponding section or subsection of
the disclosure letter delivered by the Company to Purchaser on the date hereof
(the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ "), the Company hereby represents and
warrants to Purchaser and Merger Sub as set forth in this _Section 4.1_;
_provided,_ that any disclosure in any section of the Company Disclosure
Letter shall only qualify (A) the representation or warranty made in the
corresponding Section of this _Section 4.1_ and (B) other representations and
warranties in this _Section 4.1_ to the extent the relevance of such

apparent on its face; _provided,_ further that the exceptions referenced in

representations and warranties of the Company in _Section 4.1(b)_, _Section
4.1(c)_, _Section 4.1(l)_ and _Section 4.1(r)_.

(a)  _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. Each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and (to

assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted and is qualified to
do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation or other legal
entity in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its
assets or properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification,
except where the failure to be so organized, qualified or in good standing,
or have such power or authority, has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect. The "Project Green" on-line data site maintained by "IntraLinks" and
established by the Company for purposes of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement to the extent the materials made available therein as of 11:59
PM on the date prior to the date hereof (the " _Data Room_ "), contains a

Subsidiaries" (as defined in Rule 1.02(w) of Regulation S-X promulgated
pursuant to the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (such act, as amended,
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the " _Exchange Act_ "),
each as amended to date) and neither the Company nor any such Significant
Subsidiary is in violation of any material provision of such organizational
documents. Section 4.1(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter accurately and
completely lists each jurisdiction where the Company and its Subsidiaries
are organized and qualified to do business. Except for any Liens under the
Revolving Credit Facility, each of the outstanding shares of capital stock or
other securities of each of the Companys Subsidiaries is duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and owned by the Company or by a

reserved for issuance pursuant to outstanding Company Options and Company
Awards granted under the Stock Plan and (B) 483,660 Shares reserved for future

outstanding Company Option and each outstanding Company Award, including the
holder, date of grant, date of expiration, number of Shares subject thereto,
the terms of vesting (if any), and the exercise price (if applicable).

agreements, arrangements, calls, commitments, rights or awards of any kind
that obligate the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue or sell any
shares of capital stock or other securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any securities or obligations convertible or exchangeable

outstanding. 

(iv) Upon any issuance of any Shares in accordance with the terms of the Stock
Plan, such Shares will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and

convertible into or exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with
the Stockholders on any matter. Except for the Voting Agreement, there are no
irrevocable proxies and no voting agreements with respect to any capital stock
of, or other equity or voting interests in, the Company.

held for such purpose or acting by written consent in lieu of a stockholders
meeting (the " _Company Stockholder Approval_ "), if required by applicable
Law. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and
constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Company enforceable against
the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws of

Stockholder will be necessary under applicable Law, such certificate of
incorporation or bylaws or otherwise to adopt this Agreement.

Adverse Effect.

(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Voting
Agreement by the Company do not, and the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby will not, constitute or
result in (A) a breach or violation of, or a default under, the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company or the comparable governing documents
of any of its Subsidiaries or, (B) with or without notice, lapse of time or
both, a breach or violation of, a termination (or right of termination) or

or impairment of any right to own or use or the creation of a Lien on any
of the assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to any

its Subsidiaries or, assuming compliance with the matters referred to in
_Section 4.1(d)(i)_, any Law to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is subject except, in the case of _clause (B)_ above, for any such
breach, violation, termination, default, creation, acceleration or loss of
right which has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

or furnished all forms, statements, certifications, reports and documents
required to be filed or furnished by it with the U.S. Securities and Exchange

or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances in which
they were made, not misleading, except to the extent that the information in

of the Code or, except for liabilities, penalties and taxes that have not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the

payment, funding or vesting of any benefits under any Benefit Plan, (x)

(ii) _Section 4.1(p)(ii)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true
and complete list of all Registered Intellectual Property owned by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Company Intellectual Property_ "),
indicating for each listed item the record owner, the registration or

Purchaser has delivered a true, correct and complete copy of an executed
commitment letter addressed to Purchaser and the Company, dated the date

to Purchaser an amendment or waiver to the Revolving Credit Facility fully
executed by all parties to the Revolving Credit Facility (the " _Waiver_ ")

contemplated hereby. As of the date hereof, each of the Equity Commitment
Letter and, to the knowledge of Purchaser, the Waiver, is in full force and

Waiver, has not been withdrawn, terminated or otherwise amended or modified in
any respect, Purchaser has not received notice of any such withdrawal or
termination and no such amendment or modification is contemplated. No event

thereto with respect to the financings contemplated thereby, and, except as
set forth, described or provided for in the Equity Commitment Letter, (x)
there are (1) no conditions precedent to the obligations of the Equity
Investor to fund the Equity Financing, or (2) conditions precedent to the
effectiveness of the Waiver (the " _Debt Financing_ " and together with the

contingencies or other provisions under any agreement (including any side
letters) relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to which
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates is a party that would permit the Equity
Investor or any of the lenders to reduce the total amount of the Financing or
impose any additional condition precedent to the availability of the
Equity Financing or any additional condition precedent to the availability of
the Debt Financing. There are no side letters or other agreements, Contracts
or arrangements related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the
Financing other than as expressly set forth in the Financing Commitment
Letters. The

 



24  Company is a third-party beneficiary of the Equity Commitment Letter. As of
the date hereof, assuming the truth and accuracy of the Companys
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, Purchaser has no
reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing will not be
satisfied on a timely basis or that the funding contemplated in the Financing

on a timely basis in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Purchaser has fully paid any and all fees required by the Waiver to
be paid on or prior to the date hereof. Subject to its terms and conditions,

has delivered to the Company the Limited Guarantee of the Guarantor. The
Limited Guarantee is in full force and effect and a legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Guarantor, and no event has occurred that, with or without
notice or lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to result in a
breach of, or a default under, the Limited Guarantee on the part of the
Guarantor, and the Limited Guarantee guarantees delivery of the Purchaser
Breach Termination Fee and Purchaser Financing Termination Fee, on the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth therein.

standstill or similar provisions of any agreement to which the Company or any

permitted to take any of the actions described in the foregoing _clause (v)_
if the Company determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that a failure of the Company to take such action could reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board.
Subject to _Section 5.2(b)_ and  _Section 5.2(c)_, the Company shall, and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and direct its Representatives to
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any solicitation, discussion or
negotiation with any Persons conducted heretofore by the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any of their Representatives with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal or Alternative Transaction.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if at any time
following the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time (i) the
Company receives a written Acquisition Proposal from a Third Party without
breaching its obligations under this _Section 5.2_; and (ii) the Company
Board, upon the recommendation of the Transaction Committee, determines in
good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial
advisor, that such Alternative Transaction constitutes or such Acquisition
Proposal could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal from such
Third Party, then the Company may (A) furnish information with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiaries and afford access to the business, properties,
assets, books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to such
Third Party making such Acquisition Proposal and (B) enter into,
participate and maintain discussions or negotiations with, such Third Party
making such Acquisition Proposal; _provided,_ that the Company (x) will not,
and will not allow any of its Representatives to, disclose any non-public
information to such Third Party without entering into an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement; and (y) will provide to Purchaser any non-public
information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries provided to such Third
Party which was not previously provided to Purchaser as promptly as
practicable following its provision to such Third Party. The Company shall
notify Purchaser (within forty-eight (48) hours of the Companys knowledge of
any of the events described in clauses (x) or (y) below) of receipt by the
Company or any of its Representatives of (x) any Acquisition Proposal or (y)
any request for non-public information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with any Acquisition Proposal, indicating, in
connection with such notice, the identity of the Person or group of Persons
making such Acquisition Proposal or request and the material terms and
conditions related thereto 

 



31  (including, if applicable, copies of any written Acquisition Proposal or
request, including proposed agreements) and thereafter shall keep Purchaser
reasonably informed, on a prompt basis (and, in any event, within one (1)
Business Day), of any material developments or modifications to the terms and
the status of any of the foregoing events described in clauses (x) or (y)
above.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if prior to
the Effective Time, the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal without
breaching its obligations under this _Section 5.2_, that the Company Board,
upon the recommendation of the Transaction Committee, determines in good
faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial advisor
and after taking into account all adjustments to the terms of this Agreement
that may be offered by Purchaser in accordance with this _Section 5.2(c)_,
constitutes a Superior Proposal and the Company Board determines in good
faith, upon the recommendation of the Transaction Committee, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel that the failure to take such
action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law, the Company Board may (i) effect a Change of
Recommendation and/or (ii) terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
9.3(a)_ to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal; _provided,_ that the Company Board may not effect a Change of
Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.3(a)_
unless (A) it gives Purchaser three (3) Business Days prior written notice
(the " _Notice Period_ ") of its intention to do so (unless at the time such
notice is otherwise required to be given there are less than three (3)
Business Days prior to the proposed Effective Date, in which case the Company
shall provide as much notice as is reasonably practicable) attaching the most
current version of all relevant proposed transaction agreements and other
material documents, (B) during the Notice Period, the Company, if requested by
Purchaser, shall have engaged in good faith negotiations to amend this
Agreement (including by making its officers, its legal and financial advisors
reasonably available to negotiate in good faith) so that such Alternative
Transaction would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal and (C) Purchaser
does not make, within such Notice Period, an offer that the Company Board
determines in good faith, upon the recommendation of the Transaction
Committee, after consultation with its legal and financial advisors, is at
least as favorable to the Stockholders as such Superior Proposal. In the
event of any material revisions to the applicable Superior Proposal, the
Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Purchaser and to
comply with the requirements of this _Section 5.2(c)_ with respect to such
new written notice (to the extent so required).

(d) Nothing contained herein shall prevent the Company from complying with
Rules 14a-9, 14d-9, 14e-2 and Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under
the Exchange Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal or from issuing a
"stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its position
thereunder or making any required disclosure to the Stockholders if, in the
good faith judgment of the Company Board, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel, the failure to do so could reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to Stockholders under applicable Law.
In no event shall the issuance of a "stop, look and listen statement" (or
similar statement pursuant to the requirements of applicable Law) constitute
a Change of Recommendation.

 



32 (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if prior to
the Effective Time, without breaching its obligations under this _Section
5.2_, (i) there occurs any fact, change, event, circumstance, occurrence,
effect or development that affects or would be reasonably expected to affect
the business, assets, liabilities, financial condition or results of
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, that (A) is material,
individually or in the aggregate, with any other such fact, change, event,
circumstance, occurrence, effect or development, (B) does not involve or
relate to an Acquisition Proposal and (C) is not known to the Company Board as
of the date hereof, and (ii) the Company Board, upon the recommendation of the
Transaction Committee, determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would reasonably be expected
to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to Stockholders under applicable
Law, then the Company Board may make a Change of Recommendation. No Change of
Recommendation shall change the approval of the Company Board for purposes of
causing any Takeover Statute to be inapplicable to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Voting Agreement.

 

5.3 _Financing Cooperation_. (a) Without the written consent of Purchaser the
Company will not amend, modify or waive any provision of the Waiver or other
provision of the Revolving Credit Facility in a manner, individually or in the
aggregate, constituting a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect. If Purchaser
seeks any alternative financing contemplated by  _Section 6.5_ hereof (the "
_Alternative Financing_ "), the Company shall cooperate promptly, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to cooperate promptly, in each case, using commercially
reasonable efforts, in connection with the arrangement of the Alternative
Financing, as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser including by (i)
participating in meetings (including lender meetings), presentations, due
diligence and drafting sessions; (ii) furnishing Purchaser and its financing
sources financial and other pertinent information regarding the Company and
its Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser to consummate the
Alternative Financing at the time during the Companys fiscal year such
offerings will be made; (iii) cooperating with, in accordance with and subject
to the limitations contained in _Section 7.5_, prospective lenders involved
in the Alternative Financing to provide access to the Companys and its
Subsidiaries respective assets, cash management and accounting systems; and
(iv) otherwise reasonably cooperating in Purchasers efforts to obtain the
Alternative Financing (including requesting of the appropriate Persons, and
using its good faith efforts to obtain, customary officers certificates and
other similar documents as may reasonably be requested by Purchaser);
_provided,_ that the Company shall not be required to provide, or cause the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to provide, cooperation under this
_Section 5.3_ that: (A) unreasonably interferes with the ongoing business of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (B) causes any representation or
warranty in this Agreement to be breached; or (C) causes any condition set
forth in _Article VIII_ to fail to be satisfied or otherwise causes the breach
of this Agreement or any Contract to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or the breach prior to Closing of any Material
Contract; and, _provided,_ further, that the effect of any such breach shall
be excluded when determining if the conditions set forth in _Section 8.2(a)_
and _Section 8.2(b)_ are satisfied). In no event shall the Company be in
breach of this Agreement because of the failure to deliver any financial or
other information that is not currently readily available to the Company on
the date hereof or is not otherwise prepared in the ordinary course of
business of the Company at the time requested by Purchaser or for the failure
to obtain any comfort with respect to, or review of, any financial or other
information by its accountants.

 



33 (b) In no event shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries be required to
pay any commitment or similar fee or incur any liability (including due to
any act or omission by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives) or expense in connection with assisting Purchaser
in arranging the Alternative Financing or as a result of any information
provided by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates or
Representatives in connection therewith. Purchaser shall, from and after the
Closing Date or promptly after the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Article IX_ , (i) promptly upon request by the Company reimburse the Company
for all out-of-pocket costs incurred in good faith by the Company and its
Subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation and (ii) other than in the
case of intentional or willful misconduct by the Company or its Subsidiaries,
indemnify and hold harmless the Company, and its Affiliates and
Representatives from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages,
claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or
incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the Alternative
Financing or providing any of the information utilized in connection
therewith. 

5.4 _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable
to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each
of Purchaser, Merger Sub, the Company and the Company Board shall grant such
approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that such transactions may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and by the Merger and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the
effects of such Takeover Statute on such transactions.

5.5 _Section 16 Matters_. The Company Board shall, prior to the Effective
Time, take all such actions as may be necessary or appropriate pursuant to
Rule 16b-3(e) under the Exchange Act to exempt the conversion to cash of all
Shares, Company Options and Company Awards by officers and directors of the
Company who are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the
Exchange Act or by employees or directors of the Company who may become an
officer or director of Purchaser subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act. In furtherance of the foregoing, prior to
the Effective Time, the Company Board shall adopt resolutions that specify
(i) the name of each individual whose disposition of Shares (including Company
Options, Company Awards and other derivative securities with respect to
Shares) is to be exempted, (ii) the number of Shares (including Company
Options, Company Awards and other derivative securities with respect to
Shares) to be disposed of by each such individual and (iii) that the approval
is granted for purposes of exempting the disposition from Section 16(b) of the
Exchange Act under Rule 16b-3(e) of the Exchange Act. The Company shall
provide to counsel for Purchaser for its review copies of such resolutions to
be adopted by the Company Board prior to such adoption.

 

ARTICLE VI __

 

 _Covenants of Purchaser_

6.1 _Conduct of Business of Purchaser_. Purchaser shall not, and shall not
permit any of its Representatives to, without the prior written consent of the
Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned) take or agree to take any action that would reasonably be
expected to (a) delay or prevent the consummation of the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (b) materially interfere
with Purchasers (or any of its Affiliates) ability to make available to the
Paying Agent at the Effective Time funds sufficient for the satisfaction of
all of Purchasers and Merger Subs obligations under this Agreement.

 



34 6.2 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Purchaser shall take all action necessary to
cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement and the
Voting Agreement and to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set

6.3 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. (a) Without
limiting any additional rights that any Indemnified Party may have under any
agreement or Benefit Plan as in effect on the date hereof, from and after the
Effective Time, Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and
severally, indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law (and Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation, jointly and
severally, shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, if requested, upon an undertaking by the
Indemnified Party to repay such expenses if it is ultimately determined
under applicable Law that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be
indemnified), each present and former director, officer or employee of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ "),
against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities, including
amounts paid in settlement (collectively, " _Costs_ ") incurred in connection
with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative (a " _Legal Action_ "), arising out
of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, that are, in whole or in part, based on or arising out of the
fact that such Person is or was a director, officer or employee of the Company
or any Subsidiary of the Company, including with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or serves or served as a fiduciary under, or
with respect to, any Employee Benefit Plan at any time maintained by or
contributed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph (a)
of this  _Section 6.3_, upon learning of any such Legal Action, shall
promptly notify Purchaser thereof, but the failure to so notify shall not
relieve Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation of any liability it may have to
such Indemnified Party except to the extent such failure materially
prejudices the indemnifying party. In the event of any such Legal Action
(whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) Purchaser and the
Surviving Corporation shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel
selected by the Indemnified Parties, which counsel shall be reasonably
satisfactory to Purchaser, promptly after statements therefore are received
and otherwise advanced to such Indemnified Party upon request
for reimbursement of documented expenses reasonably incurred, (ii) Purchaser
and the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate with the defense of such Legal
Action, (iii) any determination required to be made with respect to whether
an Indemnified Partys conduct complies with the standards set forth under
applicable Law and the certificate of incorporation or bylaws shall be made by
independent counsel mutually acceptable to Purchaser and the Indemnified Party
and (iv) neither Purchaser nor the Surviving Corporation shall settle,
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in such Legal Action
pending or threatened in writing to which an Indemnified Party is a party (and
in respect of which indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Party
hereunder), unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out
of such Legal Action; _provided,_  that Purchaser and the

 



35  Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected
without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned). If such indemnity is not available with respect to
any Indemnified Party, then Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation and the
Indemnified Party shall contribute to the amount payable in such proportion as
appropriate to reflect relative faults and benefits.

 

(c) Purchaser shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or its successor
to obtain a single premium directors and officers liability insurance tail
policy with policy terms, limits, amounts and conditions at least as favorable
to the directors and officers covered under such directors and officers
liability insurance as the terms, limits, amounts and conditions in the
Companys existing directors and officers liability insurance (the "
_Current D andO Insurance_"); _provided,_ that in connection with this _Section
6.3_, Purchaser shall not pay a one-time premium in excess of 300% of the
last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof (such 300%
amount, the " _Maximum Premium_ "); _provided_ , _further_ , that if the
premium for such insurance exceeds such Maximum Premium, Purchaser shall or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation, after consultation with the Company, to
obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding
such amount.

 

(d) Purchaser hereby acknowledges that the Indemnified Parties may have
certain rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and/or insurance
provided by other Persons. Purchaser hereby agrees that (i) Purchaser and the
Surviving Corporation are the indemnitor of first resort (i.e., their
obligations to the Indemnified Parties are primary and any obligation of such
other Persons to advance expenses or to provide indemnification for the same
expenses or liabilities incurred by any such Indemnified Party are secondary),
(ii) Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation shall be required to advance the
full amount of expenses incurred by any such Indemnified Party and shall be
liable for the full indemnifiable amounts, without regard to any rights any
such Indemnified Party may have against any such other Person and (iii)
Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation irrevocably waive, relinquish and
release such other Persons from any and all claims against any such other
Persons for contribution, subrogation or any other recovery of any kind in
respect thereof. Each of Purchaser and Surviving Corporation further agrees
that no advancement or payment by any of such other Persons on behalf of any
such Indemnified Party with respect to any claim for which such Indemnified
Party has sought indemnification from the Surviving Corporation shall affect
the foregoing and such other Persons shall have a right of contribution and/or
be subrogated to the extent of such advancement or payment to all of the
rights of recovery of such Indemnified Party against the Surviving
Corporation. 

(e) The provisions of this _Section 6.3_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their heirs
and their Representatives and are in addition to, and not in substitution for,
any other rights to indemnification that any such Person may have by contract
or otherwise. If any Indemnified Party is required to bring any action to
enforce rights or to collect monies due under this Agreement and is successful
in such action, Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation shall reimburse such
Indemnified Party for all of its expenses reasonably incurred in connection
with bringing and pursuing such action, including, without limitation,
reasonable attorneys fees and costs.

 



36 (f) For the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time (i) (or, in the case of matters occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time that have not been resolved prior to the
sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, until such matters are finally
resolved) Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor, and shall
itself honor as if it were the Surviving Corporation, in each case, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, all rights to indemnification or
exculpation existing in favor of a director, officer, employee or Employee
Benefit Plan fiduciary of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including,
without limitation, rights relating to advancement of expenses and
indemnification rights to which such Persons are entitled), as provided in
the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any
indemnification agreement, in each case, as in effect on the date hereof, and
relating to actions or events through the Effective Time and (ii) Purchaser
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause (A) the Charter and
Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to contain provisions no less favorable to
the Indemnified Parties with respect to limitation of certain liability of
directors, officers, employees and agents and indemnification than are set
forth as of the date of this Agreement in the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of the Company and (B) the certificate of incorporation and bylaws or
comparable organizational documents of each Subsidiary of Purchaser to
contain the current provisions regarding indemnification of directors,
officers, employees and agents which provisions in each case shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnified Parties.

(g) If Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all
or substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual,
corporation or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Purchaser or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations set
forth in this _Section 6.3_.

6.4 _Employee Benefits and Compensation_. For at least one (1) year following
the Closing Date, Purchaser shall provide or cause to be provided to all
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date who
continue to be employed by the Company and its Subsidiaries thereafter (i) a
salary or wage level and bonus opportunity comparable in the aggregate to the
salary or wage level and bonus opportunity to which they were entitled
immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii) employee benefits that, in the
aggregate, are comparable to the employee benefits that they were entitled to
receive immediately prior to the Closing Date (excluding for all purposes of
this _Section 6.4_, equity or equity-based compensation, change in control
arrangements, retention arrangements, transaction bonuses and similar
arrangements triggered in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement). In lieu of the foregoing, following the Closing, Purchaser
may arrange for the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries to
participate in the employee benefit plans of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries
(collectively, the " _Purchaser Benefit Plans_ ") on substantially the same
terms and conditions as similarly situated employees of Purchaser. Purchaser
shall cause the Purchaser Benefit Plans to take into account for purposes of
eligibility, benefits (excluding accruals under a defined benefit pension
plan) and vesting thereunder service by employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as if such service were with Purchaser or its Subsidiaries. For
purposes of each Purchaser Benefit Plan providing employee welfare benefits to
any employee 

 



37  of the Company or its Subsidiaries, Purchaser shall cause such Purchaser
Benefit Plans to (x) waive all pre-existing condition exclusions and
limitations, waiting periods, evidence of insurability or good health and
actively-at-work exclusions with respect to such employees and their
dependents to the same extent such exclusions, limitations or other conditions
were waived or satisfied under a comparable plan of the Company or its
Subsidiaries and (y) take into account any eligible expenses incurred by such
employees and their dependents for purposes of satisfying all deductible, co-
payment, coinsurance, maximum out-of-pocket requirements and like adjustments
or limitations on coverage applicable to such employees and their covered
dependents. Nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall: (a)
confer upon any current or former director, officer, employee or consultant of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any representative, beneficiary or
dependent thereof, any rights or remedies, including any right to employment
or continued employment for any period or terms of employment, of any nature
whatsoever, (b) be interpreted to prevent or restrict the Purchaser or its
Affiliates from modifying or terminating the employment or terms of employment
of any such employee after the Closing Date or (c) be treated as an amendment
or other modification of any Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan or
arrangement.

6.5 _Financing_. Purchaser and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that
obtaining the Debt Financing, or any Alternative Financing, is not a condition
to the consummation of the Merger. Purchaser shall obtain the Equity Financing
contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letter upon satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions to the Closing set forth in _Section 8.1_ and _Section 8.2_.
Purchaser shall not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, without
the prior written consent of the Company, take any action or enter into
any transaction that could reasonably be expected to materially impair, delay
or prevent consummation of the Debt Financing. In the event any portion of the
Debt Financing expires or is terminated or otherwise becomes unavailable on
the terms and conditions contemplated in the Revolving Credit Facility and
Waiver, Purchaser or the Company, as the case may be, promptly (and in any
event within two (2) Business Days) shall notify the other party of such
unavailability and the reasons therefor, and Purchaser shall thereafter use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain Alternative Financing, including from
alternative sources on terms no less favorable to Purchaser than the terms of
the Revolving Credit Facility, as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event. Purchaser shall (i) keep the Company informed on a
reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to
arrange the Financing and Alternative Financing, (ii) provide notice to the
Company promptly upon receiving any Alternative Financing and (iii) furnish
correct and complete copies of any definitive agreements with respect to the
Financing or Alternative Financing to the Company promptly upon their
execution. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Purchaser and
Merger Sub shall give the Company prompt notice (i) of any material breach or
default by any other party to any of the Financing Commitment Letters or
any other definitive agreements related to the Financing or Alternative
Financing of which Purchaser or Merger Sub becomes aware, (ii) of the receipt
of (a) any written notice or (b) other written communication, in each case
from any Person with respect to any (A) actual or potential material breach
or default or any termination or repudiation by any party to any of the
Financing Commitment Letters or any other definitive agreements related to the
Financing or Alternative Financing of any provisions of the Financing
Commitment Letters or any other definitive agreements related to the Financing
or Alternative Financing or (B) material dispute or disagreement between or
among any parties to any of the Financing Commitment Letters or any other
definitive agreements related to the Financing or Alternative

 



38  Financing with respect to the obligation to fund or make available the
Financing or Alternative Financing or the amount of the Financing or
Alternative Financing to be funded or made available at the Closing, and
(iii) if at any time, for any reason, Purchaser or Merger Sub believes in good
faith that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing
or Alternative Financing on the terms and conditions (including any market
flex) contemplated by any of the Financing Commitment Letters, or any other
definitive agreements related to the Financing or Alternative Financing. As
soon as reasonably practicable, Purchaser and Merger Sub shall provide any
information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any circumstance
referred to in _clause (i)_ , _(ii)_ or _(iii)_ of the immediately preceding
sentence. Prior to the Effective Time, neither Purchaser nor Merger Sub
shall, without the prior written consent of the Company, amend, modify,
supplement or waive any of the conditions or contingencies to funding or the
availability of the Financing or Alternative Financing contained in the
Financing Commitment Letters (or any definitive agreements related to the
Financing or Alternative Financing) to the extent such amendment, modification
or supplement or waiver, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be
expected to have the effect of (i) adversely affecting the ability or
likelihood of Purchaser or Merger Sub to timely consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) amending, modifying
or supplementing the conditions or contingencies to the Financing or
Alternative Financing in a manner that makes it less likely the Financing or
Alternative Financing will be funded or made available or imposing new or
additional conditions or expanding any existing condition to the receipt of
the Financing or Alternative Financing. In the event all conditions
applicable to the Equity Commitment Letter and Waiver have been satisfied,
Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the lenders under the
Debt Financing and the Equity Investor to fund the Financing and comply with
its obligations under the Debt Financing required to consummate the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as practicable;
_provided,_ that Purchaser shall not be obligated under any provision of this
Agreement to commence an action, suit, proceeding or claim against any source
of debt financing.

6.6 _Voting Agreement_. From and after the date hereof, in no event shall
Purchaser amend in any material respect, or waive any material requirement
under, the Voting Agreement.

after the Closing and regardless as to whether a Third Party purchaser has
been identified or approved prior to the Closing (a " _Divestiture_ "), (2)
taking or committing to take such other actions that may limit Purchaser, its

42  and records and, during such period, the Company shall (and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to Purchaser all information concerning its
business, properties and personnel as may reasonably be requested,
_provided,_ that the foregoing shall not require the Company (i) to permit any
inspection, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment of

Parties or violate any of its obligations with respect to confidentiality if
the Company shall have used commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
consent of such Third Party to such inspection or disclosure, (ii)
to disclose any privileged information of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or (iii) to violate any Laws. All requests for information and

executive officers. All such information shall be governed by the terms of the

required by Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or
rules of any national securities exchange, the NASDAQ or by the request of any
Governmental Entity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section
7.7_ shall limit the Companys or the Company Boards rights to make public
statements about its actions under _Section 5.2_ and _Section 9.3(a)_
without prior consultation.

7.8 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in _Section 9.5_, whether or not
the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses (including those payable to

other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Voting Agreement

opportunity to review and comment on the Information Statement, and any
amendment or supplement thereto, and all responses to requests for additional
information by, and replies to comments of, the SEC, (ii) take into good
faith consideration all comments reasonably proposed by Purchaser and (iii)
not file such document with the SEC prior to receiving the approval of

reasonable best efforts, after consultation with the other Parties, to respond
promptly to all comments of and requests by the SEC with respect to the
Information Statement. Each Party will advise the other Parties, promptly
after it receives notice thereof, of any request by the SEC for amendment of

Party discovers any information relating to the Company, Purchaser or any of
their respective Affiliates that should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Information Statement, so that the Information Statement
shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the Party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other Parties and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall be filed with the SEC by the Company, and to the
extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the Stockholders. Each of

7.10 _Control of Operations_. Nothing contained in this Agreement or the
Voting Agreement shall give Purchaser or Merger Sub, directly or indirectly,
the right to control or direct the Companys operations prior to the Effective
Time.

7.11 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall promptly advise Purchaser
orally and in writing of any stockholder litigation against the Company and/or
its directors relating to this Agreement or the Voting Agreement, the Merger
and/or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Voting
Agreement and shall keep Purchaser fully informed regarding any such
stockholder litigation. The Company shall give Purchaser the opportunity
to consult with the Company regarding the defense or settlement of any such

in all respects as of the date hereof, (ii) _Section 4.1(b)(i)_, _(ii)_

and as of the Closing Date as if made on and as of such dates (except to the
extent any such representation or warranty is made as of a specified date,
which such representation or warranty shall be true and correct as of such
specified date), except where the failures of such other representations and
warranties to be true and correct have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Purchaser shall have received at the Closing a certificate signed on
behalf of the Company by an executive officer of the Company to the effect
that the condition set forth in this _Section 8.2(a)_ has been satisfied.

to effect the Merger is also subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent
permitted by Law) waiver by the Company at or prior to the Effective Time of

warranties of Purchaser and Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement shall be

such representation or warranty is made as of a specified date, in which case
such representation or warranty shall be true and correct as of such specified
date), except where the failures of such representations and warranties to be

8.4 _Frustration of Closing Conditions_. Neither the Company, on the one
hand, nor Purchaser and Merger Sub, on the other hand, may rely on the failure
of any conditions set forth in this _Article VIII_ to be satisfied if such
failure was caused by such Partys failure to use the standard of
efforts required from such Party to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including as required by and
subject to _Article VII_.

to complete the Closing by the date the Closing is required to have occurred

of this Agreement and the abandonment of the Merger pursuant to this _Article
IX_ , this Agreement shall become void and of no effect with no liability on
the part of any Party (or of any of its respective directors, officers or
other Representatives or Affiliates); _provided,_ that (i) except as
otherwise provided herein, no such termination shall relieve any Party of any
liability or damages resulting from any willful or knowing breach of this

in the second sentence of _Section 10.1_ shall survive the termination of
this Agreement.

(b) _Company Termination Fee_.

9.4(a)_, then the Company shall pay the Company Termination Fee to Purchaser
in immediately available funds within five (5) Business Days after such
termination or (B) by the Company pursuant to _Section 9.3(a)_, then the
Company shall pay the Company Termination Fee to Purchaser in immediately
available funds concurrently with such termination.

(ii) If (A) this Agreement is terminated by Purchaser pursuant to _Section
9.4(b)_ (but only if the failure to satisfy the condition specified therein
results from an intentional breach by the Company of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein), (B)
after the date of this Agreement and prior to the earlier of (1) the date of
such termination and (2) the Effective Time, an Acquisition Proposal shall
have been publicly announced or otherwise communicated to the Stockholders
and (C) within one (1) year following the date of such termination (1) the

one of its Affiliates to, pay the Purchaser Breach Termination Fee to the
Company in immediately available funds within five (5) Business Days after
such termination.

contained in this _Section 9.5_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these agreements, none of the
Company, Purchaser and Merger Sub would have entered into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Company or Purchaser, as the case may be, fails promptly
to pay any amount due to Purchaser or the Company, as the case may be,
pursuant to this _Section 9.5_, it shall also pay any costs and expenses
(including attorneys fees) incurred by the other Party in connection with a
legal action to enforce this Agreement that results in a judgment against the
paying Party for such amount, together with interest on the amount of any
unpaid fee, cost or expense at the publicly announced prime rate of Citibank,

excluding) the payment date.

Company fails to effect the Closing or otherwise breaches this Agreement or
fails to perform hereunder, then, except for (i) an order of specific
performance as and only to the extent expressly permitted by _Section 10.15_
or (ii) money damages as expressly permitted by _Section 9.5(g)_, Purchasers
and Merger Subs sole and exclusive remedy (whether at law, in equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise) against the Company Related Parties in
respect of this Agreement, any Contract executed in connection herewith (other
than the Confidentiality Agreement) and the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby shall be to terminate this Agreement in accordance with this
_Article IX_ and collect, if due, (1) the Company Termination Fee and (2) any
interest and other amounts payable pursuant to _Section 9.5(d)_ and, upon
payment of such amounts in accordance with  _Section 9.5(b)_, except in

abandonment or termination thereof) or any matters forming the basis for such
termination, and (C) Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
any legal proceedings pending in connection with this Agreement, any Contract
executed in connection herewith (other than the Confidentiality Agreement) or

and other amounts payable pursuant to  _Section 9.5(d)_ on more than one
occasion, (ii) under no circumstances shall Purchaser and/or Merger Sub be

the Companys sole and exclusive remedy (whether at law, in equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise) against the Purchaser Related Parties in
respect of this Agreement, any Contract executed in connection herewith

_9.5(b)(ii)_  because the conditions to the payment of such Company
Termination Fee set forth in Section _9.5(b)(ii)(B)_ and Section
_9.5(b)(ii)(C)_ have not been met, then Purchaser shall be entitled to seek
from the Company money damages (excluding punitive, lost profits, lost
opportunity, benefit of the bargain, speculative or other

 



51  damages to the extent that such other damages are not reasonably
foreseeable), which damages may include, but need not be limited to, the

in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the Parties without the
prior written consent of each of the other Parties and any

; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser or Merger Sub may with prior written

hereunder to any parties providing Alternative Financing pursuant to the
terms thereof for purposes of creating a security interest herein or other
assignment as collateral in respect of such Alternative Financing or to an
affiliate of Purchaser ( _provided_ , such assignment does not release or

Letter); _provided_ , _further_ , that Purchaser may designate, by written

remedies expressly conferred upon a Party shall be cumulative with, and not
exclusive of, any other remedy contained in this Agreement, at law or in
equity. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the exercise by a
Party of any one remedy shall not preclude the exercise by such Party of
any other remedy.

10.15 _Specific Performance_. (a) The Parties agree that irreparable damage
for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy, would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to
specific performance and other equitable relief, including an injunction or
injunctions, to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement, without proof of actual damages,
in accordance with _Section 10.5_, this being in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the Parties agrees
that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance
and other equitable relief on the basis that (x) either Party has an adequate
remedy at law or (y) an award of specific performance is not an appropriate
remedy for any reason at law or equity. Any Party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide
any bond or other security in connection with any such order or injunction.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, however, the
Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that the Company shall be entitled to
specific performance to cause Purchaser and/or Merger Sub to draw down the
full proceeds of the Equity Financing pursuant to the terms and conditions of
the Equity Commitment Letter only if (a) all conditions in  _Section 8.1_
and _Section 8.2_ have been satisfied (other than those conditions that, by
their nature, are to be satisfied at the Closing (and which are, at the time
that the Company seeks specific performance pursuant to this  _Section
10.15_, capable of being satisfied if the Closing were to occur at such time),
(b) either the Waiver is in full force and effect or Alternative Financing has
been funded or will be funded at the date the Closing is required to have
occurred pursuant to _Section 1.2_, (c) Purchaser and Merger Sub fail to
complete the Closing by the date the Closing is required to have occurred
pursuant to _Section 1.2_, (d) the Company has confirmed in writing to
Purchaser that all conditions set forth in _Section 8.3_ have been satisfied
or that it would be willing to waive any unsatisfied conditions in _Section
8.3_ for purposes of consummating the Merger and it is ready, willing and
able to consummate the Merger and (e) such specific performance would result
in the consummation of the Merger in accordance with this Agreement
substantially contemporaneously with the consummation of the Debt Financing
(or alternative debt financing) and the Equity Financing.

 



58 (c) In the event that, pursuant to a claim for specific performance brought
against Purchaser and/or Merger Sub pursuant to _Section 10.15(b)_, a court
rules that Purchaser and/or Merger Sub breached this Agreement in connection
with their failure to effect the Closing in accordance with _Section 1.2_ and
that the failure of any of the conditions necessary for specific performance
set forth in _Section 10.15(b)_ is attributable to such breach, but the court
declines to enforce specifically the obligations of Purchaser and/or Merger
Sub to draw down the full proceeds of the Equity Financing pursuant to the
terms and conditions of the Equity Commitment Letter and/or to effect the
Closing in accordance with _Section 1.2_, on the terms and subject to the
conditions in this Agreement, then, in addition to the right of the Company
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.3_ and collect the
Purchaser Breach Termination Fee or the Purchaser Financing Termination Fee,
as the case may be, then the Company shall have the right to be paid the
Companys costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with
all actions to seek specific performance of Purchaser and Merger Subs
obligations pursuant to this Agreement and/or the Financing Commitment
Letters and all actions to collect such fee or expenses. In the event that,
pursuant to a claim for specific performance brought against Purchaser and/or
Merger Sub other than to cause Purchaser and/or Merger Sub to draw down the
full proceeds of the Equity Financing pursuant to _Section 10.15(b)_, a court
rules that Purchaser and/or Merger Sub breached this Agreement, but the court
declines to enforce specifically the obligations of Purchaser and/or Merger
Sub, then, in addition to the right of the Company to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 9.3 and collect the Purchaser Breach Termination Fee or
the Purchaser Financing Termination Fee, as the case may be, the Company
shall have the right to be paid the Companys costs and expenses (including
attorneys fees) in connection with all actions to seek specific performance
of Purchaser and Merger Subs obligations pursuant to this Agreement and all
actions to collect such fee or expenses.

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the exercise of the
Companys right to seek specific performance pursuant to this _Section
10.15_ reduce, restrict or otherwise limit the Companys right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.3_ and be paid the applicable Purchaser
termination fee;  _provided,_ that under no circumstances shall the Company
be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance of
the consummation of the Merger pursuant to this _Section 10.15_ and the
payment of all or any portion of any Purchaser termination fee.
