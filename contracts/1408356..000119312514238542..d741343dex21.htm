corporation ("Parent"), Sunflower Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub One"),
Sunflower Acquisition LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub Two" and together with Merger Sub One,

RECITALS

A. The boards of directors (or similar governing body) of each of Parent,
Merger Subs and the Company have determined that it is advisable and in the
best interests of each such corporation and their respective equityholders
that Parent acquire the Company through the statutory merger of Merger Sub
with and into the Company (the "First Step Merger"). As soon as practicable
following the First Step Merger, and as part of a single integrated
transaction, Parent will cause the Company, as the surviving entity in the
First Step Merger, to merge with and into Merger Sub Two, with Merger Sub Two
continuing as the surviving entity (the "Second Step Merger" and, taken
together with the First Step Merger, the "Merger").

B. The Company and Parent intend, by executing this Agreement, that the Merger
will qualify as a tax-free reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").

 

C. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Subs, on the other
hand, desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and other
agreements in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

D. Pursuant to the First Step Merger, among other things, and subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time (i) all of the
issued and outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock shall be converted into
the right to receive the consideration set forth herein; (ii) all of the
Company Options shall be cancelled and extinguished and shall be converted
into the right to receive the consideration set forth herein; and (iii) all of
the issued and outstanding Company Warrants or other securities convertible
into or exchangeable for shares of Company Capital Stock shall be terminated
and shall be converted into the right to receive the consideration set forth
herein.

 

E. A portion of the consideration otherwise payable by Parent in connection
with the Merger shall be placed in escrow by Parent as partial security for
the indemnification obligations set forth in this Agreement in the amount and
on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein.

 

E. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as a
condition and inducement to Parent and Merger Subs to enter into this
Agreement, (i) each of the Key Employees shall enter into a non-competition
and non-solicitation agreement with Parent, substantially in the form attached
as Exhibit A (a "Key Employee Non-Competition and Non-
Solicitation Agreements"); and (ii) each of the Key Employees shall execute
an offer letter, substantially in the form of Exhibit B (a "Key Employee Offer
Letters"), each to be effective as of the Effective Time.

 

F. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as a
condition and inducement to Parent and Merger Subs to enter into this
Agreement, certain holders of shares of Company Capital Stock or Company
Options set forth in Schedule A shall execute and deliver Voting Agreements,
in the form attached as Exhibit C (each, a "Voting Agreement") to Parent
and Merger Subs. G. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as a
condition and inducement to Parent and Subs to enter into this Agreement,
Company Securityholders listed on Schedule A are entering into and delivering
to Parent one or more Joinder and Waiver Agreements, substantially in the form
attached as Exhibit D (a "Joinder and Waiver Agreement"), to be effective
upon the Closing.

and shall thereupon cease to exist.

(c)  _Dissenting Shares of Company Capital Stock_. Following the Effective

(d) _Company Capital Stock Generally_. At the Effective Time each share of

Effective Time (other than (i) Company Treasury Shares and (ii) Dissenting
Shares), shall be cancelled, extinguished and converted into the right to

-20- (e) _Preferred Stock Conversion_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, all
of the shares of the Company Preferred Stock shall be converted into shares

(f) _Treatment of Company Options_.

 

(i) Parent will not assume any Company Options. At the Effective Time and by
virtue of the First Step Merger, each Company Option shall be cancelled and
replaced with the consideration set forth in this Section 2.7(f) (the
"Cancelled Company Options"). Cancelled Company Options that are Vested
Company Options will be cancelled and replaced with (A) the right to receive
a number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest
whole share of Parent Common Stock) equal to (1) the product of (x) the total
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Vested
Company Option that were issuable upon exercise of the Vested Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time; multiplied by (y) the excess of (a)
the Per Share Closing Merger Consideration Value; over (b) the entire exercise
price per share of such Vested Company Option; divided by (2) the Closing
Price; and (B) the right to receive a portion of the Earnout Consideration as
set forth in Section 2.16, when and if paid, with the amount of any such
payment to be determined based on the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Vested Company Option (together, the "Vested
Option Merger Consideration").

 

(ii) Cancelled Company Options that are Unvested Company Options (other than
Unvested Company Options that are not held by Continuing Employees or Persons
who will continue to be service providers to Parent or its Subsidiaries
immediately after the Effective Time, all of which will be cancelled and not
replaced) will be cancelled and replaced with (A) the right to receive
a number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest
whole share of Parent Common Stock) equal to (1) the product of (x) the total
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Unvested Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time; multiplied by (y) the excess
of (a) the Per Share Closing Merger Consideration Value; over (b) the entire
exercise price per share of such Unvested Company Option; divided by (2)
the Closing Price; and (B) the right to receive a portion of the Earnout
Consideration as set forth in Section 2.16, when and if paid, with the maximum
amount of any such payment to be determined based on the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Unvested Company Option
(together, the "Unvested Option Merger Consideration"). The Unvested Option
Merger Consideration will be paid to the holder in accordance with the vesting
schedule applicable to the Unvested Company Option prior to the Effective
Time, subject to the satisfaction of any vesting conditions (including
continued service) that applied to the Unvested Company Option prior to the
Effective Time. If the service of a holder of Unvested Option Merger
Consideration with Parent or one of its Subsidiaries terminates prior to the
vesting of the Unvested Option Merger Consideration, then Parent shall have no
further obligation to pay any Unvested Option Merger Consideration to such
holder, except that such holder shall still be entitled to receive, in respect
of the portion of holders Unvested Option Merger Consideration that vested
prior to or in connection with such termination of service, any amounts
payable pursuant to Section 2.16, when and if paid.

(iii) Payment of the Vested Option Merger Consideration and any payment of the
Unvested Option Merger Consideration will be subject to applicable Tax
withholding in accordance with the procedures implemented by Parent in its
reasonable discretion. To the extent necessary to comply with applicable Law,
Parent may limit the sale of transfer of any shares of Parent Common Stock
paid pursuant to any Vested Option Merger Consideration or earned Unvested
Option Merger Consideration.

 

(iv) Prior to the Effective Time, and subject to the review and approval of
Parent, the Company shall take all actions necessary to effect the
transactions contemplated by this Section 2.7(f) under the Plan, and all
Company Option agreements and any other applicable plan or arrangement of the
Company (whether written or oral, formal or informal), including adopting
all resolutions, giving all requisite notices and obtaining appropriate
consents from each holder of Company Options. Materials to be submitted to the
holders of Company Options in connection with any notice required under this
Section 2.7(f) shall be subject to review and approval by Parent.

 



-21- (g) _Treatment of Company Warrants_. No outstanding Company Warrants, if any,
shall be assumed by Parent, and the Company shall cause each such Company
Warrant to be either (i) exercised by the holder of such Company Warrant in
full prior to the Effective Time; or (ii) to the extent not exercised in full,
terminated, cancelled and automatically converted into (A) the right to
receive a number of shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest
whole share of Parent Common Stock) equal to (1) the product of (x) the total
number of shares of Company Common Stock (after giving effect to the
conversion of Company Preferred Stock into Company Common Stock, if
applicable) subject to such Company Warrant; multiplied by (y) the excess of
(a) the Per Share Closing Merger Consideration Value; over (b) the exercise
price per share of such Company Warrant; divided by (2) the Closing Price; and
(B) the right to receive payment of a portion of the Earnout Consideration as
provided in Section 2.16, with the amount of any such payment to be
determined based on the total number of shares of Company Common Stock (after
giving effect to the conversion of Company Preferred Stock into Company Common
Stock, if applicable) subject to such Company Warrant.

(h) _Tax Consequences_. The Merger is intended to qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1) of the Code, and
this Agreement is intended to constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the
meaning of Treasury Regulations Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent makes no representation or warranty to
the Company or to any Company Stockholder regarding the Tax treatment of the
Merger, or any of the Tax consequences to the Company or any Company
Stockholder of this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions or
agreements contemplated hereby. The Company, on behalf of itself and the
Company Stockholders, acknowledges that it and they are relying solely on
their respective Tax advisors in connection with this Agreement, the Merger
and the other transactions and agreements contemplated hereby.

(i) _Withholding of Taxes_. The Company, Parent, the Interim
Surviving Entity, the Final Surviving Entity and the Escrow Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder or former holder of Company Capital Stock, a Company
Option or a Company Warrant such amounts as may be required to be deducted or
withheld therefrom under any provision of U.S. federal, state, local or
non-U.S. tax law or under any applicable legal requirement and to be provided
with any necessary Tax forms, including Form W-9 or the appropriate series of
Form W-8, as applicable, or any similar information. To the extent that such
amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate
Governmental Entity, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes as
having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been
paid. To the extent that any payment pursuant to this Agreement is not reduced
by such deductions or withholdings, such recipient shall indemnify Parent and
its Affiliates (including the Interim Surviving Entity and the Final
Surviving Entity) for any amounts imposed by any taxing authority with respect
to any payments made to such recipient pursuant to this Agreement, together
with any costs and expenses related thereto (including reasonable attorneys
fees and costs of investigation); _provided_ , _however_ , that such recipient
shall not be required to indemnify Parent and its Affiliates (including the
Interim Surviving Entity and the Final Surviving Entity) for any cost or
expense attributable to the gross negligence or intentional misconduct of
Parent or its Affiliates.

(j)  _Fractional Shares_. No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will
be issued by virtue of the First Step Merger, but in lieu thereof, each
Company Securityholder that would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a
share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock that otherwise would be received by such holder) shall,
upon surrender of such holders Company Stock Certificate(s), or in the case
of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit
(and bond, if required) in the manner provided in Section 2.14, receive from
Parent an amount of cash (rounded up to the nearest whole cent), without
interest, less the amount of any withholding Taxes as contemplated by Section
2.7(g) that are required to be withheld with respect thereto, equal to the
product of: (i) such fraction multiplied by (ii) the Closing Price.

 



-22- (k) _Stock Threshold_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, to the extent that the sum of (i) the aggregate number of shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable in the First Step Merger plus (ii) the maximum
number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of all
Company Options assumed or exchanged in connection with the Merger would be
equal to or greater than 19.9% of the shares of Parent Common Stock
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, then Parent shall
be permitted to elect to make cash payments for Company Options that would
otherwise be assumed or exchanged.

2.8 _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) _No Conversion_. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to
the contrary, any shares of Company Capital Stock held by a Company
Stockholder who has duly perfected dissenters rights under applicable Law
(any such shares, the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or
represent a right to receive the applicable amount of consideration under
this Agreement for such Company Stockholders shares of Company Capital Stock
set forth in Section 2.7, but in lieu thereof, such Company Stockholder shall
be entitled to such rights as are provided by applicable Law.

 

(b) _Loss of Dissenters  Rights_. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section
2.8(a), if any holder of Dissenting Shares shall effectively withdraw or lose
(through failure to perfect or otherwise) such holders dissenters rights
under applicable Law, then, as of the later of the Effective Time and the
occurrence of such event, such holders shares shall automatically be
converted into and represent only the right to receive, upon surrender of the
certificate representing such shares in accordance with the terms of Section
2.10, (i) the Per Share Closing Merger Consideration; and (ii) a portion of
the Earnout Consideration as set forth in Section 2.16, when and if paid.

submitted to Parent in advance and shall not be presented to any Company
Stockholder prior to the Company receiving Parents consent. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, to the extent that Parent, the
Interim Surviving Entity, the Final Surviving Entity or the Company (i) makes
any payment or payments in respect of any Dissenting Shares in excess of the
amounts that would otherwise would have been payable in respect of such
shares in accordance with this Agreement; or (ii) incurs any Losses (including
reasonable attorneys and consultants fees and out-of-pocket costs and
expenses and including any such fees, costs and expenses incurred in
connection with investigating, defending against or settling any action or
proceeding) in respect of any Dissenting Shares (excluding payments for such
shares) ((i) and (ii) together, "Dissenting Share Payments"), then Parent
shall be entitled to recover, under the terms of Article VIII, the amount of
such Dissenting Share Payments.

 

2.9 _Working Capital Adjustment_.

 

(a) _Calculation of Estimated Closing Net Working Capital_. At least five
Business Days prior to the close of business on the Closing Date, the Company
shall prepare and deliver to Parent a draft of an estimated unaudited
consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the close

Statement shall fairly and accurately present the Companys good faith best
estimate (based on reasonable assumptions) of the Closing Net Working Capital
without giving effect to the consummation of the First Step Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The estimated Closing Net
Working Capital set forth in the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital

Capital."

 

(b) _Calculation of Actual Closing Net Working Capital_.

 

(i) Within 60 days following the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare (or cause
to be prepared) and deliver to the Securityholder Representative a statement
setting forth Parents calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital (the
"Actual Closing Net Working Capital Statement"). If Parent does not deliver
the Actual Closing Net Working Capital Statement within such time period,
then for all purposes of and under this Agreement the term "Actual Closing Net
Working Capital" shall mean the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital set
forth in the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital Statement delivered by the
Company pursuant to Section 2.9(a).

(ii) The Securityholder Representative may dispute any item or amount
set forth in the Actual Closing Net Working Capital Statement within 30 days
following receipt of the Actual Closing Net Working Capital Statement by
delivering to Parent a written notice of such dispute (a "Notice of Dispute")
setting forth, in reasonable detail and to the extent practicable, (A) each
item or amount so disputed by the Securityholder Representative; (B) the
Securityholder Representatives calculation of each such disputed item or
amount; and (C) the Securityholder Representatives calculation of the
Closing Net Working Capital of the Company after giving effect to the
Securityholder Representatives calculation of each such disputed item or
amount.

 

(iii) If Parent does not receive a Notice of Dispute from the Securityholder
Representative delivered pursuant to and in accordance with Section
2.9(b)(ii) within the time period set forth therein, then (A) the
Securityholder Representative shall be deemed to have irrevocably consented
and agreed to each item and amount set forth in the Actual Closing Net Working
Capital Statement delivered by Parent pursuant to Section 2.9(b)(i); and (B)
for all purposes of and under this Agreement, the term "Actual Closing Net
Working Capital" shall mean the Closing Net Working Capital as set forth
in the Actual Closing Net Working Capital Statement delivered by Parent
pursuant to Section 2.9(b)(i). If Parent receives a Notice of Dispute from the
Securityholder Representative delivered pursuant to and in accordance
with Section 2.9(b)(ii) within the time period set forth therein, then Parent
and the Securityholder Representative shall use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to resolve all disputed items and amounts set forth in the
Notice of Dispute pursuant to good faith negotiations. In the event that
Parent and the Securityholder Representative shall reach agreement within 30
days following Parents receipt of a Notice of Dispute on all disputed items
and amounts set forth in such Notice of Dispute, then for all purposes of and
under this Agreement, the term "Actual Closing Net Working Capital" shall mean
the Closing Net Working Capital as agreed upon by Parent and the
Securityholder Representative in writing, and any such resolution shall be
final and binding on the parties hereto for the purposes of this Section
2.9(b) and Article VIII. In the event that Parent and the Securityholder
Representative are unable to reach agreement within 30 days following
Parents receipt of a Notice of Dispute on all of the disputed items or
amounts set forth in a Notice of Dispute, then the following shall occur:

 

(A) Parent and the Securityholder Representative shall execute a memorandum
(the "Working Capital Memorandum") setting forth (1) the resolved items or
amounts, if any; and (2) the items or amounts that remain in dispute following
such good faith negotiations.

 



-24- (B) At the request of either Parent or the Securityholder Representative,
Parent and the Securityholder Representative shall submit all remaining
disputed items and amounts set forth in the Working Capital Memorandum to
Grant Thornton LLP or, if such firm refuses such assignment, to a nationally
recognized accounting firm that has not performed work for, and is otherwise
independent of, each of Parent, the Company and the Securityholder
Representative and that is reasonably acceptable to Parent and the
Securityholder Representative (the "Independent Accounting Firm") for
resolution in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof. Each of the
parties to this Agreement shall, and shall cause their respective affiliates
and representatives to, provide full cooperation to the
Independent Accounting Firm, including providing the Independent Accounting
Firm with all relevant information, books and records and any work papers
relating to the disputed items and amounts and all other items reasonably
requested by the Independent Accounting Firm. The Independent Accounting Firm

Representative; (3) be instructed to reach its conclusions regarding any such
dispute within 30 days after its appointment and provide a written explanation
of its decision; and (4) not (x) determine any liability claimed by the

than that claimed by such party; or (y) determine any asset claimed by the
Securityholder Representative or liability claimed by Parent in an amount in
excess of the amount claimed by such party except, in the case of each of (x)
and (y), as may be necessary to make a corresponding adjustment to a disputed
item in accordance with GAAP. All expenses relating to the engagement of
the Independent Accounting Firm shall be shared equally by Parent and the
Securityholder Representative (for and on behalf of the Company
Securityholders). The Independent Accounting Firm shall determine all disputed
items and amounts and its decision in respect thereof shall be final and
binding upon Parent and the Securityholder Representative.

(iv) Except as set forth in Section 2.9(b)(i) or Section 2.9(b)(iii), for all
purposes of this Agreement, the term "Actual Closing Net Working Capital"
shall mean the Closing Net Working Capital based upon (A) all amounts agreed
upon by Parent and the Securityholder Representative in respect of any
disputed items or amounts, as set forth in the Working Capital Memorandum; and
(B) all other amounts determined by the Independent Accounting Firm pursuant
to Section 2.9(b)(iii)(B). 

(v) During the period of time from and after the date of the delivery of the
Actual Closing Net Working Capital Statement to the Securityholder
Representative until the Final Adjusted Closing Merger Consideration Amount
has been finally determined, Parent shall provide the Securityholder
Representative and his, her or its representatives (including accountants and
counsel) (subject to the execution and delivery of a confidentiality
agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent) with
reasonable access during normal business hours to the books and records of the
Interim Surviving Entity, the Final Surviving Entity and the working papers
used by Parent (or accountants and counsel retained by it), and access to such
personnel or representatives of Parent, the Interim Surviving Entity or the
Final Surviving Entity as the Securityholder Representative may reasonably
require for the purposes of review of, resolving any dispute related to or
responding to any matters or inquiries concerning Parents calculation of the
Closing Net Working Capital, the Actual Closing Net Working Capital Statement
and the preparation of any Notice of Dispute, and Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to respond to inquiries from the

Statement.

(a) _Escrow Amount Deposit_. Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent
shall deposit the Escrow Amount, out of the Closing Merger Consideration
deliverable pursuant to Section 2.7, with the Escrow Agent. Parent shall be
deemed to have contributed with the Escrow Agent, on behalf of each Company
Securityholder, such Company Securityholders Pro Rata Portion of the Escrow
Amount.

 



-25- (b) _Closing Payments_.

 

(i) Promptly following the Closing Date, but in no event later than four
Business Days after the Closing Date, Parent or its agent shall mail a letter
of transmittal in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit F (the
"Letter of Transmittal") to each Company Stockholder at the address set forth
opposite each such Company Stockholders name on the Spreadsheet. 

(ii) Upon surrender of a certificate that formerly represented shares of
Company Capital Stock (the "Company Stock Certificates") for cancellation to
Parent or its agent, together with the Letter of Transmittal, Form W-9 or the
appropriate series of Form W-8 and any other instruments that Parent or its
agent reasonably requests (the "Exchange Documents"), duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of
such Company Stock Certificate shall be entitled to receive from Parent or its
agent in exchange therefor that portion of the Closing Merger Consideration
into which the shares of Company Capital Stock represented by such Company
Stock Certificate have been converted pursuant to Section 2.7 (determined,
solely for purposes of this Section 2.10(b), as if the Final Adjusted Closing
Merger Consideration Amount required to determine the Closing Merger
Consideration in accordance with the definition thereof was the Estimated
Adjusted Closing Merger Consideration Amount), less such Company Stockholders
Pro Rata Portion of the Escrow Amount contributed with the Escrow Agent
pursuant to Section 2.10(a). Parent or its agent shall deliver such
consideration (which, for the avoidance of doubt, may be delivered in a book-
entry or similar position through The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation
or any other depository or similar functionary, credited to an account for the
benefit of such Company Stockholder) specified in the preceding sentence to
such Company Stockholder. Upon the surrender of any such Company Stock
Certificate, the Company Stock Certificate so surrendered shall thereupon be
cancelled. Until so surrendered, each Company Stock Certificate outstanding
after the Effective Time will be deemed, for all corporate purposes
thereafter, to evidence only the right to receive the portion of the Merger
Consideration into which such shares of Company Capital Stock shall have been
converted pursuant to Section 2.7 plus the right to receive a portion of the
Earnout Consideration as set forth in Section 2.16, when and if paid.

(c) Promptly following the determination of the Final Adjusted Closing Merger
Consideration Amount, in the event that the Final Adjusted Closing Merger
Consideration Amount is (i) less than the Estimated Adjusted Closing Merger
Consideration Amount (such difference, the "Shortfall Amount"), Parent and
the Securityholder Representative shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to
promptly release from the Escrow Fund and deliver to Parent such number of
shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole share) as is
equal to the Shortfall Amount divided by the Closing Price; or (ii) greater
than the Estimated Adjusted Closing Merger Consideration Amount (such excess,
the "Excess Amount"), Parent or its agent shall deliver to the Company
Securityholders, in accordance with their respective pro rata portion (based
on the number of Company Securities held by such Company Securityholder as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time over the Total Outstanding Shares),
an aggregate amount of shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the
nearest whole share) valued at the Closing Price or cash (at Parents sole
discretion) equal to the Excess Amount.

 

2.11 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock_. All consideration
paid in respect of the surrender for exchange of shares of Company Capital
Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to be full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Capital Stock,
and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the
Interim Surviving Entity of shares of Company Capital Stock which were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Company Stock Certificates are presented to the Interim Surviving Entity
or the Final Surviving Entity for any reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this Article II.

 



-26- 2.12 _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, none of Parent, Merger Subs, the Interim Surviving Entity, the
Final Surviving Entity or any party hereto shall be liable to a holder of any
shares of Company Capital Stock for any shares transferred or amounts paid to
a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law. At any time following the last day of the twelve month period
following the Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to require its agent to
deliver to Parent or its designated successor or assign any amounts payable
under this Agreement that has been deposited with such agent pursuant to this
Agreement and not disbursed pursuant to Section 2.7, and thereafter the
Company Securityholders shall be entitled to look only to Parent (subject to
the terms of Section 2.7) as general creditors thereof with respect to any
shares of Parent Common Stock and cash amounts that may be payable to such
Persons pursuant to Section 2.7 or Section 2.10. No interest shall be payable
for the cash amounts delivered to Parent pursuant to the provisions of this
Section 2.12 and that are subsequently delivered to the Company
Securityholders.

 

2.13 _Transfers of Ownership_. If any payments are to be made to a Person
other than the Person whose name is reflected on the Company Stock
Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor, it will be a condition of the
issuance or delivery thereof that the certificate so surrendered will be
properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the
Person requesting such exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent
designated by it any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment
of any portion of the amounts payable under this Agreement in any name other
than that of the registered holder of the certificate surrendered, or
established to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it that
such tax has been paid or is not payable.

 

2.14 _Surrender of Company Stock Certificates; Lost, Stolen or Destroyed
Company Stock Certificates_. No portion of the amounts payable under this
Agreement shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock
Certificate with respect to shares of Company Capital Stock formerly
represented thereby until the holder of record of such Company Stock
Certificate shall have surrendered such Company Stock Certificate and the
Exchange Documents pursuant hereto. In the event that any Company Stock
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent or its agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such amount, if
any, as may be required pursuant to Section 2.7; _provided, however_ , that
Parent or its agent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to
the issuance thereof, require the Person who is the owner of such lost, stolen
or destroyed certificates to either (a) deliver a bond in such amount as it
may reasonably direct (not to exceed 2.25% of the value of the aggregate Per
Share Closing Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares
represented by such Company Stock Certificate); or (b) provide an
indemnification agreement in a form and substance acceptable to Parent or its
agent against any Claim that may be made against Parent or its agent with
respect to the certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

2.15  _Additional Adjustments to Merger Consideration_. The applicable
portion of the amounts payable to holders of Company Capital Stock hereunder,
and any other applicable numbers or amounts, shall be adjusted to reflect
appropriately the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible
into Company Capital Stock), reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification or other like change with respect to Company Capital Stock
occurring or having a record date on or after the date of this Agreement and
prior to the Effective Time.

2.16  _Earnout_.

(a) _General Acknowledgement_. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that
the Companys projected manufacturing capability was a material factor in
determining the valuation of the Company by Parent. As a result,
notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, except as
specifically provided in this Agreement, Parent shall pay to the Company
Stockholders, the holders of Company Warrants, the holders of Vested Company
Options and, as applicable, the holders of Unvested Company Options, in each
case as of immediately prior the Effective Time, the Earnout Consideration,
if any, in accordance with this Section 2.16.

Company Stockholders, the holders of Company Warrants, the holders of Vested
Company Options and, as applicable, the holders of Unvested Company Options,
in each case as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be entitled to
receive an aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the
quotient obtained by dividing (A) 33.33% of the Earnout Consideration Amount;
by (B) the applicable Earnout Closing Price (such number of shares of Parent
Common Stock, the "First Earnout Amount"), with (x) each Company Stockholder
being entitled to receive an amount of shares of Parent Common Stock from the
First Earnout Amount (rounded down to the nearest whole share of Parent Common
Stock) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the applicable Per
Share Earnout Consideration; by (2) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock held by such Company Stockholder immediately prior to the Effective
Time; (y) each holder of Company Warrants being entitled to receive an amount
of shares of Parent Common Stock from the First Earnout Amount (rounded down

multiplied by (B) the Per Share Earnout Consideration. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if a Funding Event has not occurred prior to January 1, 2016, then
such percentage in Section 2.16(b)(i)(A) shall be 50% rather than 33.33%.

(ii) If, during any fiscal quarter prior to or including the fiscal quarter
ending December 31, 2016 (the "Second Earnout"), the Company manufactures at
least 50 megawatts of Qualified Panels with an average Fully Loaded Cost of

(A) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Option that were issuable upon exercise of such Company Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time; multiplied by (B) the Per Share Earnout
Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Funding Event has not
occurred prior to January 1, 2016, then such percentage in Section

Amount; by (2) the applicable Earnout Closing Price (such number of shares of
Parent Common Stock, the "Third Earnout Amount"), with (x) each Company
Stockholder being entitled to receive an amount of shares of Parent Common
Stock from the Third Earnout Amount (rounded down to the nearest whole share

to be delivered, to the Securityholder Representative a memorandum (the
"Earnout Notice") specifying in reasonable detail the Final Surviving Entitys
manufacturing production and the average Fully Loaded Cost of production for
the prior fiscal quarter. If a portion of the Earnout Consideration is payable
in respect of such prior fiscal quarter (such portion, an "Earnout Payment"),
then the applicable Earnout Notice shall also include the calculation of the
aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock payable in respect of such
Earnout Payment valued at the applicable Earnout Closing Price.

 

(iii) The Securityholder Representative shall have 15 days to make an
objection in writing to any item in the Earnout Notice, and that objection
must be delivered to Parent prior to the expiration of such 15 day period. If
no such objection is delivered to Parent within such 15 day period, then the
applicable Earnout Notice shall become final and binding on Parent, the
Company Securityholders and the Securityholder Representative.

 



-29- (iv) At any time following delivery of an objection pursuant to Section
2.16(c)(iii), either Parent or the Securityholder Representative may elect to
resolve any dispute regarding the Earnout Notice in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Section 8.4(d).

 

(v) Promptly following the resolution of any objections to an Earnout Notice
that includes an Earnout Payment, Parent shall distribute (or cause its agent
to distribute) such Earnout Payment to the applicable Company Securityholders.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any portion of the Earnout Payment payable to
holders of Unvested Company Options will be paid to the holder in
accordance with the vesting schedule applicable to the Unvested Company
Option prior to the Effective Time, subject to the satisfaction of any vesting
conditions (including continued service) that applied to the Unvested Company
Option prior to the Effective Time.

(vi) Notwithstanding Section 2.16(c)(v), if Parent delivers an Earnout Notice
stating that an Earnout Payment is payable and Parent has a claim outstanding
for Excess Losses that have not yet been paid, then Parent shall distribute
(or cause its agent to distribute) the portion, if any, of such Earnout
Payment that is in excess of such claimed and unpaid Excess Losses to the
Company Securityholders, and that portion of such Earnout Payment that is
equal to such claimed and unpaid Excess Losses may be retained by Parent. Upon
final resolution of such claim, then any such amount in dispute shall either
be (A) distributed to the Company Securityholders; or (B) permanently
retained by Parent in accordance with such resolution.

 

(vii) If (A) prior to January 1, 2016, an Earnout Payment is made in respect
of the First Earnout, the Second Earnout or both and (B) a Funding Event has
not occurred prior to January 1, 2016, then the percentage used in the
calculation of the First Earnout Amount, the Second Earnout Amount or both
will be adjusted to 50% (rather than 33.33%) and Parent shall promptly
distribute (or cause its agent to distribute) the appropriate amount of
additional shares of Parent Common Stock, valued as of the First Earnout or
the Second Earnout, as applicable (with all such payments rounded down to the
nearest share of Parent Common Stock).

(viii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.16, Parent
will be permitted, in its sole discretion, to satisfy any Earnout Payment in
cash (based on the applicable Earnout Closing Price) rather than shares of
Parent Common Stock; _provided_ , _however_ , that the total amount of Parent
Common Stock paid to the Company Securityholders pursuant to this Agreement
shall equal at least 40% of the total consideration paid to the Company
Securityholders pursuant to this Agreement, calculated, for this purpose,
based on the fair market value of any shares of Parent Common Stock included
in each payment of consideration determined by averaging the high and low
sales prices for a share of Parent Common Stock on the payment date.

 

(d) _Earnout Rights Not Transferable_. No Company Securityholder may sell,
exchange, transfer or otherwise dispose of his, her or its right to receive
any portion of the Earnout Consideration, other than by operation of law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any Company Securityholders who are investment
funds may transfer (through a book entry system maintained by or on behalf of
Parent in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 5f.103-1(c)) all or any
portion of their right to receive the Earnout Consideration to any investment
funds that are under the control of the same management company
after providing written notice to Parent at least five days prior to making
such transfer.

(e) _Earnout Protections_.

 

(i) Except as otherwise permitted by this Section 2.16(e), Parent will not
take any action the principal purpose of which is to circumvent or adversely
affect the Companys ability to achieve the milestones required for the
Earnout Consideration to be delivered; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parents
obligation under this Section 2.16(e)(i) shall be subject in all respects to
the prudent business judgment of Parents board of directors or management in
connection with the business and operations of

 



-30-  Parent and its Subsidiaries (including the Interim Surviving Entity and the
Final Surviving Entity), taken as a whole, and nothing in this Agreement shall
obligate Parent to (A) operate the Interim Surviving Entity or the Final
Surviving Entity as a separate business; or (B) make any investments in any of
the Companys operations in China.

 

(ii) Parent shall fund the operations of the Final Surviving Entity (or the
Interim Surviving Entity, as applicable) in a manner that is materially
consistent with the annual operating plan in the form provided to Parent by
the Company and attached to Schedule 2.16 (the "Operating Plan"), with such
changes as may be agreed upon by Parent and the management of the Final
Surviving Entity (or the Interim Surviving Entity, as applicable), with the
affirmative consent of Zheng Xu or, if he is no longer an employee of Parent
or one of its Subsidiaries, another person that was a current employee of the
Company on the Closing (Mr. Xu or such other employee, the "Management
Representative"), which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

 

(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary in the
Operating Plan, it is understood and agreed that Parent shall have the right
to cease or reduce funding the operations other than ordinary course operating
expenses) of the Final Surviving Entity (or the Interim Surviving Entity, as
applicable) at any time if, in Parents prudent and reasonable business
judgment, (A) the aggregate costs of the Companys operations are more than
15% above the Operating Plan (as may be modified pursuant to Section
2.16(e)(ii)) for a particular fiscal quarter as of the end of such fiscal
quarter (other than the first fiscal quarter following the Closing); (B)
construction of the New York Manufacturing Facility or the Second Line is
delayed by two or more quarters from that contemplated by the Operating Plan
(as may be modified pursuant to Section 2.16(e)(ii)); (C) the funding
contemplated by the New York Facility Agreement is not received; or (D) it is
appropriate to do so to respond to Business Conditions. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Section 2.16, if the First Earnout is not
achieved and Parent reasonably determines in good faith that the Second
Earnout is not likely to be achieved, then Parent shall have no obligation to
provide any additional funding to the Final Surviving Entity (or the Interim
Surviving Entity, as applicable).

(iv) Parent and the Securityholder Representative will reasonably cooperate
to adjust the cost targets in Section 2.16(b) as necessary to minimize the
effect of any increases in the market spot price for polysilicon and for any
cost increases caused by Parents requirement that the Final Surviving
Entity (or the Interim Surviving Entity, as applicable) change its
manufacturing processes or procedures (including any requirement that the
Final Surviving Entity (or the Interim Surviving Entity, as applicable) use
Parents Zep system or develop Zep panels).

(v) In the event that the construction of the Second Line is delayed as a
result of any war, invasion, act of foreign enemies, hostilities (regardless
of whether war is declared), civil war, rebellion, revolution, insurrection,
military or usurped power or confiscation, terrorist activities,
nationalization, government sanction, embargo or natural disaster, then the
parties will cooperate to extend the deadlines associated with the First
Earnout, the Second Earnout and the Third Earnout to account for any delays
caused by such event, and the date of January 1, 2016 as it appears in this
Section 2.16 will be changed to the date of determination of the Third
Earnout, after giving effect to such extension.

(vi) Parent is entitled, in its sole discretion, to elect to delay the
funding and construction of the Second Line by not more than six months, in
which case the parties will cooperate to extend the deadlines associated with
the First Earnout, the Second Earnout and the Third Earnout to account for
such delay (on at least a day-for-day basis), and the date of January 1, 2016
as it appears in this Section 2.16 will also be adjusted to account for such
delay (on at least a day-for-day basis).

 

(vii) If Parent decides to expand the size of the New York Manufacturing
Facility (it being acknowledged that it is the intention of the parties to
build a facility with the capacity to produce at least 1 gigawatt of Qualified
Panels annually), then Parent, the Securityholder Representative and the

 



-31-  Management Representative will cooperate to make commensurate changes to the
milestones and scope of the First Earnout, the Second Earnout and the Third
Earnout, as well as the Fully Loaded Cost amounts set forth on Schedule 2.16.
If Parent, the Securityholder Representative and the Management Representative
are unable to agree on such commensurate changes, then any party may initiate
mediation of the dispute with the assistance of a neutral arbitrator
belonging to and under the rules of the CPR Institute for Dispute Resolution.
The party requesting the mediation shall arrange for mediation services,
subject to the approval of the other parties, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Mediation shall take place in
Santa Clara County, California during reasonable business hours and upon
reasonable advance notice. Mediation may be scheduled to begin at any time,
but with at least 10 Business Days written notice to all parties. If one
party initiates mediation, then all parties (A) shall participate in the
mediation in good faith and shall devote reasonable time and energy to the
mediation so as to promptly resolve the dispute or conclude that they cannot
resolve the dispute; and (B) shall not pursue other remedies while such
mediation is proceeding. The mediator shall also make a determination as how
the costs of the mediation should be allocated between Parent, on the one
hand, and the Securityholder Representative and the Management Representative
(in each case, on behalf of the Company Securityholders), on the other hand.
If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation (and, if
applicable, mediation) after a reasonable period of time, then any party may
demand arbitration of the differences between the parties related to this
Section 2.16(e)(vii), and the final changes to the milestones and scope of the
First Earnout, the Second Earnout and the Third Earnout, as well as the Fully
Loaded Cost amounts set forth on Schedule 2.16 will be determined by binding
arbitration. Arbitration shall take place in Santa Clara County, California in
accordance with the then-current Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
Arbitration Association and judgment upon the award rendered may be entered in
any court having jurisdiction thereof. Such arbitration shall be conducted by
a single arbitrator chosen by mutual agreement of Parent, the Securityholder
Representative and the Management Representative. Alternatively, at the
request of any party before the commencement of arbitration, the arbitration
shall be conducted by three independent arbitrators, none of whom shall have
any competitive interests with Parent the Securityholder Representative and
the Management Representative. Parent, on the one hand, and the Securityholder
Representative and the Management Representative, on the other hand, shall
each select one arbitrator. The two arbitrators so selected shall select a
third arbitrator. In any such arbitration, each party shall be limited to
calling a total of three witnesses, both for purposes of deposition and the
arbitration hearing. Subject to the foregoing limitation on the number of
witnesses, the arbitrator or arbitrators, as the case may be, shall set a
limited time period and establish procedures designed to reduce the cost and
time for discovery while allowing the parties an opportunity, adequate in the
sole judgment of the arbitrator or majority of the three arbitrators, as the
case may be, to discover relevant information from the opposing parties about
the subject matter of the dispute. The arbitrator, or a majority of the three
arbitrators, as the case may be, shall rule upon motions to compel or limit
discovery and shall have the authority to impose sanctions for discovery
abuses, including attorneys fees and costs, to the same extent as a
competent court of law or equity should the arbitrators or a majority of the
three arbitrators, as the case may be, determine that discovery was sought
without substantial justification or that discovery was refused or objected to
without substantial justification. The decision of the arbitrator or a
majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be, as to the changes to
the milestones and scope of the First Earnout, the Second Earnout and the
Third Earnout, as well as the Fully Loaded Cost amounts set forth on Schedule
2.16, shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the parties to this
Agreement and the Company Securityholders, and, if necessary, may be enforced
in any court having competent jurisdiction by suit on the decision or in any
other matter provided by applicable Law. Such decision shall be written and
shall be supported by written findings of fact and conclusions that shall set
forth the determination of the arbitrator(s). The arbitrator(s) shall also
make a determination as how the costs of the arbitration should be allocated
between Parent, on the one hand, and the Securityholder Representative and the
Management Representative (in each case, on behalf of the Company
Securityholders), on the other hand, and each party waives its right to seek
an order compelling the other party to pay its portion of its costs and
expenses (including attorneys fees) for any arbitration.

unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the assets of the Company and
its Subsidiaries. The Company has made available to Parent the most recent
management representations

 



-37-  letter delivered by the Company Auditors to the Company. Neither the Company
(including any Employee) nor the Company Auditors has identified or been made
aware of any (1) significant deficiency or material weakness in the system of
internal accounting controls utilized by the Company; (2) fraud, whether or
not material, that involves the Company management or other Employees who have
a role in the preparation of financial statements or the internal accounting
controls utilized by the Company; or (3) Claim or allegation regarding any of
the foregoing.

the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to be material to the Company
or its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (c) Liabilities that have arisen in
connection with this Agreement and any Related Agreements or the actions
contemplated to be taken hereby and thereby; (d) that have arisen in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and are reflected as
current liabilities in the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital Statement;
or (e) executory obligations arising in connection with the performance of any
Material Contract.

 

3.8 _No Changes_. Since December 31, 2013, the Company and its Subsidiaries

the Current Balance Sheet or with respect to Liabilities incurred in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since the Balance
Sheet Date;

(d) destruction of, damage to, or loss of any material tangible assets of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (whether or not covered by insurance), or

individual, Governmental Entity, works council, employee or

the Company on the Real Property nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, such
Real Property, including the improvements thereon, violate any applicable
building code, zoning requirement, ordinance, rule, regulation or statute
relating to such Real Property or operations thereon, and any such non-

Patent and Trademark Office (the "PTO") or equivalent authority anywhere in
the world) related thereto (other than regular proceedings associated with the
prosecution of such items); (iv) the names of any other person having an
ownership interest in such item; and (v) any action that must be taken within
120 days following the date of this Agreement (including the payment of any

documents, applications or certificates) for the purposes of obtaining,
maintaining, perfecting, preserving or renewing any Registered Intellectual
Property. Each item of Company Registered Intellectual Property is currently
in compliance with all formal legal requirements (including payment of filing,
examination and maintenance fees, proofs of use, and recordations of
assignments) and, to the extent issued, is, to the Knowledge of the Company,
subsisting, valid and enforceable. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries have taken or failed to take any action (including failure to
disclose any information) that would limit the validity, scope or
enforceability of any Patents that are Company Intellectual Property. All
necessary documents and certificates currently due for filing as of the date
of this Agreement in connection with such Company Registered Intellectual
Property have been filed with the relevant patent, copyright, trademark or
other Governmental Entities in the United States or foreign jurisdictions, as
the case may be, for the purposes of maintaining such Registered Intellectual
Property. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has claimed "small

Intellectual Property.

(c) _Patents_. All Patents included in the Company Registered Intellectual
Property (i) have been prosecuted in good faith; (ii) are not subject to any

respect to such Patents and have made no intentional misrepresentations in
connection with the prosecution or maintenance of such Patents.

licensable by the Company or Parent free and clear of all Liens and without
restriction and without payment of any kind to any third Person.

 

(e) _Exclusive Ownership_. The Company and its Subsidiaries exclusively own,
and, following the Closing, Parent and its Subsidiaries will exclusively own,
all right, title and interest to all Company Intellectual Property, including
all Company Registered Intellectual Property and Trade Secrets, free and clear
of any Liens, except for Permitted Liens. To the extent that any Intellectual
Property has been developed, supported or created independently or jointly by
any Person other than the Company or its Subsidiaries for which the Company or
such Subsidiary has, directly or indirectly, provided consideration for
such development or creation, the Company or such Subsidiary has a written
agreement with such Person with respect thereto, and the Company or such
Subsidiary thereby has obtained a valid and enforceable assignment sufficient
to transfer all right, title and ownership (including the right to seek past
and future damages) of, and is the exclusive owner of, all such Intellectual
Property Rights therein by operation of law or by valid assignment, and has
obtained the waiver of all non-assignable rights, including all Moral Rights,
as applicable. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has (i) granted
any exclusive license of or exclusive right to use, or authorized the
retention of any exclusive rights to use or joint ownership of, any Company
Intellectual Property to any other Person; or (ii) permitted its rights in any
Intellectual Property Right that is or was Company Intellectual Property to
lapse or enter into the public domain, except as a result of its exercise of
reasonable business judgment. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has, in the past 24 months, transferred sole or joint ownership of any
Intellectual Property Right that is or was Company Intellectual Property to
any other Person. 

 



-46- (f) _Validity and Enforceability_. To the Knowledge of the Company, there are
no legal opinions to the effect that any of the subject matters of the
Company Intellectual Property may be or are invalid or unenforceable, or
official actions or other notices from any Governmental Entity that any of the
subject matters or claims of pending applications for registration
constituting any of such Company Intellectual Property are unregistrable
(other than ordinary course proceedings associated with the prosecution of
such items). No Company Intellectual Property or Company Product is subject
to any proceeding or outstanding decree, order, judgment or settlement
agreement or stipulation that restricts in any manner the use, provision,
transfer, assignment or licensing thereof by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or that may affect the validity, use or enforceability of such
Company Intellectual Property.

export, branding, advertising, promotion, marketing, manufacture and sale of
any Company Product: (i) has not and does not infringe or misappropriate any
Intellectual Property Rights of any Person; and (ii) will not infringe or
misappropriate, to the extent conducted by Parent or its Affiliates following
the Closing in the same manner as currently conducted or currently proposed by
the Company to be conducted (including pursuant to the Operating Plan),
any Intellectual Property Rights of any Person that exist on or prior to the
Closing (including any Patents that first issue after the Closing from pending
applications that exist on or prior to the Closing). The operation of the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, including the design,
development, use, import, export, branding, advertising, promotion, marketing,
manufacture and sale of any Company Product, has not violated and will not, to
the extent conducted by Parent or its Affiliates following the Closing in the
same manner as currently conducted or currently proposed by the Company to be
conducted (including pursuant to the Operating Plan), violate any right of any
Person (including any right to privacy or publicity) or constitute unfair
competition or trade practices under the laws of any jurisdiction. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries have received notice from any Person
claiming that such operation or any act, Company Product or
Intellectual Property of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries conflicts
with, infringes or misappropriates any Intellectual Property Rights of any
Person or constitutes unfair competition or trade practices under the laws of
any jurisdiction (nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, is there any basis
therefor). The Company and its Subsidiaries have not obtained or sought any
studies, reports or analyses with respect to actual or potential Patent
coverage, freedom to operate, Patent infringement or otherwise with respect
to any Patents of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any third Person,
including opinions of counsel or reports of other advisors.

 

(i) _Non-Infringement of Company IP_. To the Knowledge of the Company, no
Person is infringing or misappropriating any material Company Intellectual
Property. The Company or one of its Subsidiaries has the exclusive right to
bring actions against any Person that is infringing any Company Intellectual
Property and to retain for itself any damages recovered in any such action.

 

(j) _Effects of the Transaction_. Neither this Agreement, the Merger nor any
of the other transactions contemplated hereby, including the assignment to
Parent by operation of law or otherwise of any Contracts to which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, will result in Parent or any of its

 



-47-  Affiliates (i) granting to any third Person any right to or with respect to
any Intellectual Property Rights owned by, or licensed to, any of them; (ii)
being bound by, or subject to, any non-compete or other material restriction
on the operation or scope of their respective businesses; or (iii) being
obligated to pay any royalties or other material amounts, or offer any
discounts, to any third Person in excess of those payable by, or required to
be offered by, any of them, respectively, in the absence of this Agreement,
the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(k) _Employee Invention Assignment Agreements_. The Company and its
Subsidiaries have taken reasonable steps to protect the Companys or such
Subsidiaries rights in confidential information and trade secrets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries or provided by any other Person to the Company or
its Subsidiaries. Without limiting the foregoing, (i) the Company or one of
its Subsidiaries has maintained, and enforces, a policy requiring each
Employee to execute a valid and enforceable proprietary information,
confidentiality and assignment agreement sufficient to irrevocably assign
(except as limited by applicable Law) any Intellectual Property developed by
such employee for the Company or such Subsidiary to the Company or such
Subsidiary, substantially in the standard form for employees (a copy of which
is has been made available to Parent) (the "Employee Proprietary Information
Agreement"); (ii) the Company or one of its Subsidiaries has maintained, and
enforces, a policy requiring each consultant or contractor to execute a valid
and enforceable consulting agreement containing proprietary information,
confidentiality and assignment provisions sufficient to irrevocably assign
(except as limited by applicable Law) any Intellectual Property developed by
such consultant for the Company or such Subsidiary to the Company or such
Subsidiary, substantially in the standard form for consultants or contractors
(a copy of which has been made available to Parent) (the "Consultant
Proprietary Information Agreement"); and (iii) all Employees who have
developed or contributed to any Company Intellectual Property have executed an
Employee Proprietary Information Agreement or a Consultant Proprietary
Information Agreement, as appropriate, without any exclusions or exceptions
that would prevent the assignment of such developed or contributed
Intellectual Property to the Company or its Subsidiaries. All Employees whose
employment relationships are or were governed by Laws in countries that
recognize Moral Rights have executed written agreements with the Company or
one of its Subsidiaries that waive, for the benefit of the Company or such
Subsidiary, and to the extent permitted by applicable Law, all Moral Rights in
any works of authorship relating to the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. No Employees have retained or are entitled to any rights in any
Intellectual Property developed by such Employee for the Company or any of its
Affiliates, including any license rights or economic interests, and no
payments are due and no such Employee has any rights to receive any payments
with respect to such Intellectual Property. To the Knowledge of the Company,
no current Employee is obligated under any agreement, subject to
any judgment, decree or order of any Governmental Entity or any similar
restriction that would materially interfere with the use of his or her efforts
to carry out his or her duties for the Company and its Subsidiaries, or to
promote the interests of the Company and its Subsidiaries in their current
businesses, or that would conflict with such businesses in a material manner.

(l)  _Government and University Funding_. No government funding, facilities
or resources of a university, college, other educational institution or
research center or funding from third Persons was used in the development of
the Company Intellectual Property. No Governmental Entity, university,
college, other educational institution or research center has any valid claim
or right in or to the Company Intellectual Property. To the Knowledge of the
Company, no Employee who was involved in, or who contributed to, the creation
or development of any Company Intellectual Property has performed services for
any government, university, college or other educational institution, or
research center during a period of time during which such Employee was also
performing services for the Company or one of its Subsidiaries.

(m) _Standards Bodies Membership_. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a member of, and has not actively participated in, any
organization, body or group that is engaged in or that has, or is in the
process of, setting, establishing or promulgating any industry or product
standards or the terms under which Intellectual Property Rights will be
licensed. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is

 



-48-  committed, nor is it obligated or bound, to grant licenses of any current or
future Company Intellectual Property to any third Person as a result of any
such membership or participation. None of the Company Products require a
license with respect to any industry standards. Without limiting the
foregoing, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is under any
obligation or duty, nor is it bound by any Contract, as a result of any
such membership or participation, to grant licenses of any Company
Intellectual Property under any terms, including "RAND" or "FRAND" terms.

Software with, any Company Product; (ii) distributed Open Source Software in

Technology; or (iii) used any Open Source Software in any manner
that creates, or purport to create, obligations for the Company or one of its
Subsidiaries to grant to any third Person any rights or immunities under any
Company Intellectual Property. The Company and its Subsidiaries have not used
any Open Source Software in any manner that requires or purports to require

Source Software) that all or any part of any Company Product or that other
Software incorporated into, derived from or distributed with such Open Source
Software be (A) disclosed or distributed in source code form; (B) licensed for
the purpose of making derivative works; or (C) redistributable at no charge or
with any restriction on the consideration charged therefor.

(o) _No Disclosure of Source Code_. Neither the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries nor any Person acting on its or their behalf has disclosed,
delivered or licensed to any Person, agreed to disclose, deliver or license to

other Person of any Source Code that is Company Intellectual Property. No
event has occurred, and no circumstance or condition exists, that (with or
without notice or lapse of time, or both) will, or would reasonably be
expected to, result in the disclosure or delivery by the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries or any Person acting on its or their behalf to any Person of
any Source Code that is Company Intellectual Property. Section 3.11(o) of the
Disclosure Schedule identifies each Contract pursuant to which the Company or
one of its Subsidiaries has deposited, or is or may be required to deposit,
with an escrow agent or any other Person, any Source Code that is Company
Intellectual Property, and describes whether the execution of this Agreement
or the consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated hereby could result in the release from escrow of any Source Code

in the Companys or such Subsidiaries standard form of end-user license
agreement (a copy of which has been made available to Parent); or (ii) for

contractual commitments, express and implied warranties, service level
commitments, product specifications and product documentation and to any
representations made by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to its
respective customers. The Company and its Subsidiaries have no Liability
(and, to the Knowledge of the Company, there is no basis for any present or
future Claim against the Company or its Subsidiaries giving rise to any
Liability) for replacement, repair or redelivery thereof or other damages in
connection therewith in excess of any reserves therefor reflected on the
Financials.

to be incapable of being used in the full manner for which they were designed
(collectively, "Contaminants").

by them under, are not in default or violation of, and have no Knowledge of
any default or violation by any other party to, each Company Employee Plan,

Company Employee Plan. There are no Claims pending, or, to the Knowledge of

for benefits) against any Company Employee Plan or against the assets of any
Company Employee Plan. Each Company Employee Plan (excluding individual award
agreements entered into under such plan that require the Employees consent to
amend or terminate such agreement) can be amended, terminated or otherwise
discontinued after the Effective Time in accordance with its terms, without
liability to Parent or the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates (other than
ordinary notice and administration requirements and expenses). There are no
audits, inquiries or proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company

Affiliate have timely made all contributions and other payments required by

sponsored, participated in or contributed to any self-insurance plan.

 

(e) _International Employee Plan_. Each International Employee Plan has been
established, maintained and administered in all material respects in

by any and all statutory or regulatory Laws that are applicable to such
International Employee Plan. No International Employee Plan required to be
funded has unfunded liabilities that, as of the Effective Time, will not be
offset by insurance or fully accrued. Except as required by Law, no condition
exists that would prevent the Company or Parent from terminating or amending
any International Employee Plan (excluding individual award agreements
entered into under such plan that require the Employees consent to amend or
terminate such agreement) at any time for any reason without liability to the
Company or its ERISA Affiliates (other than ordinary notice and
administration requirements and expenses or routine claims for benefits or
provision of vested benefits under such plan).

 

(f) _No Post-Employment Obligations_. No Company Employee Plan or Employee
Agreement provides, or reflects or represents any liability of the Company or

insurance, health or other employee welfare benefits to any Employee for any
reason, except as may be required by COBRA or other applicable Law, and the
Company and its ERISA Affiliates have never represented, promised or
contracted (whether in oral or written form) to any Employee (either
individually or to Employees as a group) or any other person that such

or other employee welfare benefits following termination of employment, except
to the extent required by COBRA or other applicable Law.

Rights Act of 1998, the requirements of the Newborns and Mothers Health
Protection Act of 1996 or any amendment to each such act or any similar
provisions of state Law applicable to its Employees.

 



-57- (h) _Effect of Transaction_. The execution of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby
will not (either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent
events that would not, in and of themselves, trigger such payment,
acceleration or other benefit or obligation) constitute an event under any
Company Employee Plan, Employee Agreement, trust or loan that will or may
result in any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise), acceleration,
forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in benefits or
obligation to fund benefits with respect to any Employee.

historic business assets in a business, within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.368-1(d).

 

(d) Parent and the Merger Subs have not taken any action and do not know of

deemed to operate as, any type of consent by Parent.

5.4 _No Solicitation._

 

(a) _No Solicitation_. The Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries and

transaction; (ii) disclose or furnish any information not customarily

performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed by the parties hereto that Parent shall be entitled
to an immediate injunction or injunctions, without the necessity of proving
the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy and without the necessity of
posting any bond or other security, to prevent breaches of the provisions of
this Section 5.4 and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof
in any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being
in addition to any other remedy to which Parent may be entitled at law or in
equity. Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation
of the restrictions set forth above by any Representative shall be deemed to
be a breach of this Agreement by the Company.

6.1 _Required Stockholder Approval; Fairness Hearing._

 

(a) _California Permit_. As soon as reasonably practicable following the date
of this Agreement, Parent and the Company shall prepare, and Parent shall
file (the date of such filing, the "Permit Filing Date"), the necessary
documents with the Commissioner of Corporations of the State of California

held by the California Commissioner to consider the terms, conditions and
fairness of the Merger pursuant to Sections 25121 and 25142 of the California
Corporate Securities Law of 1968 (the "Fairness Hearing Law"), together with
an application for a permit (a "California Permit") from the California
Commissioner, so that the issuance of Parent Common Stock in the First Step
Merger shall be exempt from registration under the Securities Act, by virtue
of the exemption provided by Section 3(a)(10) thereof (such documents to be
filed by Parent pursuant to this Section 6.1(a), collectively, the "Permit
Application"). The Company shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, the
notice of the Hearing (the "Notice"), in the form approved and signed by the
California Commissioner, to the Company Stockholders as promptly as
practicable and in any event within three Business Days following its

any necessary update that the Company becomes aware of with respect to the
identity of the Company Stockholders at least three Business Days prior to

Statement within seven Business Days of the date of this Agreement and each
of Parent and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
finalize such draft as promptly as practicable thereafter. The Information
Statement shall constitute a disclosure document for the offer and issuance
of the shares of Parent Common Stock to be received by the Company
Stockholders in the First Step Merger and an information statement for
solicitation of stockholder consent with respect to the adoption of
this Agreement and the approval of the First Step Merger and the transactions

CCC) along with such other information as required by applicable Law and
shall include a reference to the unanimous recommendation of the board of
directors of the Company (i) for the approval and adoption of this Agreement
and the approval of the First Step Merger and the transactions contemplated
hereby by the stockholders of the Company; and (ii) against the exercise of
dissenters rights in connection with the First Step Merger. Each party hereto

Information Statement will not, on the date the Information Statement is first
sent or furnished to the stockholders of the Company, contain any statement
which, at such time, is false or misleading with respect to any
material fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make
the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not false or misleading.

 

(c) _Cooperation_. The Company shall cooperate with, and provide the
information reasonably requested by, Parent in connection with Parents
application for a California Permit. Whenever any event occurs that is
required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Permit
Application or Information Statement, the Company and Parent shall cooperate
in delivering any such amendment or supplement to all stockholders of the
Company or filing any such amendment or supplement with the California
Commissioner or its staff or any other government officials. Parent, with the
reasonable cooperation of the Company, will respond to any comments from the
California Commissioner or the California Department of Business Oversight,
and Parent and the Company shall work together in good faith and use their
commercially reasonable efforts to have a California Permit granted as soon
as practicable after such filing. Each of Parent and the Company agrees to
provide promptly to the other such information concerning its business and
financial statements and affairs as, in the reasonable judgment of the
providing party or its counsel, may be required or appropriate under the
Fairness Hearing Law for inclusion in the Information Statement, or in any
amendments or supplements thereto, and to cause its counsel and auditors to
cooperate with the others counsel and auditors in preparation of the
Information Statement. Each of the Company and Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the above-referenced documents, including the
Permit Application, the Notice and the Information Statement to comply with
all requirements of applicable federal and state securities Laws. In addition,
each of the Company and Parent shall cause to appear and testify at the
Hearing each such partys executives, as in such partys reasonable judgment
may be necessary to obtain a California Permit.

6.1, in the event that, (i) after working in good faith and using commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain a California Permit for at least 120 days from
the Permit Filing Date, Parent or the Company reasonably determines that they
are not able to receive a California Permit under terms that permit the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby within 150 days after the
date of this Agreement; or (ii) the California Commissioner has
denied Parents application for a California Permit following the exercise of
commercially reasonable efforts by Parent to appeal any such denial, then
Parent or the Company, as applicable, shall promptly provide to the other a
notice (the "Election Notice") that it is abandoning the process to obtain a
California Permit. After providing an Election Notice, Parent will promptly

First Step Merger on a registration statement on Form S-4; or (B) issue the
shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to

Parent elects to issue shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to clause

registering the resale of such shares of Parent Common Stock and use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to become
effective within 15 days after the Closing Date and remain effective
until all such shares may be resold pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities
Act without regard to volume or other limitations set forth in such Rule. In
the event that Parent issues an Election Notice, the parties hereto agree to
cooperate to take such other actions necessary to complete the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

this Agreement, Parent and the Company shall prepare and make such filings as

(g) _Soliciting Materials_. Any materials to be submitted to the stockholders
of the Company in connection with the solicitation of their approval of the
First Step Merger and this Agreement, including the Information Statement and,

reasonable review and approval by Parent and shall include information
regarding the Company, the terms of the Merger and this Agreement, the
unanimous recommendation of the board of directors of the Company in favor of
the First Step Merger and this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the Company shall not include in the Soliciting

associates the form and content of which shall not have been approved by
Parent prior to such inclusion. The Soliciting Materials and all information
furnished on or in any document mailed, delivered or otherwise furnished or
to be mailed, delivered or otherwise furnished to the Company Stockholders in
connection with the solicitation of their consent to this Agreement, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby will not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact and will not omit to state any material
fact necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which made, not misleading; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the foregoing does not extend to any information supplied by Parent or Merger
Subs that is contained in any of the foregoing documents. The Company and
Parent shall promptly advise the other in writing if at any time prior to the
Closing the Company or Parent, as the case may be, shall obtain knowledge of
any facts that might make it necessary or appropriate to amend or supplement
the Soliciting Materials in order to make statements contained or incorporated
by reference therein not misleading or to comply with applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall only be required to provide notice
of any such facts to the extent such facts relate to information furnished in
writing by Parent or Merger Subs for the express purposes of including in

Company shall only be required to provide notice to Parent of any such facts
to the extent that such facts relate to information included by the Company
in the Soliciting Materials.

Agreement, or the interpretation, making, performance, breach or
termination hereof) without first consulting the Company, except that this
restriction shall be subject to Parents and its Affiliates obligation to
comply with applicable securities Laws and the rules of The NASDAQ Global

Parent may, after consultation with the Company, issue communications
regarding the existence or subject matter of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby to its or the Companys or its Subsidiaries
employees, customers and suppliers, as reasonably necessary for Parent to
maintain business relationships with such Persons or to comply with its

conditions set forth in this Agreement, the parties hereto shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to (a) take promptly, or cause to be taken

of any impediment on Parent, its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or the Company
under any statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree, order or other
legal restraint governing competition, monopolies or restrictive trade
practices (any such action described in (i), (ii) or (iii), an "Action of
Divestiture"). Nothing herein shall require Parent to litigate with any
Governmental Entity.

6.7 _Contract Consents, Amendments and Terminations_. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall (a) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all
necessary consents, waivers and approvals of any parties to any Contract
(including those listed on Schedule 6.7 and Schedule 7.2(e)(i)) as are

remain in full force and effect, including those consents, waivers and
approvals of any parties to any Contract listed on Schedule 6.7 and Schedule
7.2(e)(i); (b) use commercially reasonable efforts to modify each of the

and any other notices required under any Contract in connection with the
Merger promptly following the date of this Agreement. Such requests for
consents, waivers, approvals, modifications, terminations or notices shall be
in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent, and Parent shall be provided a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the foregoing. In the event
that the other parties to any such Contract, including a lessor or licensor of
any Leased Real Property, conditions its grant of a consent, modification,
waiver, termination or approval (including by threatening to exercise a
"recapture" or other termination right) upon, or otherwise requires in
response to a notice or consent, modification or termination 

 



-74-  request regarding the Merger, the payment of a consent fee, "profit sharing"
payment or other consideration, including increased rent payments or other
payments under the Contract or the provision of additional security
(including a guaranty), the Company shall be responsible for making all such
payments (the "Consent and Modification Fees"). Prior to or in connection with
the Closing, the Company shall pay (using the Companys cash) (i) all Consent
and Modification Fees; and (ii) all change of control, bonus, severance or

Transaction Payroll Taxes related to the amounts in this clause (ii) (the
items in clause (i) and (ii), the "Change of Control Fees"). In the event that
the Merger does not close for any reason other than the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(g), Parent shall not have any liability to
the Company, the Company Securityholders or any other Person for any costs,
claims, liabilities or damages resulting from the Company seeking to obtain
such consents, waivers, approvals, modifications or terminations or providing
such notices.

6.8 _Expenses and Fees._

 

(a) _Payment_. If the First Step Merger is consummated, all fees and expenses
incurred by the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with the First
Step Merger, including all legal, accounting, financial advisory, consulting
and all other fees and expenses of third parties incurred by the Company and
its Subsidiaries in connection with the negotiation and effectuation of
the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby ("Third Party Expenses"), shall be the obligation of the Company. The
Company shall provide Parent with a statement of Estimated Third Party
Expenses and an estimate of all Change of Control Fees showing in reasonable
detail both the paid and unpaid Third Party Expenses and Change of Control
Fees incurred by the Company as of the Closing Date (or anticipated to be
incurred or payable by the Company after the Closing Date) (the "Statement of
Expenses") at least five Business Days prior to the Closing Date, and on the
Closing Date the Statement of Expenses shall be certified by the Companys
Chief Financial Officer as true, correct and complete as of the Closing Date.
The Company shall pay (using the Companys cash) all Third Party Expenses and
any Change of Control Fees on or prior to the Closing Date, or, if not so
paid, shall be paid by Parent at the Closing (in which case such Third Party
Expenses or Change of Control Fees that are paid by Parent will, without
duplication, be included as liabilities in the calculation of Closing Net
Working Capital). Any Third Party Expenses or Change of Control Fees that are
not reflected on the Statement of Expenses and not otherwise accounted for in
the calculation of the Base Closing Merger Consideration Amount ("Excess
Expenses and Fees") may be paid out of the Escrow Fund, and Parent and the
Securityholder Representative shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to make
such payment to Parent.

(b)  _Non-consummation_. If the First Step Merger is not consummated, each
party hereto shall pay its own fees and expenses incurred in connection
herewith, and neither party shall be liable to the other party for any costs
or expenses incurred in connection herewith.

6.9 _280G Approval_. The Company shall promptly, submit to the Company
Stockholders for approval by the requisite vote (in a manner satisfactory to
Parent), by such number of the Company Stockholders as is required by the
terms of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, any payments or benefits that may,
separately or in the aggregate, constitute a "parachute payment" within the
meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement ("Section 280G Payments") (which determination
shall be made by the Company and shall be subject to review and approval by
Parent), such that all such payments and benefits shall not be deemed to be
Section 280G Payments, and prior to the Effective Time the Company shall
deliver to Parent evidence satisfactory to Parent that, as to any such
Section 280G Payments, a vote of the Company Stockholders was solicited in
conformance with Section 280G and the regulations promulgated thereunder and
either (a) that such requisite stockholder approval was obtained with respect
to any Section 280G Payment (the "280G

 



-75-  Approval"); or (b) that the 280G Approval was not obtained with respect to
any Section 280G Payment and, as a consequence, that such payments or benefits
shall not be made or provided to the extent they would cause any amounts to
constitute Section 280G Payments, pursuant to the 280G Waivers, which were
executed by the affected individuals prior to the vote of the stockholders of
the Company.

 

6.10 _Pre-Closing Employee Matters_.

 

(a) _Existing Employees_. The Company shall cause each Continuing Employee
listed on Schedule 6.10(a) to execute a proprietary information agreement
reasonably acceptable to Parent with the Company or one of its Subsidiaries
that is enforceable and effective as of such employees first date of
employment or service.

 

(b) _New Employees and Contractors_. Each person who becomes an employee of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the date of this Agreement and
prior to the Closing shall be required by the Company or one of its
Subsidiaries to enter into and execute a proprietary information agreement
reasonably acceptable to Parent with the Company or one of its Subsidiaries
that is enforceable and effective as of such employees first date of
employment or service. Each Person who becomes a consultant or contractor of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the date of this Agreement and
prior to the Closing shall be required by the Company or one of its
Subsidiaries to enter into and execute, a proprietary information agreement
with the Company enforceable and effective as of such consultant or
contractors first date of service.

 

(c) _Resignation Letter_. The Company shall, prior to the Closing, cause each
officer and director of the Company and its Subsidiaries to execute a
resignation and release letter in substantially the form attached as Exhibit H
(the "Director and Officer Resignation and Release Letter"), effective as of
the Effective Time.

 

(d) _Severance_. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries shall, prior to the
Closing, pay in full all severance obligations that are required to be paid
under applicable Law to any Employee who has been terminated prior to the
Closing.

6.11 _Post-Closing Employee Matters_. Parent or its Affiliates may offer
certain U.S. Employees, including the Key Employees, employment by Parent, one
of its Subsidiaries, the Interim Surviving Entity or the Final Surviving
Entity as a Continuing Employee, to be effective as of the Closing Date, upon
proof of a legal right to work in the United States (such employees offered
such employment, the "Offered Employees"). Such employment will: (a) be set
forth in offer letters on Parents standard form; (b) be subject to and in
compliance with Parents applicable policies and procedures, including
employment background checks and the execution of Parents employee
proprietary information agreement governing employment conduct and
performance; (c) have terms, including the position and salary, that will be
determined by Parent; (d) include, if applicable, a waiver by the Employee of
any future equity-based compensation to which such Employee may otherwise
have been entitled; and (e) supersede any prior express or implied employment
agreements, arrangement or offer letter in effect prior to the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the offers provided to the Offered
Employees shall provide for terms and conditions that maintain substantially
(i) the aggregate economic value of the total cash compensation (including
base salary, base hourly wage, target bonus and other cash-based incentive
payments, but excluding equity compensation) of each Continuing Employee; and
(ii) the aggregate economic value of the benefits under the employee benefit
plans, programs and arrangements for the benefit of such Continuing Employee
and his or her dependents and beneficiaries, in each case as provided to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time so as to not
implement any substantial aggregate reduction in the value of compensation,
benefits, rights or entitlements during such period (the "Offered Terms")
and, following the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause its Affiliate
who is employing such Continuing Employee to maintain such Offered Terms.
After the Effective Time, nothing contained in the foregoing sentence shall
prohibit Parent or its Affiliates from reducing or

 



-76-  otherwise modifying any component of compensation or benefits of any
Continuing Employee. Effective as of, and following, the Closing, to the
extent permitted or required by applicable Law, Parent or one of its
Affiliates will cause any employee benefit plans, programs, policies and
arrangements in which any Continuing Employee participates that is a health or
welfare benefit plan (collectively, "Parent Welfare Plans") to (A) waive all
limitations as to preexisting conditions, requirements for insurability,
exclusions and service conditions with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to Continuing Employees (and their
eligible dependents); (B) honor any payments, charges and expenses of such
Continuing Employees (and their eligible dependents) that were applied toward
the deductible and out-of-pocket maximums under the corresponding Company
Employee Plan in satisfying any applicable deductibles, out-of-pocket
maximums or co-payments under a corresponding Parent Welfare Plan during the
same plan year in which such payments, charges and expenses were made; and (C)
with respect to any medical plan, waive any waiting period limitation or
evidence of insurability requirement that would otherwise be applicable to a
Continuing Employee following the Closing. No Continuing Employee or other
Employee, including any beneficiary or dependent thereof, or any other Person
that is not a party to this Agreement, shall be entitled to assert any claim
hereunder and nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted as limiting the
power of Parent or its Affiliates to amend or terminate any
particular employee benefit plan, program, agreement or policy, or
interpreted as requiring the Company or Parent or any of their Affiliates to
continue the employment of any Continuing Employee for any period of time.

 

6.12 _Termination of Certain Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) _401(k) Plan_. Effective as of no later than the day immediately preceding
the Closing Date, the Company and any ERISA Affiliate shall terminate any and
all group severance, separation or salary continuation plans, programs or
arrangements and any and all Company Employee Plans intended to include a Code
Section 401(k) arrangement (each, a "401(k) Plan") (unless Parent provides
written notice to the Company no later than 10 Business Days prior to the
Closing Date that such 401(k) plans shall not be terminated). Unless Parent
provides such written notice to the Company, no later than five Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that
such Company Employee Plans have been terminated (effective as of no later
than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date) pursuant to resolutions
of the board of directors of the Company or such ERISA Affiliate, as the case
may be. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to review
and approval of Parent. The Company also shall take such other actions in
furtherance of terminating such Company Employee Plans as Parent may
reasonably require. In the event that termination of a 401(k) Plan would
reasonably be anticipated to trigger liquidation charges, surrender charges or
other fees, then such charges or fees shall be included in Third Party
Expenses and shall be the responsibility of the Company, and the Company shall
take such actions as are necessary to reasonably estimate the amount of such
charges or fees and provide such estimate in writing to Parent no later
than seven Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

(b) _PEO Arrangement_. The Company shall terminate its services agreement
with TriNet, Inc. (the "PEO Arrangement"), effective as of the Closing Date.
The Company shall ensure that all employee benefits under the PEO Arrangement

Date. Parent shall have received from the Company evidence reasonably
satisfactory to Parent that the PEO Arrangement has been timely and properly
terminated in accordance with this Section 6.12(b) pursuant to resolutions of
the board of directors of the Company and any other appropriate entity. Any
termination fee or similar expense resulting from the termination of the PEO
Arrangement shall be borne solely by the Company, and no such fee or expense
shall be borne by the Employees or by Parent. 

6.13 _Agreements and Documents Delivered at Signing or Immediately Following
Signing_. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause each agreement and document that was
executed by any Person and delivered to Parent prior to, contemporaneously
with, or immediately following, the execution of this Agreement, as the case
may be, to remain in full force and effect through the Closing Date.

Convertible Note shall have no rights thereunder after the Closing, except to
be issued the shares of Parent Common Stock into which such Convertible Note
is being settled, it being understood that the shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable upon settlement of the Convertible Notes will not be entitled to any

the amount of any and all Closing Indebtedness to the extent that such Closing
Indebtedness is not paid in full and finally discharged by the Company (or is

Effective Time by reducing the Base Closing Merger Consideration Amount by the
amount of any such unpaid Closing Indebtedness (or the amount of any such
Closing Indebtedness paid by Parent on the Companys behalf). The Company
shall deliver to Parent, at least one Business Day prior to the Closing Date,
executed payoff letters or final invoices, as applicable, from each lender,
creditor, noteholder or other counterparty to which such Closing Indebtedness
is owing (whether or not then due and payable), in each case (a) that sets
forth the amount to be paid on or prior to the Closing Date, together with
wire transfer

 



-80-  instructions; (b) evidencing that the payment of such amount would result in
the full repayment, satisfaction, release, and discharge of all current and
future obligations of the Company (and, in the case of hedging, swap or
similar agreements, the complete unwind and settlement of such arrangements)
in respect of such item (except obligations for indemnification and
reimbursement that expressly survive repayment in full) and of all current
and future Liens relating to such item; and (c) contemplating the delivery of

recorded, as the case may be, will be sufficient to release any and all Liens
relating to such item.

6.22 _Joinder and Waiver Agreement_. The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Joinder and Waiver Agreement to be executed
on or prior to the Closing Date by the holders of at least 95% of the Company
Capital Stock that would be issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

 

6.23 _Indemnification of Company Officers and Directors_.

 

(a) _Indemnification_. For six years following the Closing, Parent shall, and
shall cause the Company, to fulfill and honor all rights to indemnification
for acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective Time now existing
in favor of the current or former officers and directors (including, if
applicable, their directors, officers, partners, employees, agents, spouses
and controlling persons) of the Company and its Subsidiaries currently
indemnified by the Company or its Subsidiaries under the agreements between
the Company and such Persons existing as of the date of this Agreement and set
forth on Schedule 6.23(a) (such Persons, the "Company Indemnitees"),
including any provisions existing in the Charter Documents as of the date of
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligations of Parent, the
Interim Surviving Entity, the Final Surviving Entity and their successors (i)
shall be subject to any limitation imposed by applicable Law (including any
limits imposed by applicable Law on the Company and its Subsidiaries as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time); and (ii) shall not be deemed to
release any Company Indemnitee who is also an officer or director of the
Company from his or her obligations pursuant to this Agreement or any Related
Agreement, nor shall such Company Indemnitee have any right of contribution,
indemnification or right of advancement from Parent, the Interim Surviving
Entity, the Final Surviving Entity or any of their successors with respect to
any Loss claimed by any of the Indemnified Parties against such Company
Indemnitee in his or her capacity as a Company Stockholder pursuant to this
Agreement or any Related Agreement. The foregoing shall not in any way limit
any Company Indemnitees rights to coverage under the Tail
Policy. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall have no obligation to
maintain the existence of the Interim Surviving Entity or the Final Surviving
Entity for any specified period following the Effective Time.

 

(b) _Tail Policy_. The Company shall purchase prior to or concurrent with the
Closing a prepaid directors and officers liability policy or policies (the
"Tail Policy") that will remain in effect until the six year anniversary of
the Effective Time the material terms of which, including coverage and amount,
are comparable to those of the Companys current directors and officers
liability insurance policy; _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent any
payments with respect to such Tail Policy have not been made by the Company
prior to or concurrent with the Closing, then such payments shall be deemed
Third Party Expenses or Excess Expenses and Fees, as the case may be.

6.24 _Further Assurances_. Each party hereto, at the request of another party
hereto, shall execute and deliver such other instruments and do and perform
such other acts and things as may be necessary or desirable for effecting
completely the consummation of the Merger and the transactions contemplated
hereby. If at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest
the Interim Surviving Entity and, after the Second Step Merger, the Final
Surviving Entity with full right, title and possession to all assets,
property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company, then
Parent, Merger Subs, and the officers and directors of the Company, Parent
and Merger Subs are fully authorized, in the name of their respective
corporations or otherwise, to take, and will take, all such lawful and
necessary action.

 



-81- 6.25 _Estoppel Certificate_. The Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain an estoppel certificate in form reasonably acceptable to
Parent from the Foundation with respect to the New York Manufacturing

with a schedule of the Convertible Notes, which such schedule shall set forth,
for each Convertible Note, (i) the name of the holder of such Convertible

Convertible Note; (vi) the maturity date of such Convertible Note; (vii) the
principal amount of such Convertible Note; (viii) whether the Convertible Note
was issued as part of an investment unit or otherwise with original issue
discount, and the value as of the issue date of the Convertible Note of any
warrants or other property comprising a component of any such investment unit;
(ix) the accrued interest on such Convertible Note as of the date of such
schedule (taking into account both stated interest and any amount treated as
interest or original issue discount for U.S. federal income Tax purposes); and
(x) an estimate of the amount of any withholding and the basis for any
exemption from or reduction in withholding. 

(b) To the extent that the Spreadsheet reflects, with respect to any
Convertible Note, that accrued interest (including any amounts treated as
interest for U.S. federal income Tax purposes) is exempt from withholding or
is subject to withholding at a reduced rate, the Company shall provide, or
cause the holders of such Convertible Notes to provide, at least seven
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, all required Tax forms in connection
with such exemption or reduction, including IRS Forms W-9, from any such
holder that is a U.S. person, and the appropriate series of IRS Forms W-8 from
any such holder that is not a U.S. person (and all supporting documentation,
such as IRS Form W-8IMY and the underlying Forms W-8BEN, W-8BENE and W-9 of
the beneficial owners of such Convertible Notes) and any similar information
(the "Tax Forms"). In the absence of such Tax Forms, the Company, Parent, the
Interim Surviving Entity, the Final Surviving Entity and the Escrow Agent
shall withhold at the statutory rate of 30% against any amount determined by
Parent to constitute interest for U.S. federal income Tax purposes.

Indemnifying Party for Losses in respect of any Indemnifiable Matters under
(A) Section 8.2(a)(i) shall be limited to an amount equal to such Indemnifying
Partys Pro Rata Portion of the property in the Escrow Fund; (B) Section
8.2(a)(ii) shall be limited to an amount equal to such Indemnifying Partys
Pro Rata Portion of the property in the Escrow Fund plus up to $36,000,000 of
the Earnout Consideration Amount (and such amount shall be satisfied first
from the Escrow Fund and then from the Earnout Consideration Amount) (such
excess amount, "Excess Losses"); and (C) Section 8.2(a)(ii) through Section
8.2(a)(x) shall be limited to the portion of the amounts payable under this
Agreement actually received by such Indemnifying Party (it being understood
that, for purposes of this clause (C), the amount actually received in respect
of any Convertible Notes held by an Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to be
part of the amount actually received by such Indemnifying Party).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, there will be no
limit on the ability of the Indemnified Parties to recover from an
Indemnifying Party if such Indemnifying Party commits, participates in,
was responsible for, was complicit in the commission of or had actual
knowledge of any fraud or intentional misrepresentation.

 



-89- (b) _Threshold_. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 8.3, no
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover any Losses in respect of any
Indemnifiable Matters under Section 8.2(a)(i) unless and the aggregate amount
of Losses for which the Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this Agreement exceeds $1,000,000 (the "Threshold"), in which
case the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to the full amount of all such
Losses from the first dollar (including the amount of the Threshold).

 

(c) _Other Limitations_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement:

 

(i) nothing in this Agreement shall limit the liability of the Company or
Parent for any willful or intentional breach of any representation, warranty
or covenant set forth in this Agreement, any Related Agreements or in any
certificates or other instruments required to be delivered pursuant to this
Agreement if the First Step Merger is not consummated;

 

(ii) (A) any Indemnifying Party committing, or having actual knowledge of, any
fraud or intentional misrepresentation with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby shall indemnify, and hold the Indemnified
Parties harmless for, any Losses paid, suffered, incurred or sustained by the
Indemnified Parties a result of such fraud or intentional
misrepresentation; and (B) none of the Indemnified Partys equitable or legal
claims arising out of fraud or intentional misrepresentation shall be limited
or waived by this Article VIII or any other provision in this Agreement with
respect to any Person committing such fraud or intentional misrepresentation
or any Person who has actual knowledge of such fraud or intentional
misrepresentation;

 

(iii) any Indemnified Party may bring a claim for indemnification for any Loss
under this Article VIII notwithstanding the fact that such Indemnified Party
had Knowledge of the breach, event or circumstance giving rise to such Loss
prior to the Closing or waived any condition to the Closing related thereto;

 

(iv) if an Indemnified Partys claim under this Article VIII may be brought
under different sections of Section 8.2(a), then such Indemnified Party shall
have the right to bring such claim under any applicable section it chooses in
accordance with this Article VIII;

 

(v) nothing in this Agreement shall limit the rights of any party hereto to
apply for equitable remedies to enforce the other party or parties
obligations hereunder; and

(vi) nothing in this Agreement shall limit the right of any Indemnified Party
to pursue remedies under any Related Agreement against the parties thereto.

(d) _Taxes Imposed by Parent_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the Indemnifying Parties shall not have any
liability or indemnification obligation for any Taxes of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (i) with respect to any taxable period (or portion
thereof) beginning after the Closing Date, other than (A) penalties, interest
and additions to Tax incurred in such period that relate to Pre-Closing Taxes;
(B) Taxes resulting from breaches of the representations and warranties set
forth in Section 3.9(a)(vii), Section 3.9(a)(ix), Section 3.9(a)(x), Section
3.9(a)(xii), Section 3.9(a)(xiii), Section 3.9(a)(xvii), Section 3.9(a)(xix),
Section 3.9(b), Section 3.9(c) and Section 3.9(d); and (C) any Taxes
attributable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
Transaction Payroll Taxes; or (ii) resulting solely from any action taken by
Parent, the Company or any of their Affiliates after the Closing on the
Closing Date.

(e) _Insurance_. For purposes of calculating the amount of Losses, there shall
be deducted therefrom an amount equal to the amount of any proceeds actually
received by any Indemnified Party from any third party insurer in connection
with such Losses (net of applicable costs of recovery or collection thereof as
well as any reserves, deductibles, premium adjustments and retrospectively
rated premiums).

 



-90- (f) _Non-reliance_. For purposes of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, Parent and Merger Subs acknowledge and agree that (i)
they are not entitled to rely on any representations or warranties or other
statements of fact or opinion other than the representations and warranties
expressly set forth in Article III, as modified by the Disclosure Schedule;
(ii) in connection with the transactions set forth herein, Parent and Merger
Subs have received certain estimates, projections, forecasts and similar
forward-looking statements relating to the future operating and financial
performance of the Company and no representation or warranty (other than as
explicitly set forth in Article III, as modified by the Disclosure Schedule)
is being made by or on behalf of the Company or any other Person with respect
to such matters, it being understood that this clause (ii) will not affect the
ability of Parent or Merger Subs to rely on the representations and warranties
actually set forth in Article III, as modified by the Disclosure Schedule.
For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto agree that no Indemnified
Person shall be entitled to any recovery for any Losses to the extent already
taken into account in the calculation of the Final Adjusted Closing
Merger Consideration Amount.

(g) _Offset_. Subject to this Section 8.3, Parent shall have the right to
offset amounts that would otherwise be payable as an Earnout Payment to
satisfy any Loss owed to any Indemnified Party under this Article VIII (other
than Section 8.2(a)(i)) that is in excess of the property in the Escrow Fund
(but only after the Escrow Fund is first depleted). Following the payment of
an Earnout Payment, if Parent reasonably determines that one or more future
Earnout Payments will not be made, then Parent may recover any Loss owed to
any Indemnified Party by recovery of the applicable portion of such paid
Earnout Payment (but subject in all cases to the limitations contained in this
Section 8.3 and only after the Escrow Fund is first depleted).

 

8.4 _Indemnification Claims Procedures_.

 

(a) _Making a Claim for Indemnification; Claim Certificate_. If an Indemnified
Party believes that it has or may acquire a right to indemnification under
this Article VIII, such Indemnified Party may make an indemnification claim
pursuant to Section 8.2(a) by delivering a certificate (a "Claim Certificate")
to the Securityholder Representative, with a copy to the Escrow Agent (if and
to the extent that the Losses described in the Claim Certificate are
recoverable by seeking recourse against the Escrow Fund), or to one or more
Indemnifying Parties (if and only to the extent that the Losses described in
the Claim Certificate are recoverable by seeking recourse directly against any
such Indemnifying Party), (i) stating that such Indemnified Party has paid,
sustained, suffered or incurred (or reasonably anticipates that it will
have to pay, sustain, suffer or incur) Losses; and (ii) specifying in
reasonable detail, to the extent known, the individual items of Losses
included in the amount so stated, the date that each such item was paid,
sustained, suffered or incurred, or the basis for such anticipated liability,
and the nature of the Indemnifiable Matter to which such item is related;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Claim Certificate need only specify such
information to the knowledge of such Indemnified Party as of the Claim Date,
shall not limit any of the rights or remedies of any Indemnified Party and may
be updated and amended from time to time by the Indemnified Party by
delivering an updated or amended Claim Certificate to the
Securityholder Representative or applicable Indemnifying Parties, as the case
may be, with a copy to the Escrow Agent (if and to the extent that the Losses
described in the Claim Certificate are recoverable by seeking recourse against
the Escrow Fund). The date of delivery of a Claim Certificate is referred to
herein as the "Claim Date" of such Claim Certificate (and the claims for
indemnification set forth therein).

 

(b) _Objecting a Claim for Indemnification; Objection Notice_.

 

(i) Following its receipt of a Claim Certificate, the Securityholder
Representative (or in the case of a claim directly against one or
more Indemnifying Parties, such Indemnifying Parties) may object to any
item(s) or amount(s) set forth therein by delivering written notice thereof
(an "Objection Notice") to the Indemnified Party submitting such Claim
Certificate at the addresses

 



-91-  of such Indemnified Party set forth in such Claim Certificate, with a copy
to the Escrow Agent (if and to the extent that the Losses described in the
Claim Certificate are recoverable only by seeking recourse against the Escrow
Fund); _provided_ , _however_ , that to be effective such Objection Notice
must (i) be delivered to the Indemnified Party (and, in the case of a claim
for recourse against the Escrow Fund, to the Escrow Agent) prior to 5:00
p.m., Pacific time, on the 30th day following the Claim Date of the Claim
Certificate (such deadline, the "Objection Deadline"); and (ii) set forth in
reasonable detail the nature of the objections to the claims in the Claim
Certificate in respect of which the objection is made.

(ii) If the Securityholder Representative (or the Indemnifying Party, if
indemnification is validly being sought hereunder directly from such
Indemnifying Party) does not object as provided in Section 8.4(b)(i) to any
item or amount set forth in an Claim Certificate prior to the
Objection Deadline for such Claim Certificate, then such failure to so object
shall be an irrevocable acknowledgement by the Securityholder Representative
(or the Indemnifying Party, if indemnification is being validly sought
hereunder directly from such Indemnifying Party) that the Indemnified Party
is entitled to the full amount of the claims for Losses set forth in such
Claim Certificate (and such entitlement shall be conclusively and irrefutably
established) with respect to the Indemnifying Party against whom
indemnification has been sought (any such claim, an "Unobjected Claim").

(iii) With respect to an Unobjected Claim against the Escrow Fund, promptly
following the Objection Deadline for the Claim Certificate, the Escrow Agent
shall promptly release from the Escrow Fund and deliver to any Indemnified
Party that has previously delivered such Claim Certificate an amount equal to
the amount of Losses set forth in such Unobjected Claim (not to exceed the
amount then remaining in the Escrow Fund). With respect to an Unobjected Claim
for which the Indemnifying Party is directly liable beyond the amount of the
Escrow Fund, Parent shall first exercise its right of offset contained in
Section 8.3(g) and thereafter, if and to the extent that the Losses included
in the Unobjected Claim are not covered in full by such recovery, then
within 30 days of a claim becoming an Unobjected Claim, the applicable
Indemnifying Party shall make the applicable payment to such Indemnified
Party, subject to the limitations contained in Section 8.3 and Section 8.6.

 

(c) _Procedure Following an Objection_. If the Securityholder Representative
(or the Indemnifying Party, if indemnification is being validly sought
hereunder directly from such Indemnifying Party) does object as provided in
Section 8.4(b) to any item(s) or amount(s) set forth in any Claim Certificate,
then the Securityholder Representative (or the objecting Indemnifying Party)
and the Indemnified Party shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights
of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims. If the
Securityholder Representative (or the objecting Indemnifying Party) and the
Indemnified Party should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement
shall be prepared and signed by the Securityholder Representative (or the
objecting Indemnifying Party) and the Indemnified Party and, in the case of a
claim against the Escrow Fund, shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent. The
Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and make
distributions from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms hereof.

 

(d) _Resolution of Conflicts_. __

 

(i) If the Securityholder Representative (or the Indemnifying Party, in the
case of a claim for indemnification validly sought directly from an
Indemnifying Party) timely delivers an Objection Notice in accordance with
Section 8.4(b)(i), then the Securityholder Representative (or such objecting
Indemnifying Party) and Parent (for itself and on behalf of any other
Indemnified Party) shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of
the respective parties to resolve the objections in the Objection Notice with
respect to each such claim. Either the Securityholder Representative (or such
objecting Indemnifying Party) and Parent may, but shall not be obligated to,
initiate non-binding mediation of the dispute with the assistance of a neutral
arbitrator belonging to and under the rules of the CPR Institute for Dispute
Resolution. The party requesting the mediation shall arrange for mediation
services, subject to the

 



-92-  approval of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Mediation shall take place in Santa Clara County,
California during reasonable business hours and upon reasonable advance
notice. Mediation may be scheduled to begin at any time, but with at least 10
Business Days written notice to all parties. If one party initiates
mediation, the parties (A) shall participate in the mediation in good faith
and shall devote reasonable time and energy to the mediation so as to promptly
resolve the dispute or conclude that they cannot resolve the dispute; and (B)
shall not pursue other remedies while such mediation is proceeding. If
the Securityholder Representative (or the objecting Indemnifying Party) and
Parent reach an agreement, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be
prepared and signed by the Securityholder Representative (or the objecting
Indemnifying Party) and the Indemnified Party and, in the case of a claim
against the Escrow Fund, shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent and, in the
case of a claim directly against the Indemnifying Parties, to the Indemnifying
Parties. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum
and make distributions from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms
thereof.

(ii) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation (and,
if applicable, mediation) prior to 90 days following the date an Objection
Notice is deemed properly delivered, given and received pursuant to Section
10.1, either Parent or the Securityholder Representative (or the objecting
Indemnifying Party) may bring suit in the courts identified in Section 10.7 to
resolve the matter. The decision of the trial court as to the validity and
amount of any claim in such Claim Certificate shall be nonappealable, binding
and conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement and the Escrow Agent shall
be entitled to act in accordance with such decision and the Escrow Agent shall
distribute the amounts from the Escrow Fund in accordance therewith. Judgment
upon any award rendered by the trial court may be entered in any court having
jurisdiction.

8.5  _Third-Party Claims_. In the event that any Indemnified Party becomes
aware of a third party claim (a "Third Party Claim") that such Indemnified
Party in good faith believes may result in a claim for indemnification,
such Indemnified Party shall, as promptly as practicable, notify the
Securityholder Representative (or, in the event indemnification is validly
being sought hereunder directly from an Indemnifying Party, such Indemnifying
Party) of such claim. The failure to so notify the Securityholder
Representative (or such Indemnifying Party, if applicable) of the commencement
of any such Third Party Claim will relieve the Indemnifying Parties from
liability in connection therewith only if and to the extent that such failure
materially and adversely affects the ability of the Indemnifying Parties to
defend their interests in such Third Party Claim. The Securityholder
Representative shall be entitled on behalf of the Indemnifying Party (or,
in the event indemnification is being validly sought hereunder directly from
an Indemnifying Party, such Indemnifying Party shall be entitled), at its or
their expense, to participate in, but not to determine or conduct, the defense
of, or settlement negotiations with respect to, such Third Party Claim. The
Securityholder Representative or the Indemnifying Party, as applicable, shall
have the right to receive copies of all pleadings, notices and communications
with respect to the Third Party Claim to the extent that receipt of such
documents does not affect any privilege relating to the other party and the
Indemnified Party shall keep the other party reasonably informed and updated
as to the status of the Third Party Claim at all times pending resolution
thereof. The Indemnified Party shall have the right in its sole discretion to
conduct the defense of, and to settle, any such Third Party Claim; _provided_
, _however_ , that except with the written consent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) of the Securityholder
Representative (or, in the event that indemnification is being sought
hereunder directly from an Indemnifying Party, such Indemnifying Party), no
settlement of any such Third Party Claim with third party claimants shall be
determinative of (i) the amount of Losses relating to such matter; or (ii)
unless otherwise previously agreed in writing by the Securityholder
Representative or the Indemnifying Party, the existence of an Indemnifiable
Matter. Subject to the foregoing sentence, if there is a Third Party Claim
that, if adversely determined would give rise to a right of recovery for
Losses, then any amounts paid, sustained, suffered or reasonably incurred by
the Indemnified Party in defense of such Third Party Claim, regardless of the
outcome of such claim, shall be deemed to be Losses. In the event that the
Securityholder Representative has consented to any such settlement with
respect to an Indemnifiable Matter under Section 8.2(a), then the
Indemnifying Parties shall have no power or

 



-93-  authority to object under any provision of this Article VIII to the amount
of any Third Party Claim by the Indemnified Parties against the Escrow Fund or
against the Indemnifying Parties directly, as the case may be, with respect
to such settlement.

8.6 _Escrow Arrangements._

 

(a) _Escrow Fund_. By virtue of this Agreement and as partial security for the
Indemnified Parties under Section 8.2(a), at the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit with the Escrow Agent the Escrow Amount without any act of the
Indemnifying Parties in accordance with Section 2.10(a). Such deposit of the
Escrow Amount will constitute an escrow fund (together with any interest
accrued thereon, the "Escrow Fund") to be governed by the terms set forth
herein. The Escrow Fund shall be available to compensate the Indemnified
Parties for any claims for any Losses paid, sustained, suffered or
incurred by them and for which they are entitled to recovery under this
Article VIII. The Escrow Agent may execute this Agreement following the date
of this Agreement and prior to the Closing, and such later execution shall not
affect the binding nature of this Agreement as of the date of this Agreement
between the other parties hereto.

(b) _Distribution of the Escrow Fund_. __ 

(i) Subject to the following requirements, the Escrow Fund shall be in
existence immediately following the Effective Time and shall terminate at
11:59 p.m., Pacific time, on the Survival Date (such period, the "Escrow
Period").

(ii) Within three Business Days following the end of the Escrow Period,
Parent and the Securityholder Representative shall jointly instruct the Escrow
Agent to distribute any Parent Common Stock remaining in the Escrow Fund to
the Indemnifying Parties in accordance with their respective Pro Rata
Portions following such termination as provided in Section 8.6(b)(iii);
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Escrow Fund shall not terminate, and the
Escrow Agent shall not disburse any shares of Parent Common Stock from the
Escrow Fund with respect to any amount in respect of any unsatisfied claims
specified in any Claim Certificate delivered prior to any applicable
disbursement date or termination date ("Unresolved Claims") with respect to
facts and circumstances existing prior to such disbursement date or
termination date or the Survival Date, and any such amount shall not be
distributed to the Indemnifying Parties at such time.

 

(iii) As soon as all Unresolved Claims have been resolved, Parent and the
Securityholder Representative shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to
deliver the remaining portion of the Escrow Fund, if any, not required to
satisfy such Unresolved Claims (A) first, to the Securityholder Representative
for any Securityholder Representative Expenses; and (B) second, to
the Indemnifying Parties. Deliveries of shares of Parent Common Stock out of
the Escrow Fund to the Indemnifying Parties pursuant to this Section 8.6 shall
be made in proportion to their respective Pro Rata Portions of the remaining
amounts in the Escrow Fund, with the amount delivered to each Company
Securityholder rounded down to the nearest share of Parent Common Stock.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Escrow Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any property in the Escrow Fund
deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any Company Securityholder such
amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under any
provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax law or under any applicable
legal requirement. To the extent that such amounts are so deducted or withheld
and paid to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such amounts shall be treated
for all purposes as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts
would otherwise have been paid.

(iv) For purposes of this Agreement, the amount of shares of Parent Common
Stock in the Escrow Fund to be paid to the Indemnified Parties in respect of
any Losses, if any, shall equal the applicable amount of the Losses divided by
the Closing Price (rounded down to the nearest whole share).

 



-94- (c) _Protection of the Escrow Fund; Tax Reporting_. __

 

(i) The Escrow Agent shall hold and safeguard the Escrow Fund during the
Escrow Period, shall treat such funds as trust funds in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement and shall hold and dispose of the Escrow Fund only in
accordance with the terms of this Article VIII and Section 2.10.

 

(ii) Parent and the Escrow Agent will cooperate to maintain an appropriate
ledger of the shares of Parent Common Stock held in the Escrow Fund and the
applicable Company Securityholder to which those shares are allocated. The
Escrow Agent will be shown as the registered owner of all shares of Parent
Common Stock in the Escrow Fund on the certificate(s) evidencing such shares
(if such shares are certificated) and on the books and records of Parent, but
the applicable Company Securityholders will have all rights with respect to
the shares of Parent Common Stock held in the Escrow Fund during the period of
time in which such shares have not been transferred or repurchased (including
the right to instruct the Escrow Agent how to vote such shares and the right
to receive on a current basis any cash dividends or other distributions made
with respect to such shares), except the right of possession or transfer
thereof. The parties hereto agree that the applicable Company Securityholder
is the owner of such shares issued to such Company Securityholder pursuant to
this Agreement and held by the Escrow Agent.

 

(iii) Each of Parent and, prior to the Closing, the Company and, after the
Closing, the Securityholder Representative shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause each Indemnifying Party to provide to the Escrow Agent any
necessary Tax forms, including Form W-9 or the appropriate series of Form W-8,
as applicable (which must be originally executed), or any similar form
requested by the Escrow Agent; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Escrow Agent
shall rely upon (and obtain copies from Parent as necessary, to the extent
that Parent has received such forms prior to the Closing) all tax forms used
and collected by Parent in connection with Closing payments pursuant to
Section 2.10(b)(ii).

(iv) The Escrow Agent shall withhold any taxes it deems appropriate in the
absence of proper tax documentation or as required by law, and shall remit
such taxes to the appropriate authorities. The Company hereby represent and
warrants to the Escrow Agent that (A) there is no sale or transfer of
a United States Real Property Interest as defined under IRC Section 897(c) in
the underlying transaction giving rise to this Agreement; and (B) except as
provided in the Spreadsheet, no Indemnifying Party is subject to withholding
on payments made in connection with the Merger, other than backup withholding
on failure to provide any required tax documentation. The Indemnifying Parties
agree to indemnify and hold the Escrow Agent harmless from any liability or
obligation on account of taxes, assessments, additions for late payment,
interest, penalties, expenses and other governmental charges that may be
assessed or asserted against the Escrow Agent in connection with or relating
to any payment made or other activities performed under the terms of this
Agreement, including any liability for the withholding or deduction of (or the
failure to withhold or deduct) the same, and any liability for failure to
obtain proper certifications or to report properly to governmental
authorities in connection with this Agreement, including costs and expenses
(including reasonable legal fees and expenses), interest and penalties, except
to the extent such amounts relate to the Escrow Agents fraud or
gross negligence, failure to withhold, or failure to perform any backup
withholding. The foregoing indemnification and agreement to hold harmless
shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

 

(d) _Escrow Agent s Duties_.

 

(i) The Escrow Agent shall be obligated only for the performance of such
duties as are specifically set forth herein, and as set forth in
any additional written escrow instructions which the Escrow Agent may receive
after the date of this Agreement that are signed by an officer of Parent, and
may rely and shall be protected in relying or refraining from acting on any
instrument reasonably believed to be genuine and to have been signed or
presented by the proper party or parties. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable
for any act done or omitted hereunder as Escrow Agent while acting in good
faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment, and any act done or omitted
pursuant to the advice of legal counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such
good faith.

 



-95- (ii) The Escrow Agent is hereby expressly authorized to disregard any and all
warnings given by any of the parties hereto or by any other Person, excepting
only orders or process of courts of law, and is hereby expressly authorized to
comply with and obey orders, judgments or decrees of any court, awards of
arbitrators and written instructions of Parent. In case the Escrow Agent
obeys or complies with any such order, judgment or decree of any court, award
of arbitrator or instructions, the Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any of
the parties hereto or to any other Person by reason of such compliance,
notwithstanding any such order, judgment, decree or award being subsequently
reversed, modified, annulled, set aside, vacated or found to have been entered
without jurisdiction.

 

(iii) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable in any respect on account of the
identity, authority or rights of the parties executing or delivering or
purporting to execute or deliver this Agreement or any documents or papers
deposited or called for hereunder.

(iv) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for the expiration of any rights
under any statute of limitations with respect to this Agreement or any
documents deposited with the Escrow Agent.

 

(v) In performing any duties under this Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall not
be liable to any party for damages, losses or expenses, except as a result of
gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Escrow Agent. The
Escrow Agent shall not incur any such liability for (A) any act or failure to
act made or omitted in good faith; or (B) any action taken or omitted in
reliance upon any instrument, including any written statement or affidavit
provided for in this Agreement that the Escrow Agent shall in good faith
believe to be genuine, nor will the Escrow Agent be liable or responsible for
forgeries, fraud, impersonations, or determining the scope of any
representative authority. In addition, the Escrow Agent may consult with legal
counsel in connection with performing the Escrow Agents duties under this
Agreement and shall be fully protected in any act taken, suffered, or
permitted by him/her in good faith in accordance with the advice of counsel.
The Escrow Agent is not responsible for determining and verifying the
authority of any person acting or purporting to act on behalf of any party to
this Agreement.

(vi) If any controversy arises between the parties to this Agreement, or with
any other party, concerning the subject matter of this Agreement, its terms
or conditions, the Escrow Agent will not be required to determine the
controversy or to take any action regarding it. The Escrow Agent may hold all
documents and the Escrow Fund and may wait for settlement of any such
controversy by final appropriate legal proceedings or other means as, in the
Escrow Agents discretion, may be required, despite what may be set forth
elsewhere in this Agreement. In such event, the Escrow Agent will not be
liable for damages. Furthermore, the Escrow Agent may, at its option, file an
action of interpleader requiring the parties to answer and litigate any claims
and rights among themselves. The Escrow Agent is authorized to deposit with
the clerk of the court all documents and the Escrow Amounts held in escrow,
except all costs, expenses, charges and reasonable attorney fees incurred by
the Escrow Agent due to the interpleader action (the "Agent Interpleader
Expenses") and that the parties agree to pay as follows: 50% to be paid by
Parent and 50% to be paid by the Indemnifying Parties on the basis of the
Indemnifying Parties respective Pro Rata Portions; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in the event any Indemnifying Party fails to timely pay such
Indemnifying Partys Pro Rata Portion of the Agent Interpleader Expenses, then
Parent may at its option pay such Indemnifying Partys Pro Rata Portion of the
Agent Interpleader Expenses and recover an amount equal from such
Indemnifying Partys Pro Rata Portion of the Escrow Fund. Upon initiating such
action, the Escrow Agent shall be fully released and discharged of and from
all obligations and liability imposed by the terms of this Agreement.

 

(vii) Parent and the Indemnifying Parties and their respective successors and
assigns agree jointly and severally to indemnify and hold Escrow Agent
harmless against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, and
expenses, including reasonable costs of investigation, counsel fees, including

 



-96-  allocated costs of in house counsel and disbursements that may be imposed on
Escrow Agent or incurred by Escrow Agent in connection with the performance of
its duties under this Agreement, including any litigation arising from this
Agreement or involving its subject matter, other than those arising out of the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Escrow Agent (the "Agent
Indemnification Expenses") as follows: 50% to be paid by Parent and 50% to be
paid out of the Escrow Fund.

(viii) The Escrow Agent may resign at any time upon giving at least 30 days
written notice to Parent and the Securityholder Representative; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no such resignation shall become effective until the
appointment of a successor escrow agent by Parent (which appointment shall be
subject to the reasonable consent of the Securityholder Representative). The
successor escrow agent shall execute and deliver an instrument accepting such
appointment, and it shall, without further acts, be vested with all the
estates, properties, rights, powers, and duties of the predecessor escrow
agent as if originally named as escrow agent. Upon appointment of a successor
escrow agent, the Escrow Agent shall be discharged from any further duties and
liability under this Agreement.

 

(e) _Fees_. Parent shall pay all initial setup and ongoing maintenance fees of
the Escrow Agent for performance of its duties hereunder in accordance with
the standard fee schedule of the Escrow Agent. It is understood that the fees
and usual charges agreed upon for services of the Escrow Agent shall be
considered compensation for ordinary services as contemplated by this
Agreement. In the event that (i) the conditions of this Agreement are not
promptly fulfilled, (ii) the Escrow Agent renders any service not provided for
in this Agreement but that has been requested by an officer of Parent, (iii)
the parties request a substantial modification of the terms of this Agreement
or (iv) any controversy arises, or if the Escrow Agent is made a party to, or
intervenes in, any litigation pertaining to the Escrow Fund or its subject
matter, then the Escrow Agent shall be reasonably compensated for such
extraordinary services and reimbursed for all costs, attorneys fees,
including allocated costs of in house counsel, and expenses occasioned by such
default, delay, controversy or litigation.

 

(f) _Successor Escrow Agents_. Any corporation into which the Escrow Agent in
its individual capacity may be merged or converted or with which it may be
consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or
consolidation to which the Escrow Agent in its individual capacity shall be a
party, or any corporation to which substantially all the corporate trust
business of the Escrow Agent in its individual capacity may be transferred,
shall be the Escrow Agent under this Agreement without further act.

 

8.7 _Securityholder Representative_.

 

(a) _Terms of Appointment_. By virtue of the adoption and approval of this
Agreement and the approval of the First Step Merger by the Indemnifying
Parties, each of the Indemnifying Parties shall be deemed to have agreed to
appoint the Securityholder Representative as his, her or its agent and
attorney-in-fact, as the Securityholder Representative with full power and
authority to act for and on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties to give and
receive notices and communications, to authorize payment to any Indemnified
Party from the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims by such Indemnified Party
pursuant to Section 8.2(a), to object to such payments, to agree to,
negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and request mediation as
provided in this Agreement and comply with orders of courts and awards of
mediators with respect to such claims, to assert, negotiate, enter into
settlements and compromises of, and request mediation and comply with orders
of courts and awards of mediators with respect to, any other claim by any
Indemnified Party against any Indemnifying Party or by any such
Indemnifying Party against any Indemnified Party or any dispute between any
Indemnified Party and any such Indemnifying Party, to authorize the sale of
all of the shares of Parent Common Stock in the Escrow Fund and deliver an
Escrow Sale Instruction Letter to the Escrow Agent, and to execute all
documents necessary or appropriate in the sole opinion of the Securityholder
Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing, in each case relating
to

 



-97-  this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and to take all
other actions that are either (i) necessary or appropriate in the judgment of
the Securityholder Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing or
(ii) specifically mandated by the terms of this Agreement. The Securityholder
Representative may resign at any time. Such agency may be changed by the
Indemnifying Parties from time to time upon not less than 30 days prior
written notice to Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Securityholder
Representative may not be removed unless holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time agree to such removal and to the identity of the
substituted agent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a vacancy in the position of
Securityholder Representative may be filled by the vote of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time. No bond shall be required of the Securityholder
Representative. After the Closing, notices or communications to or from the
Securityholder Representative shall constitute notice to or from the
Indemnifying Parties.

(b) _Securityholder Representative Expenses_. The Securityholder
Representative shall not be liable for any act done or omitted hereunder as
Securityholder Representative while acting in good faith and without gross
negligence or willful misconduct. The Indemnifying Parties shall severally and
not jointly indemnify the Securityholder Representative and hold the
Securityholder Representative harmless against any losses, liabilities,
damages, claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, fees, costs or
expenses (including the fees and expenses of counsel and experts and
all expenses with respect to document location, duplication and shipment)
arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the
Securityholder Representatives duties hereunder, including the reasonable
fees and expenses of any legal counsel retained by the Securityholder
Representative (collectively, "Securityholder Representative Expenses"), in
each case as such Securityholder Representative Expense is suffered or
incurred; provided, that in the event that any such Securityholder
Representative Expense is finally adjudicated to have been directly caused by
the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Securityholder
Representative, the Securityholder Representative will reimburse the
Indemnifying Parties the amount of such indemnified Securityholder
Representative Expenses to the extent attributable to such bad faith, gross
negligence or willful misconduct. If not paid directly to the Securityholder
Representative by the Indemnifying Parties, any such Securityholder
Representative Expenses shall be recovered by the Securityholder
Representative from if then available after satisfaction of all claims of an
Indemnified Party, the amounts in the Escrow Fund prior to any distribution
thereof to the Indemnifying Parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that while the
Securityholder Representative Expenses may be paid from the Escrow Fund, this
does not relieve the Indemnifying Parties from their obligation to promptly
pay such Securityholder Representative Expenses as they are suffered or
incurred, nor does it prevent the Securityholder Representative from seeking
any remedies available to it at law or otherwise. In no event will
the Securityholder Representative be required to advance his own funds on
behalf of the Indemnifying Parties or otherwise. The Indemnifying Parties
acknowledge and agree that the foregoing indemnities will survive the
resignation or removal of the Securityholder Representative or the
termination of this Agreement. A decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Securityholder Representative, including an amendment, extension or waiver of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.3 and Section 9.4, shall constitute a
decision of the Indemnifying Parties and shall be final, binding and
conclusive upon the Indemnifying Parties, and the Escrow Agent and Parent may
rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of
the Securityholder Representative as being the decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Indemnifying Parties. The Escrow Agent and Parent are
hereby relieved from any liability to any person for any acts done by them in
accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Securityholder Representative.

(c) _Expense Fund_. At the Closing, the Company will wire transfer to the
Securityholder Representative an amount equal to $200,000 (the "Expense
Fund"), which the Securityholder Representative will use solely for the
purpose of paying directly, or reimbursing the Securityholder Representative
for, any third party expenses incurred by the Securityholder Representative
pursuant to this Agreement. The Company Securityholders will not receive any
interest or earnings on the Expense Fund and irrevocably transfer and assign
to the Securityholder Representative any ownership right that they may
otherwise have had in any such

 



-98-  interest or earnings. The Securityholder Representative will not be liable
for any loss of principal of the Expense Fund other than as a result of his
gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Securityholder Representative
will hold the funds in the Expense Fund separate from his other funds, will
not use such funds for his operating expenses or any other purposes and will
not voluntarily make the Expense Fund available to his creditors in the event
of bankruptcy. Contemporaneous with or as soon as practicable following the
release in full of the Escrow Fund, the Securityholder Representative will
deliver the balance of the Expense Fund to Parent (or such other entity
selected by Parent) for further distribution to the Company Securityholders
and among them in proportion to their respective Pro Rata Portion. The Expense
Fund will be considered a Third Party Expense.

to act constitutes a breach of this Agreement;

 

(c) by either the Company or Parent, if any requirement under Law makes the
consummation of the Merger illegal, or if a Governmental Entity of competent
jurisdiction shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any
statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree, injunction, order or other
legal restraint is in effect and that has the effect of permanently
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger, which order,
decree, ruling or other action is final and nonappealable; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
9.1(c) shall not be available to any party hereto whose action or failure to
act has been a principal cause of or resulted in such requirement under Law or
such action;

 

(d) by Parent if the Stockholder Written Consent is not delivered to Parent
within three Business Days after the receipt of a California Permit;

(e) by Parent if there shall be any action taken, or any Law enacted,

Entity, that would constitute an Action of Divestiture;

(f) by Parent if Parent and Merger Subs are not in material breach of any of
their respective obligations under this Agreement and there has been a breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company set
forth in this Agreement such that the conditions set forth in Section 7.2(a)
would not be satisfied, and such breach has not been cured within 20 days
after written notice thereof has been provided to the Company; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no cure period shall be required for a breach that by its
nature cannot be cured and in no event shall the cure period extend beyond the
End Date; or

 



-99- (g) by the Company if the Company is not in material breach of any of its
obligations under this Agreement and there has been a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Parent and Merger Subs set
forth in this Agreement such that the conditions set forth in Section 7.3(a)
would not be satisfied, and such breach has not been cured within 20 days
after written notice thereof has been provided to Parent; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no cure period shall be required for a breach which by its
nature cannot be cured and in no event shall the cure period extend beyond
the End Date.

9.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement as
provided in Section 9.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there
shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Merger Subs, the
Company or any of their respective directors, officers, employees,
stockholders, representatives, agents or Affiliates; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that each party hereto and thereto shall remain liable for any willful or
intentional breaches of this Agreement, any Related Agreements or any
Certificate or other instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement prior to
its termination; and _provided further_ , _however_ , that, the provisions of
Section 6.4, Section 6.5, Section 6.8, Article X and this Section 9.2 shall
remain in full force and effect and survive any termination of this Agreement
pursuant to the terms of this Article IX.

9.3 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at any
time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of the party
against whom enforcement is sought. For purposes of this Section 9.3, the
Indemnifying Parties agree that any amendment of this Agreement following the
Effective Time that is signed by the Securityholder Representative shall be
binding upon and effective against the Indemnifying Parties whether or not
they have signed such amendment.

 

9.4 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing, Parent and Merger
Subs, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, and at any time
following the Effective Time, Parent and the Company, on the one hand, and the
Securityholder Representative, on the other hand, may, to the extent legally
permitted, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations
of the other party hereto; (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations
and warranties made to such party set forth herein or in any document
delivered pursuant hereto; or (c) waive compliance with any of the
covenants, agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party set forth
herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of such party. For purposes of this Section 9.4, the Indemnifying
Parties agree that any extension or waiver signed by the Securityholder
Representative shall be binding upon and effective against all Indemnifying
Parties whether or not they have signed such extension or waiver. No delay or
failure by any party hereto to assert any of its rights or remedies shall
constitute a waiver of such rights or remedies.

10.2 _Counterparts; Execution_. This Agreement and any amendments may be
executed in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one
and the same agreement and shall become effective when one or more
counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and delivered to
the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not sign the
same counterpart. Any such counterpart, to the extent delivered by fax or
.pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpg or similar attachment to email (any such delivery, an
"Electronic Delivery"), shall be treated in all manner and respects as an
original executed counterpart and shall be considered to have the same
binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof
delivered in person. No party hereto shall raise the use of an Electronic
Delivery to deliver a signature, or the fact that any signature or agreement
or instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of an Electronic
Delivery, as a defense to the formation of a contract, and each party forever
waives any such defense, except to the extent such defense relates to lack of
authenticity.

10.3 _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries; Assignment_. This
Agreement, the Exhibits and Schedules to this Agreement, the Disclosure
Schedule, the Confidentiality Agreement and the documents and instruments and
other agreements among the parties hereto referenced herein (a) constitute the
entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersede all prior Contracts among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof; (b) are not intended to, and shall not, confer upon any
other Person any rights or remedies hereunder, other than (i) as set forth in
Section 6.23 and Section 10.11; (ii) the Indemnifying Parties; and (iii) the
Indemnified Parties with respect to the rights under Article VIII; and (c)
shall not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise, except that Parent
may assign its rights and delegate its obligations hereunder to any of its
Affiliates so long as Parent remains ultimately liable for all of Parents
obligations hereunder.

 

10.4 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the
application thereof becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

10.5 _Other Remedies_. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, any
and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party hereto will be
deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby,
or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one
remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

10.6 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed in all respects by the
laws of the State of Delaware.

10.7 _Dispute Resolution_. The parties hereto agree that any legal proceeding
by or against any party hereto or with respect to or arising out of this
Agreement shall be brought exclusively in any state or federal court located
in New Castle County, Delaware. By execution and delivery of this Agreement,
each party hereto irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of such courts and to the appellate courts therefrom solely for
the purposes of disputes arising under the this Agreement and not as a general

 



-102-  submission to such jurisdiction or with respect to any other dispute, matter
or claim whatsoever. The parties hereto irrevocably consent to the service of
process out of any of the aforementioned courts in any such action or
proceeding by the delivery of copies thereof by overnight courier to the
address for such party to which notices are deliverable hereunder. Any such
service of process shall be effective upon delivery. Nothing herein shall
affect the right to serve process in any other manner permitted by applicable
Law. The parties hereto waive any right to stay or dismiss any action or
proceeding under or in connection with this Agreement brought before the
foregoing courts on the basis of (a) any claim that it is not personally
subject to the jurisdiction of such courts for any reason, or that it or any
of its property is immune from the above-described legal process; (b) that
such action or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, that venue for
the action or proceeding is improper or that this Agreement may not be
enforced in or by such courts; or (iii) any other defense that would hinder or
delay the levy, execution or collection of any amount to which any party
hereto is entitled pursuant to any final judgment of any court having
jurisdiction.

10.8 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES
ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER
BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN THE NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

10.9 _USA Patriot Act Compliance_. To help the government fight the funding
of terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires all
financial institutions to obtain, verify and record information that
identifies each Person who opens an account. For a non-individual Person,
the Escrow Agent will ask for documentation to verify its formation and
existence as a legal entity. The Escrow Agent may also ask to see financial
statements, licenses and identification and authorization documents from
individuals claiming authority to represent the Person or other relevant
documentation. The parties hereto each agree to provide all such information
and documentation as to themselves as requested by Escrow Agent to ensure
compliance with federal law.

 

10.10 _Escrow Security Procedures_.

 

(a) _Security Procedures_. Parent and the Securityholder Representative shall
each deliver to the Escrow Agent a fully executed incumbency certificate
naming the officers who have the authority to execute and amend this
Agreement. Exhibit K names the authorized representatives who are authorized
to provide disbursement instructions with respect to the Escrow Fund, and
the Escrow Agent may rely upon the confirmation of anyone purporting to be
any such officer or authorized representative. In the event funds transfer
instructions are given, whether in writing or by fax, the Escrow Agent is
authorized to seek confirmation of such instructions by telephone call-back
to one or more of the persons designated in Schedule 10.10 who is different
from the person who gave the transfer instruction, and the Escrow Agent may
rely upon the confirmation of anyone purporting to be the person so
designated. The persons and telephone numbers for call-backs may be changed
only in a writing actually received and acknowledged by the Escrow Agent. The
Escrow Agent and the beneficiarys bank in any funds transfer to Parent may
rely solely upon any account numbers or similar identifying numbers provided
by Parent to identify (i) the beneficiary; (ii) the beneficiarys bank; or
(iii) an intermediary bank. The Escrow Agent may apply any of the Escrow Fund
for any payment order it executes using any such identifying number in a
manner consistent with the written instructions from (A) Parent, to the extent
that it relates to payments to Parent; or (B) the
Securityholder Representative, to the extent that it relates to payments to
the Securityholder Representative or the Indemnifying Parties. Parent and the
Securityholder Representative each acknowledge that the security procedures
set forth in this Section 10.10 are commercially reasonable.

(b) _Disbursement to Parent_. Unless the Escrow Agent is otherwise instructed
in writing by Parent, Parent acknowledges that the Escrow Agent is authorized
to use the funds transfer instructions to disburse any funds due to Parent
under this Agreement without a verifying call-back as set forth on Exhibit K.

 



-103- 10.11 _Representation of Company Securityholders and the Company_. Each of the
parties to this Agreement hereby acknowledges and agrees, on its own behalf
and on behalf of each of its Affiliates, that (a) OMelveny and Myers LLP
("OMM") represents and has represented the Company and various of the Company
Securityholders in other matters; (b) OMM may serve as counsel to each and any
Company Securityholder and its respective Affiliates in the negotiation,
preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of
the Merger and other transactions contemplated hereby; and (c) following the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, OMM
(or any successor) may serve as counsel to any Company Securityholder or to
the Securityholder Representative in connection with any litigation, claim or
obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby notwithstanding such representation or
any continued representation of any Company Securityholder or any of their
Affiliates in matters relating to the Company, its Subsidiaries, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby, and each of the parties hereto
(on its own behalf and on behalf of its respective affiliates) consents to
the foregoing and irrevocably waives any conflict of interest arising
therefrom. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing does not constitute a
waiver by Parent or any of its Affiliates of any conflict arising out of
OMMs representation of Parent or any of its Affiliates (including the
Surviving Corporation) following the Effective Time. OMM is an intended third
party beneficiary of this Section 10.11.

 

10.12 _Privileged Information_. Parent, for itself, Merger Subs, the Interim
Surviving Entity and the Final Surviving Entity and its and their respective
successors and assigns, hereby irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that all
attorney-client privileged communications between the Company Stockholders,
the Company and counsel to the Company made exclusively in connection with
the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and closing under, or any
dispute or proceeding arising under or in connection with, this Agreement that
immediately prior to the Closing would be deemed to be privileged
communications of the Company Stockholders, the Company or its counsel and
would not be subject to disclosure to Parent, the Interim Surviving Entity or
the Final Surviving Entity in connection with any process relating to a
dispute arising under or in connection with this Agreement or any of the
Related Agreements shall continue after the Closing to be privileged
communications with such counsel, and none of Parent, the Interim Surviving
Entity or the Final Surviving Entity shall seek to obtain such communications
by any process on the grounds that the privilege attaching to such
communications belongs to the Company and not the Company Stockholders. Other
than as explicitly set forth in this Section 10.12, the parties hereto
acknowledge that any attorney-client privilege attaching as a result of
counsel representing the Company prior to the Closing shall survive the
Closing and continue to be a privilege of the Interim Surviving Entity and the
Final Surviving Entity, and not the Company Stockholders, after the Closing.
