shall have any competitive interests with Parent the Securityholder Representative and the Management Representative. Parent, on the one hand, and the Securityholder Representative and the Management Representative, on the other hand, shall each
select one arbitrator. The two arbitrators so selected shall select a third arbitrator. In any such arbitration, each party shall be limited to calling a total of three witnesses, both for purposes of deposition and the arbitration hearing. Subject
to the foregoing limitation on the number of witnesses, the arbitrator or arbitrators, as the case may be, shall set a limited time period and establish procedures designed to reduce the cost and time for discovery while allowing the parties an
opportunity, adequate in the sole judgment of the arbitrator or majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be, to discover relevant information from the opposing parties about the subject matter of the dispute. The arbitrator, or a majority
of the three arbitrators, as the case may be, shall rule upon motions to compel or limit discovery and shall have the authority to impose sanctions for discovery abuses, including attorneys&#146; fees and costs, to the same extent as a competent
court of law or equity should the arbitrators or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be, determine that discovery was sought without substantial justification or that discovery was refused or objected to without substantial
justification. The decision of the arbitrator or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be, as to the changes to the milestones and scope of the First Earnout, the Second Earnout and the Third Earnout, as well as the Fully Loaded Cost
amounts set forth on Schedule&nbsp;2.16, shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement and the Company Securityholders, and, if necessary, may be enforced in any court having competent jurisdiction by suit on the decision
or in any other matter provided by applicable Law. Such decision shall be written and shall be supported by written findings of fact and conclusions that shall set forth the determination of the arbitrator(s). The arbitrator(s) shall also make a
determination as how the costs of the arbitration should be allocated between Parent, on the one hand, and the Securityholder Representative and the Management Representative (in each case, on behalf of the Company Securityholders), on the other
hand, and each party waives its right to seek an order compelling the other party to pay its portion of its costs and expenses (including attorneys&#146; fees) for any arbitration. </P>

the accomplishment of the foregoing or (ii)&nbsp;specifically mandated by the terms of this Agreement. The Securityholder Representative may resign at any time. Such agency may be changed by the Indemnifying Parties from time to time upon not less

Representative and hold the Securityholder Representative harmless against any losses, liabilities, damages, claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, fees, costs or expenses (including the fees and expenses of counsel and experts and all
expenses with respect to document location, duplication and shipment) arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Securityholder Representative&#146;s duties hereunder, including the reasonable fees and expenses of

event that any such Securityholder Representative Expense is finally adjudicated to have been directly caused by the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Securityholder Representative, the Securityholder Representative will
reimburse the Indemnifying Parties the amount of such indemnified Securityholder Representative Expenses to the extent attributable to such bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct. If not paid directly to the Securityholder Representative
by the Indemnifying Parties, any such Securityholder Representative Expenses shall be recovered by the Securityholder Representative from if then available after satisfaction of all claims of an Indemnified Party, the amounts in the Escrow Fund
prior to any distribution thereof to the Indemnifying Parties; <I>provided</I>, <I>however</I>, that while the Securityholder Representative Expenses may be paid from the Escrow Fund, this does not relieve the Indemnifying Parties from their
obligation to promptly pay such Securityholder Representative Expenses as they are suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent the Securityholder Representative from seeking any remedies available to it at law or otherwise. In no event will the
Securityholder Representative be required to advance his own funds on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties or otherwise. The Indemnifying Parties acknowledge and agree that the foregoing indemnities will survive the resignation or removal of the
Securityholder Representative or the termination of this Agreement. A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Securityholder Representative, including an amendment, extension or waiver of this Agreement pursuant to Section&nbsp;9.3 and
Section&nbsp;9.4, shall constitute a decision of the Indemnifying Parties and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the Indemnifying Parties, and the Escrow Agent and Parent may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Securityholder Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of the Indemnifying Parties. The Escrow Agent and Parent are hereby relieved from any liability to any person for any acts done by them in accordance with such

Securityholder Representative will hold the funds in the Expense Fund separate from his other funds, will not use such funds for his operating expenses or any other purposes and will not voluntarily make the Expense Fund available to his creditors
