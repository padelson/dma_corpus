Re: _Sponsor Earnout Letter_

  



  

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  



  

Reference is made to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of
the date hereof (as it may be amended, the " _Merger Agreement_ "), by
and among (i) Forum Merger II Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "
_Parent_ "), (ii) Sprout Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a
wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Parent, (iii) Myjojo, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the " _Company_ "), and (iv) Salvatore Galletti, in the capacity
as the initial Holder Representative. Unless otherwise defined herein,
capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the
Merger Agreement.

  



  

In order to induce the Company to enter into the Merger Agreement, the
Sponsor has agreed to enter into this letter agreement (this " _Agreement_
"). Pursuant to and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
the Sponsor agrees to place into escrow 2,500,000 shares of Parent Common
Stock that were purchased by Sponsor in a private placement prior to the IPO
(the " _Sponsor Earnout Shares_ ").

  



  

For good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are
hereby acknowledged, the Sponsor and each of the undersigned parties hereby
agrees as follows:

  



   | 1.| The Sponsor hereby agrees that, upon and subject to the Closing,
the Sponsor will place the Sponsor Earnout Shares into escrow in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement. Sponsor acknowledges
and agrees that such Sponsor Earnout Shares will thereafter be subject to the
vesting terms set forth in the Merger Agreement and if such vesting
conditions are not satisfied, such Sponsor Earnout Shares shall be subject to
forfeiture. If all or any portion of the Sponsor Earnout Shares vest in
accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, any restrictive legends
that have been placed on the Sponsor Earnout Shares, other than those, if
any, required by applicable securities laws, shall be removed (and the
undersigned parties agree to cooperate with the Sponsor in securing the
removal of such restrictive legends, if any, that have been placed on the
Sponsor Earnout Shares). 
---|---|---

   | 2.| The Sponsor hereby agrees that, from and after the Closing, the
Sponsor shall not sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of, or hypothecate or
otherwise grant any interest in or to, any of the Sponsor Earnout Shares,
unless and until such shares have become vested in accordance with the terms
of the Merger Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 3.| This Agreement, together with the Merger Agreement to the extent
referenced herein, constitutes the entire agreement and understanding of the
parties hereto in respect of the subject matter hereof and supersedes all
prior understandings, agreements, or representations by or among the parties
hereto, written or oral, relating to the subject matter hereof. This
Agreement may not be changed, amended, modified or waived as to any
particular provision, except by a written instrument executed by all parties
hereto. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 4.| No party hereto may assign either this Agreement or any of its
rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent
of the other parties hereto, and any purported assignment in violation of the
foregoing shall be null and void ab initio. This Agreement shall be binding
on the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 5.| This Agreement shall be construed and interpreted in a manner
consistent with the provisions of the Merger Agreement. In the event of any
conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the Merger Agreement, the
terms of the Merger Agreement shall govern. The provisions set forth in
Section 10.6, 10.7, 10.10 and 10.12 of the Merger Agreement, as in effect as
of the date hereof, are hereby incorporated by reference into, and shall be
deemed to apply to, this Agreement as if all references to the "Agreement" in
such sections were instead references to this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 6.| Any notice, consent or request to be given in connection with any
of the terms or provisions of this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be
sent in the same manner as provided in the Merger Agreement, with notices to
the Sponsor, the Parent, the Company and the Holder Representative being sent
to the addresses set forth therein, in each case with all copies as required
thereunder. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 7.| This Agreement shall terminate at such time, if any, as the Merger
Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, and upon such
termination this Agreement shall be null and void and of no effect whatsoever,
and the parties hereto shall have no obligations under this Agreement.
