warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE I.

 

THE MERGER

1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in
accordance with the North Carolina Business Corporation Act (the " _NCBCA_ "),
at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall merge with and into Target. Target
shall be the Surviving Company in the Merger, and shall continue its
corporate existence under the laws of the State of North Carolina. Upon
consummation of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub
shall terminate.

 

1.2 _Effective Time_. The Merger shall become effective as set forth in the
articles of merger (the " _Articles of Merger_ ") that shall be filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of North Carolina (the " _North Carolina
Secretary_ ") on the Closing Date. The term " _Effective Time_ " shall be the
date and time when the Merger becomes effective, as set forth in the Articles
of Merger.

1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger
shall have the effects set forth in Section 55-11-06 of the NCBCA.

1.4 _Conversion of Target Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Target, Parent, Merger Sub or
the holder of any of the following securities:

 

(a) Subject to _Section 2.2(e)_, each share of the common stock, no par value
per share, of Target (including shares of Target Non-Voting Common Stock, the
" _Target Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, except for shares of Target Common Stock owned by Target,
Parent or Merger Sub (other than shares of Target Common Stock held in trust
accounts, managed accounts and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or
agency capacity, that are beneficially owned by third parties (any such shares
held in a fiduciary or agency capacity by Target, Parent or any of
their respective Subsidiaries, as the case may be, being referred to herein
as " _Trust Account Shares_ ") and shares of Target Common Stock held on
account of a debt previously contracted (" _DPC Shares_ ")), shall be
converted into the right to receive 0.5235 validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable shares (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of the common stock, $1.00 par
value per share, of Parent (the " _Parent Common Stock_ ") together with cash
in lieu of any fractional shares in accordance with the provisions of
_Section 2.2(e)_ of this Agreement (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). No
shares of preferred stock of Parent will be issued in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) All of the shares of Target Common Stock converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article I_ shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist
as of the Effective Time, and each certificate previously representing any
such shares of Target Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") and each
uncertificated share of Target Common Stock (each, an " _Uncertificated Share_
") registered to a holder of Target Common Stock shall thereafter represent
only the right to receive a certificate (or at Parents option, evidence of
shares in book entry form) representing the Merger Consideration in whole
shares of Parent Common Stock, together with any cash in lieu of fractional
shares pursuant to _Section 2.2(e)_, into which the shares of Target Common
Stock represented by such Certificate or Uncertificated Share have been
converted pursuant to this _Section 1.4_ and _Section 2.2(e)_ and any
dividends or distributions with respect thereto which the holder has the
right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)_. Certificates and
Uncertificated Shares previously representing shares of Target Common Stock
that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
shall be exchanged for certificates (or at Parents option, evidence of
shares in book entry form) representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock
equal to the Merger Consideration, together with any cash in lieu of
fractional shares and any dividends or distributions with respect thereto
which the holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)_, in
consideration therefor upon the surrender of such Certificates or transfer
of 

 



2  such Uncertificated Shares in accordance with _Section 2.2_.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, prior to the
Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or Target
Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased, or changed into or
exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities as a result
of a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock
dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or other similar change in
capitalization, an equitable and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the
Exchange Ratio per share and Merger Consideration payable pursuant to this
Agreement and any amounts payable to the holders of Target Equity Awards
pursuant to this Agreement.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at
the Effective Time, all shares of Target Capital Stock that are owned by
Target, Parent or Merger Sub (other than Trust Account Shares and DPC Shares)
shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and neither the Merger
Consideration nor any other consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

1.5 _Parent Capital Stock_. At and after the Effective Time, each share
of Parent Capital Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding and shall not be affected
by the Merger.

 

1.6 _Merger Sub Common Stock_. At and after the Effective Time, each share of
common stock of Merger Sub, no par value per share (the " _Merger Sub Common
Stock_ "), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into one share of common stock, no par value per share, of
the Surviving Company.

 

1.7 _Treatment of Target Equity Awards_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to acquire shares of Target
Common Stock (a " _Target Stock Option_ ") issued pursuant to Targets
equity-based compensation plans identified in _Section 4.12(a)_ of the Target
Disclosure Schedule (the " _Target Stock Plans_ ") that is outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall
become fully vested and shall be cancelled and converted automatically into
the right to receive a cash payment from Parent or Parent Bank (the " _Cash
Out Amount_ ") in an amount equal to the product of (x) the excess, if any,
of the Merger Consideration Price (as defined below) over the exercise price
of each such Target Stock Option and (y) the number of shares of Target Common
Stock subject to such option to the extent not previously exercised. After
the Effective Time, any such cancelled Target Stock Option shall no longer be
exercisable by the former holder thereof, but shall only entitle the holder to
the payment of the Cash Out Amount, without interest. In the event the
exercise price per share of Target Common Stock subject to a Target Stock
Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration Price, such Target
Stock Option shall be cancelled without consideration and have no further
force or effect. For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Merger
Consideration Price_ " means the product of (i) the Exchange Ratio multiplied
by (ii) the Parent Share Closing Price.

 

(b) At the Effective Time, each outstanding award of shares of Target Common
Stock subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse restriction (a " _Target
Restricted Share Award_ ") granted under the Target Stock Plans, whether
vested or unvested, that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Target Restricted Share Awards granted on or
after December 31, 2016) shall become fully vested and shall be cancelled and
converted automatically into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
respect of each share of Target Common Stock underlying such Target Restricted
Share Award. 

(c) At the Effective Time, each outstanding Target Restricted Share Award
granted on or after December 31, 2016 (and not as of the Effective Time
previously forfeited or otherwise delivered to or retained by Target in
connection with the payment of any withholding taxes associated with such
award), shall be converted into an award (a " _Parent Restricted Share Award_
") of a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of (i)
the number of shares of Target Common Stock subject to the corresponding
Target Restricted Share Award multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio.
Each Parent Restricted Share Award shall, unless otherwise provided for in an
agreement by and between the grantee and Parent, be subject to the same terms,
conditions and restrictions as applied to the corresponding Target Restricted
Share Award immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



3 (d) At the Effective Time, each outstanding restricted stock unit award in
respect of shares of Target Common Stock (a " _Target RSU Award_ " and any
such award or Target Stock Option or Target Restricted Share Award, a "
_Target Equity Award_ ") granted under the Target Stock Plans, whether vested
or unvested, that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall become fully vested and shall be cancelled and converted
automatically into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of
each share of Target Common Stock underlying such Target RSU Award.

(e) At or as soon as practicable following the Effective Time (which may be in
connection with the payment of the first regular base salary payment due to
such holder following the Closing, but in any event shall occur within thirty
(30) days of the Effective Time), Parent or Parent Bank shall deliver the Cash
Out Amount to the holders of Target Stock Options, without interest. Such
payments may be reduced by any Taxes withheld pursuant to Section 2.3.

(f) At or as soon as practicable following the Effective Time (which may be
in connection with the payment of the first regular base salary payment due to
such holder following the Closing, but in any event shall occur within ten
(10) business days of the Effective Time), Parent or Parent Bank shall
deliver any Merger Consideration payable pursuant to _Sections 1.7(b)_ or
_1.7(d)_ to the holders of Target Restricted Share Awards and Target RSU
Awards. Such payments may be reduced by any Taxes withheld pursuant to
_Section 2.3_.

(g) At or prior to the Effective Time, Target and Parent, through their
respective board of directors or the appropriate committee thereof, shall
adopt any resolutions and take any actions that are necessary to effectuate
the provisions of this _Section 1.7_.

 

(h) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a
number of shares of Parent Common Stock in respect of Parent Restricted Share
Awards issued pursuant to _Section 1.7(c)_. Effective as of the Effective
Time, Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor
or other appropriate form) with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock
subject to such Parent Restricted Share Awards and shall maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and
maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained
therein) for so long as such awards remain outstanding.

1.8 _Articles of Surviving Company_. At the Effective Time, the articles of
incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time (the " _Merger Sub Articles_ "), shall be the articles of incorporation
of the Surviving Company until thereafter amended in accordance with
applicable law;  _provided_ , that the name of the Surviving Company as
reflected in the Merger Sub Articles shall be "BNC Bancorp".

name of the Surviving Company as reflected in the Merger Sub Bylaws shall be
"BNC Bancorp".

 

1.10 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended that the Mergers, taken together,
shall constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code and that this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization"
for the purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.

 

1.11 ___Officers and Directors of Surviving Company_. The officers and
directors of Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
continue as the officers and directors of the Surviving Company.

1.12 _The Second Step Merger_.

 

(a) _The Second Step Merger._ On the Closing Date and as soon as reasonably
practicable following the Effective Time, in accordance with the Tennessee
Business Corporation Act (the " _TBCA_ ") and the NCBCA, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Company to be merged with and into Parent in the Second Step
Merger, with

 



4  Parent surviving the Second Step Merger as the Surviving Corporation and
continuing its existence under the laws of the State of Tennessee, and the
separate corporate existence of the Surviving Company ceasing as of the
Second Effective Time. In furtherance of the foregoing, Parent shall cause to
be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Tennessee (the "
_Tennessee Secretary_ "), in accordance with the TBCA, articles of merger
(the " _Tennessee Articles of Merger_ ") relating to the Second Step Merger
and shall cause to be filed with the North Carolina Secretary, in accordance
with the NCBCA, articles of merger relating to the Second Step Merger (the "

2.1 _Deposit of Merger Consideration_. At or prior to the Closing, Parent
shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to Target and Parent (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the
benefit of the holders of Certificates and Uncertificated Shares, for exchange
in accordance with this  _Article II_, certificates (or at Parents option,
evidence of shares in book entry form) representing the shares of Parent
Common Stock constituting the Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of any
fractional shares with 

 



5  respect to the Merger Consideration (such cash and certificates for shares
of Parent Common Stock (or at Parents option, evidence of shares in book
entry form), together with any dividends or distributions with respect
thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "), to be
issued pursuant to _Section 1.4_ and paid pursuant to _Section 1.4_ and
_Section 2.2(e)_ in exchange for shares of Target Common Stock outstanding
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Exchange Agent shall not be
entitled to vote or exercise any other rights of ownership with respect to the
shares of Parent Common Stock held by it from time to time hereunder, except
that it shall receive and hold all dividends and other distributions payable
or distributable with respect to such shares for the account of the persons
entitled thereto.

 

2.2 _Delivery of Merger Consideration_.

 

(a) As soon as practicable, but in no event later than five (5) business days
after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to
each holder of record of one or more Certificates or Uncertificated Shares a
letter of transmittal (" _Letter of Transmittal_ ") in customary form as
reasonably agreed by the parties hereto (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss of and title shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the
Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates or the transfer of the Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the
Merger Consideration. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate or Certificates
to the Exchange Agent for exchange and cancellation, together with such
properly completed Letter of Transmittal or upon receipt of an "agents
message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as
the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book entry
transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the holder of such Certificate or
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares, as applicable, shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor, as applicable, (i) the Merger Consideration that
such holder of the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares shall have become
entitled pursuant to the provisions of _Article I_ , including cash in lieu of
any fractional shares in accordance with the provisions of _Section 2.2(e)_;
and (ii) a check representing the amount of any dividends or distributions
that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)_, and the
Certificate or Certificates so surrendered or the Uncertificated Share or
Uncertificated Shares transferred shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest
will be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration, including on any cash
payable in lieu of fractional shares, or on any unpaid dividends and
distributions payable to holders of Certificates or Uncertificated Shares.

 

(b) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Parent Common
Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or
untransferred Uncertificated Share with respect to the shares of Parent Common
Stock represented thereby until the holder thereof shall surrender such
Certificate or transfer such Uncertificated Share in accordance with this 
_Article II_. After the surrender of a Certificate or transfer of an
Uncertificated Share in accordance with this _Article II_ , the record holder
thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other
distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become
payable with respect to the whole shares of Parent Common Stock which the
shares of Target Common Stock represented by such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share have been converted into the right to receive.

(c) If any certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock is to be
issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate or Certificates
surrendered or the Uncertificated Share or Uncertificated Shares transferred
in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall be a condition of the
issuance thereof that the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer)
and otherwise in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share or
Uncertificated Shares shall be properly transferred, and that the person
requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any
transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate
representing shares of Parent Common Stock in any name other than that of the
registered holder of the Certificate or Certificates surrendered or
Uncertificated Share or Uncertificated Shares transferred, or required for any
other reason, or shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

 



6 (d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of Target of the shares of Target Common Stock that were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented for
transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the
Merger Consideration and any dividends or distributions that such holder is
entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)_.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no certificates
or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be
issued upon the surrender of Certificates or transfer of Uncertificated Shares
for exchange, no dividend or distribution with respect to Parent Common Stock
shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such
fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any other rights of a shareholder of Parent. In lieu of the issuance of any
such fractional share, Parent shall pay to each former shareholder of Target
who otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in
cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) the average
of the closing prices of Parent Common Stock on the Nasdaq Global Select
Market (" _Nasdaq_ "), or such other securities market or stock exchange on
which the Parent Common Stock then principally trades, for the ten (10)
trading days ending on the trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date
(the " _Parent Share Closing Price_ ") by (ii) the fraction of a share
(rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Parent
Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive
pursuant to _Section 1.4_.

 

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of Target as of the first anniversary of the Effective
Time shall be delivered to Parent. Any former shareholders of Target who have
not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to
Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration and any unpaid dividends and
distributions on the Parent Common Stock deliverable in respect of each share
of Target Common Stock such shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this
Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of Target, its Subsidiaries, Parent, Parent Bank, the
Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of
shares of Target Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
laws.

(g) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by
Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Parent may
determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent, or if
the Merger Consideration payable with respect to such Certificate has been
returned to Parent pursuant to _Section 2.2(f)_, Parent, will issue the
Merger Consideration and any unpaid dividends and distributions in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate.

(h) The payment of any transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration, value added and other Taxes and fees (including any penalties
and interest) incurred solely by a holder of shares of Target Common Stock in
connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and the filing of any related Tax returns and other documentation
with respect to such Taxes and fees, shall be the sole responsibility of such
holder.

 

2.3 _Withholding_. Each of Parent, Parent Bank, Target and the Surviving
Corporation is entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent
to deduct and withhold, from any consideration payable or otherwise
deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of
shares of Target Common Stock or Target Equity Awards such amounts as are
required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code, or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax law or under any other applicable
legal requirement. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld and
remitted on a timely basis to the appropriate Governmental Entities, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been
paid to the person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid. The
parties hereto shall reasonably cooperate to reduce or eliminate any such
deduction or withholding to the extent permissible under applicable law.

requirement contained in a provision hereof or as an exception to one or more
representations or warranties contained in this _Article III_ or to one
or more of Parents covenants contained in _Article V_ , _provided, however_
, that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) no
such item is required to be set forth in such schedule as an exception to
a representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the related
representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (ii) the mere
inclusion of an item in such schedule as an exception to a representation or
warranty shall not be deemed an admission by Parent that such item represents
a material exception or material fact, event or circumstance or that such item

Parent and (iii) any disclosures made with respect to a section of this
_Article III_ shall be deemed to qualify any other section of this _Article

cross reference) from a reading of the disclosure that such disclosure applies
to such section), Parent and Merger Sub hereby represent and warrant to Target
as follows:

standing under the laws of the State of Tennessee. Merger Sub is
a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the State of North Carolina. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has full

authorizations which are legally required) to own, lease and operate its
properties and to engage in the business and activities now conducted by it,
except where the failure to have such licenses, franchises, permits and other
governmental authorizations would not, either individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. As used in this
Agreement, the term " _Material Adverse Effect_ " means, with respect to
Parent, Target or the Surviving Company, as the case may be, a material
adverse effect on (i) the business, operations, results of operations, or
financial condition of such party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or
(ii) the ability of such party to timely consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby; _provided, however,_ that with respect to clause (i), the
following shall not be deemed to have or contribute to, or be taken into
account in determining whether there has been or would reasonably be expected
to be, a Material Adverse Effect: any change or event caused by or resulting
from (A) changes, after the date hereof, in prevailing interest rates,
currency exchange rates or other economic or monetary conditions in
the United States or elsewhere, (B) changes, after the date hereof, in United

trading prices, or trading volume, of a partys capital stock, by itself (it

 



8  being understood that any facts or circumstances giving rise to or
contributing to such change that are not otherwise excluded from the
definition of Material Adverse Effect may be taken into account in
determining whether there has been or would reasonably be expected to be a
Material Adverse Effect), or (J) the failure by Target or Parent to meet any
internal or published industry analyst projections, forecasts or estimates
of revenues or earnings or other financial or operating metrics for any
period (it being understood that any facts or circumstances giving rise to or
contributing to such failure that are not otherwise excluded from the
definition of Material Adverse Effect may be taken into account in
determining whether there has been or would reasonably be expected to be a
Material Adverse Effect).

 

(b) Parent is a financial holding company registered under the Bank Holding
Company Act of 1956, as amended (the " _BHC Act_ "). True and complete copies

all jurisdictions (whether federal, state, local or foreign) where its

standing would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on Parent and (iv) has all requisite corporate or limited liability company,
as applicable, power and authority to own or lease its properties and assets
and to carry on its business as now conducted, except to the extent that the
failure to have such power or authority would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. As used in this Agreement, the word
" _Subsidiary_ " when used with respect to any party means any bank, savings
bank, corporation, partnership, limited liability company, or other
organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated, which is consolidated
with such party for financial reporting purposes under GAAP.

"takeover" or "interested shareholder" law (any such laws, " _Takeover
Statutes_ ").

would reasonably be expected to prevent the Mergers, taken together, from
qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code.

3.29 _Information Supplied_. The information relating to Parent and its
Subsidiaries that is provided by Parent or its representatives specifically
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (a) the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, on the date it (and any amendment or supplement
thereto) is first mailed to Parents and Targets shareholders and at the time
of the Parent Shareholders Meeting and the Target Shareholders Meeting, (b)
the Form S-4, when it and any amendment thereto becomes effective under the
Securities Act, and (c) any other document filed with any other Regulatory
Agency in connection herewith, will not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they are made, not
misleading. The Form S-4 and the portions of the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus relating to Parent and its Subsidiaries and other
portions within the reasonable control of Parent and its Subsidiaries will
comply in all material respects with the provisions of the Securities Act and
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no representation or warranty is made by Parent with respect to
statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on information
provided or supplied by or on behalf of Target or its Subsidiaries for
inclusion in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4.

 

3.30 _Internal Controls_. The records, systems, controls, data and information
of Parent and its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated
under means (including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process,
whether computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct
control of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or accountants engaged
or utilized by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including all means of
access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-
direct control that would not reasonably be likely to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Parent
has implemented and maintains a system of (i) disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that
material information relating to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is made
known to the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of Parent
by others within those entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosures and to make the certifications required by the
Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "
_Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), and (ii) internal control over financial reporting
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act)
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP. Parent has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation prior to the date hereof, to Parents outside auditors and the
audit committee of Parents board of directors (x) any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely
affect Parents ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information, and (y) to the knowledge of Parent, any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in Parents internal controls over financial reporting. Copies of any
such disclosures were made in writing by management to Parents auditors and
audit committee and a copy has been previously made available to Target. To
the knowledge of Parent, there is no reason to believe that Parents outside
auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not
be able to give the certifications and attestations required pursuant to
the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act, without qualification, prior to the Closing Date.

 



21 3.31 _Opinion of Parent Financial Advisor_. Prior to the execution of this
Agreement, the board of directors of Parent has received an opinion (which,
if initially rendered verbally, has been or will be confirmed by a written
opinion, dated the same date) of Keefe, Bruyette and Woods, Inc. to the effect
that as of the date thereof and based upon and subject to the factors,
assumptions and limitations set forth therein, the Exchange Ratio is fair from
a financial point of view to Parent. Such opinion has not been amended or
rescinded as of the date of this Agreement.

 

3.32 _No Further Representations_.

 

(a) Except for the representations and warranties made by Parent and Merger
Sub in this _Article III_ , neither Parent nor Merger Sub nor any other
person makes any express or implied representation or warranty with respect to
Parent, its Subsidiaries, Merger Sub, or their respective businesses,
operations, assets, liabilities or conditions (financial or otherwise), and
Parent and Merger Sub hereby disclaim any such other representations or
warranties. In particular, without limiting the foregoing disclaimer, neither
Parent nor Merger Sub nor any other person makes or has made any

representatives with respect to (i) any financial projection, forecast,
estimate, budget or prospective information relating to Parent, Merger Sub,

except for the representations and warranties made by Parent and Merger Sub in
this _Article III_ , any oral or written information presented to the Target
or any of its affiliates or representatives in the course of their
due diligence investigation of Parent, the negotiation of this Agreement or
in the course of the transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that neither Target nor any
other person has made or is making, and they have not relied upon, any express
or implied representation or warranty regarding Target or any of its
Subsidiaries other than those contained in _Article IV_.

imposed pursuant to Section 4975 or 4976 of the Code, and (vi) there are no
pending or, to the knowledge of Target, threatened or anticipated claims

the Target Benefit Plans or any trusts related thereto.

 

(f) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in conjunction
with any other event) (i) result (either alone or upon the occurrence of any
additional acts or events) in any payment (including, without limitation,
severance, unemployment compensation, "excess parachute payment" (within the
meaning of Section 280G of the Code), forgiveness of indebtedness or
otherwise) becoming due to any director or any employee of Target or any of
its affiliates from Target or any of its affiliates under any Target Benefit
Plan or otherwise, (ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable under any
Target Benefit Plan or (iii) result in any acceleration of the time of payment
or vesting of any such benefits. Target has made available to Parent
preliminary drafts of Section 280G calculations (that are not final and are

based as set forth therein), which to Targets knowledge are based on true,
correct and complete data as of the date hereof, in all material respects,

be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Target, each Target Benefit
Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (within the meaning

Target and each of its Subsidiaries have since January 1, 2014 complied in all
material respects with, and are not in default in any material respect under,
any applicable law, statute, order, rule, regulation, policy, agreement and/or
guideline of any Governmental Entity or Regulatory Agency relating to Target
or any of its Subsidiaries, except where the failure to hold such license,
franchise, permit, patent, trademark or authorization or such noncompliance or
default would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Target, including, without
limitation, laws related to data protection or privacy, the USA PATRIOT Act,
the Bank Secrecy Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B, the
Fair Housing Act, the Community Reinvestment Act, the Fair Credit Reporting

by any Governmental Entity or Regulatory Agency and that meets the
requirements of Sections 352 and 326 of the USA Patriot Act.

be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Target, Target and each of

them acts as a fiduciary, including accounts for which each of them serves as
a trustee, agent, custodian, personal representative, guardian, conservator
or investment advisor, in accordance with the terms of the governing
documents, applicable state and federal law and regulation and common law.
None of Target, any of its Subsidiaries, or any director, officer or employee
of Target or of any of its Subsidiaries, has committed any breach of trust or

to any material assets, rights or properties of Target or its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole. Each contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding of
the type described in this _Section 4.14(a)_ (excluding any Target Benefit

policies, agreements, and guidelines of any Governmental Entity or Regulatory
Agency) (the " _Target Data_ "), against any unauthorized or improper use,
access, transmittal, interruption, modification or corruption, except where
the failure to have in place such policies and procedures has not had and
would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on Target. Target and Target Bank are in
compliance with applicable federal and state confidentiality and data security
laws, statutes, orders, rules, regulations, policies, agreements, and
guidelines of any Governmental Entity or Regulatory Agency including, without

control of Target or any of its Subsidiaries or accountants engaged
or utilized by Target or any of its Subsidiaries (including all means of
access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-
direct control that would not reasonably be likely to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Target. Target
has implemented and maintains a system of (i) disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that
material information relating to Target or any of its Subsidiaries is made
known to the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of Target
by others within those entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions

Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (ii)
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and

the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Target has
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to
Targets outside auditors and the audit committee of Targets board of
directors (x) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are

summarize and report financial information, and (y) to the knowledge of
Target, any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in Targets internal controls over
financial reporting. Copies of any such disclosures were made in writing by
management to Targets auditors and audit committee and a copy has been
previously made available to Parent. To the knowledge of Target, there is no
reason to believe that Targets outside auditors and its chief executive
officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give the
certifications

 



38  and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted
pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification,
prior to the Closing Date.

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

6.1 _Regulatory Matters._

 

(a) Target and Parent shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC, no later
than thirty-five (35) business days after the date of this Agreement, the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and Parent shall promptly prepare and file
with the SEC the Form S-4, in which the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus will
be included as a prospectus. Each of Target and Parent shall use
their reasonable best efforts in consultation with their respective legal
counsel to have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as practicable after such filing, and Parent and Target shall
thereafter promptly mail or deliver the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to
their respective shareholders. Parent shall also use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and
approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and Target shall furnish all information concerning Target and the
holders of Target Capital Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection
with any such action. If at any time any information relating to any of the
parties, or their respective affiliates, officers or directors, should be
discovered by a party, which information should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to any of the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus
so that such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the
party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties
hereto and, to the extent required by law, rules or regulations, an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and mailed, delivered or otherwise made available
to the shareholders of Parent and Target.

(b) The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use their
reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file and cause their
applicable Subsidiaries to promptly prepare and file all necessary
documentation to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings to
obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities or Regulatory
Agencies which are

 



43  reasonably necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including, without limitation, the Mergers and
the Bank Merger), and to comply with the terms and conditions of all such
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all such Governmental
Entities, Regulatory Agencies and third parties. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, as soon as practicable and in no event later
than thirty (30) business days after the date of this Agreement, Parent and
Target shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, each prepare
and file any applications, notices and filings required to be filed with any
Governmental Entity or Regulatory Agency, including the FRB, FDIC, TDFI or
NCCOB, in order to obtain the Requisite Regulatory Approvals. The parties
hereto agree that they will consult with the other parties hereto with respect
to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of
all third parties, Governmental Entities and Regulatory Agencies necessary or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
each party will keep the others apprised of the status of matters relating to
completion of the transactions contemplated herein. Parent and Target agree to
furnish each other and each others counsel with all information concerning
themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, trustees, officers and
shareholders and such other matters as reasonably may be necessary or
advisable in connection with the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the Form
S-4, the Requisite Regulatory Approvals and any application, petition or other
statement or application made by or on behalf of Parent, Parent Bank, Target
or Target Bank or any of their affiliates to any Governmental Entity or
Regulatory Agency in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Parent and Target shall have the right to review in advance, and,
to the extent practicable, each will consult the other on, in each case
subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, all the
information relating to Parent or Target, as the case may be, and any of
their respective Subsidiaries, which appears in any filing made with, or
written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity or
Regulatory Agency in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto
shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Each party shall consult
with the other in advance of any meeting or conference with any third party or
any Governmental Entity or Regulatory Agency in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, to the extent permitted by
such Governmental Entity or Regulatory Agency, give the other party and its
counsel the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and
conferences, except to the extent such meetings and conferences relate to
confidential supervisory information. Each party will provide the other with
copies of any applications, notices, petitions or filings, and all
correspondence relating thereto, prior to filing, other than any portions of
material filed in connection therewith that contain confidential supervisory
information or other information filed under a claim of confidentiality and,
in each case, subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of
information. Each party acknowledges and agrees that nothing in this
Agreement, including this _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.2_, shall require any
party to provide confidential supervisory information to any other party.

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent
and Target shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) avoid the entry of,
or to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment,
injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that
would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing, and (ii) avoid or eliminate
each and every impediment so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as
possible, including proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by
consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of businesses or assets of Parent, Target and their respective
Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
nothing contained in this Agreement shall require Parent or Target or their
respective Subsidiaries to take, or agree to take, any actions specified in
this _Section 6.1_ that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the Mergers and
the Bank Merger (a " _Burdensome Condition_ ").

 

(d) Each of Parent and Target agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries, (i)
that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion
or incorporation by reference in the Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4
and each amendment or supplement thereto, if any, becomes effective under the
Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein not misleading and (ii) that none of the information
supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference
in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and any amendment or

 



44  supplement thereto will, at the date of mailing to shareholders and at the
time of the Parent Shareholders Meeting and the Target Shareholders Meeting,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make any statement therein,
in light of the circumstances under which such statement was made, not
misleading. Each of Parent and Target further agrees that if it becomes aware
that any information furnished by it would cause any of the statements in the
Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be false or misleading
with respect to any material fact, or to omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein not false or misleading, to promptly
inform the other party thereof and to take appropriate steps to correct the
Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

 

(e) To the extent permitted by applicable law, Target and Parent shall
promptly advise each other upon their (or their Subsidiaries) receiving any
communication from any Governmental Entity or Regulatory Agency whose consent
or approval is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement that causes such party to believe that there is a
reasonable likelihood that any Requisite Regulatory Approval will not be
obtained, that the receipt of any such approval will be materially delayed or
that a Burdensome Condition might be imposed on any such Requisite Regulatory
Approval.

 

6.2 _Access to Information_.

 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws, each of Parent and
Target, for the purposes of verifying the representations and warranties of
the other and preparing for the Mergers and the other matters contemplated by
this Agreement, shall, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries
to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel, advisors and
other representatives of the other party, access, during normal business
hours during the period prior to the Effective Time and in a manner so as not
to interfere with normal business operations, to all of its properties, books,
contracts, commitments, personnel, information technology systems and records
and each shall reasonably cooperate with the other party in preparing to
execute after the Effective Time conversion or consolidation of systems and
business operations generally (including by entering into customary
confidentiality, non-disclosure and similar agreements with such service
providers and/or the other party), and, during such period, during normal
business hours and in a manner so as not to interfere with normal
business operations, each of Parent and Target shall, and shall cause its
respective Subsidiaries to, make available to the other party (i) a copy of
each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed or
received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal
securities laws or federal or state banking laws (other than reports or
documents which it or any of its Subsidiaries is not permitted to disclose
under applicable law) and (ii) all other information concerning its and its
Subsidiaries business, properties and personnel as the other party may
reasonably request. Neither Parent nor Target nor any of their respective
Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the
rights of Parents or Targets, as the case may be, customers, jeopardize the
attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or control of
such information (after giving due consideration to the existence of any
common interest, joint defense or similar agreement between the parties) or
contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty
or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The
parties hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under
circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

 

(b) The Mutual Confidentiality Agreement dated as of December 14, 2016,
entered into by and between Parent and Target (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ ") will remain in full force and effect following the date of this
Agreement, whether or not the Merger occurs, in accordance with the terms
thereof, and each of Parent and Target shall hold all information furnished
by or on behalf of the other party or any of such partys Subsidiaries or
representatives pursuant to this Agreement in confidence to the extent
required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement. 

(c) No investigation by any of the parties or their respective representatives
shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive the representations and
warranties of the other party or parties set forth herein.



 



45 6.3 _Target Shareholder Approval_.

 

(a) Target shall take, in accordance with applicable law and the Target
Articles and bylaws of Target, all action necessary to convene a meeting of
its shareholders (the " _Target Shareholders  Meeting_") to be held as soon
as reasonably practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective for the
purpose of obtaining the Requisite Target Vote required in connection with
this Agreement, the Merger and, if so desired and mutually agreed upon, other
matters of the type customarily brought before an annual or special meeting of
shareholders to approve a merger agreement. Target and the board of directors
of Target shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from the
shareholders of Target the Requisite Target Vote, including by communicating
to Targets shareholders the Target board of directors recommendation (and
including such recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus) that
the shareholders approve this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, and Target shall engage a proxy solicitor reasonably acceptable to
Parent to assist in the solicitation of proxies from shareholders relating to
the Requisite Target Vote. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the
contrary contained herein, subject to _Sections 8.1_ and _8.2_ , if the board
of directors of Target, after receiving the advice of its outside counsel
and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisor, determines in
good faith that it would more likely than not result in a violation of its
fiduciary duties under applicable law to continue to recommend this
Agreement, then the board of directors of Target may withdraw or modify or
qualify in a manner adverse to Parent its recommendation (a " _Target Adverse
Recommendation Change_ ") to its shareholders that they approve
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and in submitting
this Agreement to its shareholders, the board of directors of Target may
submit this Agreement to its shareholders without recommendation or with such
modified or qualified recommendation (although the resolutions approving this
Agreement as of the date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in which
event the board of directors of Target may communicate the basis for its lack
of a recommendation or such modified or qualified recommendation to its
shareholders in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or an appropriate
amendment or supplement thereto; _provided_ , that the board of directors of
Target may not take any actions under this sentence unless (i) it gives
Parent at least five (5) business days prior written notice of its intention
to take such action and a reasonable description of the event or circumstances
giving rise to its determination to take such action (including, in the event
such action is taken by the board of directors of Target in response to an
Acquisition Proposal, the latest material terms and conditions and the
identity of the third party in any such Acquisition Proposal, or any amendment
or modification thereof, or describe in reasonable detail such other event or
circumstances if not in response to an Acquisition Proposal) and (ii) at the
end of such notice period, the board of directors of Target takes into account
any amendment or modification to this Agreement proposed by Parent and after
receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial
matters, its financial advisor, determines in good faith that it would
nevertheless more likely than not result in a violation of its fiduciary
duties under applicable law to continue to recommend this Agreement. Any
material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new
Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this _Section 6.3_ and will require a
new notice period as referred to in this _Section 6.3_; _provided_ , that
with respect to any such amendment, the applicable notice period in this
_Section 6.3_ shall be three (3) business days instead of five (5) business
days.

(b) Target shall adjourn or postpone the Target Shareholders Meeting if (i)
as of the time for which such meeting is originally scheduled there are
insufficient shares of Target Common Stock represented (either in person or by
proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such
meeting, or (ii) on the date of such meeting Target has not received proxies
representing a sufficient number of shares necessary to obtain the Requisite
Target Vote; provided, that Target shall not be required to adjourn or
postpone the Target Shareholders Meeting more than one (1) time.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, unless this Agreement has
been terminated, the Target Shareholders Meeting shall be convened and this
Agreement shall be submitted to the shareholders of Target at the
Target Shareholders Meeting for the purpose of Targets shareholders voting
on the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve
Target of such obligations.

 



46 6.4 _Parent Shareholder Approval_.

 

(a) Parent shall take, in accordance with applicable law and the Parent
Charter and bylaws of Parent, all action necessary to convene a meeting of
its shareholders (the " _Parent Shareholders  Meeting_") to be held as soon
as reasonably practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective for the
purpose of obtaining the Requisite Parent Vote required in connection with
this Agreement and, if so desired and mutually agreed upon, other matters of
the type customarily brought before an annual or special meeting of
shareholders to approve the matters required by the Requisite Parent Vote.
Parent and the board of directors of Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain from the shareholders of Parent the Requisite Parent Vote,
including by communicating to Parents shareholders the Parent board of
directors recommendation (and including such recommendation in the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus) that the shareholders approve the issuance of the
shares of Parent Common Stock constituting the Merger Consideration in
connection with the Merger, and Parent shall engage a proxy solicitor
reasonably acceptable to Target to assist in the solicitation of proxies from
shareholders relating to the Requisite Parent Vote. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or anything to the contrary contained herein, subject to
_Sections 8.1_ and _8.2_ if the board of directors of Parent, after receiving
the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its
financial advisor, determines in good faith that it would more likely than not
result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law to
continue to recommend that Parents shareholders approve the issuance of the
shares of Parent Common Stock constituting the Merger Consideration in
connection with the Merger, then the board of directors of Parent may
withdraw or modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Target its recommendation
(a " _Parent Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") to its shareholders that they
approve the issuance of the shares of Parent Common Stock constituting the
Merger Consideration in connection with the Merger, and in submitting such
proposal to its shareholders, the board of directors of Parent may submit such
proposal to its shareholders without recommendation or with such modified or
qualified recommendation (although the resolutions approving this Agreement
and the issuance of the shares of Parent Common Stock constituting the Merger
Consideration in connection with the Merger as of the date hereof may not
be rescinded or amended), in which event the board of directors of Parent may
communicate the basis for its lack of a recommendation or such modified or
qualified recommendation to its shareholders in the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto;
_provided_ , that the board of directors of Parent may not take any actions
under this sentence unless (i) it gives Target at least five (5) business
days prior written notice of its intention to take such action and a
reasonable description of the event or circumstances giving rise to its
determination to take such action and (ii) at the end of such notice period,
the board of directors of Parent takes into account any amendment or
modification to this Agreement proposed by Target and after receiving the
advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its
financial advisor, determines in good faith that it would nevertheless more
likely than not result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under
applicable law to continue to recommend that Parents shareholders approve the
issuance of the shares of Parent Common Stock constituting the Merger
Consideration in connection with the Merger.

(b) Parent shall adjourn or postpone the Parent Shareholders Meeting if (i)
as of the time for which such meeting is originally scheduled there are
insufficient shares of Parent Common Stock represented (either in person or by
proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such
meeting, or (ii) on the date of such meeting Parent has not received proxies
representing a sufficient number of shares necessary to obtain the Requisite
Parent Vote; _provided_ , that Parent shall not be required to adjourn or
postpone the Parent Shareholders Meeting more than one (1)
time. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, unless this Agreement
has been terminated, the Parent Shareholders Meeting shall be convened and
this Agreement shall be submitted to the shareholders of Parent at the Parent
Shareholders Meeting for the purpose of Parents shareholders voting on the
approval of the issuance of the shares of Parent Common Stock constituting the
Merger Consideration in connection with the Merger and nothing contained
herein shall be deemed to relieve Parent of such obligations.

6.5 _Timing of Shareholders  Meetings_. Parent and Target will use their
respective reasonable best efforts to hold the Parent Shareholders Meeting
and the Target Shareholders Meeting on the same date.



 



47 6.6 _Legal Conditions to Merger_. Subject in all respects to _Sections 6.1_ ,
_6.3_  and _6.4_ , Target and Parent shall, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (a) to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to comply
promptly with all legal requirements that may be imposed on such party or its
Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and the Bank Merger and, subject to
the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ hereof, to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) to obtain (and to
cooperate with the other parties to obtain) any material consent,
authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental
Entity or Regulatory Agency and any other third party that is required to be
obtained by Parent, Target or their respective Subsidiaries in connection with
the Mergers, the Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

 __6.7 _Nasdaq Listing_ _._ Parent shall cause the shares of Parent Common
Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger to be authorized for listing
on Nasdaq, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective
Time. __

6.8 _Employee Benefit Plans; Existing Agreements_.

(a) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first
anniversary thereof (the " _Protected Period_ ") and except as otherwise
provided in this _Section 6.8_, Parent shall provide each employee of Target
and its Subsidiaries who continues to be employed by Parent or its
Subsidiaries immediately following the Effective Time (a " _Continuing
Employee_ ") with (i) a base salary or base wage rate, as applicable, that is
no less favorable than the base salary or base wage rate, as applicable,
provided by Target or any of its Subsidiaries to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) short- and long-term incentive
compensation opportunities that, in each case, are (A) with respect to the
fiscal year of the Target in which the Effective Time occurs (if the
Effective Time occurs after the first quarter of such fiscal year), no less
favorable than the short- and long-term incentive compensation opportunities
provided by Target or any of its Subsidiaries to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (B) with respect to (x) the
fiscal year of Parent commencing immediately after the year in which the
Effective Time occurs (if the Effective Time occurs after the first quarter of
such fiscal year) and (y) the fiscal year of the Target in which the
Effective Time occurs (if the Effective Time occurs in the first quarter of
such fiscal year, in which case clause (A) above shall not apply), no less
favorable than the short- and long-term incentive compensation opportunities
provided by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to similarly-situated employees
of Parent or its Subsidiaries, and (iii) participation in the other
compensation and employee benefit plans in which similarly-situated employees
of Parent or its Subsidiaries participate, to the same extent as similarly-
situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries. Without limiting the
immediately preceding sentence, Parent shall provide to each Continuing
Employee whose employment is terminated without cause during the Protected
Period, severance benefits equal to the amounts set forth on _Schedule 6.8(a)_
taking into account the service of such Continuing Employees prior to
the Effective Time consistent with _Section 6.8(b)_ and any service with
Parent and its affiliates thereafter. For purposes of this _Section 6.8_,
"cause" shall have the same meaning as provided in any written
employment agreement between any Continuing Employee and Parent or any
affiliate of Parent on the date such Continuing Employee is terminated, or if
no such definition or employment agreement exists, "cause" shall mean conduct
amounting to (1) fraud or dishonesty against Parent or any affiliate of
Parent; (2) the Continuing Employees willful misconduct, repeated refusal to
follow the reasonable directions of the Parents board of directors or knowing
violation of law in the course of performance of the duties of the Continuing
Employees service with Parent or any affiliate of Parent; (3) repeated
absences from work without a reasonable excuse; (4) repeated intoxication with
alcohol or drugs while on the premises of Parent or any affiliate of Parent
during regular business hours; (5) a conviction or plea of guilty or nolo
contendere to a felony or a crime involving dishonesty; or (6) a breach or
violation of the terms of any agreement to which the Continuing Employee and
Parent or any affiliate of Parent are party.

(b) With respect to each Parent Benefit Plan, Parent shall recognize all
service of the Continuing Employees with Target and its Subsidiaries
(including any predecessor entities or any entities which merged or
consolidated with or into Target or any of its Subsidiaries) for all
purposes;  _provided, however_ , that such service

 



48  shall not be recognized (i) for purposes of benefit accrual under any tax
qualified defined benefit pension plan, (ii) under any Parent Benefit Plan
that is frozen to new participants or that applies to a grandfathered
population or (iii) to the extent that such recognition would result in a
duplication of benefits. With respect to the Continuing Employees and their
eligible dependents, Parent shall (A) recognize all such service under the
Parent Benefit Plans for purposes of satisfying any waiting periods, evidence
of insurability requirements, or the application of any preexisting condition
limitations, (B) waive pre-existing condition limitations to the same extent
waived under a corresponding Target Benefit Plan and (C) give credit for
amounts paid under a corresponding benefit plan for purposes of applying
deductibles, copayments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had
been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Parent Benefit
Plans; _provided, however_ , that, with respect to any welfare benefits plans
that are provided through a third-party insurer ( _i.e_., are not self-
insured), Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to effectuate the
foregoing.

(c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall assume and honor in
accordance with their terms all employment, severance, change in control and
other compensation agreements and arrangements between Target or any of its
Subsidiaries and any of their employees, which are not terminated in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and all accrued and vested benefit obligations through the
Effective Time which are between Target or any of its Subsidiaries and any of
their current or former directors, officers, employees or consultants.

(d) At the Effective Time, Target shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, cease contributions to and terminate the 401(k) plan
sponsored by Target (the " _Target 401(k) Plan_ "), subject to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall (i)
adopt written resolutions (a copy of which shall be delivered to Parent at
the Closing) to terminate the Target 401(k) Plan and fully vest all
participants in their benefits thereunder, such termination and vesting to be
effective as of the day immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (ii)
deliver to Parent, prior to the Closing, notice of the Target 401(k) Plan
termination. Parent reserves the right to suspend the distribution of benefits
from the Target 401(k) Plan until the receipt of a favorable determination
letter from the IRS with respect to the termination of the Target 401(k)
Plan. The Continuing Employees shall be eligible to participate, effective as
of the Closing Date, in a 401(k) plan sponsored or maintained by Parent or one
of its Subsidiaries (the " _Parent 401(k) Plan_ "). Parent and Target shall
take any and all actions as may be required, including amendments to the
Target 401(k) Plan and/or Parent 401(k) Plan, to permit each Continuing
Employee who is a participant in the Target 401(k) Plan to be eligible to
commence participation in the Parent 401(k) Plan as of the Closing Date, make
in-kind rollover contributions to the Parent 401(k) Plan of "eligible rollover
distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) in an
amount equal to the full account balance distributable to such Continuing
Employee from the Target 401(k) Plan, and accept rollovers of any plan loans.

 

(e) On and after the date hereof, any broad-based employee notices or
communication materials (including any website posting) with respect
to employment, compensation or benefits matters addressed in this Agreement
or related, directly or indirectly, to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be subject to the prior prompt review and comment of the other
party unless the notice or communication material is similar in substance to

6.9 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance._

 

(a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, including,
without limitation, any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
in which any individual who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date
of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a
director, manager, officer or employee of Target or any of its Subsidiaries,
or who is or was serving at the request of Target or any of its Subsidiaries
as a director, manager, officer, employee or agent of another person,
including any entity specified in the Target Disclosure Schedule (the "
_Indemnified Parties_ "), is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in
whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to
(i) the fact that such person is or was a director, manager, officer or
employee of Target or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their predecessors or
is or was serving at the request of Target or any of its Subsidiaries or any
of their predecessors as a director, manager, officer, employee or agent of
another person or (ii) this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby, whether in any case asserted or arising before or after the Effective
Time, the parties hereto agree to cooperate and use their best efforts to
defend against and respond thereto. From and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each such Indemnified Party
against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and court costs and expenses in advance of the
final disposition of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation to
each Indemnified Party upon receipt of an undertaking (in reasonable and
customary form) to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that
such Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification hereunder),
judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any such
threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

(b) Subject to the following sentence, for a period of six (6) years after
the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect the current
policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by Target
(provided, that Parent may substitute therefor policies with a substantially
comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms
and conditions which are no less advantageous to the insured) with respect to
claims against the present and former officers and directors of Target and
its Subsidiaries arising from facts or events which occurred at or before the
Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement);
_provided, however_ , that Parent shall not be obligated to expend, on an
annual basis, an amount in excess of 250% of the aggregate annual premium
paid as of the date hereof by Target for such insurance (the " _Premium Cap_
"), and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed the
Premium Cap, then Parent shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance
which provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to the
Premium Cap. In lieu of the foregoing, Target, in consultation with Parent,
may (and at the request of Parent, Target shall use its reasonable best
efforts to) obtain at or prior to the Effective Time, at Parents expense, a
six-year "tail" policy under Targets existing directors and officers
liability insurance policy providing equivalent coverage to that described in
the preceding sentence if and to the extent that the same may be obtained for
an amount that, in the aggregate, does not exceed the Premium Cap.

 

(c) In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties or
assets to any person, then, and in each such case, the Surviving Corporation
shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of
the Surviving Corporation will expressly assume the obligations set forth in
this _Section 6.9_.

 



 



50 (d) The provisions of this _Section 6.9_ shall survive the Effective Time and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives.

6.10  _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective Time
any further action is reasonably necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises
of any of the parties to the Mergers, the proper officers and directors of
each party to this Agreement and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all
such necessary action as may be reasonably requested by the other parties to
this Agreement.

6.11 _Advice of Changes_ _._ Target and Parent shall promptly advise the
other of any fact, change, event or circumstance known to it (i) that has had
or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on it or (ii) which
it believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a
material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained herein or that reasonably could be expected to give rise,
individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of a condition in _Article
VII_ ; _provided, however_ , that no such notification shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties (or
remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the
parties under this Agreement; _provided, further_ , that a failure to comply
with this _Section 6.11_ shall not constitute the failure of any condition
set forth in _Sections 7.2_ or _7.3_ to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute
a breach of this Agreement by the party failing to give such notice, in each
case unless the underlying breach would independently result in the failure of
a condition set forth in _Sections 7.2_ or _7.3_ to be satisfied.

 

6.12 _Acquisition Proposals; Board Recommendation_.

 

(a) Target shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries and each of its and its
Subsidiaries affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents and
representatives (including any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney,
accountant or other representative retained by Target or any of its
Subsidiaries (each a " _Target Representative_ ")) to immediately cease
and terminate any and all existing discussions, negotiations or activities
with any other parties conducted heretofore (whether currently ongoing or not)
with respect to the possibility or consideration of any Acquisition Proposal.
Except as otherwise provided in _Section 6.12(b)_, from the date of this
Agreement through the Effective Time, Target shall not, and shall cause each
of its Subsidiaries not to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
Target Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate,
knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing
information or assistance), or take any other action designed to solicit,
initiate, facilitate or encourage any inquiries or the making of any proposal
that constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to, any Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) participate in any discussions, negotiations or other
communications regarding any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) except pursuant to
_Section 6.3_ in connection with and after making a Target Adverse
Recommendation Change, make or authorize any statement, recommendation or
solicitation in support of any Acquisition Proposal or (iv) provide
any confidential or nonpublic information or data to any person relating to
an Acquisition Proposal with respect to such party.

(b)

 

(i) Notwithstanding the foregoing _Section 6.12(a)_, prior to the receipt of
the Requisite Target Vote, Target may and may permit its Subsidiaries and
Target Representatives to engage in discussions and negotiations with, or
provide any nonpublic information or data to, any person in response to an
unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal by such person made
after the date of this Agreement to the extent that its board of directors
concludes in good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside counsel,
and with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors) that failure to
take such actions would be more likely than not to result in a violation of
its fiduciary duties under applicable law; provided, however, that, prior to
providing any nonpublic information permitted to be provided pursuant to the
foregoing, Target shall have provided notice to Parent of its intention to
provide such information, and shall have provided such information to Parent
if not previously provided to Parent, and shall have entered into a
confidentiality agreement with such third party on terms no less favorable to
Target than the Confidentiality Agreement, which confidentiality agreement
shall not provide such person with any exclusive right to negotiate with
Target.

 



51 (ii) Target shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than twenty-
four (24) hours) after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, or any request
for nonpublic information relating to Target or any of its Subsidiaries that
could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, or any
inquiry from any person seeking to have discussions, negotiations or other
communications relating to a possible Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall,
if made orally, be confirmed in writing, and shall indicate the identity of
the person making the Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request and the
material terms and conditions of any inquiries, requests, proposals or offers
(including a copy thereof if in writing and any related documentation or
correspondence). Target shall also promptly, and in any event within twenty-
four (24) hours, notify Parent, orally and in writing, if it enters into
discussions or negotiations or engages in other communications concerning any
Acquisition Proposal or provides nonpublic information or data to any person
in accordance with this _Section 6.12(b)_ and keep Parent reasonably
apprised of the status and terms of any such proposals, offers, discussions or
negotiations on a current basis including by providing a copy of all material
documentation or correspondence relating thereto. Target shall use its
reasonable best efforts to enforce any existing confidentiality or standstill
agreements to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party in accordance
with the terms thereof.

 

(iii) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.12_ shall prohibit Target, its
board of directors or any of its Subsidiaries from taking and disclosing to
its shareholders a position required by or otherwise complying with Rule
14e-2(a), Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the
Exchange Act; _provided, however_ , that compliance with such rules shall not
in any way limit or modify the effect that any action taken pursuant to such
rules has under any other provision of this Agreement.

 

(c) Unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms,
Target shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective officers, directors,
managers, agents, advisors and Target Representatives not to on its or any of
Targets Subsidiaries or affiliates behalf, enter into any letter
of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement, merger agreement, or other agreement (other than a confidentiality
agreement referred to and entered into in accordance with _Section 6.12(b)_)
relating to any Acquisition Proposal.

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means,
any proposal, offer or third party indication of interest in any (x) direct
or indirect acquisition or purchase of 20% or more of the consolidated assets
of Target and its Subsidiaries or 20% or more of any class of equity or voting
securities of Target or any of its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or
in the aggregate, constitute more than 20% of the consolidated assets of
Target, (y) tender offer (including a self-tender) or exchange offer that, if
consummated, would result in such third party beneficially owning 20% or more
of any class of equity or voting securities of Target or any of its
Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more
than 20% of the consolidated assets of Target or (z) merger, consolidation,
share exchange, business combination, reorganization, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving Target or any of its
Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more
than 20% of the consolidated assets of Target, in each case other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

6.13 _Financial Statements and Other Current Information_. As soon as
reasonably practicable after they become available, but in no event more than
thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar month ending after the date
hereof, Target shall furnish to Parent (a) consolidated financial statements
of Target (including balance sheets, statements of operations and
shareholders equity) (to the extent available) as of and for such month then
ended, (b) internal management reports showing actual financial performance
against plan and previous period, and (c) to the extent permitted by
applicable law, any reports provided to Targets board of directors or any
committee thereof relating to the financial performance and risk management
of Target and its Subsidiaries.

6.14 _Exemption from Liability under Section 16(b)_. Target and Parent agree
that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain those officers and
directors of Target subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act (" _Target Insiders_ "), both prior to and after
the Effective Time, it is desirable that Target Insiders not be subject to a
risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest

 



52  extent permitted by applicable law in connection with the conversion of
shares of Target Common Stock and Target Equity Awards in the Merger, and for
that compensatory and retentive purpose agree to the provisions of this
_Section 6.14_. The board of directors of Parent and of Target, or a
committee of non-employee directors thereof (as such term is defined for
purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall reasonably promptly,
and in any event prior to the Effective Time, take all such steps as may be
required to cause (in the case of Target) any dispositions of Target Common
Stock or Target Equity Awards by Target Insiders, and (in the case of Parent)
any acquisitions of Parent Common Stock or Parent Equity Awards by any Target
Insiders who, immediately following the Merger, will be officers or directors
of Parent subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the
Exchange Act, in each case pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, to be exempt from liability pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the
Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

 

6.15 _Bank Merger_. Immediately following the Second Step Merger, Target Bank
will merge (the " _Bank Merger_ ") with and into Parent Bank pursuant to the
agreement and plan of merger entered into by Parent Bank and Target Bank on
the date hereof (the " _Bank Merger Agreement_ "). Parent Bank shall be the
surviving entity in the Bank Merger and, following the Bank Merger, the
separate corporate existence of Target Bank shall cease. Promptly following
execution of the Bank Merger Agreement, Target shall approve such agreement as
the sole shareholder of Target Bank and Parent shall approve such agreement
as the sole shareholder of Parent Bank. Prior to the Effective Time, Target
shall cause Target Bank, and Parent shall cause Parent Bank, to execute such
certificates or articles of merger and such other documents and certificates
as are necessary to effectuate the Bank Merger (" _Bank Merger Certificates_
").

6.16 _Exchange Matters_. Prior to the Closing Date, Target shall cooperate
with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper
or advisable on its part under applicable laws and rules and policies of
Nasdaq to enable the delisting of the shares of Target Common Stock from
Nasdaq and the deregistration of the shares of Target Common Stock under the
Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time.

 

6.17 _Dividends_. After the date of this Agreement, each of Parent and Target
shall coordinate with the other the declaration of any dividends in respect
of Parent Common Stock and Target Common Stock and the record dates and
payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the parties hereto
that holders of Target Common Stock shall not receive two dividends, or fail
to receive one dividend, in any quarter with respect to their shares of
Target Common Stock and any shares of Parent Common Stock any such holder
receives in exchange therefor in the Merger.

 

6.18 _Assumption of Target Debt_. Parent agrees to execute and deliver, or
cause to be executed and delivered, by or on behalf of Parent, the Surviving
Company or Parent Bank (as the case may be), at or prior to the Effective

other agreements to the extent required by the terms of such debt, Target
Trust Preferred Securities, guarantees, securities, and other agreements.

6.19 _No Control of Other Party s Business_. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control or
direct the operations of Target or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective
Time, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Target, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of Parent or its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of
Parent and Target shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and its
Subsidiaries respective operations.

 

6.20 _Change of Method_. The parties may by mutual agreement at any time
change the method of effecting the Mergers, if and to the extent they deem
such change to be desirable; _provided, however_ , that no such change

 



53  shall (i) alter or change the Exchange Ratio or the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock received by holders of Target Common Stock or the amount
or kind of Merger Consideration, (ii) adversely affect the tax treatment of
(A) holders of Target Common Stock as a result of receiving the Merger
Consideration or (B) holders of Parent Common Stock or (iii) materially impede
or delay consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a
timely manner.

6.21 _Restructuring Efforts_. If either Target or Parent shall have failed to
obtain the Requisite Target Vote or the Requisite Parent Vote at the duly
convened Target Shareholders Meeting or Parent Shareholders Meeting, as
applicable, or any adjournment or postponement thereof, each of the parties
shall in good faith use its reasonable best efforts to negotiate a
restructuring of the transaction provided for herein ( _provided, however_ ,
that neither party shall have any obligation to agree to (i) alter or change
any material term of this Agreement, including the amount or kind of
consideration to be issued to holders of Target Common Stock or Target Equity
Awards or (ii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of the transaction with
respect to its shareholders) and/or resubmit this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (or as restructured pursuant to this _Section
6.21_) to its respective shareholders for approval.

 

6.22 _Takeover Statutes_. None of Parent, Target or their respective boards of
directors shall take any action that would cause any Takeover Statute to
become applicable to this Agreement, the Mergers, the Bank Merger or any of
the other transactions contemplated hereby, and each shall take all necessary
steps to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the Mergers, the Bank
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby from any applicable
Takeover Statute now or hereafter in effect. If any Takeover Statute may
become, or may purport to be, applicable to the transactions contemplated
hereby, each party and the members of their respective boards of directors
will grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate
or minimize the effects of any Takeover Statute on any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including, if necessary, challenging the
validity or applicability of any such Takeover Statute.

Consideration in connection with the Merger, by the shareholders of Target or
Parent, respectively:

 

(a) by mutual consent of Parent and Target in a written instrument, if the
board of directors of each so determines;

or any Governmental Entity or Regulatory Agency of competent jurisdiction
shall have issued a final nonappealable order, injunction or decree
permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making illegal the

agreements of such party set forth herein;

(c) by either Parent or Target if the Merger shall not have been consummated
on or before the first anniversary of the date of this Agreement (the "

to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth
herein;

 



56 (d) by either Parent or Target ( _provided_ , that the terminating party is
not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or

any such representation or warranty shall cease to be true) set forth in this
Agreement on the part of Target, in the case of a termination by Parent, or
Parent or Merger Sub, in the case of a termination by Target, which breach or
failure to be true, either individually or in the aggregate with all other
breaches by such party (or failures of such representations or warranties to
be true), would constitute, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date,
the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 7.2_, in the case of a
termination by Target, or _Section 7.3_, in the case of a termination by
Parent, and which is not cured by the earlier of the Termination Date and
thirty (30) days following written notice to Target, in the case of
a termination by Parent, or Parent, in the case of a termination by Target,
or by its nature or timing cannot be cured during such period;

 

(e) by Parent, if (i) prior to such time as the Requisite Target Vote is
obtained, Target or the board of directors of Target (A) makes a Target
Adverse Recommendation Change (or publicly discloses its intention to do so)
or otherwise submits this Agreement to its shareholders without a
recommendation for approval, or recommends to its shareholders an
Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger, or (B) materially breaches its
obligations under _Section 6.3_ or _Section 6.12_, or (ii) a tender offer or
exchange offer for 20% or more of the outstanding shares of Target Common
Stock is commenced (other than by Parent or a Subsidiary thereof), and the
board of directors of Target recommends that the shareholders of Target tender
their shares in such tender offer or exchange offer or otherwise fails to
recommend that such shareholders reject such tender offer or exchange offer
within the 10 business day period specified in Rule 14e-2(a) under the
Exchange Act; or

 

(f) by Target, if prior to such time as the Requisite Parent Vote is obtained,
Parent or the board of directors of Parent (A) makes a Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change (or publicly discloses its intention to do so) or
otherwise submits the proposal to approve the issuance of the shares of Parent
Common Stock constituting the Merger Consideration in connection with the
Merger to its shareholders without a recommendation for approval, or (B)
materially breaches its obligations under _Section 6.4_.

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to clause (b), (c),
(d), (e) or (f) of this _Section 8.1_ shall give written notice of such
termination to the other party in accordance with _Section 9.4_, specifying
the provision or provisions hereof pursuant to which such termination is
effected.

8.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Parent or Target
as provided in _Section 8.1_, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and
have no effect, and none of Parent, Target, any of their respective
Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors of any of them shall have any
liability of any nature whatsoever hereunder, or in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby, except that (i) _Section 6.2(b)_,
this _Section 8.2_ and _Article IX_ (other than _Section 9.1_) shall survive
any termination of this Agreement, and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, neither Parent, Merger Sub nor Target
shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages (which, in the
case of Target, shall include the loss to the holders of Target Common Stock
and Target Equity Awards of the economic benefits of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the loss of the premium offered to the holders
of Target Common Stock and Target Equity Awards) arising out of its fraud or
willful and material breach of any provision of this Agreement.

(b)

 

(i) In the event that after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
termination of this Agreement a bona fide Acquisition Proposal shall have
been made known to senior management of Target or shall have been made
directly to its shareholders generally or any person shall have publicly
announced (and not withdrawn) an Acquisition Proposal with respect to Target
and (x) (A) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or
Target pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)_ without the Requisite Target Vote having
been obtained or (B) thereafter this 

 



57  Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_, and (y)
prior to the date that is twelve (12) months after the date of such
termination, Target enters into a definitive agreement or consummates a
transaction with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same
Acquisition Proposal as that referred to above), then Target shall, on the
earlier of the date it enters into such definitive agreement and the date of
consummation of such transaction, pay Parent, by wire transfer of same day
funds, a fee equal to $66,000,000.00 (the " _Termination Fee_ "); _provided_ ,
that for purposes of this  _Section 8.2(b)(i)_, all references in the
definition of Acquisition Proposal to "20%" shall instead refer to "50%".

 

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
_Section 8.1(e)_, then Target shall pay Parent, by wire transfer of same day
funds, the Termination Fee as promptly as reasonably practical after the date
of termination (and, in any event, within three (3) business days thereafter).

 

(iii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Target pursuant to
_Section 8.1(f)_, then Parent shall pay Target, by wire transfer of same day
funds, the Termination Fee as promptly as reasonably practical after the date
of termination (and, in any event, within three (3) business days thereafter).

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but without limiting the
right of any party to recover liabilities or damages in accordance with
_Section 8.2(a)_, the maximum aggregate amount of fees payable by Target or
Parent under this _Section 8.2_ shall be equal to the Termination Fee, and in
no event shall any party be required to pay the Termination Fee more than
once.

(d) Each of Parent and Target acknowledges that the agreements contained in
this _Section 8.2_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other party would not
enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if Target or Parent fails promptly to
pay the amount due pursuant to this  _Section 8.2_, and, in order to obtain
such payment, the Parent or Target, as applicable, commences a suit which
results in a judgment against Target or Parent, as applicable for the
Termination Fee or any portion thereof, such non-paying party shall pay the
costs and expenses of the other party (including reasonable attorneys fees
and expenses) in connection with such suit. In addition, if Target or Parent
fails to pay the amounts payable pursuant to this  _Section 8.2_, then
Target or Parent, as applicable, shall pay interest on such overdue amounts
(for the period commencing as of the date that such overdue amount was
originally required to be paid and ending on the date that such
overdue amount is actually paid in full) at a rate per annum equal to the
"prime rate" (as announced by JPMorgan Chase and Co. or any successor thereto)
in effect on the date on which such payment was required to be made for the
period commencing as of the date that such overdue amount was originally
required to be paid. The amounts payable by Target or Parent pursuant to
_Section 8.2(b)_ constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty, and, except
in the case of fraud or willful and material breach of this Agreement, shall
be the sole monetary remedy of Parent or Target, as applicable, in the event
of a termination of this Agreement specified in such section.

9.6 _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable law, this Agreement may
be amended by the parties hereto, at any time before or after approval of the
matters presented in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by the shareholders of Parent and Target; _provided, however_ , that
after any approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the
shareholders of Parent or Target, there may not be, without further approval
of such shareholders, any amendment of this Agreement that requires further
approval under applicable law. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

9.7 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties
hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of Parent or Merger Sub,
in the case of Target, or Target, in the case of Parent, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto on the part of Parent or Merger Sub, in the
case of Target, or Target, in the case of Parent, and (c) waive compliance
with any of the agreements on the part of Parent or Merger Sub, in the case
of Target, or Target, in the case of Parent, or of such partys conditions
contained herein; _provided, however_ , that after any approval of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the shareholders of Parent or
Target, there may not be, without further approval of such shareholders, any
extension or waiver of this Agreement or any portion thereof which requires
further approval under applicable law. Any agreement on the part of a party
hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a
written instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or
waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an
obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver
of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

9.8  _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, all of
which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and
delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not
sign the same counterpart.

9.9 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the documents and the
instruments referred to herein) together with the Confidentiality Agreement
constitutes the entire agreement among the parties and supersedes all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof.

9.10 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to any
applicable conflicts of law principles, except to the extent mandatory

 



60  provisions of federal law apply (and except that matters relating to the
fiduciary duties of the board of directors of Target and Merger Sub shall be
subject to the laws of the State of North Carolina and matters relating to
the fiduciary duties of the board of directors of Parent shall be subject to
the laws of the State of Tennessee). Any legal action or proceeding with
respect to this Agreement by one party against any other party shall be
brought only in any federal or state court located in the State of Delaware,
which shall have exclusive jurisdiction and venue for such purpose. By
execution and delivery of this Agreement, the parties hereby accept for
themselves, and in respect of their property, generally and unconditionally,
the jurisdiction and venue of the aforesaid courts and waive any objection to
the laying of venue on the grounds of _forum non conveniens_ which they may
now or hereafter have to the bringing or maintaining of any such action or
proceeding in such jurisdiction, and agree that service of process upon any
party in any such action or proceeding will be effective if notice is given in
accordance with _Section 9.4_.

 

9.11 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.
EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT: (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT
SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING,
SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS

WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS _SECTION 9.11_.

9.12 _Publicity_. Except as otherwise required by applicable law or the rules
of Nasdaq or as required under the rules and regulations of the SEC, neither
Target nor Parent shall, or shall permit any of their respective Subsidiaries
to, issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public
announcement with respect to, or otherwise make any public statement
concerning, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior
consent of Parent, in the case of a proposed announcement or statement by
Target or any of its Subsidiaries, or Target, in the case of a proposed
announcement or statement by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

9.13 _Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries_ _._ Neither this Agreement nor
any of the rights, interests or obligations of the parties hereto shall be
assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or
otherwise) without the prior written consent of Target, in the case of Parent
or Merger Sub, or Parent, in the case of Target. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and
assigns. Except for (i) as otherwise specifically provided in _Section 6.9_,
(ii) from and after the Effective Time, but only if the Effective Time shall
occur, the rights of holders of Target Common Stock to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in _Article II_ , and the rights of holders of
Target Equity Awards under  _Section 1.7_, and (iii) the right of Target to
enforce the rights of its shareholders and the holders of Target Equity Awards
pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)_, this Agreement (including the documents and
instruments referred to herein) is not intended to confer upon any person
other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder. Any purported
assignment in contravention hereof shall be null and void. The representations
and warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the
parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the parties. Any inaccuracies
in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties
hereto in accordance herewith without notice or liability to any other
person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this
Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks
associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the
parties hereto. 

 



61  Consequently, persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

9.14 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any
provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this
Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction such
that the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion thereof shall
be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

 

9.15 _Delivery by Facsimile or Electronic Transmission_. This Agreement and
any signed agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this
Agreement, and any amendments or waivers hereto or thereto, to the extent
signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by e-mail delivery of
a ".pdf" format data file, shall be treated in all manner and respects as
an original agreement or instrument and shall be considered to have the same
binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof
delivered in person. No party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument
shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf"
format data file to deliver a signature to this Agreement or any amendment or
waiver hereto or other such instrument or the fact that any signature or
agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of a
facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format data file as a defense
to the formation of a contract, and each party hereto forever waives any such
defense.

 

9.16 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to
specific performance of the terms hereof, including an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions hereof in any action or proceeding brought in
accordance with _Section 9.10_, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties hereby
further waives (a) any defense in any action for specific performance that a
remedy at law would be adequate and (b) any requirement under any law to post
security or a bond as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.
