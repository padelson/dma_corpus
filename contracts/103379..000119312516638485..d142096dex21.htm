or the Assumed Liabilities) and (B) to the extent not covered by clause (A)

conditions of this Agreement, Buyer agrees, effective at the Effective Time,
to assume (or cause to be assumed by one or more of its Subsidiaries) only the
following Liabilities of Seller or any of the Retained Subsidiaries, except
for the Excluded Liabilities (the "Assumed Liabilities"):

(a) all Liabilities of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries arising under the
Contracts assigned to Buyer or its Subsidiary under Section 2.02(e) to the
extent relating to performance for any periods following the Effective Time;

(b) all Liabilities under warranty obligations for individual product returns
in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice that are not

22 (e) the Accrued Salaries and Wages and Other Accrued Liabilities but, in each

No Liabilities other than those expressly set forth in clauses (a)  (j) above
shall be included in the Assumed Liabilities. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
any Assumed Liabilities in respect of the Delayed Assets shall only be assumed
at the Delayed Transfer Effective Time (it being understood that for this
purpose, each preceding reference in this Section 2.04 to "Effective Time" or
"Closing Date" shall be deemed to instead refer to "Delayed Transfer Effective
Time" or "Delayed Transfer Date", respectively), and such assumption shall
only include such Assumed Liabilities as they exist as of the Delayed Transfer
Date and shall be further subject to the provisions of Section 2.15(i).

 

Section 2.05. _Excluded Liabilities_. Buyer (or one or more of its
Subsidiaries) is assuming only the Assumed Liabilities from Seller and the
Retained Subsidiaries and is not assuming any other Liability of Seller or any
of the Retained Subsidiaries of whatever nature, whether presently in
existence or arising hereafter. All such other Liabilities shall be retained
by and remain Liabilities of Seller or the Retained Subsidiaries, as
applicable (all such Liabilities not being assumed being herein referred to as
the "Excluded Liabilities"), including the following:

 

(a) all Liabilities to the extent arising out of or relating to the conduct or
operation by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with any
Retained Business;

(b) all Liabilities to the extent arising out of or relating to any Excluded
Asset;

 

(c) all Liabilities to the extent arising from the ownership, use or operation
of the Purchased Assets or the Business prior to the Effective Time (other
than the Assumed Liabilities specified in clauses (a) through (h) of Section
2.04);

(d) all Liabilities or obligations to the extent arising out of the matters
set forth in Section 2.05(d) of the Disclosure Schedule;

 



23 (e) all Retained Environmental Liabilities;

 

(f) all Liabilities for Taxes for any Pre-Closing Tax Period except for Unpaid

(g) all Indebtedness of the Business other than the Asset Assumed Closing
Indebtedness ("Excluded Closing Indebtedness");

(h) all Retained Employment Liabilities; and

 

(i) all Liabilities of Seller and the Retained Subsidiaries under the
Transaction Documents, including all Liabilities that the
Transaction Documents contemplate will be retained by the Seller or the
Retained Subsidiaries.

In addition to the foregoing, any Liabilities of a Purchased Subsidiary that
would have been an Excluded Liability if at the Effective Time it had been a
Liability of a Seller or Retained Subsidiary shall be deemed to be the
Excluded Liabilities for purposes of this Agreement, and at the
Effective Time Seller or one or more of the Retained Subsidiaries shall
assume and be responsible for such Liabilities.

Section 2.06. L _imitation on Assignment of Purchased Assets_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, this Agreement
shall not constitute an agreement to assign or transfer any Contract or other
Purchased Asset that is not assignable or transferable without (i) the
consent of any Person, other than Seller, Buyer or any of their respective
Affiliates, and such consent shall not have been obtained prior to Closing (or
in the case of the Delayed Assets, after the Delayed Transfer Date) or (ii)
violating any Applicable Law (such assets being collectively referred to
herein as "Non-Assignable Assets"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller and
Buyer and each of their respective Subsidiaries shall have the continuing
obligation from the date hereof until eighteen (18) months after the Closing
(or in the case of the Delayed Assets, eighteen (18) months after the Delayed
Transfer Date) to use their reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary
consents to the assignment or transfer thereof, or to deliver any required
notices, it being understood that other than general internal costs, overhead
and use of internal personnel and assets or infrastructure, neither Seller,
Buyer nor any of their respective Affiliates or Subsidiaries shall be
required to expend money or incur any Liability (other than de minimis costs
and expenses), commence any litigation or offer or grant any accommodation
(financial or otherwise) to any third party to obtain such consents. Upon
obtaining the requisite third-party consents thereto, such Non-Assignable
Assets shall promptly be transferred and assigned to Buyer hereunder at no
additional cost. With respect to any Non-Assignable Asset or right thereunder
that is not transferred and assigned to Buyer at the Closing (or in the case
of the Delayed Assets, the Delayed Transfer Date) by reason of this Section
2.06 after the Closing, until any requisite consent is obtained therefor and
the same is transferred and assigned to Buyer, Buyer and Seller shall
cooperate with each other and use their reasonable best efforts to obtain for
Buyer, at no cost to Seller or Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates, an
arrangement with respect thereto to provide for Buyer to obtain substantially
comparable benefits therein and provide for Buyer to assume the obligations
and bear the economic burdens associated therewith, and to otherwise put Buyer
and Seller (and their respective Affiliates) in the position they would have
been in had such Non-Assignable Asset and accompanying Assumed Liability been

 



24  transferred at the Closing. In furtherance of the foregoing, Seller shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates to, without further consideration therefor, pay
and remit to Buyer or its designee all monies, rights and other consideration
received in respect of such Non-Assignable Asset or right thereunder as
promptly as reasonably practicable after receipt thereof.

 

Section 2.07. _Purchase Price; Allocation of Purchase Price_. The purchase
price for the Purchased Assets and the Shares is (i) One Hundred and Twenty
Million U.S. Dollars ($120,000,000), _plus_ or _minus_ , as applicable, (ii)
the Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount, _plus_ (iii) the Estimated Acquired
Closing Cash Amount and _minus_  (iv) the Estimated Assumed Closing
Indebtedness Amount (as adjusted, the "Purchase Price"). The Estimated
Purchase Price shall be paid as provided in Section 2.08 and shall be subject
to adjustment as provided in Section 2.12.

(a) The Purchase Price shall be allocated, for Tax purposes, among the
Purchased Assets and the Shares as set forth in the statement attached hereto
as _Exhibit F_ (the "Allocation Statement").

(b) If an adjustment is made with respect to the Purchase Price pursuant to
Section 2.12 or otherwise, such adjustment shall, pursuant to Section 1060 of
the Code, be allocated as agreed by Buyer and Seller, and the Allocation
Statement shall be adjusted in a manner consistent therewith. In the event
that an agreement as to such adjustment is not reached within 60 days after
the determination of the Final Adjusted Net Working Capital or other event
giving rise to an adjustment, Buyer and Seller shall jointly retain an
Accounting Referee (as defined in Section 2.11(c)) to resolve the disputed
items. Upon resolution of the disputed items, the allocations reflected on the
Allocation Statement shall be adjusted to reflect such resolution. The
costs, fees and expenses of the Accounting Referee shall be borne equally by
Buyer and Seller. Buyer and Sellers shall cooperate in the preparation of, and
shall timely file, any forms (including Form 8594) with respect to the
Allocation Statement, including any amendments to such forms required with
respect to any adjustment to the Purchase Price, pursuant to this Agreement.

(c) Buyer and Seller shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to,
file all Tax Returns (including amended returns and claims for refunds) and
information reports in a manner consistent with the Allocation Statement.

 

Section 2.08. _Estimated Purchase Price_.

 

(a) At least five Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall
deliver to Buyer a statement setting forth Sellers good faith estimate of
the Adjusted Net Working Capital (the "Estimated Adjusted Net Working
Capital"), the Estimated Acquired Closing Cash Amount and the Estimated
Assumed Closing Indebtedness Amount and the Purchase Price based
thereon, accompanied by a reasonably detailed computation of such estimate
(such statement, the "Estimated Closing Statement" and the estimate of the
Purchase Price set forth therein, the "Estimated Purchase Price").
The Estimated Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance with the
accounting principles and methodologies set forth in the Illustrative Net
Working Capital Schedule and the Accounting Principles and this Agreement.
Following delivery of the Estimated Closing Statement, Seller shall provide
Buyer and its

 



25  advisors reasonable access to the relevant books and records and employees
of Seller in connection with Buyers review of the calculation of the
Estimated Purchase Price and the parties will cooperate in good faith to
resolve any dispute with respect to the items set forth in the Estimated
Closing Statement prior to Closing (but any such dispute shall not delay the
Closing).

 

Section 2.09. _Closing_. The closing (the "Closing") of the purchase and sale
of the Shares and the Purchased Assets, the assumption of the Assumed
Liabilities and the transactions contemplated by Section 2.01(b) shall take
place at the offices of Davis Polk and Wardwell LLP, 450 Lexington Avenue, New
York, New York, on the last Business Day of Sellers fiscal month in which
all of the conditions set forth in Article 9 (other than those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, waiver of those
conditions) have been satisfied (or, to the extent permitted by Applicable
Law, waived) (the first date on which such conditions are satisfied (or, to
the extent permitted by Applicable Law, waived), the "Closing Trigger Date").
The Closing shall be deemed effective as of 11:59:59 p.m. Eastern Time on the
Closing Date (the "Effective Time"). At the Closing:

 

(a) Buyer shall deliver to Seller:

 

(i) a certificate, dated the Closing Date and signed by an executive officer
of Buyer, pursuant to Section 9.03(e) hereof;

(ii) a duly executed counterpart to each Transaction Document to which Buyer
or any Affiliate thereof is a party; 

(iii) the Estimated Purchase Price in immediately available funds by wire
transfer to an account or accounts designated by Seller by notice to Buyer;
and

(b) Seller shall deliver to Buyer:

 

(i) a certificate, dated the Closing Date and signed by an executive officer
of Seller, pursuant to Section 9.02(f) hereof;

(ii) a duly executed counterpart to each Transaction Document to which Seller
or any Affiliate thereof is a party;

(iii) certificates for the Shares (to the extent certificated) duly endorsed
or accompanied by stock powers duly endorsed in blank, with any required
transfer stamps affixed thereto;

(iv) such duly executed deeds and other good and sufficient instruments of
conveyance and transfer as shall be effective to vest good and marketable
title in Buyer to the Owned Real Property, free and clear of Liens except
Permitted Liens; and

 



26 (v) the written resignation of all of the board members and officers of
the Purchased Subsidiaries and their Subsidiaries, effective as of the
Closing.

(c) In addition to the foregoing, but subject to the other provisions of this
Article 2, Seller and Buyer (or their applicable Subsidiaries) shall execute
and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, to the other party at the
Closing such customary transfer agreements, assumption agreements,
deeds, bills of sale, endorsements, assignments, affidavits and other
instruments of sale, conveyance, transfer and assignment as may be required in
a jurisdiction in which Applicable Law or custom requires observance of
specified formalities or procedures to legally effect the transfer of the
Purchased Assets or Shares or assumption by Buyer (or one or more of its
Subsidiaries) of the Assumed Liabilities, in each case, in such form as is
reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and Seller (the "Foreign Transfer
Agreements").

Section 2.10. _Foreign Transfer Agreements_. The Foreign Transfer
Agreements shall serve purely to effect the legal transfer or assignment of
the Purchased Assets and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities in the
applicable jurisdictions. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) the Foreign Transfer
Agreements shall not have any effect on the value being given or received by
Seller or Buyer, including the allocation of assets and Liabilities as between
them, all of which shall be determined solely in accordance with this
Agreement and (ii) in the event of any conflicts between any Foreign Transfer
Agreement and this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall control in all
respects.

 

Section 2.11. _Final Purchase Price Calculation_. (a) As promptly as
practicable, but no later than 60 days after the Closing Date, Seller will
cause to be prepared and delivered to Buyer a statement (the "Closing
Statement") setting forth Sellers calculation of (i) Adjusted Net Working
Capital, (ii) Acquired Closing Cash, (iii) Assumed Closing Indebtedness and
(iv) the Purchase Price based thereon. The Closing Statement shall be prepared
in accordance with the Illustrative Net Working Capital Schedule and the
Accounting Principles. Buyer shall assist Seller in the preparation of the
Closing Statement and shall provide Seller reasonable access to the
properties, books and records of Buyer for such purpose.

 

(b) If Buyer disagrees with Sellers calculation of the Purchase Price as set
forth in the Closing Statement, Buyer may, within 30 days after delivery of
the Closing Statement, deliver a written notice to Seller (a "Dispute Notice")
disagreeing with such calculation and which specifies Buyers calculation of
the (i) Adjusted Net Working Capital, (ii) Acquired Closing Cash, (iii)
Assumed Closing Indebtedness and (iv) the Purchase Price based thereon in
reasonable detail, including specifying Buyers grounds for each point of
disagreement. The Dispute Notice shall specify those items or amounts as to
which Buyer disagrees (each, a "Disputed Item") and Buyer shall be deemed to
have agreed with all other items and amounts contained in the Closing
Statement.

 

(c) If Buyer duly delivers a Dispute Notice, Buyer and Seller shall, during
the 30 days following such delivery, use their reasonable best efforts to
reach agreement on each Disputed Item in order to determine the Purchase
Price. If Buyer and Seller are unable to reach such agreement during such
period, they shall promptly thereafter jointly retain a nationally recognized
and independent accounting firm, who shall not have any material

 



27  relationship with Buyer or Seller or any of their respective Affiliates (the
"Accounting Referee") and cause such Accounting Referee promptly to review
this Agreement and the Disputed Items for the purpose of calculating the
Purchase Price. The Accounting Referee shall deliver to Buyer and Seller, as
promptly as practicable, a written report setting forth such calculation. Such
report shall be final and binding upon Buyer and Seller. The cost of such
review and report shall be borne by Seller and Buyer in inverse proportion as
they may prevail on the matters resolved by the Accounting Referee, which
proportionate allocation shall be calculated on an aggregate basis based on
the relative dollar values of the amounts in dispute and shall be determined
by the Accounting Referee at the time the determination of such firm is
rendered on the merits of the matters submitted. Buyer and Seller shall in
good faith execute customary engagement documentation required by the
Accounting Referee. The Accounting Referee shall determine, based solely on
presentations by Buyer and Seller and their respective representatives, and
not by independent review, only those Disputed Items still in dispute. In
resolving any Disputed Item, the Accounting Referee shall be bound by the
provisions of this Agreement and the application of the Illustrative Net
Working Capital Schedule and the Accounting Principles. With respect to its
determination of each such Disputed Item, the Accounting Referee may only
decide the specific Disputed Items still under dispute by the parties and its
decision for each such Disputed Item must be within the range of values
assigned to each such Disputed Item in the Closing Statement and the Dispute
Notice.

(d) Buyer and Seller agree that they will, and agree to cause their
respective independent accountants and Subsidiaries to, cooperate and assist
in the preparation of the Closing Statement and the calculation of the
Purchase Price and in the conduct of the reviews referred to in this Section
2.11, including the making available to the extent necessary of books,
records, work papers and personnel.

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, neither the calculations to be made pursuant
to this Section 2.11 nor the purchase price adjustment to be made pursuant to
Section 2.12 are intended to be used to adjust for errors or omissions that
may be found with respect to the Balance Sheets or the Target Adjusted Net
Working Capital Amount, for which Article 10 shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy. No fact or event, including any market or business development,
occurring on or after the Effective Time, and no change in GAAP or Applicable
Law after the date hereof, shall be taken into consideration in the
calculations to be made pursuant to Section 2.12.

 

Section 2.12. _Adjustment of Purchase Price_. (a) Subject to Section 2.12(b),
if the Final Purchase Price exceeds the Estimated Purchase Price, Buyer shall
pay to Seller, in the manner and with interest as provided in Section 2.12(c),
the amount of such excess. If the Final Purchase Price is less than the
Estimated Purchase Price, Seller shall pay to Buyer, in the manner and with
interest as provided in Section 2.12(c), the amount of such difference. The
"Final Purchase Price" means the Purchase Price (x) as set forth in the
Closing Statement if Buyer does not duly deliver a Dispute Notice or (y) if a
Dispute Notice is delivered (i) as agreed between Seller and Buyer pursuant to
Section 2.11(c) or (ii) in the absence of such agreement, as determined by the
Accounting Referee pursuant to Section 2.11(c); _provided_ , that in no event
shall the finally determined Adjusted Net Working Capital (the "Final Adjusted
Net Working Capital"), Acquired Closing Cash or Assumed Closing Indebtedness
(collectively, the "Final Adjusted Amounts"), in each case, be more than the
higher value thereof proposed by either Seller or Buyer or less than the lower
value thereof proposed by either Seller or Buyer, in each case, as set forth
in the Closing Statement and the Dispute Notice, respectively.

 



28 (b) For purposes of calculating the Final Purchase Price pursuant to Section
2.12(a):

 

(i) Promptly upon the determination of the Final Adjusted Amounts, the parties
shall determine the amount that would have been paid pursuant to Section 2.08
if the Final Adjusted Amounts had been substituted for the Estimated Adjusted
Net Working Capital, Estimated Acquired Closing Cash Amount and Estimated
Assumed Closing Indebtedness Amount, as applicable.

 

(ii) If such substitution when netted, would have resulted in a Purchase Price
that is less than the Estimated Purchase Price paid at the Closing, then
Seller shall pay to Buyer an aggregate amount equal to such shortfall pursuant
to Section 2.12(a).

 

(iii) If such substitution when netted, would have resulted in a Purchase
Price that is greater than the Estimated Purchase Price paid at the Closing,
then Buyer shall pay to Seller an aggregate amount equal to such excess
pursuant to Section 2.12(a).

 

(iv) If such substitution when netted, would have resulted in a Purchase Price
that is equal to the Estimated Purchase Price paid at Closing, then there
shall be no adjustment to the Estimated Purchase Price.

(c) Any payment pursuant to this Section 2.12 shall accrue interest pursuant
to Section 2.13 and shall be made by Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, at a
mutually convenient time within five Business Days after the determination of
Final Purchase Price, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such
account or accounts of such other party as may be designated by such other
party.

Section 2.13.  _Payments_. Any amount required to be paid by Buyer or Seller
under this Agreement that is not paid within the period specified for such
payment shall bear interest on a daily basis, from and including the date such
payment was required to be made hereunder, to but excluding the date of
payment, at a rate per annum equal to the rate of interest publicly announced
by JPMorgan Chase Bank from time to time as its prime rate in effect at its
office located at 270 Park Avenue, New York, New York in effect from time to
time during the period from the date such payment was required to be made
hereunder, to the date of payment. Such interest shall be payable at the same
time as the payment to which it relates and shall be calculated on the basis
of a year of 365 days and the actual number of days elapsed.

Section 2.14. _Withholding_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
each party shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable
pursuant to this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents such amounts as
are required to be deducted and withheld under Applicable Law (such party
that deducts and withholds, the "Withholding Party"). The Withholding Party
shall timely pay the full amount so deducted or withheld to the relevant
Taxing Authority, in accordance with Applicable Law. To the extent
such amounts are

 



29  so deducted or withheld and timely paid to the relevant Taxing Authority
under this Section 2.14, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents as having been paid by the
Withholding Party to the other party.

Section 2.15. _Delayed Transfer_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the parties hereby agree
that the conveyance, assignment, transfer and delivery to Buyer (or one or
more of its Subsidiaries) of the Purchased Assets (other than the Assigned IP
and the Purchased Assets described in Section 2.02(j)) located in the
jurisdictions set forth in Section 2.15(a) of the Disclosure Schedule or
other jurisdictions outside of the United States and Canada in which brand
concept stores or agency relationships are managed from such jurisdictions
(the "Delayed Assets"), and the assumption by Buyer (or one or more of its
Subsidiaries) of the Assumed Liabilities with respect thereto (including
without limitation, the Delayed Assets Employees), shall (x) not occur until
the earlier of (i) the twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing Date and
(ii) such earlier date after the Closing designated by Buyer on not less than
thirty (30) days written notice to Seller and (y) be subject to the prior
completion and fulfillment of any Delayed Assets Employees Notice Obligation
as required pursuant to any Delayed Assets Employees Notice Procedure, which
Seller and Buyer agree to work together in good faith to promptly fulfill
(such date that the Delayed Assets are conveyed, assigned, transferred or
delivered to, and the Assumed Liabilities with respect thereto are assumed
by, Buyer (or one or more of its Subsidiaries), the "Delayed Transfer Date")
_provided_ that the Delayed Transfer Date shall occur on the last Business Day
of Sellers fiscal month in which the date set forth in the foregoing clauses
(i) or (ii), as the case may be, occurs. The consummation of such conveyance,
assignment, transfer, delivery and assumption shall be deemed effective as of
11:59 p.m. on the Delayed Transfer Date (the "Delayed Transfer Effective
Time"). Following Sellers receipt of such written notice, Buyer and Seller
shall cooperate in good faith to agree upon an appropriate method of
conveying, assigning, transferring and delivering physical possession of the
applicable Delayed Assets. The transfer of the Delayed Assets and the
assumption of the Assumed Liabilities with respect thereto shall be effected
without the payment of any additional consideration by Buyer or its
Subsidiaries and shall not modify, alter or otherwise affect any obligations
with respect to the calculation or payment of the Purchase Price set forth in
this Article 2.

 

(b) Until the conveyance, assignment, transfer or delivery to Buyer (or one or
more of its Subsidiaries) of the Delayed Assets and the assumption of the
Assumed Liabilities with respect thereto, and except as expressly contemplated
by the Transaction Documents or with Buyers written consent (which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), from the Closing until the
Delayed Transfer Effective Time, Seller shall, and shall cause its Retained
Subsidiaries to, conduct the Business associated with the Delayed Assets in
the ordinary course consistent with past practice (it being understood that,
after the Closing, as between the Parties, Buyer will be solely and
exclusively responsible for the prosecution, maintenance and enforcement, in
its sole discretion, of the Intellectual Property Rights included in the
Purchased Assets) and use reasonable best efforts to (A) preserve intact the
Businesss business organizations and relationships with third parties,
including customers and suppliers, and (B) without being required to increase
compensation or pay any bonuses or other amounts, keep available the services
of those of its officers and employees who are

 



30  involved in the operation of the Business as presently conducted. In
addition, until the Delayed Transfer Effective Time, Seller and its
Subsidiaries shall not take any actions that would be prohibited by Section
5.01 of this Agreement (other than any changes to the policies, procedures, or
processes which are generally applicable to Seller and its Subsidiaries,
_provided_ any such changes do not affect the amounts that would otherwise be
payable under Section 2.15(d)), with respect to the Delayed Assets and the
Business related thereto, to the same extent as if such provisions were to
apply to the Seller or such Subsidiaries until the Delayed Transfer
Effective Time. Without limiting the foregoing, and to the extent permitted
by Applicable Law, Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, in
respect of the Delayed Assets and the Assumed Liabilities relating thereto,
take such reasonable and lawful direction from Buyer with respect to the
operation and conduct of the Business associated with the Delayed Assets and
the Assumed Liabilities related thereto and shall permit Buyer to make all
strategic and business decisions relating thereto, including, in each case,
to the extent permissible under Applicable Law, (i) the issuance of any new
purchase orders other than in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice (so long as such ordinary course of business is
not inconsistent with Buyers specific direction), (ii) the opening or
closing of stores, (iii) the introduction of new products, (iv) the expansion
of operations of the Business, (v) the hiring, termination or transfer
of Delayed Assets Employees, (vi) the licensing or sublicensing of
Intellectual Property Rights, (vii) providing return authorizations to
customers or granting credits to retailers other than in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practice (so long as such ordinary course of
business is not inconsistent with Buyers specific direction), and (viii)
marketing and product designs. Seller shall also cooperate with Buyer in good
faith, and Seller shall provide Buyer with regular updates regarding the
activities and operations of the Business, to the extent requested by Buyer
during the period prior to the Delayed Transfer Effective Time in connection
with the transition of the Business associated with the Delayed Assets to
Buyer (or its Subsidiaries) at the Delayed Transfer Effective Time. Seller
shall keep Buyer reasonably informed of any new purchase orders, return
authorizations to customers and credits to retailers provided by the Business
in the ordinary course of business in accordance with the previous sentence.

(c) Subject to Applicable Law and the Confidentiality Agreement, Seller
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, (i) give Buyer, its counsel and
other authorized representatives reasonable access (such access to occur
during normal business hours and on reasonable notice and in such a manner as
would not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the
Seller) to all properties, personnel, books and records of the Business to the
extent related to the Delayed Assets, (ii) furnish to Buyer, its counsel and
other authorized Representatives such financial and operating data and other
information in the possession of Seller and its Subsidiaries (and in the form
such information or data then exists) relating to the Business to the extent
related to the Delayed Assets as such Persons may reasonably request, and
(iii) instruct the employees, independent accountants, counsel and financial
advisors of Seller to cooperate with the Buyer in respect of the management
and operations of such Business. Buyer shall bear all reasonable out-of-
pocket costs and expenses incurred by Seller and its Affiliates pursuant to
this Section 2.15(c).

(d) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the end of each fiscal month
after the Closing Date through (and including) the month in which the Delayed
Transfer Date occurs, Seller shall submit to the Buyer an unaudited statement
of pre-Tax operating cash flows substantially in the form of _Schedule II_
hereto (the "Cash Flow Schedule") setting forth

 



31  the operating cash flows of the Business in respect of the Delayed Assets
calculated in accordance with the Accounting Principles and determined in the
manner set forth in the Cash Flow Schedule, which shall reflect the operating
cash flows of the Business associated with the Delayed Assets for each partial
or whole fiscal month following the Closing Date until the Delayed Transfer
Date (each, a "Cash Flow Statement"). Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, in no event shall Seller or its Subsidiaries allocate or charge
costs or expenses to the Business associated with the Delayed Assets other
than as set forth on the Cash Flow Statement.

 

(e) To the extent that a Cash Flow Statement indicates that the Business
associated with the Delayed Assets had positive pre-Tax operating cash flows
for a partial or whole fiscal month after the Closing Date until the Delayed
Transfer Date, the Seller shall pay, or cause to be paid, such amount to Buyer
(or one of its Subsidiaries designated by Buyer) as soon as
commercially practicable, but in no event later than five Business Days,
after delivery of the Cash Flow Statement. To the extent that a Cash Flow
Statement indicates that the Business associated with the Delayed Assets had
negative pre-Tax operating cash flows for a partial or whole fiscal month
after the Closing Date until the Delayed Transfer Date, then Buyer (or one of
its Subsidiaries designated by Buyer) shall pay, or cause to be paid, such
amount to Seller as soon as commercially practicable, but in no event later
than five Business Days, after delivery of the Cash Flow Statement.

(f) Any dispute between the parties regarding the amounts set forth in any
Cash Flow Statement delivered pursuant to this Section 2.15 shall be subject
to resolution in the same manner set forth in Section 2.11 of this Agreement.

 

(g) On the Delayed Transfer Date, each of Buyer and Seller shall execute and
deliver the Foreign Transfer Agreements in respect of the transfer of the
Delayed Assets to Buyer (or one or more of its Subsidiaries designated by it)
and the assumption by Buyer (or one or more of its Subsidiaries) of the
Assumed Liabilities with respect thereto, assuming for such purposes
that references to the Closing Date in such Foreign Transfer Agreements refer
to the relevant Delayed Transfer Date.

(h) In the event of loss or damage occurring to any Delayed Asset (a "Damaged
Asset" and such event an "Asset Casualty") following the Closing and prior to
the Delayed Transfer Date, (i) Seller shall notify Buyer promptly upon
the occurrence of an Asset Casualty and provide Buyer with such updates and
information as Seller receives from time to time, (ii) Seller shall use its
reasonable best efforts to restore the Damaged Asset to a safe condition and
(iii) at the Delayed Transfer Effective Time, Seller or the Other Sellers, as
applicable, shall assign to Buyer or its designated Subsidiary all proceeds of
property and casualty insurance (net of any such proceeds actually spent to
restore the Damaged Asset) maintained by Seller or the Other Sellers
attributable to such Damaged Asset.

(i) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Assumed
Liabilities shall include all Liabilities (other than Excluded Liabilities)
relating to the ownership, use or operation of the Delayed Assets or the
conduct of the Business associated with the Delayed Assets that are
incurred following the Effective Time and prior to the Delayed Transfer
Effective Time, except for any such Liabilities (which shall be deemed to be
Excluded Liabilities for purposes of this Agreement), resulting from a breach
by Seller or its Subsidiaries 

 



32  of this Section 2.15(i) or that are otherwise incurred outside of the
ordinary course of business of the Business (unless taken at the specific
direction of Buyer in accordance with this Section 2.15) and any such
Liabilities shall be deemed to be Excluded Liabilities for purposes of this
Agreement. Seller shall cooperate with Buyer and assist Buyer in obtaining
insurance policies in the name of Seller and its Subsidiaries under terms and
conditions requested by Buyer with respect to insuring the Liabilities of the
Business associated with the Delayed Assets following the Effective Time.
Buyer shall be responsible for the costs of such insurance policies and
such insurance policies shall name Buyer and its Subsidiaries as additional
insured Persons. Such policies and any and all rights thereunder shall be
assigned to Buyer at the Delayed Transfer Date.

 

ARTICLE 3

 

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER_

 

Except as set forth in the Disclosure Schedule (with specific reference to the
particular Section or subsection of this Agreement to which the information
set forth in the Disclosure Schedule relates, but subject to Section 12.13),
Seller hereby represents and warrants to Buyer, as of the date hereof and as
of the Closing Date, that:

 

Section 3.01. _Corporate Existence and Power_. Seller is a corporation duly
incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation and has full power and authority to enable it to
own, lease or otherwise hold its properties and assets (including the
Purchased Assets) and to conduct its Business as presently conducted.
Each Other Seller is duly organized, validly existing and, to the extent
legally applicable, is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the
character of any properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of
the Business conducted makes such qualification necessary. Seller and each
Other Seller, as applicable, has full corporate or similar authority and power
to execute and deliver this Agreement and each of the other Transaction
Documents to which it is a party and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. Seller has made available to Buyer correct
and complete copies of Sellers certificate of incorporation and bylaws and
all amendments thereto.

 

Section 3.02. _Corporate Authorization_. The execution, delivery and
performance by Seller of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby are within Sellers corporate powers and have
been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Seller.
The execution, delivery and performance of each other Transaction Document to
which Seller or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, by Seller and any such
Subsidiary, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, are
within Sellers and any such Subsidiarys corporate or similar authority and
power and have been, or will be prior to their execution, delivery and
performance, duly authorized by all necessary corporate or similar action on
the part of Seller and any such Subsidiary. Assuming due and valid execution
by each other party hereto, this Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by Seller and constitutes a valid and binding agreement of Seller,
enforceable against Seller in accordance with its terms (subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
other laws affecting creditors rights generally and general principles of
equity (collectively, the "Enforceability Exceptions")). Assuming due and
valid 

 



33  execution by each other party thereto, each other Transaction Document to
which Seller or any of its Subsidiaries is a party constitutes or, upon the
execution and delivery thereof by Seller and any such Subsidiary, shall
constitute, a valid and binding agreement of Seller and any such Subsidiary,
enforceable against Seller and any such Subsidiary in accordance with its
terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions.

 

Section 3.03. _Governmental Authorization_. The execution, delivery and
performance by Seller and each of its Subsidiaries of each Transaction
Document to which it is a party and the consummation by Seller or such
Subsidiary of the transactions by Seller or such Subsidiary, as applicable,
contemplated hereby and thereby require no action by or in respect of, or
filing with, any Governmental Authority and none of Seller nor any Subsidiary
of Seller is required to provide any notice, declaration, filing or receive
the consent or approval of any Governmental Authority, other than (i) those
required to be made or obtained pursuant to the HSR Act; (ii) those required
to be made or obtained with respect to Competition Laws; (iii) those required
to be made or obtained under the 1934 Act, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder; (iv) those required to be made or obtained with
respect to work councils, labor unions and similar bodies; or (v) any such
actions or filings, the failure to make or obtain would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to the Business.

Section 3.04. _Noncontravention_. The execution, delivery and performance by
Seller and each of its Subsidiaries of the Transaction Documents to which it
is a party, and the consummation of the transactions by Seller or such
Subsidiary contemplated hereby and thereby do not and will not, with or
without notice or lapse of time or both, assuming compliance with the matters
referred to in Section 3.03, (i) conflict with, violate or result in a breach
of any provision of the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other
governing or similar organizational document of Seller or its Subsidiaries,
(ii)) violate, breach or conflict with any Applicable Law (iii) require any
consent or other action by any Person under, constitute a default under, or
give rise to any right of termination, revocation, cancellation
or acceleration of, any right or obligation of Seller, or any Other Seller or
any Purchased Subsidiary, or to a loss of any benefit to which Seller or any
Other Seller or any Purchased Subsidiary is entitled under any provision of
any agreement or other instrument binding upon Seller, any Other Seller or
any Purchased Subsidiary, or cause the forfeiture of any right under any
indenture, mortgage, lease, contract, agreement, license, charter or
instrument to which Seller or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or is bound,
or (iv) result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any Purchased
Asset, the Shares or on any asset of any Purchased Subsidiary, except for any
Permitted Liens, with such exceptions, in the case of each of clauses (ii)
through (iv), as would not have, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to be material to the Business or as would not prevent or
materially delay the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document to which Seller or any of its Subsidiaries is a party.

Section 3.05. _Purchased Subsidiaries_. (a) Each Purchased Subsidiary is duly
organized and validly existing and, to the extent legally applicable, in good
standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization. Each Purchased
Subsidiary (i) has full organizational and corporate power and authority to
carry on the Business as now conducted and (ii) has full corporate power and
authority to own, lease and operate any and all of its properties, rights and
assets in respect of the Business. Since the Balance Sheet Date and except as
disclosed to Buyer prior to the date hereof, no Purchased Subsidiary has been
treated as a corporation for Tax purposes.

 



34 (b) Section 3.05(b) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth the authorized,
issued and outstanding shares of capital stock (or other equity interests) of
each Purchased Subsidiary and the record and beneficial owners of such
outstanding shares of capital stock (or other equity interests) of each
Purchased Subsidiary. All of the Shares (and equity interests in the other
Purchased Subsidiaries) are owned beneficially and of record by Seller, the
Retained Subsidiaries or a Purchased Subsidiary (as applicable) free and clear
of any Lien. All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock (or
other equity interests) of the Purchased Subsidiaries (i) are duly authorized
and validly issued, are fully paid and nonassessable and were not issued in
violation of any preemptive or similar rights, and (ii) were offered and
issued in compliance with applicable securities laws. Each of Seller, the
applicable Retained Subsidiary and Purchased Subsidiaries has the right,
authority and power to sell, assign and transfer any or all of such Shares to
Buyer.

 

(c) Except for the Shares and as otherwise set forth on Section 3.05 Section
3.05(b) of the Disclosure Schedule or Section 3.05(c) of the Disclosure
Schedule, there are no equity interests in a Purchased Subsidiary issued,
reserved for issuance or outstanding and there are no preemptive or similar
rights on the part of any holder of any class of securities of any Purchased
Subsidiary (other than any other Purchased Subsidiary). There are no options,
warrants, preemptive or similar rights, rights of first refusal, convertible
or exchangeable securities, "phantom" stock rights, stock appreciation
rights, stock-based performance units or Contracts to which any Purchased
Subsidiary, Seller or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of
them is bound that (i) would obligate any of them to issue, deliver,

Buyer has full corporate authority and power to execute and deliver this
Agreement and each of the Transaction Documents and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. Buyer has all governmental
licenses, authorizations, permits, qualifications, consents and approvals
required to carry on its businesses as now conducted, except for those
licenses, authorizations, permits, qualifications, consents and approvals, the
absence of which would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to prevent or materially delay the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or any other Transaction Document to which Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party.

 

Section 4.02. _Corporate Authorization_. The execution, delivery and
performance by Buyer of this Agreement and the consummation of the

have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of
Buyer. The execution, delivery and performance of each other Transaction
Document to which Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries is a party and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, are within Buyers and
such Subsidiarys corporate or similar authority and power and have been, or
will be prior to their execution, delivery and performance, duly authorized
by all necessary corporate or similar action on the part of Buyer and any such
Subsidiaries. Assuming due and valid execution by each other party hereto,
this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Buyer and constitutes
a valid and binding agreement of Buyer, enforceable against Buyer in
accordance with its terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions. Assuming
due and valid execution by each other party thereto, each other Transaction
Document to which Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries is a party constitutes or,
upon the execution and delivery thereof by Buyer or such Subsidiary, shall
constitute, a valid and binding agreement of Buyer and any such
Subsidiary, enforceable against Buyer and any such Subsidiary in accordance
with its terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions.

performance by Buyer of each Transaction Document and the consummation by
Buyer of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby require no action by

filing or receive the consent or approval of any Governmental Authority other
than (i) those required to be made or obtained pursuant to the HSR Act, (ii)
those media reports required to be made or obtained under the Securities Law,
1968 applied in Israel, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder; (iii) those required to be made or obtained with respect to
applicable Competition Laws; (iv) those required to be made or obtained with
respect to work councils, labor unions and similar bodies; or (v) any such

Buyer of the Transaction Document to which it is a party and the consummation
of the transaction by Buyer contemplated hereby and thereby do not and will
not with or without notice or lapse of time or both, assuming compliance with

in a breach of any provisions of the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or
other governing or similar organizational document of Buyer or its applicable
Subsidiaries, (ii) violate, breach or conflict with any Applicable Law, or
(iii) require any consent or other action by any Person under, constitute a

cancellation or acceleration of any right or obligation of Buyer or to a loss
of any benefit to which Buyer is entitled under any provision of any agreement
or other instrument binding upon Buyer with such exceptions, in the case of
each of clauses (ii) through (iii), as would not prevent or materially delay
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other Transaction
Document to which Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries is a party.

 

Section 4.05. _Financing_. Buyer has, and will have prior to the Closing,
sufficient cash, available lines of credit or other sources of immediately
available funds to enable it to make payment of the Purchase Price and any
other amounts to be paid by it hereunder.

 

Section 4.06. _Litigation_. There are no Actions pending against or, to the
knowledge of Buyer, threatened against, Buyer, except for such Actions as
would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to prevent
or materially delay the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
other Transaction Document to which Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries is
a party.

Section 4.07. _Finders  Fees_. There is no investment banker, broker, finder
or other intermediary which has been retained by or is authorized to act on
behalf of Buyer who might be entitled to any fee or commission in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents.

 

Section 4.08. _Inspections; No Other Representations_. Buyer is an informed
and sophisticated purchaser, and has engaged expert advisors, experienced in
the evaluation and purchase of property and assets such as the Purchased
Assets and the Shares as contemplated hereunder. Buyer has undertaken such
investigation and has been provided with and has evaluated such documents and
information as it has deemed necessary to enable it to make an

 



50  informed and intelligent decision with respect to the execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement. Buyer acknowledges that Seller has given
Buyer access to certain documents of the Business. Buyer acknowledges that
the representations and warranties contained in Article 3 and in any
certificate or closing document delivered pursuant to this Agreement are the
only representations and warranties made by Seller in connection with the
transactions contemplated herein. Buyer acknowledges that Seller makes no
representation or warranty with respect to (i) any projections, estimates or
budgets delivered to or made available to Buyer or its Representatives of
future revenues, future results of operations (or any component thereof),
future cash flows or future financial condition (or any component thereof) of
the Business or the future business and operations of the Business or (ii)
except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, any other information or
documents made available to Buyer or its Representatives with respect to the
Business; _provided_ that nothing herein shall preclude any claim in the event
that Buyer is able to demonstrate that Seller has made a material
misstatement of fact to Buyer that constitutes actual fraud against Buyer.

Section 4.09. _Purchase for Investment_. Buyer is purchasing the Shares for
investment for its own account and not with a view to, or for sale in
connection with, any distribution thereof. Buyer (either alone or together
with its advisors) has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and
business matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its
investment in the Shares and is capable of bearing the economic risks of such
investment.

or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and any
other Competition Laws as soon as practicable.

(c) If any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any other Transaction Documents under the
HSR Act or any other applicable Competition Law, or if any Action is
instituted or threatened by any Governmental Authority or any private party
challenging any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
other Transaction Document as violative of the HSR Act or any other
Competition Law, Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to
promptly resolve such objections. In furtherance of the foregoing, Buyer
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Affiliates to, take all actions,
including (i) agreeing to hold separate or to divest any of the businesses or
properties or assets of the Business, the Purchased Assets or the Purchased
Subsidiaries; (ii) creating or terminating any relationship, contractual
rights or obligations of the Business, the Purchased Assets or the Purchased
Subsidiaries; (iii) effectuating any other change or restructuring of the
Business, the Purchased Assets or the Purchased Subsidiaries and (iv)
opposing, fully and vigorously, (x) any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding that is initiated or threatened to be initiated challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and (y)
any request for, the entry of, and seek to have vacated or terminated, any
Order that could restrain, prevent or delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including in the case of either (x) or (y)
by defending through litigation any action asserted by any Person in any court
or before any Governmental Authority, and vigorously pursuing all
available avenues of administrative and judicial appeal (and, in each case,
to enter into agreements or stipulate to the entry of an Order or decree or
file appropriate applications with any Governmental Authority in connection
with any of the foregoing and in the case of actions by or with respect to
the Purchased Assets and Purchased Subsidiaries; by consenting to such
action), as may be required (x) by the applicable Governmental Authority in
order to resolve such objections as such Governmental Authority may have to
such transactions under the HSR Act or any other applicable Competition Law or
(y) by any domestic or foreign court or other tribunal, in any Action
challenging such transactions as violative of the HSR Act or any other
applicable Competition Law, in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution, vacating, lifting, altering or reversal of, any Order that has
the effect of restricting, preventing or prohibiting the consummation of the 

 



57  transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing
or any other provision of this Agreement, none of Buyer and any of its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates shall be required to agree to any sale, transfer,
license, separate holding, divestiture or other disposition of, or to any
prohibition of or any limitation on the acquisition, ownership, operation,
effective control or exercise of full rights of ownership, or
other modification of rights in respect of, the Business, the Purchased
Assets or the Assumed Liabilities, or other remedy that, in each case, (x) is
not conditioned on the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the other Transaction Documents, (y) would impose any obligation
on Buyer its Affiliates to agree to any sale, transfer, license, separate
holding, divestiture or other disposition of any asset, rights, properties,
entities or business, or any other restriction, other than in respect of the
Business, the Purchased Subsidiaries or the Purchased Assets or (z) would,
after giving effect to such action, reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the Business, the Purchased Subsidiaries and the Purchased
Assets, taken as a whole.

(d) After the Closing, and for no further consideration, each of Seller
and Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, execute, acknowledge and
deliver such agreements, instruments or deeds, and take such other actions as
may reasonably be requested to more effectively convey to, transfer to or vest
in Buyer the Purchased Assets or assumption by Buyer of the Assumed
Liabilities as contemplated by this Agreement to be transferred or assumed at
the Closing (or in the case of the Delayed Assets and the Assumed Liabilities
relating thereto, the Delayed Transfer Date), including (i) transferring back
to Seller any asset which is not a Purchased Asset, (ii) transferring to Buyer
any Purchased Asset or Assumed Liability contemplated by this Agreement to be
transferred to Buyer at the Closing which was not so transferred at the
Closing and (iii) transferring to Buyer any Business Records in the possession
of Seller or its Affiliates that constitute Purchased Assets but are not
located at a Real Property described in Section 2.02(b). 

Section 6.02. _Certain Filings_. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with one
another (i) in determining whether any action by or in respect of, or filing
with, any Governmental Authority is required, or any actions, consents,
approvals or waivers are required to be obtained from parties to any
Contracts, in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents and (ii) in taking such actions or making any such filings,
furnishing information required in connection therewith and seeking to obtain
any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers in a timely manner.

Section 6.03. _Public Announcements_. The parties agree that an initial press
release to be issued with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be in a mutually agreed form. The parties further agree to
obtain the written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld) of the
other before issuing any additional press release or making any public
statement with respect to the Transaction Documents or the transactions
contemplated thereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that a party may, without the
prior written consent of the other party, but only following consultation
with the other party to the extent practicable, issue such public disclosure
as may be required by Applicable Law or any listing agreement with any
national securities exchange to which the disclosing party is subject.

 

Section 6.04. _Notices of Certain Events_. Each of Seller and Buyer shall
promptly notify the other party of:

 

(i) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by any Transaction Documents;

 



58 (ii) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority
in connection with the transactions contemplated by any Transaction
Documents; and

(iii) the commencement of any Action that, if pending on the date of this
Agreement, would have been required to be disclosed pursuant to, in the case
of Seller, Section 3.09 or, in the case of Buyer, Section 4.06.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (i) a partys
failure to comply with this Section 6.04 shall not, in itself, provide the
other party hereto or any of such other partys Affiliates with a right not to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.04 will not be deemed to
modify any of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of
Buyer or Seller, as applicable, or the remedies available hereunder to Buyer
or Seller, as applicable, or the conditions to Buyers or Sellers, as
applicable, obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

Section 6.05.  _Non-Compete; Non-solicit_.

(a) Seller agrees that it will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries not to,
during the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the third
anniversary of the Closing Date, directly or indirectly, acquire any of the
businesses set forth on Section 6.05(a) of the Disclosure Schedule.

 

(b) For a period of eighteen months following the Closing Date (or in the case
of Delayed Assets Employees, the Delayed Transfer Date), Seller shall not,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly, solicit (or
cause to be directly or indirectly solicited) for employment or hire in any
capacity (whether as an employee, consultant or otherwise) any
Business Employee who is an officer, management employee or more senior
employee of the Business as of the date hereof or is set forth in Section
6.05(a) of the Disclosure Schedule (any such employee, a "Covered Employee").
The foregoing shall not (i) restrict Seller or its Affiliates from engaging
in generalized searches for employees through media advertisements of general
circulation, employment search firms, open job fairs or other similar means
which, in each case, are not specifically targeted at such Covered Employees
or (ii) apply to any Covered Employee (x) whose employment has been terminated
by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including any Purchased Subsidiary) or (y)
who voluntarily resigns, in the case of (x) or (y) at least six months prior
to commencement of employment discussions with Seller or its Affiliates.

 

(c) For a period of eighteen months following the Closing Date, Buyer shall
not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing, the
Purchased Subsidiaries) not to, directly or indirectly, solicit (or cause to
be directly or indirectly solicited) for employment or hire in any capacity
(whether as an employee, consultant or otherwise) (i) any officer,
management employee or more senior employee of Seller with whom Buyer, its
Affiliates or any of its or their representatives has made contact in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
Transition Services Agreement prior to the Closing; _provided_ , that the
foregoing shall not (A) restrict Buyer or its Affiliates from engaging

 



59  in generalized searches for employees through media advertisements of
general circulation, employment search firms, open job fairs or other similar
means which, in each case, are not specifically targeted at such employees,
(B) apply to any such employee whose employment has been terminated by Seller
or any of its Affiliates or who voluntarily resigns, in either case, at least
six months prior to commencement of employment discussions with Buyer or any
of its Affiliates or (C) apply to any Business Employee and (ii) in the case
of employees of Seller or its Subsidiaries who provide services to Buyer
pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement, the foregoing restriction
shall apply until the date that is eighteen months after the last date on
which the services of such employees are provided by Seller or its Affiliates
pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement.

 

(d) Seller and Buyer acknowledge that: (i) the obligations under this Section
6.05 are reasonable in the context of the nature of the Business and the
Retained Business and the competitive injuries likely to be sustained by the
Business and Buyer and the Retained Business and Seller, as the case may be,
if Seller or Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates were to violate such
obligations; (ii) the covenants in this Section 6.05 are adequately supported
by consideration from each party for the benefit of the other party and were a
material inducement to such party to enter into this Agreement and (iii) the
foregoing makes it necessary for the protection of the Business and Buyer and
the Retained Business and Seller, as the case may be, that Seller and Buyer
uphold their respective obligations under this Section 6.05 for
the reasonable time period contained herein and therein. If any provision in
this Section 6.05 shall for any reason be held invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability
shall not affect any other provisions of this Section 6.05, but this Section
6.05 shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision
had never been contained herein. It is the intention of the parties that if
any of the restrictions or covenants contained herein is held to cover a
geographic area or to be for a length of time which is not permitted by
Applicable Law, or in any way construed to be too broad or to any extent
invalid, such provision shall not be construed to be null, void and of no
effect, but to the extent such provision would be valid or enforceable under
Applicable Law, a court of competent jurisdiction shall construe and interpret
or reform this Section 6.05 to provide for a covenant having the
maximum enforceable geographic area, time period and other provisions (not
greater than those contained herein) as shall be valid and enforceable under
such Applicable Law.

 

Section 6.06. _No Solicitation of Alternative Transactions_. Neither Seller
nor its Affiliates shall, and each shall cause their Representatives, not to,
directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate, facilitate, encourage or accept any
inquiries or proposals from any person relating to any direct or indirect
acquisition or purchase, merger, recapitalization, consolidation, business
combination, sale of assets, sale of any equity interest (including by way of
equity issuance or exchange), or similar or comparable transactions, in each
case for the acquisition of all or a substantial portion of the Business,
other than sales of Inventory in the ordinary course of business and other
than the transaction contemplated by this Agreement (any such inquiry,
proposal or offer being referred to as an "Alternative Proposal"), or engage
in discussions, conversations, negotiations or other communications with or
provide any information to, or otherwise assist or cooperate with, or enter
into any agreement, commitment or understanding with, any person (other than
Buyer and its Affiliates and designated Representatives) in connection with
any Alternative Proposal; _provided_ that this Section 6.06 shall not apply to
any transaction or proposed transaction (or any discussions or other
activities in respect thereof) involving the Retained Business or an
acquisition of Seller.

 



60 Section 6.07. _Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representation; Nonassertion
of Attorney-Client Privilege_. (a) Buyer waives and shall not assert, and
agrees to cause its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Purchased
Subsidiaries) to waive and not to assert, any conflict of interest arising out
of or relating to the representation, after the Closing (the "Post-Closing
Representation"), of Seller or any of its Affiliates or any shareholder,
officer, employee or director of Seller or any of its Affiliates (any such
Person, a "Designated Person") in any matter involving this Agreement or any
other Transaction Document or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,
by any legal counsel currently representing Seller or any of its Affiliates,
including any Purchased Subsidiary, in connection with this Agreement or any
other Transaction Document or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
(the "Current Representation").

 

(b) Buyer waives and shall not assert, and agrees to cause its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Purchased Subsidiaries) to waive and to
not assert, any attorney-client privilege with respect to any communication
between any legal counsel currently representing Seller or any of its
Affiliates and any Designated Person occurring during the Current
Representation in connection with any Post-Closing Representation in
connection with a dispute with Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including,
after the Closing, the Purchased Subsidiaries); _provided_ , that the
foregoing waiver and acknowledgement of retention shall not extend to any
communication not involving this Agreement or any other Transaction Document
or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or to communications with
any Person other than the Designated Persons and their advisers;  _provided_
, _further_ , that the foregoing waiver shall not apply to Buyers ability to
assert privilege vis-a-vis any third party (other than Seller and its
Affiliates).

 

(c) Seller and Buyer agree to take, and to cause their respective Affiliates
to take, all steps reasonably necessary to implement the intent of this
Section 6.07.

Section 6.08. _Access to Information; Cooperation_. (a) From the date hereof
until the Closing Date (or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement),
and subject to Applicable Law and the Confidentiality Agreement, Seller shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates to (i) give Buyer, its counsel and other
authorized Representatives reasonable access to all properties, personnel,
books and records of the Business, (ii) furnish to Buyer, its counsel and
other authorized Representatives such financial and operating data and other
information relating to the Business as such Persons may reasonably request
and (iii) instruct the employees, independent accountants, counsel and
financial advisors of Seller to cooperate with Buyer in its investigation of
the Business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer and its agents shall not
have access (A) to any properties of the Business, including the Purchased
Assets and Real Property, for purposes of conducting any sampling or other
invasive investigation, including of the air, soil, soil gas, surface
water, groundwater, building materials or other environmental media, (B) to
any information to the extent relating to any Retained Business or (C) any
Seller Tax Records, _provided_ , that Seller shall extract from Seller Tax
Records and provide to Buyer any information solely related to the Purchased
Subsidiaries, the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or the Business as
reasonably requested by Buyer.

 



61 (b) From and after the Closing Date, and subject to Applicable Law, upon
request of the other party, Seller and Buyer will give the other party and
its authorized Representatives reasonable access to its properties, books,
records, employees and auditors (i) to the extent necessary to prepare and
review the Closing Statement and the calculations therein, (ii) to complete
the audit contemplated by Section 6.14 and (iii) to the extent necessary to
permit such other party to comply with its financial reporting, accounting or
auditing obligations with respect to any period ending before the Closing
Date with respect to the Business or the Excluded Assets or Excluded
Liabilities, in each case, subject to restrictions set forth in Section 5.02
and Section 6.13, as applicable. From and after the Closing Date, and subject
to Applicable Law, Seller will, and will cause its applicable Subsidiaries to,
furnish to Buyer and its authorized Representatives, during normal business
hours, upon reasonable notice, access to the Business Records held by
Seller or its Subsidiaries that have not already been furnished pursuant to
Section 2.02(n).

(c) In furtherance of the foregoing, from and after the Closing Date, Seller
and Buyer will provide and, as applicable, cause their respective employees
and their respective Affiliates and their employees to provide, all
cooperation reasonably requested by or on behalf of the other party, any of
their respective Affiliates or their respective Representatives in connection
with any Assumed Liability or Excluded Liability, as the case may be, which
cooperation will include furnishing or causing to be furnished records,
information and testimony as reasonably requested by the parties, their
respective Affiliates or their respective Representatives and using reasonable
best efforts to cause employees who possess knowledge pertaining to any such
Action to provide information, recollections and explanations with respect
thereto and make themselves available, including for consultation with respect
to settlement discussions and to attend strategy sessions and judicial and
arbitration proceedings, as requested by any such party, their respective
Affiliates or their respective Representatives in connection therewith;
_provided_ that, notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer or Seller, as
applicable, will only be obligated to cause any person to cooperate with
the other party pursuant to this Section 6.08(c) if and for so long as Buyer
or Seller, as applicable, is capable of directing the actions of such person.

 

(d) Any access granted to either party or its Representatives pursuant to this
Section 6.08 shall be conducted in such manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the party granting such
access. The party to whom such access or other cooperation is granted pursuant
to this Section 6.08 shall bear all of the out-of-pocket costs and
expenses (including attorneys fees, but excluding reimbursement for general
overhead, salaries and employee benefits) reasonably incurred by the other
party or its Representatives in connection therewith.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, nothing in this
Section 6.08 shall require (i) Seller or Buyer, as applicable, to provide the
other party or its Representatives with access to (x) personnel records of
employees relating to individual performance or evaluation records, medical
histories or other information which, in the disclosing partys good faith
opinion, the disclosure of which would reasonably be expected to subject such
party or its Affiliates to risk of liability or (y) information the disclosure
of which, in the disclosing partys good faith opinion, based on the advice
of counsel, would conflict with confidentiality obligations of the Retained
Business to which such party or any of its Affiliates is

 



62 bound or would reasonably be expected to result in the forfeiture or waiver of
any attorney-client or similar privilege; _provided_ , that, in the case of
this clause (y), the disclosing party shall use reasonable best efforts to
provide the other party, to the extent possible, with access to the relevant
information in a manner that would not reasonably be expected to result in
the forfeiture or waiver of any such attorney-client or similar privilege or
violate such confidentiality provisions, (ii) either partys independent
accountants to make available to the other party or its Representatives any
work papers unless and until such Person has signed a customary
confidentiality and hold harmless agreement relating to such access to work
papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such independent
accountants or (iii) Seller or Buyer, as applicable, to provide the other
party or its Representatives access or information in connection with any
Action in which Seller or any Retained Subsidiary is an adverse party to
Buyer.

 

Section 6.09. _Use of Seller Retained Marks after Closing_. As soon as
reasonably practicable (and in any event within one hundred twenty (120)
days) after the Closing (or in the case of the Delayed Assets, the Delayed
Transfer Date), Buyer shall (i) cease any and all use of the trademarks and
service marks listed in Section 6.09 of the Disclosure Schedule (the "Seller
Retained Marks"), and (ii) use reasonable best efforts to remove, conceal,
cover, redact and/or replace such Seller Retained Marks from any and all
materials under the control or possession of Buyer that contain the Seller
Retained Marks (it being understood that nothing herein shall prevent,
restrict or otherwise limit Buyer or any of its Affiliates from (A) stating
the historical relationship between the Business and Seller and its Affiliates
for informational purposes (and in a non-trademark manner) and with
reasonable notices, indications or legends indicating that Seller and its
Affiliates are no longer affiliated with the Business, or (B) making any use
of any of the Seller Retained Marks that (x) would constitute "fair use" or
otherwise not be prohibited under Applicable Law if such use were made by a
third party, or (y) is otherwise required under Applicable Law, including
references to the Seller Retained Marks in historical, Tax, regulatory and
similar records).

Section 6.10. _Cessation of Use of Owned Intellectual Property Rights_.
Immediately following the Closing Date, except as provided under the License
Agreement, Seller and its Subsidiaries shall have no right, title or interest
in or to any Owned Intellectual Property Rights, including the Acquired
Brands. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing (and in any event
within one hundred twenty (120) days), except as provided under the License
Agreement, Seller and its Subsidiaries shall use their reasonable best efforts
to cease any and all use of the Owned Intellectual Property Rights, including
the Acquired Brands.

Section 6.11. _Litigation Cooperation_. From and after the Closing, each of
Buyer and Seller will provide and, as applicable, cause their respective
employees and Subsidiaries and their employees to provide, all such reasonable
cooperation to the other party, its Affiliates and their
respective Representatives with respect to any third party claims or Actions
relating to the Excluded Liabilities or Excluded Assets, as applicable, or any
other party subject to indemnification pursuant to Article 10, which
cooperation will include furnishing or causing to be furnished, records
(including those items of a kind described in the definition of Business
Records), information, and deposition and trial testimony and preparation as
reasonably requested by Buyer or Seller, as applicable, their respective
Affiliates or their respective Representatives; _provided_ , that, (A) no such
cooperation shall unreasonably interfere with the operation of the business of
such party providing such access and resources or any of its 

 



63  Affiliates, (B) no such cooperation shall be required in the case of an
Action or dispute between Buyer and Seller, or their respective Affiliates and
(C) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.11 the
accommodating party shall only be obligated to cause any person to cooperate
in such matters if and for so long as such party is capable of directing the
actions of such person. The party requesting such assistance shall bear any
and all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses actually incurred by the
accommodating party, its Affiliates or their respective employees or
Representatives as a result of complying with this Section 6.11, except to
the extent the requesting party (or an indemnified party) is entitled to
indemnification therefor pursuant to Article 10.

 

Section 6.12. _Replacement of Guaranties_. Buyer shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the replacement, effective as of the Closing (or in the case
of the Delayed Assets, as of the Delayed Transfer Date), of the guaranties
listed in Section 6.12 of the Disclosure Schedule (collectively, the
"Substituted Guaranties"), including by obtaining bank guarantees and letters
of credit to replace the Substituted Guarantees, in each case, to the extent
necessary, and Seller shall reasonably cooperate in Buyers efforts;
_provided_ that neither Seller nor any of Sellers Subsidiaries shall have
any obligations to make payments or incur any costs or expenses, grant any
concession or incur any other liability in connection with such cooperation
pursuant to this Section 6.12 except to the extent Buyer agrees to
promptly reimburse Seller or any of its respective Subsidiaries; _provided
further_ , that if any such guaranty is not replaced effective as of the
Closing (or in the case of the Delayed Assets, as of the Delayed Transfer
Date), Buyer shall (i) continue to use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the replacement of any unreplaced guaranties and (ii) indemnify Seller and its
Affiliates with respect to any such unreplaced guaranties in accordance with
Section 10.02(b)(iii) (but solely to the extent the liability with respect to
such unreplaced guaranty is an Assumed Liability). Without limiting the
foregoing, neither Buyer nor any of its Subsidiaries shall extend or renew any
Contract containing or underlying a Substituted Guaranty unless, prior to or
concurrently with such extension or renewal, Buyer or one of its respective
Affiliates (as applicable) is substituted in all respects for Seller and any
of its respective Affiliates (as applicable), and Seller and its respective
Affiliates are released in respect of all obligations of Seller and such
Affiliates under such Substituted Guaranty. In no event shall Buyer or any of
its Subsidiaries be obligated to pay any money to any person, other than any
payments required to obtain bank guarantees and letters of credit, to the
extent necessary, and any other payments of de minimis amounts, to effect the
replacements described in this Section 6.12.

the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate at the Closing only with
respect to that portion of the Confidential Information (as defined in the
Confidentiality Agreement) as relates to the Purchased Subsidiaries and the
Business and otherwise shall continue in full force and effect following the
Closing. If this Agreement is terminated for any reason prior to the Closing,
the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms.

 



64 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, with respect to
any information furnished by Buyer, Seller or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to the other party pursuant to Section 6.08(b), the
Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms for a period of two years following such partys
receipt of such information.

Section 6.14. _Audit Cooperation_. From and after the Closing, Seller will
furnish to Buyer such financial and operating data and other information as
Buyer may reasonably request, and shall instruct its employees to reasonably
cooperate (during normal business hours and in such a manner as would not
interfere unreasonably with the conduct of business of Seller) with Buyer, in
connection with the preparation by Buyer of audited financial statements of
the Business as of and for the period ending on the Closing Date. Buyer shall
bear all out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Seller in connection
therewith.

Section 6.15. _Pre-Closing Transactions_. During the period following the
date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time (or in the case of the
Delayed Assets, prior to the Delayed Transfer Effective Time), Seller shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Buyer and assist Buyer
in taking the actions described on Section 6.15 of the Disclosure Schedule.

designated Subsidiary all proceeds of property and casualty insurance (net of
any such proceeds actually spent to restore the Damaged Real Property)
maintained by Seller or the Other Sellers attributable to such Damaged Real
Property.

 

Section 6.17. _Correspondence_. From and after the Closing Date until the 18
month anniversary of the Closing Date, Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to Buyer any mail or other
communications received by Seller or its Affiliates from any person intended
for the Business, the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or the
Purchased Subsidiaries (including any mail or other communications in respect
of the subject matter of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents).

 

Section 6.18. _Transition Services Schedules_. The parties hereby agree that,
prior to the Closing, they shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates
to, negotiate in good faith the schedules to the Transition Services
Agreement, including with respect to the applicable scope of services, payment
obligations and duration, in accordance with the terms and provisions of the
form of Transition Services Agreement attached hereto as _Exhibit E_.

 _TAX MATTERS_

 

Section 7.01. _Tax Returns; Allocation of Taxes_.

 

(a) Seller shall (i) file or cause to be filed, when due (taking into account
any extension of a required filing date), all Tax Returns with respect to the
Purchased Subsidiaries that are required to be filed on or prior to the
Closing Date and timely pay all Taxes shown as due on such Tax Returns and
(ii) file or cause to be filed, when due (taking into account any
extension of a required filing date), all Tax Returns that relate to Combined
Taxes and timely pay all Taxes shown as due on such Tax Returns (each a "Pre-
Closing Seller Filed Tax Return") to the extent not paid at or before Closing
or taken into account in the calculation of Final Adjusted Amounts. All other
Tax Returns with respect to the Purchased Subsidiaries shall be filed or
caused to be filed by Buyer.

 

(b) Buyer shall file, or cause to be filed, when due (taking into account any
extensions of a required filing date), all Tax Returns for Income Taxes with
respect to the Purchased Subsidiaries that do not relate to Combined Taxes,
which are required to be filed by any of the Purchased Subsidiaries after the
Closing Date with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a Straddle
Tax Period (each a "Pre-Closing Buyer-Filed Income Tax Return"). Any Pre-
Closing Buyer-Filed Income Tax Return shall be prepared in a manner consistent
with past practice and without a change of any election or any accounting
method and shall be submitted by Buyer to Seller (together with schedules,
statements and, to the extent reasonably requested by Seller, supporting
documentation) at least thirty (30) Business Days prior to the due date
(including any applicable extension) of such return. Seller shall have the
right to review and comment on such Pre-Closing Buyer-Filed Income Tax Return.
If Seller, within ten (10) Business Days after review of any such Pre-Closing
Buyer-Filed Income Tax Return, notifies Buyer in writing that it objects to
any items in such return, the disputed item shall be resolved in a manner
mutually agreeable to both parties within 10 Business Days, and if not so
resolved, then by a jointly retained Accounting Referee (which may be the
same as or different from the Accounting Referee retained pursuant to Section
2.07, if any) within a reasonable time, taking into account the deadline for
filing such return. Upon resolution of all such items, the relevant Pre-
Closing Buyer-Filed Income Tax Return shall be adjusted to reflect such
resolution and shall be binding upon the parties without further adjustment.
The costs, fees and expenses of such Accounting Referee shall be borne equally
by Buyer and Seller. Except to the extent otherwise required pursuant to a
Final Determination, no Purchased Subsidiary shall amend any Tax Return with
respect to Income Tax for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a Straddle Tax Period
without the prior written consent of Seller, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld. Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes with
respect to any Pre-Closing Buyer-Filed Income Tax Return filed under this
Section 7.01(b) in accordance with Applicable Law. Seller shall pay to Buyer
an amount equal to any Pre-Closing Income Taxes shown as due and payable on
any Pre-Closing Buyer-Filed Income Tax Return prepared in compliance with this
Section 7.01(b), to the extent not paid at or before Closing or taken into
account in the calculation of Final Adjusted Amounts,

 



66 by the later of (i) ten (10) Business Days after Buyer, after having paid such
Income Taxes, submits to Seller an invoice evidencing such payment and (ii)
five (5) days prior to the latest date on which such Income Taxes are due and
payable by Buyer without interest or penalties. In the event of a dispute
between the parties with respect to any Pre-Closing Buyer-Filed Income Tax
Return, any previously filed Pre-Closing Buyer-Filed Income Tax Return shall
be adjusted to reflect such resolution, including by the filing of an amended
Pre-Closing Buyer-Filed Income Tax Return, if such return was filed prior to
resolution of such items.

(c) In the case of any Taxes (other than any Transfer Taxes payable in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents) where an applicable Straddle Tax Period is not or
cannot be closed on the Closing Date, the amount of Taxes allocable to the
portion of the Straddle Tax Period ending on the Closing Date (including for
purposes of determining the amount of Taxes attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period with respect to such Straddle Tax Period) shall be deemed to be (i) in
the case of any Taxes other than gross receipts, sales or use Taxes and Taxes
based upon or related to income, the amount of such Taxes for the entire
period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
calendar days in the Straddle Tax Period up through and ending on and
including the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of
calendar days in the entire relevant Straddle Tax Period, and (ii) in the case
of any Tax based upon or related to income and any gross receipts, sales or
use Tax, the amount of any such Taxes that would have been payable if the
relevant Tax period ended on and included the Closing Date. All determinations
necessary to give effect to the allocation set forth in the foregoing clause
(ii) shall be made in a manner consistent with prior practice of Seller, its
Affiliates or the Purchased Subsidiaries, as applicable.

(d) All Transfer Taxes imposed as a result of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by Seller and fifty
percent (50%) by Buyer when due. Seller shall file (or cause to be filed) all
necessary Tax Returns in respect of Transfer Taxes that are required by
Applicable Law to be filed by Seller. Buyer shall file (or cause to be filed)
all other Tax Returns in respect of Transfer Taxes. If required by Applicable
Law, Seller and Buyer shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to,
cooperate in preparing and filing and join in the execution of any such Tax
Returns. Each of Buyer and Seller shall (i) for any Transfer Taxes in respect
of which it is required to file Tax Returns pursuant to this Section 7.01(d),
pay to the relevant Taxing Authority any Transfer Taxes shown as due on such
Tax Returns and (ii) for any Transfer Taxes in respect of which the other
party is required to file Tax Returns pursuant to this Section 7.01(d) pay to
the other party, within two (2) Business Days prior to the due date for such
Transfer Taxes, any portion of such Transfer Taxes that it is required to bear
under this Section 7.01(d).

 

Section 7.02. _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. (a) Subject to Section 7.02(b),
Buyer and Seller agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to each other,
upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information and assistance
relating to the Business, the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities and
the Purchased Subsidiaries (including access to books and records) as is
reasonably necessary for the filing of all Tax Returns, the making of any
election relating to Taxes, the preparation for any audit by any Taxing
Authority, and the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or proceeding
relating to any Tax. Buyer and Seller shall (i) retain all books and records
with respect to Taxes pertaining to the Business, the Purchased Assets, the
Assumed

 



67 Liabilities or the Purchased Subsidiaries until the expiration of any
applicable statute of limitations and abide by all record retention
agreements entered into with any Taxing Authority for all periods required by
such Taxing Authority, and (ii) use reasonable best efforts to provide the
other party with at least 30 days prior written notice before destroying any
such books and records, during which period the party receiving the notice can
elect to take possession, at its own expense, of such books and records.
Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with each other fully, as and to the
extent reasonably requested by the other party, in the conduct of any audit
or other proceeding relating to Taxes involving the Business, the Purchased
Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or the Purchased Subsidiaries. Buyer and
Seller shall each reimburse the other party for any out of pocket costs
associated with compliance with this provision.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except to the
extent solely relating to the Purchased Subsidiaries, Purchased Assets or the
Assumed Liabilities, Seller and its Affiliates shall not be required at any
time to provide to Buyer any right to access or to review any Tax Return or
Tax work papers of Seller, any Seller Group, or any Affiliate of Seller (such
Tax Returns or Tax work papers, the "Seller Tax Records").

 

Section 7.03. _Tax Refunds_. Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid to Seller any
refund of Taxes and interest thereon received by Buyer, any Affiliate of
Buyer or the Purchased Subsidiaries attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period
no later than ten (10) days following receipt of such refund, net of any
Income Taxes imposed thereon.

 

Section 7.04. _Buyer Covenants_. Buyer shall pay and indemnify and hold
harmless Seller from and against any Taxes imposed on a Seller or a Seller
Group as a result of any actions taken by Buyer or any Purchased Subsidiary on
the Closing Date, other than in the ordinary course of business or otherwise
as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or any other Transaction Document.

ARTICLE 8

 

 _EMPLOYEE MATTERS_

 

Section 8.01. _Employment_. Buyer shall (or shall cause its Subsidiaries to)
(i) continue the employment at and after the Effective Time of each Purchased
Subsidiary Business Employee and (ii) within a reasonable period of time (but
not fewer than 30 days) prior to the Closing Date, make an offer to employ
each Non-Automatic Transfer Business Employee commencing as of the Effective
Time with Buyer or one of its Subsidiaries or a Purchased Subsidiary in each
case on the terms set forth in this Article 8, _provided_ , _however_ , that
Buyers obligations in respect of clauses (i) and (ii) above shall not apply
to any employee who is terminated, or shall be terminated, pursuant to Section
6.15. Buyer shall reimburse Seller or its applicable Affiliate for any
severance or other termination-related payments or benefits paid or provided
by Seller or its Affiliate to any Non-Automatic Transfer Business Employee who
rejects an offer of employment from Buyer or one of its Subsidiaries or a
Purchased Subsidiary that does not meet the requirements of the
preceding sentence. Unless a written acceptance of an offer of employment is
required by Applicable Law, a Business Employee who continues employment or
who has received an offer of employment pursuant to this Section 8.01 or
Section 8.02 shall be deemed to have accepted such continuance or offer,
unless such Business Employee specifically declines such continuance or offer.

 



68 Section 8.02. _Automatic Transfer Business Employees_. The parties acknowledge
and agree that the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents in
so far as they relate to Automatic Transfer Business Employees will constitute
the automatic transfer of such employees to Buyer or its Subsidiary by
operation of law. If it is found or alleged that any Automatic Transfer
Business Employee does not automatically transfer to Buyer or its relevant
Subsidiary, Buyer may (or may cause its relevant Subsidiary to) make an offer
to such Automatic Transfer Business Employee on the terms set forth in this
Article 8.

Section 8.03. _Transferred Employees_.

 

(a) As used herein, "Transferred Employee" means (i) each Purchased Subsidiary
Business Employee whose employment is continued at and after the Effective
Time pursuant to Section 8.01, (ii) each Non-Automatic Transfer Business
Employee, or if applicable, an Automatic Transfer Business Employee, who
accepts Buyers offer of employment pursuant to this Article 8 and (iii) each
Automatic Transfer Business Employee whose employment automatically transfers
pursuant to Section 8.02.

 

(b) As of the Effective Time , Seller shall ensure that each Transferred
Employee is released from employment with Seller or any Retained Subsidiary,
and from any post-termination or employment restrictions that would prohibit
or restrict such employee from performing his or her duties for Buyer, a
Purchased Subsidiary or a Subsidiary of any of them with effect from the
Closing or on the date of acceptance of employment with Buyer, a Purchased
Subsidiary or a Subsidiary of any of them, if later.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, but subject to the remaining
provisions of this Section 8.03(c), Seller shall take any and all actions
necessary to ensure that (i) the employment of Inactive Employees does not
transfer as of the Effective Time, (ii) each Inactive Employee remains
eligible for any Seller Welfare Plan in which he or she participates as of the
Effective Time following the Effective Time and (iii) Seller and its
Affiliates retain all Liabilities with respect to such Inactive Employees.
With respect to any Inactive Employee who is able to return to active service
within twelve (12) months after the Effective Time, Buyer shall (or shall
cause its Subsidiary to), not later than ten days prior to, and effective as
of, such Inactive Employees scheduled return date, make an offer to employ
such Inactive Employee on the terms set forth in this Article 8; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Buyer shall comply with the re-employment requirements of
the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA).
Effective as of the date on which an Inactive Employee commences employment
with Buyer or its Subsidiary, such Inactive Employee shall be treated as
a Transferred Employee for all purposes under this Agreement.

(d) Subject to Section 8.01, Seller and its relevant Affiliates shall be
responsible for any and all Liabilities arising prior to the Effective Time
with respect to the Business Employees employment or termination of
employment, including any statutory and non-statutory severance obligations,
and any other termination payment obligations owed to the Business Employees
arising or accruing prior to the Effective Time whether pursuant to an

 



69  agreement, plan, practice or policy, or Applicable Law, excluding any
Liabilities incurred on account of Buyers (or its Subsidiaries) failure to
abide by the terms and conditions of this Article 8 or due to Buyer (or its
Subsidiaries) terminating the employment of any Transferred Employee. Seller
and Buyer shall each be responsible for fifty percent (50%) of any and all
Liabilities described in the immediately preceding sentence that arise at the
Effective Time, and Seller and Buyer shall work together in good faith to
reduce or eliminate such Liabilities (the applicable party shall reimburse the
other party within sixty (60) days of incurring such Liability). In addition,
subject to Section 8.01, Seller and its relevant Affiliates shall retain any
and all Liabilities after the Effective Time with respect to the Business
Employees who do not become Transferred Employees, excluding any
Liabilities incurred on account of Buyers (or its Subsidiaries) failure to
abide by the terms and conditions of this Article 8 or due to Buyer (or its
Subsidiaries) terminating the employment of any Transferred Employee. Buyer
and its relevant Affiliates shall be responsible for any and all Liabilities
arising after the Effective Time with respect to the Transferred Employees
employment or termination of employment and all Liabilities incurred on
account of Buyers (or its Subsidiaries) failure to abide by the terms and
conditions of this Article 8.

(e) For purposes of this Article 8 (except for Sections 8.06 and 8.12) and
the definition of Assumed Employment Liabilities, and except to the extent
otherwise required by Applicable Law, those Business Employees in the
jurisdictions set forth on Section 2.15(a) of the Disclosure Schedule (the
"Delayed Assets Employees") shall not become Transferred Employees until the
Delayed Transfer Effective Time, and any reference to the Effective Time,
Closing or the Closing Date for purposes of Transferred Employees under
this Article 8 shall be deemed to be the Delayed Transfer Effective Time or
Delayed Transfer Date, as applicable, for the Delayed Assets Employees. Seller
and its Affiliates shall continue to provide compensation and employee
benefits (including statutory arrangements) for the Delayed Asset Employees
as of the Closing through the Delayed Transfer Date in accordance with and
subject to the provisions of Sections 2.15 and 6.15. For clarity, Buyer and
its relevant Affiliates shall be responsible for any and all Liabilities
which Seller or its respective Affiliates may incur after the Effective Time
with respect to the termination or transfer of any Business Employee if such
termination or transfer is at the direction of the Buyer or its Affiliates.

Section 8.04. _Maintenance of Compensation and Benefits_. Buyer agrees that it
shall provide (or cause its Subsidiaries to provide) each Transferred
Employee with, for the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on
the first anniversary of the Closing Date, (i) an annual base salary or wage
rate that is at least equal to his or her annual base salary or wage rate as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) employee benefits
(including severance benefits) that are substantially similar to, in the
aggregate, the employee benefits provided to similarly situated employees of
Buyer and its Affiliates as in effect from time to time. Notwithstanding
anything in this Article 8 to the contrary, for the period commencing at the
Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary of the Closing Date,
Buyer shall ensure that the terms and conditions provided to each Transferred
Employee following the Effective Time shall be subject to the requirements of
Applicable Law and applicable collective bargaining, works council and other
labor agreements as listed on Section 3.17(a) of the Disclosure Schedule.

 



70 Section 8.05. _US Defined Contribution Plans_. As of the Effective Time, Buyer
shall cover (or cause to be covered) each Transferred Employee who is based
primarily in the United States under a defined contribution plan and trust
intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code (the "Buyer DC
Plan"). Effective as of the Effective Time or any subsequent date reasonably
requested by Buyer (but not later than the 60th day following the Effective
Time), Buyer shall allow the Transferred Employees to effect a "direct
rollover" (as described in Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) of their account
balances (excluding promissory notes evidencing all outstanding participant
loans) under the VF 401(k) Savings Plan to the Buyer DC Plan.

Section 8.06. _Bonuses_. On or as soon as practicable following, or within
thirty (30) days prior to, the Closing Date (or in the case of Delayed Assets
Employees, the earlier of the Delayed Transfer Date or the regular payment
date), Seller shall (or shall cause its applicable Affiliate to) pay to each
Transferred Employee the amount of the annual bonus or other cash incentive
or commission bonus plan that such employee earned under the applicable plan
of Seller or its Affiliate for the year in which the Closing Date occurs), in
an amount equal to the amount accrued with respect to such bonus as of the
Closing Date, as prorated to reflect the portion of such year ending on the
Closing Date, to the extent not already paid. In accordance with the
foregoing, Seller shall calculate such accruals in a manner consistent with
past practice, taking into account performance through the Closing Date or
any date during the thirty (30) day period immediately preceding the Closing
Date. For the avoidance of doubt, Seller shall retain all Liabilities with
respect to such prorated bonus amounts. 

Section 8.07. _International DC Plans_. With respect to each International
Plan (other than any Purchased Subsidiary Plan) which provides defined
contribution retirement benefits (each, a "Seller International DC Plan"),
effective as of the Closing Date, each Transferred Employee who as of
immediately prior to the Closing Date is an active participant in a Seller
International DC Plan shall cease to be an active participant in such plan and
shall become a participant in a defined contribution retirement plan
established or designated by Buyer, if required by Applicable Law or an
applicable collective bargaining, works council or other labor agreement as
listed on Section 3.17(a) of the Disclosure Schedule or an applicable
employment agreement on the terms substantially similar to the terms
previously provided to Buyer as of the date hereof (each, a "Buyer
International DC Plan"). As soon as practicable after the Closing Date to the
extent required by Applicable Law or an applicable collective bargaining,
works council or other labor agreement as listed on Section 3.17(a) of the
Disclosure Schedule or an applicable employment agreement on the terms
substantially similar to the terms previously provided to Buyer as of the date
hereof, Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the transfer from
each Seller International DC Plan to the applicable Buyer International DC
Plan of the Transfer Amount attributable to the Transferred Employees who are
participants as of immediately prior to the Closing Date in such Seller
International DC Plan, where permitted by Applicable Law (the "DC Transfer
Date"). The "Transfer Amount" with respect to a Seller International DC Plan
shall be equal to the account balances as of the DC Transfer Date,
unless otherwise required by Applicable Law.

Section 8.08. _Service Credit_. Buyer shall grant (or cause its Subsidiaries
to grant) each Transferred Employee credit for years of prior service, and
recognize such employees continuity of service, with Seller or any of its
Affiliates or their respective

 



71  predecessors for all purposes, including eligibility, vesting and benefit
accrual (other than benefit accrual under a defined benefit pension plan or
retiree medical plan), under each employee benefit plan sponsored or
maintained by Buyer or any of its Affiliates; provided, however, that such
credit shall not result in a duplication of benefits. For the avoidance of
doubt, Buyer shall (or shall cause its Subsidiaries to) credit
each Transferred Employee with all paid time off accrued and unused by such
Transferred Employee through the Effective Time to the extent reflected on the
Closing Statement; provided that, to the extent required by Applicable Law,
all paid time off accrued and unused by such Transferred Employee through the
Effective Time shall, promptly following the Closing, be paid by Buyer (or its
Subsidiaries) to such Transferred Employee (or reimbursed by Buyer to Seller
(or its applicable Affiliate) if Applicable Law requires Seller (or its
applicable Affiliate) to pay such paid time off accrued and unused by such
Transferred Employee through the Effective Time.

 

Section 8.09. _Welfare Plans_. As of the Effective Time, each Transferred
Employee shall cease participation in the health and welfare benefit plans of
Seller and its Affiliates (each, a "Seller Welfare Plan") and following the
Effective Time each Transferred Employee shall commence participation in the
health and welfare benefit plans maintained, administered or contributed to
by Buyer and its Subsidiaries. Seller and its Affiliates shall be responsible
for providing benefits in respect of claims incurred under a Seller Welfare
Plan for Transferred Employees and their beneficiaries and dependents at or
prior to the Effective Time. Benefits in respect of all welfare plan claims
incurred by Transferred Employees after the Effective Time shall be provided
by Buyer and its Affiliates. For purposes of this Section 8.09, the following
claims shall be deemed to be incurred as follows: (a) life, accidental death
and dismemberment and business travel accident insurance benefits, upon the
death or accident giving rise to such benefits and (b) health or
medical, dental, vision care and/or prescription drug benefits, upon
provision of the applicable services, materials or supplies.

 

Section 8.10. _Pre-Existing Conditions and Co-Payments_. Buyer shall (or shall
cause its Subsidiaries to) use reasonable best efforts to:

(a) waive all limitations as to pre-existing conditions, exclusions and
waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to the Transferred Employees under any health and welfare plans in
which such Transferred Employees are eligible to participate after the
Effective Time to the extent that such limitations were waived under
the applicable Seller Welfare Plan; and

(b) provide each Transferred Employee with credit for any co-payments and
deductibles paid at or prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any
applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any health and
welfare plans in which such Transferred Employee is eligible to participate
after the Effective Time.

 

Section 8.11. _Flexible Spending Accounts_. As of the Effective Time, each
Transferred Employee in the U.S. shall be eligible to participate in Buyers
flexible spending account plan and Seller shall retain all Liabilities with
respect to Sellers flexible spending account plan(s).

 



72 Section 8.12. _WARN Act/Collective Dismissals_.

 

(a) On or before the Closing Date, Seller shall provide a list of the name and
site of employment of any and all Business Employees in any jurisdiction who
have experienced, or will experience, an employment loss or layoff  as
defined by the WARN Act  within ninety (90) days prior to the Closing Date
and in relation to the Delayed Assets Employees only, the period between the
Closing Date and the Delayed Transfer Date. Seller shall update this list up

its relevant Affiliates shall be responsible for any and all Liabilities
which Buyer, Seller and their respective Affiliates may incur after the
Effective Time in connection with any Action brought against any of them under
the WARN Act or other Applicable Law relating to a termination of employment
that result from actions taken by Buyer or its Affiliates after the Effective
Time, with respect to the termination of employment of any Business Employee,
except that Seller and its relevant Affiliates shall be responsible for any
and all such Liabilities which Buyer and its Affiliates may incur in
connection with any Action brought against Buyer or its Affiliates under the
WARN Act or other Applicable Law relating to a termination of employment to
the extent related to inaccurate information provided by Seller in the
Employment Loss Update. Buyer and Seller agree to work together to mitigate
any Liabilities under WARN or other Applicable Law relating to a termination
of employment in respect of the Business Employees.

 

(b) With respect to the Business Employees, Seller shall not, at any time
ninety (90) days before the Closing Date and in relation to the Delayed

representing employees in the event of an employment loss or layoff.

(c) In addition to Section 8.03(d), Seller and its relevant Affiliates shall
be responsible for any and all Liabilities under the WARN Act with respect to
the Business Employees who do not become Transferred Employees; _provided
however_ , that Buyer and its relevant Affiliates shall be responsible for
any and all Liabilities under the WARN Act with respect to any Business
Employees who reject an offer of employment from Buyer or one of its
Subsidiaries or a Purchased Subsidiary that does not meet the requirements of
this Article 8.

Section 8.13. _Workers Compensation_. Buyer (or its Subsidiaries) shall be
responsible for providing benefits in respect of all claims for benefits in
respect of workers compensation and any comparable liabilities that are based
upon Transferred Employees injuries or illnesses that arise after the

providing benefits in respect of all claims for benefits in respect of workers
compensation and any comparable liabilities that are based upon Transferred
Employees injuries or illnesses that arise at or prior to the Effective
Time.

material risk of Liability.

 

Section 8.15. _Notifications_. Prior to the Closing Date (and with respect to
the Delayed Transfer Employees, the Delated Transfer Date), Buyer and Seller
agree to work together in good faith to fulfill any obligations to inform,
consult and notify under Applicable Law, with any employee representative
bodies (including any labor unions, labor organizations or works
councils) which represent employees affected by the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

Section 8.16. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Without limiting the generality
of the last sentence of Section 12.07, nothing in this Article 8, express or

parties hereto, including any Business Employee, any right, benefit or remedy
of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, (b) shall
establish, or constitute an amendment, termination or modification of, or an

be performed on or after the Closing shall survive the Closing indefinitely
or for the shorter period explicitly specified therein; _provided_ that all
obligations with respect to any Excluded Liability or Assumed Liability shall
survive indefinitely. Notwithstanding the preceding two sentences, any breach
or inaccuracy of any covenant, agreement, representation or warranty in
respect of which indemnity may be sought

 



76  under this Agreement shall survive the time at which it would otherwise
terminate pursuant to the preceding two sentences, if notice of the breach or
inaccuracy thereof giving rise to such right of indemnity shall have been
given pursuant to Sections 10.03 or 10.04, as applicable, to the party against
whom such indemnity may be sought prior to such time.

 

Section 10.02. _Indemnification_. (a) Effective at and after the Closing,
Seller shall indemnify Buyer and its Affiliates and each of their respective
directors, officers, employees, agents, successors and assigns (collectively,
the "Buyer Indemnified Parties") against and shall hold each of them harmless
from any and all damage, liability, cost, loss and expense ("Damages")
actually suffered by any Buyer Indemnified Party to the extent arising out of
or relating to, without duplication:

 

(i) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made in this
Agreement (each such breach, a "Warranty Breach") by Seller as of the date of
this Agreement or as of the Closing Date (except to the extent expressly made
as of an earlier date, in which case the accuracy of such representation or
warranty shall be tested as of such earlier date); _provided_ that for
purposes of this clause (i) of this Section 10.02(a), any such breach or
inaccuracy of a representation or warranty and the Damages resulting therefrom
shall be determined, except with respect to the applicable Specified
Qualifiers, without regard to the effect of any qualification contained
therein relating to materiality or a "Material Adverse Effect";

 

(ii) any breach of covenant or agreement made or to be performed by Seller
pursuant to this Agreement;

 

(iii) (A) any Pre-Closing Tax of any of the Purchased Subsidiaries or with
respect to the Purchased Assets, (B) any Liability for the payment of any
amount of the type described in clause (A) as a result of any Purchased
Subsidiary being or having been before the Closing a member of a Seller Group
and (C) any costs or expenses arising out of or incident to the imposition,
assessment or assertion of any Income Tax described in clauses (A) and (B);

(iv) any Retained Employment Liabilities;

(v) any Excluded Liability; and

 

(vi) any Liability of any Purchased Subsidiary that would have been an
Excluded Liability if at the Effective Time it had been a Liability of Seller
or a Retained Subsidiary;

_provided_ that, (i) Sellers indemnification obligations for Retained
Environmental Liabilities pursuant to Section 10.02(a)(ii) and Section
10.02(a)(v) shall terminate and expire on the date that is eight (8) years
after the Closing Date, and any claim for such indemnification shall be
asserted in writing pursuant to Section 10.03 and on or before such date, and
if not so asserted, shall be barred and (ii) with respect to indemnification
by Seller for Warranty Breaches pursuant to Section 10.02(a)(i) (other than
(x) with respect to the Fundamental Representations and the

 



77  representations contained in Section 3.18 that survive the Closing or (y) in
the case of fraud or a willful breach), (A) Seller shall not be liable in
respect of any such Warranty Breach, or series of Warranty Breaches arising
out of similar facts or circumstances, unless the Damages with respect thereto
exceed $75,000 (the "De Minimis Amount"), (B) Seller shall not be liable in
respect of any such Warranty Breach until the aggregate amount of all Damages
above the De Minimis Amount exceed $1,200,000 (the "Deductible"), and then
only to the extent of such excess, and (C) Sellers maximum liability for all
such Warranty Breaches shall not exceed $14,400,000 (the "Cap"); _provided
further_ , that with respect to indemnification by Seller for Warranty
Breaches pursuant to Section 10.02(a)(i) (including with respect to
the Fundamental Representations and the representations set forth in Section
3.18 that survive the Closing), Sellers maximum aggregate liability shall not
exceed the Purchase Price.

 

(b) Effective at and after the Closing, Buyer shall indemnify Seller and its
Affiliates and each of their respective directors, officers, employees,
agents, successors and assigns (collectively, the "Seller Indemnified
Parties") against and shall hold each of them harmless from any and all
Damages incurred or suffered any Seller Indemnified Party to the extent
arising out of or relating to, without duplication:

(i) any Warranty Breach by Buyer as of the date of this Agreement or as
of the Closing Date (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier
date, in which case the accuracy of such representation or warranty shall be
tested as of such earlier date); _provided_ that for purposes of this clause
(i) of this Section 10.02(b), any such breach or inaccuracy of a
representation or warranty and the Damages resulting therefrom shall be
determined, except with respect to the applicable Specified Qualifiers,
without regard to the effect of any qualification contained therein relating
to materiality;

(ii) any breach of covenant or agreement made or to be performed by Buyer
pursuant to this Agreement;

(iii) any payment, cost or expense incurred by Seller or its Affiliates
in connection with Sellers or its Affiliates failure to obtain a release
from a guaranty set forth in Section 6.12 of the Disclosure Schedule, but only
to the extent relating to periods following the Effective Time and only to
the extent such payment, cost or expense directly relates to the failure to
obtain such release (including any payment required to be made by Seller or
any Affiliate under any such guaranty with respect to any such payment);

 

(iv) (A) any Tax with respect to the Purchased Assets or the Purchased
Subsidiaries that is not a Pre-Closing Tax and (B) any costs or expenses
arising out of or incident to the imposition, assessment or assertion of any
Tax described in clauses (A);

 

(v) except to the extent Seller has agreed to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified
Party pursuant to Section 10.02(a) (disregarding the limitations contained
herein) or any other Transaction Document, any Assumed Liability and any
Liability of a Purchased Subsidiary; and

 



78 (vi) except to the extent Seller has agreed to indemnify the Buyer
Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 10.02(a) (disregarding the limitations
contained herein) or any other Transaction Document, the ownership or
operation of the Business, the Shares or any Purchased Subsidiary after the
Closing (or in the case of the Delayed Assets, after the Delayed Transfer
Date);

_provided_ that, with respect to indemnification by Buyer for Warranty
Breaches pursuant to Section 10.02(b)(i) (other than (x) with respect to the
Fundamental Representations or (y) in the case of fraud or a willful breach),
(A) Buyer shall not be liable in respect of any such Warranty Breach unless
the Damages with respect to such Warranty Breach, or series of Warranty
Breaches arising out of similar facts or circumstances, exceed the De Minimis
Amount, (B) Buyer shall not be liable in respect of any such Warranty Breach
until the aggregate amount of all Damages above the De Minimis Amount exceed
the Deductible, and then only to the extent of such excess, and (C) Buyers
maximum liability for all such Warranty Breaches shall not exceed the Cap;
_provided further_ , that with respect to indemnification by Buyer for
Warranty Breaches pursuant to Section 10.02(b)(i) (including with respect to
the Fundamental Representations), Buyers maximum aggregate liability shall
not exceed the Purchase Price.

 

Section 10.03. _Procedures_. (a) Each Person seeking indemnification under
this Article 10 (the "Indemnified Party") shall give prompt notice to the
Person from whom indemnification is sought (the "Indemnifying Party") of the
assertion of any claim or the commencement of any Action by any third party
("Third Party Claim"); _provided_ , that the failure of the Indemnified Party
to give notice as provided in this Section 10.03(a) shall not relieve any
Indemnifying Party of its obligations under Section 10.02, except to the
extent that such failure adversely prejudices the rights of any such
Indemnifying Party. Such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail such
claim and the basis for indemnification (taking into account the information
then available to the Indemnified Party). Thereafter, the Indemnified Party
shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party, as promptly as reasonably practicable
following the Indemnified Partys receipt thereof, copies of all written
notices and documents (including any court papers) received by the
Indemnified Party from the third party relating to the Third Party Claim and
the Indemnified Party shall provide the Indemnifying Party with such other
information in its possession with respect to any such Third Party
Claim reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party; _provided_ that such
disclosure would not result in a violation of Applicable Law or any
confidentiality obligation, or loss of attorney-client privilege. The
Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its sole option and expense, to
be represented by counsel of its choice and, subject to the limitations set
forth in this Section 10.03, to assume control of, and defend against,
negotiate, settle (subject to clause (b)) or otherwise deal with such Third
Party Claim, but the Indemnified Party may nonetheless participate in the
defense of such Third Party Claim with its own counsel and at its own expense;
_provided_ that the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume the
defense of a Third Party Claim and shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses
of counsel retained by the Indemnified Party to the extent such Third Party
Claim is subject to indemnification hereunder if (A) such Third Party Claim
relates to or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding, action,
indictment, allegation or investigation, (B) the primary objective of such
Third Party Claim is to seek injunctive or other equitable relief against the
Indemnified Party or (C) the Losses to be borne by the Indemnified Party are
reasonably expected to exceed the Losses to be borne by the Indemnifying
Party, in each case after giving effect to the provisions of this Article 10
(including the limitation on 

 



79  indemnification obligations set forth herein). If the Indemnifying Party
elects not to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any
Third Party Claim pursuant to this Article 10 or is otherwise prohibited from
doing so, then the Indemnified Party may defend against, negotiate, settle
(subject to clause (b)) or otherwise deal with such Third Party Claim and its
expenses thereto shall be deemed to be "Damages". If the Indemnifying Party
shall be permitted to and, in accordance with this Agreement, shall assume the
defense of any Third Party Claim pursuant to this Article 10, then the
Indemnified Party may participate, at his or its own expense, in the
defense of such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , that such Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to participate in any such defense with separate counsel at
the expense of the Indemnifying Party if (i) requested by the Indemnifying
Party to participate or (ii) in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the
Indemnifying Party, a material conflict exists between the Indemnified Party
and the Indemnifying Party, or the Indemnified Party has different or
additional material defenses available to it, that would make such separate
representation advisable (in which case the Indemnifying Party shall not have
the right to direct the defense of such Action on behalf of the Indemnified
Party); _provided further_ that the Indemnifying Party shall not be required
to pay for more than one such counsel (together with local counsel in any
jurisdiction where local counsel may be advisable) for all Indemnified Parties
in connection with any Third Party Claim.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 10.03 to the contrary, neither
the Indemnifying Party nor the Indemnified Party shall, without the written
consent of the other party, settle or compromise any Third Party Claim or
permit a default or consent to entry of any judgment (which consent shall not
unreasonably be withheld or delayed). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
consent of the Indemnified Party shall not be required for any such
settlement if (i) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid
in full by the Indemnifying Party, (ii) such settlement does not permit any
Order or other equitable relief to be entered, directly or indirectly,
against the Indemnified Party and (iii) such settlement includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all Liability on claims
that are the subject matter of such Third Party Claim and does not include
any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or failure to act
by or on behalf of any Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party makes any
payment on any Third Party Claim, then the Indemnifying Party shall
be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to all rights and remedies of
the Indemnified Party to any insurance benefits or other claims of the
Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim.

 

(c) After any decision, judgment or award shall have been rendered by a
Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction, or a settlement shall have
been consummated (in accordance with this Article 10), or the Indemnified
Party and the Indemnifying Party shall have arrived at a mutually binding
agreement with respect to a Third Party Claim hereunder, the Indemnified Party
shall forward to the Indemnifying Party notice of any sums due and owing by
the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such matter.

 

(d) Each party shall reasonably cooperate, and cause their respective
Affiliates to cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any Third Party
Claim and shall furnish or cause to be furnished such records, information and
testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings,
trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that no party shall not be required to produce any
records or information that would result in a violation of Applicable Law or
any confidentiality obligation, or loss of attorney-client privilege.

 



80 (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither this Section 10.03 nor the
following Section 10.04 shall apply to indemnification for Tax Claims. The
procedures for such indemnification shall be governed by Section 10.05.

 

(f) Seller shall have the right (but not the obligation) to defend and control
any environmental investigation, remediation, removal action or corrective
action for which the Buyer Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification
pursuant to Section 10.02(a) ("Environmental Matters"); _provided_ , _however_
, that with respect to any such Environmental Matter which Seller is
defending or controlling, Seller shall (i) coordinate with Buyer on any
actions to be taken by Seller at any Real Property involved in any such
Environmental Matters, in order to minimize unreasonable disruption to
the Business; (ii) keep Buyer reasonably informed regarding the progress of
such Environmental Matter and diligently and promptly pursue the resolution
thereof; (iii) provide Buyer the reasonable opportunity to review and comment
upon any reports, documents or other filings submitted to, and attend any
meetings with, any Governmental Authorities with jurisdiction over such
Environmental Matter; and (iv) not unreasonably interfere with Buyers
continuing use of any Real Property related to such Environmental Matter, as
long as the manner of use does not materially differ from the manner in which
it is being used as of the Effective Time.

 

(g) Seller shall not be liable for, and no Buyer Indemnified Party shall be
indemnified for, any Damages related to any Environmental Matter to the
extent such Damages (i) arise out of any sampling, testing or other invasive
investigation of any environmental media, unless such sampling, testing or
other invasive investigation is (A) required by applicable Environmental Law
or by any Governmental Authority; (B) necessary to respond to any imminent
and material threat to human health or the environment; (C) required to be
conducted by a potential buyer or its bank lenders as part of due diligence
for any proposed sale of such Real Property by Buyer or any of its
Affiliates, or as required to be conducted by financing sources as part of due
diligence for any proposed financing transactions; or (D) necessary for, and
reasonably related to, the construction or renovation of the Real Property,
which construction or renovation is conducted for a legitimate business
purpose, or (ii) exceed those Damages that are incurred to satisfy, in a
reasonably cost-effective manner, the minimum requirements of a Governmental
Authority pursuant to applicable Environmental Law. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, solely with respect to any third party waste disposal site used or
allegedly used by the Business or any Purchased Subsidiary, the limitations
on Damages set forth in Section 10.03(g)(i) and Section 10.03(g)(ii) shall not
apply to Damages arising in connection with Third Party Claims brought
pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation
and Liability Act (42 U.S.C. § 9601 et seq.) or any analogous state law.

Section 10.04. _Direct Claim Procedures_. In the event an Indemnified Party
has a claim for indemnity under Section 10.02 against an Indemnifying Party
that does not involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party agrees to
give prompt notice in writing, and as promptly as practicable, of such claim
to the Indemnifying Party, which notice shall in no event be delivered to the
Indemnifying Party later than 60 days after the Indemnified Party first learns
of the facts on which such claim is based (such 60 day period, the "Notice
Period"). Such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail such claim and the
basis for indemnification and the amount of such Damages incurred or that such
Indemnified Party reasonably estimates in good faith is likely to be incurred
in connection with such claim (taking into account the information then

 



81  available to the Indemnified Party). The failure to notify the Indemnifying
Party as promptly as practicable within the Notice Period shall not relieve
the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent
that such failure shall have actually and adversely prejudiced the
Indemnifying Party.

 

Section 10.05. _Tax Claim Procedures_. (a) If any claim or demand for Taxes in
respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 10.02, (any such
claim or demand, a "Tax Claim") is asserted in writing against the party which
would be entitled to seek such indemnification (the "Potential Indemnified
Party") or any of its Affiliates, the Potential Indemnified Party shall
notify in writing the party from which such indemnification would be sought
(the "Potential Indemnifying Party") of such Tax Claim within ten (10) days of
receipt thereof, and shall give the Potential Indemnifying Party such
information with respect thereto as the Potential Indemnifying Party may
reasonably request; _provided_ that the failure of the Potential Indemnified
Party to give notice as provided in this Section 10.05(a) shall not relieve
any Potential Indemnifying Party of its obligations under Section 10.02,
except to the extent that such failure adversely prejudices the rights of any
such Potential Indemnifying Party. The Potential Indemnifying Party shall
have the right, at its own expense, to participate in and, upon notice to the
Potential Indemnified Party to assume the defense of any claim, suit, action,
litigation or proceeding (including any Tax audit) relating to a Tax Claim (a
"Tax Controversy"), and the Potential Indemnifying Party shall not have any
indemnification obligations with respect to any payment in respect of any
Taxes arising out of a Tax Controversy with a Taxing Authority as to which it
was not afforded such right; _provided_ that if such Tax Controversy relates
to a Tax Claim with respect to any Tax Return that relates to Combined Taxes,
the Seller shall have the sole right to control and participate in such
Tax Controversy. If the Potential Indemnifying Party assumes such defense,
the Potential Indemnifying Party shall have the sole discretion as to the
conduct of such defense and the Potential Indemnified Party shall have the
right (but not the duty) to participate in the defense thereof and to employ
counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the
Potential Indemnifying Party. The Potential Indemnified Party shall not settle
any Tax Controversy in respect of which indemnity may be sought, or make
payment on account of any Tax, hereunder without the consent of the Potential
Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. Whether or not the Potential Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or
prosecute any Tax Claim, all of the parties hereto shall cooperate and shall
cause their Affiliates to cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof and,
to the extent the Potential Indemnifying Party is defending the Tax
Controversy, the Potential Indemnified Party shall provide all reasonably
requested information relating to the Tax Controversy in its possession to the
Potential Indemnifying Party.

 

(b) A Potential Indemnifying Party shall not be liable in respect of any Tax
Claim under Section 10.02, as the case may be, for any Tax (i) the payment of
which was made without the Potential Indemnifying Partys prior written
consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless the
Potential Indemnified Party has complied with the provisions set forth in
Section 10.05(a) and a Final Determination of the amount of Tax has been made,
(ii) resulting from a settlement effected without the consent of the Potential
Indemnifying Party (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), or (iii) resulting from any Tax Controversy with respect to which
the Potential Indemnified Party has not materially complied with the
provisions set forth in Section 10.05(a) to the extent that such Tax results
from such material noncompliance.

 



82 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no indemnification shall
be provided under Section 10.02 or otherwise for any Tax Claim as to which
the Buyer or the Seller, as the case may be, provides notice to the other
party after the expiration of any applicable statute of limitations.

 

Section 10.06. _Calculation of Damages_. (a) The amount of any Damages payable
under Section 10.02 by the Indemnifying Party shall be net of any (i) amounts
recovered by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates under applicable third
party insurance policies or from any other third party (other than the
Indemnifying Party or its Affiliates) alleged to be responsible therefor net
of any expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in collecting such amount
and (ii) Tax benefit realized by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates
arising from the incurrence or payment of any such Damages. If
the Indemnified Party (i) receives any actual amounts under applicable third
party insurance policies, or from any other third party (other than the
Indemnifying Party or its Affiliates) alleged to be responsible for any
Damages, then such Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the
Indemnifying Party for any payment made by such Indemnifying Party in
connection with providing such indemnification payment up to the amount
received by the Indemnified Party, net of any expenses incurred by such
Indemnified Party in collecting such amount or (ii) realizes any net Tax
benefit subsequent to an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party
that was not previously taken into account in the indemnification payment,
then such Indemnified Party shall promptly pay to the Indemnifying Party the
amount of such net Tax benefit, net of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
such Indemnified Party in collecting such amount.

 

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under Section 10.02 for any (i)
Damages relating to any matter to the extent that where the Indemnified Party
had otherwise been compensated for such matter pursuant to the calculation of
Final Adjusted Amounts or the adjustment of the Purchase Price under Section
2.12, (ii) consequential, incidental, special, exemplary or punitive Damages,
except to the extent such Damages are awarded to a third party in respect of a
Third Party Claim or (iii) lost profits or diminution in value, except as set
forth in Section 10.06(b) of the Disclosure Schedules.

 

(c) Each Indemnified Party shall use their reasonable efforts to mitigate in
accordance with Applicable Law any loss for which such Indemnified Party
seeks indemnification under this Agreement. If such Indemnified Party
mitigates its loss after the Indemnifying Party has paid the Indemnified Party
under any indemnification provision of this Agreement in respect of that loss,
the Indemnified Party must notify the Indemnifying Party and promptly pay to
the Indemnifying Party the extent of the value of the benefit to the
Indemnified Party of that mitigation (less the Indemnified Partys reasonable
costs of mitigation). 

(d) Each Indemnified Party and its Affiliates shall use reasonable efforts to
collect any amounts available under insurance coverage, or from any other
Person alleged to be responsible, for any Damages payable under Section 10.02.

 



83 (e) Any indemnification payment made pursuant to this Agreement shall be
treated by Buyer and Seller as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax
purposes.

Section 10.07. _Assignment of Claims_. If the Indemnified Party receives any
payment from an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Damages and the
Indemnified Party could have recovered all or a part of such Damages from a
third party (a "Potential Contributor") based on the underlying
claim asserted against the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall,
to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, assign or cause its Affiliates to
assign such of its rights to proceed against the Potential Contributor as are
necessary to permit the Indemnifying Party to recover from the Potential
Contributor the amount of such payment.

Section 10.08. _Exclusivity_. From and after the Closing, except as
specifically set forth in this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents,
Buyer waives, and agrees to cause its Affiliates to waive, any rights and
claims Buyer may have against Seller and its Affiliates, whether at law or in
equity, relating to the Business, the Purchased Subsidiaries, the Purchased
Assets or the transactions contemplated hereby, including claims for
contribution or other rights of recovery arising out of or relating to any
Environmental Law (whether now or hereafter in effect). After the Closing,
Section 2.13 and Section 12.09 and Article 7, Article 8 and Article 10 shall
provide the exclusive remedy for any claim arising out of this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ that nothing herein shall be
construed to limit any right or remedy set forth in any other Transaction
Document or any claim as a result of actual fraud.

 

ARTICLE 11

on or before November 25, 2016 (the "End Date"); _provided_ , that the right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 11.01(a)(ii) shall not be
available to any party whose breach of any provision of this Agreement has
caused or resulted in the failure of the Closing to be consummated by such
time;

(iii) by either Seller or Buyer, if there shall be any Applicable Law or
Order that (i) makes consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby

shall have become final and nonappealable, _provided_ that the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 11.01(a)(iii) shall not be
available to any party whose breach of any provision of this Agreement has
caused or resulted in such Applicable Law being enacted or becoming
applicable

 



84  to the transactions contemplated hereby (including due to a failure to use
reasonable best efforts in connection with the actions specified in Section
6.01 to the extent required thereunder);

(iv) by Buyer if a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to
perform any covenant or agreement on the part of Seller set forth in this
Agreement shall have occurred that would cause the conditions set forth in
Sections 9.02(a) or 9.02(c) not to be satisfied, and which breach cannot be
cured or has not been cured (to the extent necessary to avoid a failure of
such a condition) within 30 days written notice thereof from Buyer to Seller;
_provided_ , that Buyer is not then in breach of this Agreement so as to cause
any of the conditions set forth in Section 9.01 or 9.03 not to be satisfied;
or

(v) by Seller if a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to
perform any covenant or agreement on the part of Buyer set forth in this
Agreement shall have occurred that would cause the conditions set forth in

cured or has not been cured (to the extent necessary to avoid a failure of
such a condition) within 30 days written notice thereof from Seller to Buyer;
_provided_ , that Seller is not then in breach of this Agreement so as to
cause any of the conditions set forth in Section 9.01 or Section 9.03 not to
be satisfied.

(b) Other than in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 11.01(a)(i),
the party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to any clause of this
Section 11.01 shall give written notice of such termination to the other
party.

 

Section 11.02. _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated as
permitted by Section 11.01, such termination shall be without Liability of
either party (or any stockholder or Representative of such party) to the other
party to this Agreement; _provided_ that the Confidentiality Agreement, the
provisions of this Section 11.02 and the provisions of Section 6.03, Section
6.13 and Article 12 shall survive any such termination; and _provided further_
that the termination of this Agreement shall not relieve any party hereto from
any liability for (i) actual fraud or (ii) any willful and material breach
of, or willful and material failure to perform any obligation under, any
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement.

remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith

closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions

of the Disclosure Schedule lists an item or information in such a way as to
make its relevance to the disclosure required by or provided in another
section of the Disclosure Schedule or the statements contained in any Section
of Article 3 reasonably apparent, the matter shall be deemed to have been
disclosed in or with respect to such other section, notwithstanding
the omission of an appropriate cross-reference to such other section or the
omission of a reference in the particular representation and warranty to such
section of the Disclosure Schedule, (iv) except as provided in clause (iii)
above, headings have been inserted in the Disclosure Schedule for convenience
of reference only, (v) the Disclosure Schedule is qualified in its entirety by
reference to specific provisions of this Agreement and (vi) the Disclosure

contemplated hereby; _provided_ that nothing herein shall limit any
obligations of employees of Seller that enter into employment relationships
