 _PURCHASE AND SALE OF THE COMPANY INTERESTS_

 



 

Section 2.1 _Purchase and Sale of the Company Interests_. Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions of this Agreement, Buyers agree to purchase from
Sellers, and Sellers agree to sell to Buyers, all of the Company Interests at
the Closing, for the consideration specified in _Section 2.2_.

 



 

Section 2.2 _Purchase Price_. At Closing, Buyers shall pay the Preliminary
Purchase Price in immediately available funds by wire transfer to an account
or accounts that have been designated by Sellers to Buyers in writing prior to
the Closing, which amount shall be adjusted in accordance with _Section 2.4_
and _Section 9.6_ (as so adjusted, the " _Purchase Price_ ").

 



 

Section 2.3 _Purchase Price Allocation_. The Parties agree to treat the
purchase of the Company Interests contemplated by this Agreement as a sale of
assets for U.S. federal income tax purposes. No later than ninety (90) days
after the Final Settlement Date, Buyers shall prepare and deliver to Sellers a
proposed allocation (the " _Proposed Allocation_ ") of the purchase price (as
determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes) among the separate classes of
assets of each of the Company Entities consistent with Section 1060 of the
Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (and any similar
provision of state, local or foreign Law, as appropriate). If Sellers disagree
with any items reflected in the Proposed Allocation, then Sellers

 



      
 

 



 

shall notify Buyers in writing of such disputed items within thirty (30) days
after receipt thereof, and, thereafter, Sellers and Buyers shall cooperate in
good faith for a period of thirty (30) days (or such longer period as mutually
agreed by the parties). To the extent that Sellers and Buyers are unable to
resolve any disputed items, the Parties shall jointly submit any remaining
disputed items for resolution to an independent "Big Four" accounting firm or
other nationally recognized accounting firm mutually agreed upon by the
Parties in writing, and shall instruct such accounting firm to render its
decision with respect to such remaining disputed items within thirty (30) days
after such firm is retained, which decision shall be final and binding on the
Parties. Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyers, on the other hand, shall each
bear fifty percent (50%) of the costs of employing such accounting firm. The
purchase price allocation as finally agreed or determined pursuant to this
_Section 2.3_ shall be the " _Final Allocation_." The Final Allocation shall
be binding on the Buyers, the Company Entities and the Sellers and their
Affiliates for all purposes, including for Tax and financial accounting
purposes. The Buyers, the Company Entities and the Sellers and their
Affiliates shall report, act, and file Tax Returns (including Internal Revenue
Service Form 8594) in all respects and for all purposes consistent with the
Final Allocation and shall not take any position contrary thereto; _provided_
, _however_ , that nothing contained herein shall be construed so as to
prevent any Party from settling, or require any Party to commence or
participate in any litigation or administrative process challenging any
determination made by any Governmental Authority based upon or arising out of
the Final Allocation.

 



 

Section 2.4 _Purchase Price Adjustments_.

 



 

(a) _Estimated Adjustment Certificate_. TG Finance shall deliver the Estimated
Adjustment Certificate to Buyers no later than two (2) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date.

 



 

(b) _Closing Adjustment Certificate_. Within thirty (30) days after the
Closing, TG Finance shall prepare and deliver to Buyers the Closing Adjustment
Certificate; _provided_ , that if Sellers do not deliver the Closing
Adjustment Certificate within such time period, then the Estimated Adjustment
Certificate shall be deemed to be the Closing Adjustment Certificate. Buyers
and Sellers shall provide to each other such data and information as the other
Party may reasonably request in connection with the preparation and review of
the Closing Adjustment Certificate.

 



 

(c) _Notice of Disagreement_. The Closing Adjustment Certificate shall become
final and binding upon the Parties on the earlier of the date that is (i)
fifteen (15) days after receipt thereof by Buyers and (ii) ten (10) days after
the expiration of the thirty (30)-day time period specified in _Section
2.4(b)_ in the event Sellers do not deliver a Closing Adjustment Certificate
within such time period (the " _Final Settlement Date_ ") unless Buyers give
written notice of its disagreement (" _Notice of Disagreement_ ") to Sellers
prior to such date. Any Notice of Disagreement shall specify in reasonable
detail the dollar amount, nature and basis of any such disagreement. If a
Notice of Disagreement is received by Sellers, then the Closing Adjustment
Certificate (as revised in accordance with paragraph (d) below, if applicable)
shall become final and binding on the Parties on, and the Final Settlement
Date shall be, the earlier of (i) the date upon which Sellers and Buyers agree
in writing with respect to all matters specified in the Closing Adjustment
Certificate and (ii) the date upon which the Final Adjustment Certificate is
issued by the Arbitrator.

 



       
 

 



 

(d) _Final Adjustment Certificate_. During the first twenty (20) days after
the date upon which Sellers receive a Notice of Disagreement, the Parties
shall attempt to resolve in writing any differences that they may have with
respect to all matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement. If at the end
of such twenty (20)-day period (or earlier by mutual agreement to arbitrate)
the Parties have not reached agreement, the matters that remain in dispute may
be submitted to an arbitrator with experience in accounting matters (the "
_Arbitrator_ ") by either Sellers or Buyers for review and resolution. The
Arbitrator shall be a nationally recognized independent public accounting firm
agreed upon by the Parties in writing. The hearing date shall be scheduled by
the Arbitrator as soon as reasonably practicable, and shall be conducted on a
confidential basis. Sellers and Buyers shall, not later than seven (7) days
prior to the hearing date set by the Arbitrator, submit a brief (to include
their respective calculations with regard to amounts in dispute on the Closing
Adjustment Certificate) for settlement of any amounts set forth in the Notice
of Disagreement that remain in dispute. The Parties shall instruct the
Arbitrator to render a decision (which decision shall include a written
statement of findings and conclusions) resolving the matters in dispute in
accordance with this _Section 2.4_, within three (3) Business Days after the
conclusion of the hearing, unless the Parties reach agreement prior thereto
and withdraw the dispute from arbitration. The Parties shall instruct the
Arbitrator to provide to the Parties explanations in writing of the reasons
for its decisions regarding the Adjusted Working Capital and shall issue the
Final Adjustment Certificate reflecting such decisions. The Arbitrator shall
(i) act as an arbitrator and not as an expert, (ii) address only those items
in dispute and, (iii) for each item, not assign a value greater than the
greatest value for such item claimed by either Sellers or Buyers or smaller
than the smallest value for such item claimed by either Sellers or Buyers. The
decision of the Arbitrator shall be final and binding on the Parties. Sellers,
on the one hand, and Buyers, on the other hand, shall each bear fifty percent
(50%) of the fees and expenses of the Arbitrator pursuant to this _Section
2.4(d)_. As used in this Agreement, the term " _Final Adjustment Certificate_
" shall mean (i) the Closing Adjustment Certificate delivered pursuant to
_Section 2.4(b)_, as subsequently adjusted, if applicable, pursuant to this
_Section 2.4(d)_ to reflect any subsequent written agreement between the
Parties with respect thereto and, if submitted to the Arbitrator, any
amendments or modifications to the Closing Adjustment Certificate decided by
the Arbitrator or (ii) if the Closing Adjustment Certificate is not delivered
within the time period specified in _Section 2.4(b)_, the Estimated
Adjustment Certificate.

 



 

(e) _Final Settlement and Adjustment to Purchase Price; Payment_.

 



 

(i) (x) If the Adjusted Working Capital _plus_ the Closing Intercompany
Transfer Amount set forth on the Final Adjustment Certificate is less than the
Estimated Adjusted Working Capital _plus_ the Estimated Intercompany Transfer
Amount, then the Purchase Price shall equal the Preliminary Purchase Price
decreased by an amount equal to such excess of the Estimated Adjusted Working
Capital _plus_ the Estimated Intercompany Transfer Amount over the Adjusted
Working Capital _plus_ the Closing Intercompany Transfer Amount set forth on
the Final Adjustment Certificate (a " _Shortfall Payment_ ") and (y) if the
Adjusted Working Capital _plus_ the Closing Intercompany Transfer Amount set
forth on the Final Adjustment Certificate is greater than the Estimated
Adjusted Working Capital _plus_ the Estimated Intercompany Transfer Amount,
then the Purchase Price shall equal the Preliminary Purchase Price increased
by an amount equal to such excess of the Adjusted Working Capital _plus_ the
Closing

 



      
 

 



 

Intercompany Transfer Amount set forth on the Final Adjustment Certificate
over the Estimated Adjusted Working Capital _plus_ the Estimated Intercompany
Transfer Amount (an " _Excess Payment_ ").

 



 

(ii) Any Shortfall Payment or Excess Payment shall be paid by Sellers to
Buyers or Buyers to Sellers, respectively, not later than three (3) Business
Days after the Final Settlement Date by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account or accounts specified by Buyers or Sellers, as applicable.
The amount of any payment to be made after the Closing Date pursuant to this
_Section 2.4(e)(ii)_ shall bear interest from and including the Closing Date
to but excluding the date of payment at a rate per annum (calculated daily on
the basis of a year of 365 days and the actual number of days elapsed) equal
to the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition,
(the " _Prime Rate_ ") in effect on the Closing Date. Such interest shall be
payable at the same time as the payment to which it relates.

 



 

Section 2.5 _Closing_. Subject to the satisfaction or, when permissible,
waiver of the conditions set forth in _ARTICLE VII_, the closing of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") shall take
place at the offices of Latham and Watkins LLP, 885 Third Avenue, New York, New
York 10022, commencing at 10:00 a.m. local time (a) on the day that is two (2)
Business Days after the date on which the last of the conditions set forth in
_ARTICLE VII_ (other than any such conditions which by their terms are not
capable of being satisfied until the Closing Date) is satisfied or, when
permissible, waived, or (b) on such other date and/or at such other time
and/or place as the Parties may mutually agree upon in writing, _provided_ ,
that in no event shall Buyers be obligated to consummate the Closing prior to
the expiration of a sixty (60)-day period commencing on the date of completion
of delivery by Sellers or their Affiliates of the Required Financial
Statements, subject to any applicable extension of such sixty (60)-day period,
in each case, pursuant to and in accordance with _Section 6.21(d)_;
_provided_ , _further_ , that in no event shall the Closing take place prior
to the Closing Effective Date. The Closing shall be effective for all purposes
at 11:59 p.m. local time on the Closing Date.

ARTICLE III.

properties where such properties are now owned, leased or operated.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Each Company Entity is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in
good standing in each jurisdiction in which the property owned, leased or
operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such
qualification or licensure necessary, except in such jurisdictions where the
failure to be so duly qualified or licensed or in good standing would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company Entities.

 



 

Section 3.2 _Noncontravention_. Except as set forth on _Section 3.2_ of the
Sellers Disclosure Schedule, neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Sellers, nor the consummation by Sellers of the transactions
contemplated hereby (a) conflicts with any provision of the respective
Governing Documents of the Company Entities, (b) violates or results in a
breach of any Material Contract, or (c) assuming receipt of the Consents of
Governmental Authorities described in _Section 3.5_, violates any Law to
which any Company Entity is subject, except, in the case of each of clauses
(b) and (c), for such violations or breaches as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company Entities.

 



 

Section 3.3 _Capitalization_. _Section 3.3_ of the Sellers Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a list of the Company Entities, and with respect to each
Company Entity, (a) its name and jurisdiction of organization, (b) its form of
organization and (c) the Interests of such Company Entity owned, directly or
indirectly, by each applicable Seller. Except for this Agreement, no Seller is
a party to any Rights or contracts, agreements or commitments that would
require such Seller to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of such Interests.
No Seller is a party to any voting trust, proxy or other agreement or
understanding with respect to the voting of such Interests.

 



 

Section 3.4 _Title to the Company Interests_. Each Seller owns, directly or
indirectly, beneficially and of record, the Interests of the Company Entities
reflected to be owned, directly or indirectly, by such Seller on _Section
3.3_ of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule, free and clear of all Liens, except
(a) as may be created by this Agreement, (b) as may be set forth in the
Governing Documents of the applicable Company Entity, (c) for any restrictions
on sales of securities under applicable securities Laws and (d) as set forth
on _Section 3.4_ of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule. The Interests set forth
on _Section 3.3_ of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule constitute 100% of the
issued and outstanding membership interests of the Company Entity to which
such Interests relate (except as otherwise indicated on _Section 3.3_ of the
Sellers Disclosure Schedule) and have been duly authorized and validly issued.

 



 

Section 3.5 _Government Authorizations_. No Consent of, with or to any
Governmental Authority is required to be obtained or made by any Seller or any
Company Entity in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement
or the other Transaction Documents or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, other than (a) required filings under the HSR
Act, (b) requirements of any applicable provisions of the Securities Act or
any other applicable securities Laws, (c) Consents required pursuant to the
FPA as described in _Section 7.1(c)_, (d) Consents set forth on _Section

not required to be made or given until after the Closing, or (g) requirements
applicable as a result of the specific legal or regulatory status of Buyers or
any of its Affiliates or as a result of any other facts that specifically
relate to the business or activities in which Buyers or any of their
Affiliates are or propose to be engaged, other than the Business.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 3.6 _Financial Statements_. _Section 3.6_ of the Sellers Disclosure
Schedule sets forth the unaudited combined balance sheet for the Business as
of March 31, 2014 (" _Balance Sheet Date_ "), and the related combined
statements of operations and cash flows for the three (3)-month period then-
ended (the " _Business Financial Statements_ "). The Business Financial
Statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows of the Business, as of the date set forth
therein and for the period covered thereby, and were prepared in accordance
with GAAP (subject to the absence of footnotes and any year-end adjustments),
applied consistently with past practices, except as otherwise noted therein.
The Business Financial Statements have been derived from the books and records
of Sellers and their Affiliates using the historical results of operations and
the historical basis of assets and liabilities of the Business and may not
necessarily be indicative of the conditions that would have existed or the
results of operations if the Business were operated as an unaffiliated, stand-
alone entity. The Business Financial Statements include allocations of certain
expenses for services and other costs of Sellers and their Affiliates
attributable to the Business that are in accordance with existing Affiliate
contracts, are considered to be reasonable and applied consistent with past
practice.

 



 

Section 3.7 _Undisclosed Liabilities_. The Company Entities have no
Liabilities that would be required under GAAP to be reflected or reserved
against in a balance sheet of the Company Entities and that are material to
the financial position of the Company Entities, except for (a) Liabilities set
forth, reflected in, reserved against or disclosed in the Business Financial
Statements, (b) Liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice since the Balance Sheet Date, (c) Retained
Liabilities, (d) Liabilities that are the subject matter of any other
representation or warranty in this _ARTICLE III_, including Liabilities
disclosed in the Sellers Disclosure Schedule, (e) Liabilities under Contracts
of the Company Entities (other than as a result of a breach thereof by such
Company Entity), (f) Liabilities incurred in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and (g) such other Liabilities as would not, individually
or in the aggregate, be material to the Business, taken as a whole.

 



 

Section 3.8 _Absence of Certain Changes_.

 



 

(a) Since the Balance Sheet Date, and until the date hereof, each Company
Entity has conducted its respective business in the ordinary course, and there
has not been, (i) to Sellers Knowledge, any damage, destruction or loss,
whether or not covered by insurance, that would reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, result in a payment by the Company Entities
of an amount in excess of thirteen million fifty thousand dollars
($13,050,000), (ii) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any non-cash
or in-kind dividend or other distribution of Interests or property other than
cash or cash equivalents with respect to the Company Interests or (iii) any
change in accounting methods, principles or practices affecting the Company
Entities, except as required or permitted by GAAP.

 



 

(b) Since the Balance Sheet Date, except as contemplated by this Agreement
there has not been any event or development that would reasonably be expected
to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company Entities.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 3.9 _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) Except as set forth on _Section 3.9_ of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule:

 



 

(i) Each Company Entity has (A) filed, or caused to be filed, all income Tax
Returns and other material Tax Returns that it was required to file on or
prior to the date hereof and (B) paid or caused to be paid all Taxes shown to
be due and payable on such Tax Returns. All such Tax Returns were correct and
complete in all material respects, except as otherwise set forth, reflected
in, reserved against or disclosed in the Business Financial Statements. There
are no Liens for Taxes on any of the assets of any Company Entity other than
Permitted Liens.

 



 

(ii) There are no outstanding agreements or waivers extending the statutory
period of limitations applicable to the assessment of any Tax against the
Company Entities (other than automatic extensions arising from an extension of
the due date for filing a Tax Return). As of the date hereof, there are no
audits, written claims for assessments or collection of Taxes, or examinations
pending or, to Sellers Knowledge threatened, with respect to any material
Taxes of the Company Entities. None of the Company Entities is a party to any
Tax allocation, Tax sharing or similar agreement (other than any such
agreement or obligation that is not primarily related to Taxes) and none of
the Company Entities is liable for Taxes of another Person (other than another
Company Entity) as a transferee or a successor.

 



 

(iii) Each Company Entity has been treated as a disregarded entity or
partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes at all times since its
formation, and no election has ever been filed to treat any Company Entity as
an association taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income Tax purposes.

 



 

(b) No representation is being made about the income tax characteristics of
any Project (including eligibility for tax credits, Cash Grants or
depreciation allowances for which the Project qualifies). The representations
and warranties set forth in this _Section 3.9_ (i) are made only with respect
to Tax periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date and (ii) shall not be
construed as a representation or warranty, and shall not be relied upon for
any claim of indemnification with respect to, any Taxes attributable to any
Tax period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date, or any Tax
positions taken by the Buyers or their Affiliates (including the Company
Entities) in any Tax period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing
Date.

 



 

Section 3.10 _Property_. All real property owned or leased by each Company
Entity (the " _Real Property_ ") or to which such Company Entity has rights
under leases, easements, rights of way, licenses, common use agreements or
similar agreements is described in _Section 3.10_ of the Sellers Disclosure
Schedule. The agreements listed on _Section 3.10_ of the Sellers Disclosure
Schedule are all the leases, easements, rights of way, licenses, common use
agreements or similar agreements under which the Company Entities have rights
to the Real Property (the " _Project Site Agreements_ "). Each Project Site
Agreement is in full force and effect and is the legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Company Entity which is a party to such Project Site

transactions contemplated hereby.

except where the

a whole. To Sellers Knowledge, each such Permit is in full force and effect
and the applicable Company Entity is in compliance in all material respects
with all its obligations with respect thereto. There are no proceedings
pending or, to Sellers Knowledge, threatened which would reasonably be
expected to result in the revocation or termination of any material Permit of

commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate, and not impede or prevent,
access to the financing counterparties for any Indebtedness of the Company

documents and employees shall not interfere with the normal operations of
Buyers, their Affiliates or the Company Entities and the reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses of the Buyers, their Affiliates and the Company Entities
incurred in connection therewith shall be paid by Sellers; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyers and
their Affiliates shall be obligated to provide Sellers and their Affiliates
with all books, records and other documents relating to the Retained Assets

and Cash Grant Reports (or, to the extent any such books, records or other

Assets or Retained Liabilities, copies thereof). Buyers shall cause each
Company Entity to maintain and preserve all such Tax Returns, books, records

to Sellers at the end of any such period. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, Buyers shall not be required to provide any access or
information (other than relating to any Retained Assets or Retained
Liabilities) to Sellers, their Affiliates or any of their respective
representatives which Buyers reasonably believes they or the Company Entities
are prohibited from providing to Sellers, their Affiliates or their respective
representatives by reason of applicable Law, which constitutes or allows
access to information protected by attorney-client privilege, or which Buyers
or the Company Entities are required to keep confidential or prevent access to
by reason of any Contract with a third party or which would otherwise expose
any Buyers or any of their Affiliates (including the Company Entities) to a
material risk of Liability.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) From and after the Closing, Sellers shall make or cause to be made
available to Buyers all books, records and documents of such Sellers relating
to the Business (and the assistance of employees responsible for such books,
records and documents) during regular business hours for the same purposes, to
the extent applicable, as set forth in _Section 6.6(a)_; _provided, however_
, that access to such books, records, documents and employees shall not
interfere with the normal operations of Sellers and the reasonable out-of-

representatives shall have any right to access or review any Tax Return of
Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates (including any consolidated, combined

avoidance of doubt, that the foregoing limitation shall not limit Buyers
right to receive information from the Sellers, including Tax Returns filed by

(other than the Sellers)) to the extent that such information or Tax Return is
necessary for Buyers to contest a Tax claim relating to the Company Entities
for which Buyers are liable. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
Sellers shall not be required to provide any access or information to Buyers,
their Affiliates or any of their respective representatives which any Sellers
reasonably believe they are prohibited from providing to Buyers, their
Affiliates or their respective representatives by reason of applicable Law,
which constitutes or allows access to information protected by attorney-client
privilege, or which Sellers are required to keep confidential or prevent
access to by reason of any Contract with a third party or which would
otherwise expose any Seller or any of its Affiliates to a material risk of
Liability.

tax purposes (the " _Specified Company Entities_ ") as ending as of the end of
the Closing Date for U.S. federal income and applicable state and local income
tax purposes. In any case in which a closing of the current Tax period is not
required or permitted, all items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit
of any Specified Company Entity shall be allocated between the portion of the
Tax period ending on the Closing Date and the portion of the Tax period
beginning after the Closing Date based on an interim closing of the books as
of the end of the Closing Date. All Tax Returns of the Specified Company
Entities for which the Tax period ends on or prior to the Closing Date shall
be prepared (on a basis consistent with the elections, accounting methods,
conventions and principles of taxation used in past practice) and filed by

Tax period that ends on or prior to the Closing Date, which are prepared by
the Sellers pursuant to the preceding sentence, all Tax Returns of the Company
Entities for which the Tax period includes but does not end on the Closing

prepared (on a basis consistent with the elections, accounting methods,
conventions and principles of taxation used in past practice) and filed by
Buyers. Buyers shall permit Sellers a reasonable time to review and comment on
each such Tax Return described in the preceding sentence prior to filing and
Buyers shall make any changes to such Tax Returns reasonably requested by
Sellers to the extent that such changes relate to Taxes for which Sellers (or
the beneficial owners of Sellers) are liable. Sellers agree to reimburse Buyer
for the reasonable third-party out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Buyer in
connection with making any such changes. From and after the Closing Date,
Buyers shall not amend any Tax Returns of the Company Entities for any tax
period ending on or prior to the Closing Date or which includes the Closing
Date without Sellers consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Buyers shall, at Sellers reasonable request, cause
any Company Entity to file for and use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain any Tax refund of a Company Entity that is a Retained Asset.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Buyers shall promptly notify Sellers in writing upon receipt of notice of
any pending or threatened audits of any Tax Return of the Company Entities for
any Tax period that ends on or prior to, or includes the Closing Date. Such

detail the nature of such claim. Sellers shall have the sole and exclusive
right to control the conduct of any audit or other administrative or judicial
proceeding relating to Tax Returns of any Company Entities for any Tax period
that ends on or prior to the Closing Date. Sellers and Buyers shall jointly

proceeding relating to any Tax Return of any Company Entity for any Tax period
that includes but does not end on the Closing Date, and neither Party shall
settle or compromise any such matter without the other Partys consent. In the

their respective Affiliates, including, with respect to Buyers, causing the
Company Entities to take) such other action, as may be reasonably necessary to
carry out the purposes and intents of this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents.

 



 

Section 6.10 _Assumption of Obligations_. Subject to _Section 6.14_, from and
after the Closing, Buyers shall, or shall cause each of the Company Entities
to, fully perform and fulfill all of its obligations and commitments, whether
existing as of the Closing Date or arising or incurred thereafter.

 



 

Section 6.11 _Support Obligations_. In each case, at Buyers sole risk, cost
and expense: (a) Buyers shall take all steps reasonably necessary, including
offering substitute guarantees of Buyers Affiliates, and Sellers shall
cooperate (it being understood that such cooperation shall not include any
requirement to pay any consideration or offer or grant any financial
accommodation) in all reasonable respects with Buyers, to endeavor to ensure
that, effective as of the Closing Date, (i) Sellers and their Affiliates
(other than any Company Entity) shall be released from one hundred percent
(100%) of any and all obligations or Liabilities relating to or arising under
or out of or in connection with each Support Obligation, and (ii) substitute
arrangements, if required by a beneficiary of any Support Obligation, of
Buyers or their Affiliates (other than Sellers and any Company Entity) shall
be in effect, including by providing (or causing to be provided) letters of
credit or similar support, and (b), without limiting the foregoing, in the
event that the requirements set forth in clause (a) of this _Section 6.11_
are not met as of the Closing Date, and subject to acceptance by Sellers in
their reasonable discretion, Buyers or their Affiliates shall, in lieu of
providing substitute arrangements in respect of Support Obligations pursuant
to clause (a)(ii) of this _Section 6.11_, enter into such indemnification and
reimbursement agreements with Sellers or any of their Affiliates as reasonably
necessary to provide Sellers and such Affiliates with an effective release or
full indemnification with respect to all obligations and Liabilities of
Sellers and such Affiliates to be released pursuant to in clause (a) of this
_Section 6.11_.

entitled to claim benefits or seek coverage under, any of Sellers or their
Affiliates insurance policies or any of their self-insured programs in respect
of any claims arising from an event or occurrence after the Closing Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in respect of any claims commenced after the
Closing Date arising from for an event or occurrence prior to the Closing
Date, the Company Entities, subject to the terms and conditions of the
applicable policies, may make claims on any of Sellers or their Affiliates
occurrence-based insurance policies covering the Company Entities at the time
of such event or occurrence, and Sellers and their Affiliates shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to assist Buyer and the Company Entities in
asserting any such claims; _provided_ , _further_ , that Buyer shall be solely
liable for, and Sellers shall have no obligation to repay or reimburse Buyer
or the Company Entities for, all deductibles and retentions and all uninsured,
uncovered, unavailable or uncollectable amounts relating to or associated with
such claims, whether made by the Company Entities, their respective employees
or third parties. Buyer shall be solely responsible for obtaining or providing
insurance coverage for the Company Entities for any event or occurrence after
the Closing, including insurance sufficient to comply with any and all of the
contractual and statutory obligations of the Company Entities after the
Closing.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, Buyers may procure date down endorsements of
the title insurance policies covering the Real Property and Sellers shall
reasonably cooperate with Buyers in their efforts to procure such
endorsements; provided, that Buyers shall be responsible for all costs and
expenses relating thereto, including all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred by Sellers in connection therewith.

directly or indirectly, any individual who provides services to the Company
Entities pursuant to the TGOC Contracts or any director, manager, officer or
employee of Seller Parent or any of its Controlled Affiliates, to terminate
his or her employment or other relationship with any such Person, or (b) hire
any such individual, director, manager, officer or employee; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the foregoing provision shall not prevent Buyers or their
Affiliates from employing any such individual who contacts Buyers or such
Affiliates in response to a general solicitation of employment made by Buyers
or such Affiliates in a trade journal, newspaper or other publication
(including any internet job posting site) not specifically targeted at any
such individual.

Section 6.17 _Post-Closing Commercially Reasonable Efforts_. From and after
the Closing, no Party shall, and each Party shall cause its Affiliates not to,
take any actions that would restrict or prevent its or their ability to
perform its or their post-Closing covenants and agreements hereunder,
including any action that would make its or their "commercially reasonable
efforts" materially less likely to produce the intended result for the other
Parties. Further, as part of each Partys "commercially reasonable efforts,"
such Party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, enforce its and their
rights under any agreements that would reasonably be expected to yield the
intended results.

 



 

Section 6.18 _Risk of Loss_. Except as otherwise provided in this _Section
6.18_, during the period commencing on the date hereof and ending on the
Closing Date, all risk of loss or damage to the property or assets of the
Company Entities shall, as between Buyers and Sellers, be borne by Sellers
unless such loss is caused or created by Buyers. If during the period
commencing on the date hereof and ending on the Closing Date, the property or
assets of the Company Entities are damaged by fire or other casualty (each
such event, an " _Event of Loss_ "), or are taken by a Governmental Authority
by exercise of the power of eminent domain (each, a " _Taking_ "), then the
following provisions of this _Section 6.18_ shall apply:

 



 

(a) Following the occurrence of (i) any one or more Events of Loss, if the
aggregate costs to restore, repair or replace the property or assets of the
Company Entities subject to such Event of Loss to a condition reasonably
comparable to its or their condition prior to such Event of Loss, plus the
amount of any lost profits reasonably expected to accrue after Closing as a
direct result of such Event of Loss, such amount pursuant to this clause (i)
to be determined by an independent third party appraiser mutually selected by
the Parties (collectively, " _Restoration Costs_ ") and/or (ii) any one or
more Takings, if the value of the property subject to such Taking plus the
amount of any lost profits reasonably expected to accrue after Closing as a
direct result of such Taking, less any condemnation award received by Buyers
(provided, that any such condemnation award is made available to Buyer), such
amount pursuant to this clause (ii) to be determined by an independent third
party appraiser mutually selected by the Parties (collectively, the "
_Condemnation Value_ "), is, in the aggregate, less than or equal to twenty-
six million one hundred thousand dollars ($26,100,000), in the case of each of
clauses (i) and (ii), net of and after giving effect to (A) any insurance,
condemnation award or other third party proceeds reasonably expected to be
available to the applicable Company Entities of Sellers for such event, (B)
any tax benefits related thereto, (C) any amounts expended by the applicable
Project Company or Sellers prior to Closing to restore damage caused by such
casualty event and (D) adjustments relating to such casualty event or
condemnation that are to be included in Adjusted Working Capital, there shall
be no effect on the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(b) Subject to the termination right of Buyers and Sellers set forth in clause
(d) below, upon the occurrence of any one or more Events of Loss and/or
Takings involving

 



      
 

 



 

aggregate Restoration Costs and Condemnation Value in excess of twenty-six
million one hundred thousand dollars ($26,100,000) (a " _Major Loss_ "),
Sellers shall have, in the case of a Major Loss relating solely to one or more
Events of Loss, the option, exercised by notice to Buyers, to restore, repair
or replace the damaged assets or properties prior to Closing to a condition
reasonably comparable to their condition prior to such Event of Loss or
Taking, as the case may be. If Sellers elect to so restore, repair or replace
the assets or properties relating to a Major Loss, which election shall be
made by notice to Buyers prior to the Closing Date and as soon as practicable
following the occurrence of the Major Loss, Sellers will complete or cause to
be completed the repair, replacement or restoration of the damaged assets or
property prior to the Closing and the Closing Date shall be postponed for the
amount of time reasonably necessary to complete the restoration, repair or
replacement of such property or assets as reasonably agreed among Buyers and
Sellers (including, if necessary, the extension of the date contemplated by
_Section 10.1(b)_ to allow for the restoration, repair or replacement of such
assets or properties). If Sellers elect not to cause the restoration, repair
or replacement of the property or assets affected by a Major Loss, or such
Major Loss is the result in whole or in part of one or more Takings or is
otherwise not capable of being restored, repaired or replaced, the provisions
of _Section 6.18(c)_ will apply.

 



 

(c) Subject to the termination right of Buyers and Sellers set forth in clause
(d) below, in the event that Sellers elect not to cause the restoration,
repair or replacement of a Major Loss, or in the event that Sellers, having
elected to cause repair, replacement or restoration of the Major Loss, fail to
cause its completion within the period of time agreed upon by the Parties
pursuant to _Section 6.18(b)_ (subject to extension for up to ninety (90)
days for causes beyond Sellers control), or in the event that a Major Loss is
the result in whole or in part of one or more Takings or is otherwise not
capable of being restored, repaired or replaced, then the Parties shall,
within thirty (30) days following Sellers election not to cause the
restoration, repair or replacement, failure to complete, or the occurrence of
such Major Loss, as the case may be, adjust the Base Purchase Price downward
by the aggregate Restoration Cost and Condemnation Value, and proceed to
Closing. To assist Buyers in their evaluation of any and all Events of Loss,
Sellers shall provide Buyers such access to the properties and assets and such
information as Buyers may reasonably request in connection therewith.

 



 

(d) In the event that the aggregate Restoration Costs and Condemnation Value
with respect to one or more Events of Loss and/or Takings equals an amount in
excess of eighty-seven million dollars ($87,000,000), then either Buyers or
Sellers shall have the right to terminate this Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.19 _Additional Post-Closing Covenants_. Following the Closing, and
subject to reimbursement by Sellers for any and all reasonable costs and
expenses incurred by Buyers in connection therewith, Buyers shall, and shall
cause the applicable Project Companies to, carry out and comply with the
following additional covenants, all of which shall survive the Closing
indefinitely:

 



 

(a) The applicable Project Companies shall execute the conservation easements
and subordinations in the forms attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ and _Exhibit

(b) The Project Companies and Buyers shall cooperate in good faith with Alta
Windpower Development, LLC to make such filings and take such actions from
time to time as may be required to protect and preserve Alta Windpower

and Alta Windpower Development, LLC or any other Affiliate of Seller is a
party as of the Closing Date.

 



 

(d) The Project Companies shall reasonably cooperate to modify other Contracts
to which they are parties, from time to time, to facilitate Alta Windpower

include taking additional actions as are reasonably required to facilitate In-
Development and Secondary Projects, which may include obtaining the necessary
authority and waivers from FERC to the extent required to support the
provision of transmission service by a co-tenant to a Secondary Project
without having material adverse effect on the regulatory status of the
Projects or the Project Companies.

 



 

(e) The Project Companies shall cooperate with Alta Windpower Development, LLC
and Sellers other Affiliates in their efforts to dedicate and use
"alternative energy corridors" provided for in the mitigation measures to the
Kern County environmental

 



      
 

 



 

impact report for the Projects. The Project Companies shall not grant use
rights (by lease, easement, license, or otherwise) or consent to the use of
any portions of the Project Sites by third parties for electrical transmission
purposes without the consent of Sellers or Alta Windpower Development, LLC.

 



 

Section 6.20 _Release of Certain Liens_. To the extent that such Liens have
not been terminated and released prior to Closing, Buyers shall, and shall
cause the applicable Project Companies to, use commercially reasonable
efforts, which efforts shall not require the payment of any fees or expenses
to third parties (unless reimbursed by Sellers), to take all actions and
execute all documents requested by Sellers to ensure that all Liens on the
assets and properties of Alta Oak Realty Holdings, LLC, and all obligations of
Alta Oak Realty Holdings, LLC and Alta Oak Realty, LLC, under the AWAM Secured
Indebtedness are terminated and released.

(a) If Buyers intend to prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement
relating to an offering of Buyer Common Stock (including the prospectus used
in connection therewith and any amendments or supplements to such registration
statement and such prospectus, the " _Registration Statement_ "), then Buyers
shall deliver written notice of such intent to Sellers as promptly as
reasonably practicable, and in no event later than five (5) days, following
the date of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Buyers shall prepare and file the Registration Statement as soon as
reasonable practicable after the delivery of such notice and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the SEC to declare the Registration

practicable after such filing.

 



 

(c) Sellers and their Affiliates shall in good faith cooperate with Buyers and
their Affiliates to assist Buyers in preparing and filing the Registration
Statement and in timely responding to any inquiries or comments from the SEC
relating to information provided by Sellers or their Affiliates; _provided_ ,
that Buyers shall reimburse Sellers and their Affiliates for all reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by them in connection with the
performance of their obligations under this _Section 6.21_. Such cooperation
shall include delivery by Sellers to Buyers, as soon as reasonable
practicable, of:

 



 

(i) the 2011, 2012 and 2013 audited financial statements for each of: (a)
AWAM; (b) Alta Realty; (c) Alta Wind I; (d) Alta Wind Holdings; (e) Alta Wind
X; and (f) Alta Wind XI, in the case of each of the foregoing entities, on a
consolidated basis with its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(ii) the 2011, 2012 and 2013 combined audited financials representing the

on a consolidated basis with its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(d) The requirement of Sellers and their Affiliates to deliver the financial
statements set forth in clauses (i), (ii) and (iv) of Section 6.21(c) (the "
_Required Financial Statements_ ") will be deemed to have been satisfied as of
the date of delivery of the last of such Required Financial Statements
accompanied by a written notice from Sellers and/or their Affiliates that
delivery of the Required Financial Statements is complete, unless Buyers in
good faith reasonably believe that Sellers and/or their Affiliates have not
completed the delivery of the Required Financial Statements and, within five
(5) Business Days after receipt of notice from Sellers and/or their
Affiliates, delivers a written notice to the applicable Sellers and/or its
Affiliates specifying in reasonable detail the grounds for Buyers assertion
that delivery of such Required Financial Statements is not complete;
_provided_ , that it is understood that the delivery of such written notice
from Buyers will not prejudice the Sellers right to assert that the Required
Financial Statements have in fact been delivered in accordance with this
_Section 6.21_; and _provided, further_ , that in the event that it is
determined that notwithstanding the delivery of such written notice the
Required Financial Statements have in fact been delivered, the sixty (60) day-
period described in _Section 2.5_ shall not be deemed extended thereby. In no
event shall completion of delivery of the Required Financial Statements for
any purpose hereof (including for purposes of _Section 2.5_ and this _Section
6.21_) require delivery of any opinion of KPMG LLP or the consent of KPMG LLP
otherwise required to be delivered pursuant to Section 6.21(c)(iii) with
respect to any such Required Financial Statements, which opinion and consent
may be delivered after delivery of the Required Financial Statements so long
as they are delivered on or prior to the date of filing of the Registration
Statement. If, at any time following delivery of the Required Financial
Statements and prior to the filing of the Registration Statement, Sellers
discover (or are made aware by KPMG LLP of) any error in or omission from the
Required Financial Statements, then Sellers shall promptly provide written
notice thereof to Buyers setting forth such information and/or documentation
as may be necessary to correct such error or omission. If such error or
omission described in the notice provided pursuant to the preceding sentence
is reasonably expected then to delay Buyers ability to file the Registration
Statement, then Buyers may extend, by giving written notice thereof to
Sellers, the sixty (60) day-period described in _Section 2.5_ to the extent
reasonably necessary to permit Buyers to make changes to the Registration
Statement, in each case, to the extent required as a result of the error or
omission in the Required Financial Statements with respect to which Sellers
have notified Buyers, but in no event shall such extension exceed ten (10)
Business Days.

 



 

(e) None of the information provided by Sellers or their Affiliates to Buyers
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Registration Statement
will, at the time provided, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the condition set forth in
_Section 7.3(b)_, as it applies to the obligations of Sellers under this
_Section 6.21_, shall be deemed satisfied unless Sellers willful breach of
their respective obligations under this _Section 6.21_ is the direct and
proximate cause of the Buyers failure to consummate the Closing.

such termination date, until the related claim for indemnification has been
satisfied or otherwise resolved as provided in _Section 9.3_.

 



 

Section 9.2 _Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the other provisions of this _ARTICLE IX_, from and after the
Closing, Sellers shall indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties in respect of,
and hold each of them harmless from and against, any and all Damages suffered,
incurred or sustained by any of them resulting from, arising out of or
relating to (i) any breach of any representations and warranties made by
Sellers, (ii) any nonfulfillment of or failure to perform any Surviving
Covenant on the part of Sellers contained in this Agreement or (iii) any
Retained Liability.

 



 

(b) Subject to the other provisions of this _ARTICLE IX_, from and after the
Closing, Buyers shall indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties in respect of,
and hold each of them harmless from and against, any and all Damages suffered,
incurred or sustained by any of them resulting from, arising out of or
relating to (i) any breach of any representations and warranties made by
Buyers, (ii) any nonfulfillment of or failure to perform any Surviving
Covenant on the part of Buyers contained in this Agreement or (iii) any
Liability with respect to any Company Entity, whether arising prior to, on, or
after the Closing Date, other than any Retained Liability.

 



 

(c) Sellers shall not be Liable for, and no amounts of indemnity shall be
payable in the case of, any claim by a Buyer Indemnified Party for breaches by
Sellers of representations and warranties, other than the Fundamental
Representations, unless and until the Buyer Indemnified Parties have suffered,
incurred or sustained otherwise indemnifiable Damages hereunder (after giving
effect to any Indemnity Reduction Amounts) in excess of an amount equal to one
percent (1%) of the Base Purchase Price in the aggregate (the " _Deductible_
"), in which event the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to claim
indemnity for Damages only to the extent such Damages exceed the Deductible.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Sellers shall not be Liable
with respect to any individual claim hereunder (other than any claim made
pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(iii)_) that results in otherwise indemnifiable
Damages (after giving effect to any Indemnity Reduction Amounts), and such
Damages shall not be counted toward satisfaction of the Deductible, unless
such Damages exceed an amount equal to five hundred thousand dollars
($500,000).

 



 

(d) Sellers Liability for indemnification of Damages under this Agreement
resulting from, arising out of, or relating to any breach or failure of (i)
any representation or warranty made by Sellers (excluding any Fundamental
Representation) shall be limited to, in the

 



      
 

 



 

aggregate, an amount equal to fifteen percent (15%) of the Base Purchase Price
(the " _Cap_ ") and (ii) any Fundamental Representation shall be limited to,
in the aggregate, an amount equal to the Purchase Price. Sellers Liability
with respect to a claim made pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(iii)_ shall not be
subject to the Cap.

 



 

(e) The amount which an Indemnifying Party is or may be required to pay to an
Indemnified Party in respect of Damages for which indemnification is provided
under this Agreement shall be reduced by any amounts actually received
(including amounts received under insurance policies) by or on behalf of any
Indemnified Party or its Affiliates from third parties and any Tax benefit to
the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates arising in connection with the payment
of any such Damages (such amounts and benefits are collectively referred to
herein as " _Indemnity Reduction Amounts_ "). If any Company Entity or
Indemnified Party or its Affiliates receives any Indemnity Reduction Amounts
in respect of a claim for which indemnification is provided under this
Agreement after the full amount of such claim has been paid by an Indemnifying
Party or after an Indemnifying Party has made a partial payment of such claim
and such Indemnity Reduction Amounts exceed the remaining unpaid balance of
such claim, then the Indemnified Party shall promptly remit to the
Indemnifying Party an amount equal to the excess (if any) of (i) the amount
theretofore paid by the Indemnifying Party in respect of such claim, less (ii)
the amount of the indemnity payment that would have been due if such Indemnity
Reduction Amounts in respect thereof had been received before the indemnity
payment was made. An insurer or other third party who would otherwise be
obligated to pay any claim shall not be relieved of the responsibility with
respect thereto or, solely by virtue of the indemnification provisions hereof,
have any subrogation rights with respect thereto, it being expressly
understood and agreed that no insurer or any other third party shall be
entitled to any benefit they would not be entitled to receive in the absence
of the indemnification provisions by virtue of the indemnification provisions
hereof. Each of Sellers and Buyers, as appropriate, shall, or shall cause each
Indemnified Party to, use its commercially reasonable efforts to pursue
promptly any claims or rights it may have against all third parties which
would reduce the amount of Damages for which indemnification is provided under
this Agreement and take all commercially reasonable actions to mitigate
damages. Tax benefits under this _Section 9.2(e)_ shall be determined
assuming full utilization of any resulting deduction or loss in the Tax period
in which the Damage is sustained and using the highest combined marginal Tax
rate in effect for federal and applicable state, local and foreign income
Taxes for such Tax period.

 



 

Section 9.3 _Method of Asserting Claims_. All claims for indemnification by
any Indemnified Party under _Section 9.2_ shall be asserted and resolved as
follows:

 



 

(a) In the event any claim or demand in respect of which an Indemnified Party
might seek indemnity under _Section 9.2_ is asserted against or sought to be
collected from such Indemnified Party by a Person other than a party hereto or
any of its Affiliates (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), then such Indemnified Party
shall deliver a Claim Notice promptly to the Indemnifying Party in accordance
with paragraph (b) below. In case any such action is brought against an
Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in
and to assume and control the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to such Indemnified Party, and after notice from the Indemnifying
Party to such Indemnified Party of its election so to assume the defense
thereof, the Indemnifying Party shall not be Liable to such Indemnified Party
for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the latter in
connection with the defense

 



      
 

 



 

thereof; _provided_ , that the Indemnified Party may participate in such
defense at the Indemnified Partys expense. If the Indemnifying Party does not
elect to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, it shall not be obligated
to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for the Indemnified
Parties with respect to such Third Party Claim, unless the Indemnified Parties
shall have been advised by counsel that representation of any such Indemnified
Parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate under applicable standards
of professional conduct due to actual or potential differing interests between
them, in which case such Indemnified Parties shall have the right to select
separate counsel the fees and expenses of which shall be paid by the
Indemnifying Party. No Indemnifying Party shall consent to entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement of any Third Party Claim of which it has
assumed the defense hereunder without the consent of the Indemnified Party,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; _provided_ , that
such consent shall not be required if (i) the settlement agreement contains a
complete and unconditional general release by the third party asserting the
claim to all Indemnified Parties affected by the claim and (ii) the settlement
is for money damages only. No Indemnifying Party shall be subject to any
Liability for any settlement of a Third Party Claim made without its consent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

 



 

(b) In the event of any claim or demand, including Third Party Claims, in
respect of which an Indemnified Party might seek indemnity hereunder, the
Indemnified Party shall deliver an Indemnity Notice promptly to the
Indemnifying Party, _provided_ , that the failure by any Indemnified Party to
give the Indemnity Notice shall not impair such partys rights hereunder
except to the extent that an Indemnifying Party has been prejudiced thereby,
and then only to the extent of such prejudice. The Indemnifying Party shall
notify the Indemnified Party within the thirty (30)-day period after its
receipt of such Indemnity Notice (the " _Dispute Period_ ") as to whether the
Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the Indemnified Party hereunder.
If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party that it does not
dispute the claim described in such Indemnity Notice, or fails to notify the
Indemnified Party within the Dispute Period whether the Indemnifying Party
disputes the claim described in such Indemnity Notice, the Indemnifying Party
shall be deemed to be Liable hereunder for indemnifying the Indemnified Party
in respect of such claim, subject to the other provisions of this _ARTICLE
IX_, up to the amount of Damages specified in the Indemnity Notice, when such
Damages have been finally determined. If the Indemnifying Party has timely
disputed its liability with respect to such claim, the Indemnifying Party and
the Indemnified Party shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of
such dispute.

 



 

(c) The Parties shall cooperate with one another with respect to resolving any
claim or Liability with respect to which one Party is obligated to provide
indemnification hereunder.

 



 

(d) Sellers shall not have any Liability for any inaccuracy or breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant of this Agreement if Sellers can
demonstrate Buyers Knowledge, or the actual knowledge of any of Buyers
representatives that have reviewed the materials made available in the
electronic data room or in any "QandA logs," of such inaccuracy or breach prior
to the date of this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement, any amounts payable
pursuant to the indemnification obligations under this Agreement shall be paid
without duplication.

OR OTHER AGREEMENTS CONTAINED IN THE TGOC CONTRACTS.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Except for the obligations of Sellers under this Agreement, for and in
consideration of the Company Interests, effective as of the Closing, Buyers
shall and shall cause their Affiliates (including the Company Entities) to
absolutely and unconditionally release, acquit and forever discharge Sellers
and their respective Affiliates, each of Sellers and such Affiliates present
and former officers, directors, managers, employees, agents, partners,
members, equity holders and control persons, and each of the respective heirs,
executors, administrators, successors and assigns of any of the foregoing,
from any and all costs, expenses, damages, debts, or any other obligations,
liabilities and claims whatsoever, whether known or unknown, both in law and
in equity, in each case to the extent arising out of or resulting from the
ownership and/or operation of the Company Entities, or the assets, business,
operations, conduct, services, products and/or employees (including former
employees) of any of the Company Entities (and any predecessors), whether
related to any period of time before or after the Closing Date, including
liabilities under any Environmental Law.

 



 

(c) Except to the extent and only to the extent specifically contemplated by
_Section 6.18_, none of the Seller Indemnified Parties and none of the Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to any recovery under this Agreement
following Closing for any of its or its Affiliates special, exemplary,
punitive, consequential, incidental or indirect damages, lost profits
(including any damages on account of lost opportunities or lost or delayed
power generation) or losses based on diminution of value or calculated by
reference to any multiple of earnings or earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation or amortization (or any other valuation methodology); _provided_
, that the foregoing shall not apply to third-party claims for which any Party
is obligated to indemnify another Party hereunder.

 



 

Section 9.5 _Exclusive Remedies_. From and after Closing, the remedies set
forth in _Section 2.4_ and _ARTICLE IX_ shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy with respect to any and all claims relating, directly or indirectly, to
the subject matter of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing and subject to _Section 8.1_, this _ARTICLE IX_ and _ARTICLE X_,
Buyers and Sellers hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, any and all rights, claims and causes of action it or any of
their respective Affiliates may have against the other Party or any of its
Affiliates with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, whether
arising under or based upon any Law.

may be available to the Parties by Law or this Agreement, this Agreement may
be terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned at any
time prior to the Closing:

 



 

(a) by mutual written consent of Sellers and Buyers;

 



      
 

 



 

(b) by either Sellers or Buyers by giving written notice to the other Party if
the Closing shall not have occurred by October 31, 2014 (the " _Outside Date_
"), unless extended by written agreement of Sellers and Buyers; _provided_ ,
that the Outside Date shall be automatically extended on a day-for-day basis
(but in no event beyond December 31, 2014), to the extent that the sole reason
that the Closing shall not have occurred is a failure of either or both of the
conditions set forth in _Section 7.1(b)_ and _Section 7.1(c)_ (or _Section
7.1(a)_, to the extent related thereto) to have been satisfied by the Outside
Date, and; _provided further_ , that a Party shall not be permitted to
terminate pursuant to this subsection (b) if such Party is in default or
breach hereunder;

 



 

(c) by either Sellers or Buyers by giving written notice to the other Party if
such other Party has breached its covenants, agreements or other obligations
hereunder in a manner that would reasonably be expected to cause any condition
of such Party giving notice set forth in _ARTICLE VII_ not to be satisfied
and, except in the case of a breach of Buyers obligation to effect the
Closing and pay the Purchase Price in accordance with the terms of _ARTICLE
II_, such breach has not been cured within thirty (30) days after written
notification thereof by the Party seeking termination hereunder;

 



 

(d) by either Sellers or Buyers by giving written notice to the other Party if
any Governmental Authority shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or
taken any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and such order, decree, ruling or other action shall not be subject
to appeal or shall have become final and unappealable; _provided_ , that the
right to terminate this Agreement under this subsection (d) shall not be
available to any Party whose default or breach hereunder has resulted in such
order, decree, ruling or other Action;

 



 

(e) by the Sellers if (i) all the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ and
_Section 7.3_ and have been satisfied (and continue to be satisfied) or
irrevocably waived (other than any such conditions which by their terms are
not capable of being satisfied until the Closing Date) and (ii) the Buyers do
not consummate the transactions contemplated hereby within three (3) Business
Days of the day the Closing is required to occur pursuant to _Section 2.5_;
or

 



 

(f) by either Sellers or Buyers pursuant to _Section 6.18(d)_.

 



 

Section 10.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of any termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1_, all rights and obligations of the
Parties hereunder shall terminate without any Liability on the part of either
Party or its Affiliates in respect thereof, except that (i) provisions of, and
the obligations of Buyers and Sellers under, _Section 6.2(b)_, _Section
6.5_, _Section 8.1_, this _ARTICLE X_ and _ARTICLE XI_ of this Agreement
shall remain in full force and effect and (ii) such termination shall not
relieve any Party of any Liability for any breach of this Agreement.

 



       
 

 



 

ARTICLE XI.

void.

Section 11.4 _Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement may not be amended,
supplemented or otherwise modified except in a written instrument executed by
each of the Parties. No waiver by any of the Parties of any default,
misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder, whether
intentional or not, shall be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent
default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder or
affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such
occurrence. No waiver by any of the Parties of any of the provisions hereof
shall be effective unless explicitly set forth in writing and executed by the

Section 11.5 _Exhibits and Schedules_.

 



 

(a) All Exhibits and Schedules and the Disclosure Schedules attached hereto
are hereby incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof.

 



 

(b) Neither the specification of any dollar amount in any representation nor
the mere inclusion of any item in a Schedule or in the Disclosure Schedules as
an exception to a representation or warranty shall be deemed an admission by a
Party that such item represents a material fact, event or circumstance or that
such item is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company Entities or Buyer.

 



 

(c) Sellers shall have the right (but not the obligation) to deliver to
Buyers, at any time prior to the Closing Date, a supplement to the Sellers
Disclosure Schedule (the " _Closing Date Schedule Supplement_ ") to disclose
any matter arising or discovered after the date hereof, that, if existing at,
or arising or discovered prior to the date hereof, would have been required to
be set forth in the Sellers Disclosure Schedule for the representations and
warranties of Sellers set forth herein to be true and correct as of the date
hereof, and the Sellers Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be modified,
supplemented and amended to include the items listed in the Closing Date
Schedule Supplement for all purposes hereunder, other than to cure any breach
or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of Seller contained in this
Agreement for purposes of _ARTICLE IX_. If any item set forth in the Closing
Date Schedule Supplement discloses any event, circumstance or development
that, individually or in the aggregate when taken together

 



      
 

 



 

with other previously disclosed events, circumstances or developments, would
prevent any of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.3(a)_ to be satisfied,
then Buyers may terminate this Agreement by delivering notice of termination
to Sellers within ten (10) Business Days of its receipt of such Closing Date
Schedule Supplement; _provided_ , that if Buyers do not deliver such notice
within such ten (10)-Business Day period, then Buyers shall be deemed to have
irrevocably waived their right to terminate this Agreement with respect to
such item and their right to not consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby with respect to such item, in each case, after giving effect to such
item under any of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.3(a)_, but shall not
be deemed to have irrevocably waived their right to indemnification under
_Section 9.2_ with respect to such item.

 



 

Section 11.6 _Headings_. The table of contents and section headings contained
in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not be deemed a
part of this Agreement or affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement.

 



 

Section 11.7 _Construction_. The Parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of
any of the provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 11.8 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties expressly set forth in _ARTICLE III_ and
_ARTICLE IV_ of this Agreement, Buyers acknowledge that none of Sellers or
any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person makes any
representation or warranty, express or implied, at law or in equity, with
respect to Sellers, the Company Entities, the Company Interests, the Business
or any of the assets or Liabilities of the Company Entities and its
Affiliates, or with respect to any other information provided to Buyers,
whether on behalf of Sellers, the Company Entities or such other Persons,
including as to the probable success or profitability of the Business after
the Closing. Neither Sellers nor any of their Affiliates or representatives
shall have or be subject to any Liability or indemnification obligation to
Buyers or any other Person resulting from the distribution to Buyers, or
Buyers use of, any such information, including the confidential information
memorandum, related to the Business, and any information, document or material
made available to Buyers in certain "data rooms," management presentations or
in any other form in expectation or contemplation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

Section 11.9 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Schedules and
the Exhibits hereto), the Transaction Documents and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede any prior understandings,
negotiations, agreements, or representations among the Parties of any nature,
whether written or oral, to the extent they relate in any way to the subject
matter hereof or thereof.

 



 

Section 11.10 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or the
application of any such provision to any Person or circumstance shall be
declared by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, void
or unenforceable in any respect, all other provisions of this Agreement, or
the application of such provision to Persons or circumstances other than those
as

 



      
 

 



 

to which it has been held invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable, shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected,
impaired or invalidated thereby. Upon such determination that any provision,
or the application of any such provision, is invalid, illegal, void or
unenforceable, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as
possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable
manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to
the greatest extent possible. Notwithstanding anything contained herein, under
no circumstance shall the obligation of Sellers to deliver the Company
Interests be enforceable absent enforceability of the obligation of Buyers to
pay the Purchase Price, and vice versa.

 



 

Section 11.11 _Expenses_.

 



 

(a) Buyers shall be obligated to pay any and all costs of any audit of any
Company Entity as may be required to enable Buyers to complete and file any
filing by Buyers or an Affiliate of Buyers with any Governmental Authority or
otherwise. Buyers shall be obligated to pay any and all costs of filing fees
and expenses with respect to any filings required under the HSR Act in
connection with this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Any fees, costs or expenses incurred in connection with obtaining the
Required Consents or any other Consent under the Contracts of the Business
required in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be borne 50% by Buyers and 50% by Sellers.

 



 

(c) Unless otherwise provided herein, including as provided in _Section 2.2_,
each of Buyers and Sellers agrees to pay, without right of reimbursement from
the other, all costs and expenses incurred by it incident to the performance
of its obligations hereunder, including the fees and disbursements of counsel,
accountants, financial advisors, experts and consultants employed by the
respective Parties in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby,
whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
consummated.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this _Section
11.11_ shall survive the Closing and shall be deemed to be a Surviving
Covenant.

 



 

Section 11.12 _Legal Representation_.

 



 

(a) It is acknowledged by each of the Parties that the Company Entities and
Sellers have retained Latham and Watkins LLP, Akin Gump Strauss Hauer and Feld
LLP, Van Ness Feldman LLP, McDermott Will and Emery and Chadbourne and Parke LLP
(collectively, " _Sellers  Counsel_") to act as their counsel in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby and that Sellers Counsel has not
acted as counsel for any other Party in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and that none of the other Parties has the status of a
client of any of Sellers Counsel for conflict of interest or any other
purposes as a result thereof. It is likewise acknowledged by the Parties that
that Buyers or their Affiliates (for the avoidance of doubt, excluding the
Company Entities) may have the status of a client of Sellers Counsel for
conflict of interest or other purposes by virtue of representation thereby not
in connection with either (x) the transactions contemplated hereby or (y) the
representation by Sellers Counsel of the Company Entities prior to the
Closing. Subject to the following sentence, Sellers and Buyers

 



      
 

 



 

hereby agree that, in the event that any dispute arising out of this Agreement
or the other Transaction Documents or any other matter in which the interests
of Sellers and their Affiliates, on the one hand, and Buyers and their
Affiliates (including the Company Entities), on the other hand, are adverse,
arises after the Closing between any Buyer or any of the Company Entities, on
the one hand, and Sellers and their Affiliates, on the other hand (any such
dispute, a " _Potential Conflict Dispute_ "), neither Buyers nor their
Affiliates (including the Company Entities) will disqualify, or in any way
attempt to disqualify (including by asserting that Sellers Counsel have a
conflict of interest that requires a waiver by Buyer or its Affiliates),
Sellers Counsel from representing any or all of Sellers and their Affiliates
in such Potential Conflict Dispute, even though the interests of Sellers and
their Affiliates may be directly adverse to any Buyer or any of the Company
Entities, on the basis that Sellers Counsel (i) may, prior to the Closing,
have represented one or more of the Company Entities in any matter
substantially related to such Potential Conflict Dispute (for the avoidance of
doubt, whether in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or
otherwise) or (ii) has represented or continues to represent any of the
Company Entities with respect to the Retained Assets or Retained Liabilities.
For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent that Buyers or their Affiliates have
the status of a client of any of Sellers Counsel by virtue of any
representation thereof other than as described in clauses (i) or (ii) of the
preceding sentence, either prior to or after the Closing Effective Date, and,
as a result of such status, Buyers or their Affiliates have a right to
disqualify such Sellers Counsel (including by Buyers or their Affiliates
exercising a right not to waive Sellers Counsels conflict of interest in a
Potential Conflict Dispute if such right exists), such right to disqualify
Sellers Counsel from representing any or all of Sellers and their Affiliates
in a Potential Conflict Dispute shall not be affected by this _Section
11.12(a)_.

 



 

(b) Sellers and Buyers and their respective Affiliates, including following
the Closing with respect to the Company Entities, acknowledge and agree that,
in connection with any future disputes, lawsuits, actions, proceedings,
investigations or other matters, including any dispute between Buyers, the
Company Entities and/or any of its or their respective Affiliates, on the one
hand, and any of Sellers and/or any of their respective Affiliates, on the
other hand, or with or between any other Persons, with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise, (i) as to all
communications among Sellers Counsel, any of the Company Entities, the
Sellers and/or any of their Affiliates, the attorney-client privilege,
attorney work product protection and the expectation of client confidence
belongs solely to the applicable Seller and/or its Affiliates (other than the
Company Entities), and may be controlled by such Seller or its Affiliates
(other than the Company Entities), and shall not pass to or be claimed by
Buyers, the Company Entities, or any of their respective Affiliates and (ii)
Sellers Counsel may disclose to Sellers or their Affiliates any information
learned by Sellers Counsel in the course of its representation of Sellers,
the Company Entities or their respective Affiliates, whether or not such
information is subject to attorney-client privilege, attorney work product
protection, or Sellers Counsels duty of confidentiality. Accordingly, Buyers
and their Affiliates shall not have access to any such communications, or to
the files of Sellers Counsel, whether or not the Closing occurs. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon and after the Closing, (A) to
the extent that files of Sellers Counsel constitute property of the client,
only Sellers and their Affiliates shall hold such property rights and (B)
Sellers Counsel shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such
attorney-client communications or files to Buyers or the Company Entities by
reason of any attorney-client relationship between Sellers Counsel and the
Company Entities or otherwise.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) If and to the extent that, at any time subsequent to Closing, Buyers or
any of their Affiliates (including the Company Entities) shall have the right
to assert or waive any attorney-client privilege with respect to any
communication between the Company Entities or their respective Affiliates and
any Person representing them that occurred at any time prior to the Closing,
each Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including the Company
Entities), shall be entitled to waive such privilege only with the prior
written consent of Sellers.

 



 

(d) Sellers Counsel may rely on this _Section 11.12_.

 



 

Section 11.13 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all claims arising out of or
relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be
governed by the Laws of the State of New York.

 



 

Section 11.14 _Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 



 

(a) Each of the Parties irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of
(i) state courts of the State of New York located in New York County and (ii)
the United States District Court for the Southern District of the State of New
York for the purposes of any suit, Action or other proceeding arising out of
or relating to this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby (and
agrees not to commence any Action, suit or proceeding relating hereto except
in such courts). Each of the Parties further agrees that service of any
process, summons, notice or document hand delivered or sent by U.S. registered
mail to such Partys respective address set forth in _Section 11.3_ shall be
effective service of process for any Action, suit or proceeding in New York
with respect to any matters to which it has submitted to jurisdiction as set
forth in the immediately preceding sentence. Each of the Parties irrevocably
and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of any Action,
suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby in (i) state courts of the State of New York
located in New York County or (ii) the United States District Court for the
Southern District of the State of New York, and hereby further irrevocably and
unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that
any such Action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought
in an inconvenient forum. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party agrees
that a final judgment in any Action or proceeding so brought shall be
conclusive and may be enforced by suit on the judgment in any jurisdiction or
in any other manner provided in law or in equity.

 



 

(b) EACH OF THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF THE PARTIES IN THE
NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

 **FORM OF**

 



 

 **SELLER PARENT GUARANTY**

 



 

This Guaranty (this " _Guaranty_ "), dated as of [ ], 2014 (the "
_Effective Date_ "), is made by TERRA-GEN POWER, LLC (" _Guarantor_ "), in
favor of NRG YIELD, INC. (" _NRG YieldCo_ "), and NRG YIELD OPERATING LLC ("
_NRG Yield OpCo_ ," together with NRG YieldCo, " _Buyers_ ").

 



 

 _W I T N E S S E T H_ :

 



 

WHEREAS, Buyers, Terra-Gen Finance Company, LLC (" _TG Finance_ "), NTD AWAM
Holdings, LLC (" _NTD AWAM Holdings_ "), CHIPS Alta Wind X Holding Company,
LLC (" _CHIPS Alta Wind X_ ") and CHIPS Alta Wind XI Holding Company, LLC ("
_CHIPS Alta Wind XI_ " and, together with TG Finance, NTD AWAM Holdings and
CHIPS Alta Wind X, " _Obligors_ ") have entered into that certain Purchase and
Sale Agreement, dated as of June 3, 2014 (the " _Agreement_ ");

 



 

WHEREAS, Obligors are indirect subsidiaries of Guarantor;

 



 

WHEREAS, Guarantor will directly or indirectly benefit from the Agreement
between Obligors and Buyers; and

 



 

WHEREAS, Buyers require, as a condition to entering into the Agreement, that
Guarantor agrees to guaranty hereunder, for the benefit of Buyers and their
successors and permitted assigns, the full and timely performance of the
Guaranteed Obligations (as defined below).

 



 

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and as an inducement
for Buyers execution, delivery and performance of the Agreement, and for
other good and valuable consideration, the adequacy of which is hereby
acknowledged, Guarantor hereby agrees for the benefit of Buyers as follows:

 

  

1. _GUARANTY_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and provisions hereof, from and after the Effective
Date through the Termination Date (as defined below), Guarantor hereby
absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the timely and complete
payment in immediately available funds, without duplication, of all
obligations of Obligors, as and when the same shall become due, (i) to Buyers
pursuant to the Agreement and (ii) to Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to
Section 9.2(a) of the Agreement (collectively, the " _Guaranteed Obligations_
"). This Guaranty shall constitute a continuing guarantee of payment of the
Guaranteed Obligations, but not of collection.

 



 

(b) Guarantor is liable for the timely and complete payment of the Guaranteed
Obligations, as set forth in this Guaranty, as a primary obligor. Without
waiving any of the Guarantors rights hereunder, this Guaranty is effective as
a waiver of, and Guarantor

      
 

 



 

hereby expressly waives, any and all rights to which Guarantor may otherwise
have been entitled under any suretyship Laws in effect from time to time in
the State of New York.

 



 

(c) No exculpatory language contained in any of the other Transaction
Documents shall in any event or under any circumstances modify, qualify or
affect the obligations and liabilities of Guarantor hereunder, except to the
extent expressly set forth herein. This Guaranty may not be revoked by
Guarantor and shall continue to be effective with respect to the Guaranteed
Obligations arising or created after any attempted revocation by Guarantor. It
is the intent of the parties hereto that, subject to the terms of this
Guaranty, including _Section 2_, (i) the obligations and liabilities of
Guarantor hereunder are absolute and unconditional under any and all
circumstances and (ii) so long as any portion of the Guaranteed Obligations
shall remain outstanding, the obligations and liabilities of Guarantor
hereunder shall not be discharged or released in whole or in part, by any act
or occurrence (including the fact that at any time or from time to time the
Guaranteed Obligations may be increased or reduced) that might, but for the
provisions of this Guaranty, be deemed a legal or equitable discharge or
release of Guarantor.

 



 

(d) Except as provided in _Section 2(a)_ or to the extent of any set-off,
offset, claim or defense expressly provided for in this Guaranty, the
Guaranteed Obligations and the liabilities and obligations of Guarantor to
Buyers hereunder shall not be reduced, discharged or released because or by
reason of any existing or future set-off, offset, claim or defense of any kind
or nature that any of the Obligors, Guarantor or any other Person has or may
hereafter have against Buyers or against payment of the Guaranteed
Obligations.

 



 

2. _LIMITATIONS_.

 



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in this Guaranty to the
contrary, the obligations and liabilities of Guarantor under this Guaranty
shall be subject to the following limitations:

 



 

(a) The obligation and liability of Guarantor under this Guaranty is
specifically limited to payments in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations
required to be made by Obligors under the Agreement, subject to any and all
rights, set-offs, offsets, claims, counterclaims, limitations, qualifications
and other defenses, solely to the extent that each of the foregoing are
available to Obligors under the Agreement, other as expressly waived by
Guarantor pursuant to in _Section 7_ (collectively, the " _Waived Defenses_
").

 



 

(b) To the extent Obligors are relieved of all or any portion of the
Guaranteed Obligations by satisfaction thereof (including, without limitation,
by any payment hereunder) or pursuant to any express written agreement with
the Obligors, the Guarantor shall be similarly relieved, to such extent, of
its obligations under this Guaranty.

 



 

(c) Guarantor has no obligation or liability to any Person relating to,
arising out of or in connection with this Guaranty or the Agreement or any
other Transaction Documents, other than as expressly set forth herein.

 



 

(d) This Guaranty may not be enforced without first giving full effect to the
limitations contained herein.

 



      
 

 



 

3. _DEMANDS AND PAYMENT_.

 



 

(a) If any Obligor fails to completely and promptly pay any Guaranteed
Obligation to Buyers when such Guaranteed Obligation is finally determined to
be due and owing under the Agreement (an " _Overdue Obligation_ "), Guarantor
shall, promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) and,
immediately upon demand by Buyers (a " _Payment Demand_ ") and without any
other notice whatsoever, pay the amount due thereon to Buyers.

 



 

(b) Guarantors obligation hereunder to pay any particular Overdue
Obligation(s) to Buyers is conditioned upon Guarantors receipt of a Payment
Demand from Buyers satisfying the following requirements: (i) such Payment
Demand must be delivered to Guarantor in accordance with _Section 12_ below;
and (ii) the specific Overdue Obligation(s) or any portion thereof addressed
by such Payment Demand must remain due and unpaid at the time of such delivery
to Guarantor.

 



 

(c) So long as Buyers have validly made a Payment Demand in strict accordance
with the requirements specified in _Section 3(b)_, it shall not be necessary
for Buyers, in order to enforce such payment by Guarantor specified in such
Payment Demand (and Guarantor hereby waives any rights that Guarantor may have
to require Buyers), to separately take any action, obtain any judgment or file
any claim prior to enforcing this Guaranty, including to institute suit or
pursue or exhaust any rights or remedies against Obligors or others liable for
such payment, or to join Obligors for the payment of the Guaranteed
Obligations or any part thereof in any action to enforce the Guaranty, or to
resort to any other means of obtaining payment of the Guaranteed Obligations.

 



 

(d) Suit may be brought or demand may be made against Obligors or Guarantor,
separately or together, without impairing the rights of Buyers against any
party hereto. Any time that Buyers are entitled to exercise their rights or
remedies hereunder, they may in their discretion elect to demand payment, all
to the extent of their right to so elect under the terms of the Agreement.
Subject to _Section 10_ hereof, if Buyers make a Payment Demand hereunder,
such election shall not affect Buyers right to demand payment thereafter
under, and in accordance with the terms of, the Agreement, until all of the
Guaranteed Obligations have been paid in full.

 



 

(e) After validly issuing a Payment Demand in strict accordance with the
requirements specified in _Section 3(b)_, Buyers shall not be required to
issue any further notices or make any further demands with respect to the
Overdue Obligation(s) specified in that Payment Demand.

 



 

4. _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES_.

 



 

Guarantor hereby represents and warrants that:

 



 

(a) it is a limited liability company duly formed and validly existing under
the Laws of the State of Delaware and has the limited liability company power
and authority to execute and deliver this Guaranty and perform its obligations
hereunder;

 



      
 

 



 

(b) no Consent of, with or to any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction
over Guarantor is required to be obtained or made with respect to Guarantor in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Guaranty;

 



 

(c) the execution and delivery of this Guaranty and the performance of the
obligations of Guarantor hereunder have been duly authorized by Guarantor and
constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of Guarantor, enforceable
against Guarantor in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other Laws of general
application, heretofore or hereafter enacted or in effect, affecting the
rights and remedies of creditors generally and the exercise of judicial or
administrative discretion in accordance with general equitable principles
(regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at Law or in
equity);

 



 

(d) Guarantor has not entered into this Guaranty with the actual intent to
hinder, delay or defraud any creditor. Guarantor received reasonably
equivalent value in exchange for the Guaranteed Obligations. Guarantor is not
presently insolvent, and the execution and delivery of this Guaranty will not
render Guarantor insolvent;

 



 

(e) the execution and delivery of this Guaranty and the performance of its
obligations hereunder do not and will not (i) violate any Law to which
Guarantor is subject or by which any of its assets or property are bound or
(ii) conflict with or result in a breach of the terms, conditions or
provisions of (A) any of Guarantors organizational documents or (B) any
material agreement or instrument to which Guarantor is a party, or by which
Guarantor or its assets or property are bound, in the case of each of clause
(A) and (B), as would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely
affect the performance of Guarantors obligations and duties under this
Guaranty;

 



 

(f) there is no action, suit, proceeding, arbitration or investigation pending
or, to the best of Guarantors knowledge, threatened against Guarantor in any
court or by or before any other Governmental Authority, in each case, which
would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the
performance of Guarantors obligations and duties under this Guaranty;

 



 

(g) Guarantor is not in default or violation of any regulation, order, writ,
injunction, decree or demand of any Governmental Authority, the violation or
default of which would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely
affect the condition (financial or otherwise) of Guarantor or would reasonably
be expected to materially and adversely affect its performance hereunder;

 



 

(h) except as provided herein, this Guaranty and the obligations of Guarantor
hereunder are not subject to, and Guarantor has not asserted, any right of
rescission, offset, counterclaim, cross-claim, recoupment or affirmative or
other defense of any kind and neither the operation of any of the terms of
this Guaranty nor the exercise of any right hereunder will render the Guaranty
unenforceable in whole or in part; and

 



 

(i) Guarantor is contemplating neither the filing of a petition under any
state or federal bankruptcy or insolvency Laws nor the liquidation of its
assets or property and Guarantor

 



      
 

 



 

does not have any knowledge (after due and diligent inquiry) of any Person
contemplating the filing of any such petition against it.

 



 

All representations and warranties made by Guarantor herein are made as of the
date hereof but shall survive the execution hereof.

 



 

5. _SUBROGATION_.

 



 

The Guarantor shall not exercise any rights which it may acquire by way of
subrogation, by any payment made under this Guaranty, until the Guaranteed
Obligations have been paid in full. If any amount is paid to the Guarantor on
account of subordination rights under this Guaranty at any time when the
Guaranteed Obligations have not been paid in full, the amount shall be held in
trust by the Guarantor for the benefit of Buyers or the applicable Buyer
Indemnified Party and shall be promptly, but in any event within 2 Business
Days, paid to Buyers to be credited and applied to the Guaranteed Obligations,
whether matured or unmatured or absolute or contingent. If Guarantor shall
make, or cause to be made, payment to Buyers of all or any part of the
Guaranteed Obligations, upon satisfaction in full of the Guaranteed
Obligations Buyers will, at Guarantors request, execute and deliver to
Guarantor appropriate documents necessary to evidence the transfer by
subrogation to Guarantor of an interest in the Guaranteed Obligations
resulting from such payment by Guarantor; provided that any rights of
Guarantor pursuant to this _Section 5_ shall be subordinate to all
obligations of Obligors to Buyers under the Agreement.

 



 

6. _AMENDMENT OF GUARANTY_.

 



 

No term or provision of this Guaranty shall be amended, modified, altered,
waived or supplemented except in a writing signed by Guarantor and Buyers.

 



 

7. _WAIVERS AND CONSENTS_.

 



 

Subject to and in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Guaranty:

 



 

(a) Guarantor hereby waives (i) notice of acceptance of this Guaranty; (ii)
presentment and demand concerning the liabilities of Guarantor; and (iii) any
right to require that any action or proceeding be brought against Obligors or
any other Person, or to require that Buyers seek enforcement of any
performance against Obligors or any other Person, prior to any action against
Guarantor under the terms hereof.

 



 

(b) Without notice to or the consent of Guarantor, and without impairing or
releasing Guarantors obligations under this Guaranty, Buyers may: (i) change
the manner, place or terms for payment of all or any of the Guaranteed
Obligations (including renewals, extensions or other alterations of the
Guaranteed Obligations); or (ii) receive, substitute, surrender, exchange or
release any collateral or other security for any or all of the Guaranteed
Obligations.

 



 

8. _NO EFFECT ON GUARANTY_.

 



 

Subject to the terms of this Guaranty, (x) Guarantor shall remain liable on
the Guaranteed Obligations, or any part thereof, for any reason (and
regardless of any joinder of Obligors or any

 



      
 

 



 

other party (other than as provided in _Section 13(b)_) in any action to
obtain payment of any or all of the Guaranteed Obligations) described in this
_Section 8_, (y) the obligations of Guarantor under this Guaranty shall not
be altered, limited, impaired or otherwise affected by, nor shall Guarantor be
exonerated, discharged or released (by virtue of any Law, arrangement or
relationship) by, any one or more of the following events, actions, facts, or
circumstances described in this _Section 8_, and (z) the liability of
Guarantor under the Guaranty shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective
of and Guarantor waives any common law, equitable, statutory or other similar
extra-contractual rights (including rights to notice) or defenses that
Guarantor might otherwise have as a result of or in connection with any of the
following:

 



 

(a) the taking or accepting of any other security or guaranty for, or right of
recourse with respect to, any or all of the Guaranteed Obligations, to the
extent such taking or acceptance does not discharge the Guaranteed
Obligations;

 



 

(b) whether express or by operation of any Law, or otherwise, any limitation,
discharge, cessation or partial release of the liability of Guarantor
hereunder, other than as expressly provided herein;

 



 

(c) without limiting any right of Guarantor to assert set-offs, offsets,
claims, counterclaims, limitations, qualifications and other defenses, solely
to the extent each of the foregoing are available to Obligors, with respect to
the Guaranteed Obligations, either with or without notice to or consent of
Guarantor, any valid renewal, extension, modification, supplement,
subordination or rearrangement of the terms of any or all of the Guaranteed
Obligations (other than this Guaranty);

 



 

(d) any neglect, lack of diligence, delay, omission, failure, or refusal of
Buyers to take or prosecute (or in taking or prosecuting) any action for the
collection or enforcement of any of the Guaranteed Obligations;

 



 

(e) except as set forth in _Section 2(a)_ and _2(b)_ , if for any reason
Buyers are required to refund any payment by Obligors or pay the amount
thereof, in each case, to a Person other than Obligors or Guarantor;

 



 

(f) the existence of any claim, set-off, or other right that Guarantor may at
any time have against Buyers, Obligors, or any other person, in each case, if
arising outside of the Agreement or this Guaranty;

 



 

(g) the unenforceability of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations in
accordance with the terms of the Agreement against Obligors for any reason
whatsoever, including (i) the officers or persons creating the Guaranteed
Obligations acted in excess of their authority or because of a lack of
validity or enforceability or of defect or deficiency in the Agreement, other
Transaction Document or any other document or agreement executed in connection
with the creating of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any part thereof, (ii) the
act of creating the Guaranteed Obligations, or any part thereof, is _ultra
vires_ , (iii) the Obligors obligations cease to exist by operation of Law or
(iv) any of the Transaction Documents or any other document or agreement
executed in connection with the Guaranteed Obligations, or any part thereof,
has been forged or otherwise are irregular or

 



      
 

 



 

not genuine or authentic, in each case with respect to clause (iv) solely as a
result of the action of Obligors or their Affiliates;

 



 

(h) any change, whether direct or indirect, in the Guarantors relationship to
Obligors, including any such change by reason of any merger or consolidation
or any sale, transfer, issuance, spin-off, distribution or other disposition
of any stock, equity interest or other security of any Obligor, the Guarantor
or any other entity;

 



 

(i) any proceeding, voluntary or involuntary, involving bankruptcy,
insolvency, receivership, reorganization, liquidation or arrangement of any
Obligor or any defense which any Obligor may have by reason of the order,
decree or decision of any court or administrative body resulting from any such
proceeding;

 



 

(j) any other act or omission that may or might in any manner or to any extent
vary the risk of the Guarantor or that may or might otherwise operate as a
discharge of the Guarantor as a matter of Law or equity, other than (i) the
payment in full of all the Guaranteed Obligations or (ii) as expressly set
forth in this Guaranty; and

 



 

(k) any other extra-contractual circumstance that might otherwise constitute a
legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor generally, it being the
unambiguous and unequivocal intention of Guarantor and Buyers that the
liability of Guarantor hereunder shall be direct and immediate in accordance
with the terms hereof and that Guarantor shall be obligated to pay the
Guaranteed Obligations when due hereunder.

 



 

9. _REINSTATEMENT_.

 



 

In the event any payment by Obligors or any other person to Buyers is held to
constitute a preference, fraudulent transfer or other voidable payment under
any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar Law, or if for any other reason Buyers
are required to refund such payment or pay the amount thereof to any other
party, such payment by Obligors or any other party to Buyers shall not
constitute a release of Guarantor from any liability hereunder, and the
Guaranty shall continue to be effective or shall be reinstated
(notwithstanding any prior release, surrender or discharge by Buyers of the
Guaranty or of Guarantor), as the case may be, with respect to, and the
Guaranty shall apply to, any and all amounts so refunded by Buyers or paid by
Buyers to another person (which amounts shall constitute part of the
Guaranteed Obligations), and any interest paid by Buyers and any attorneys
fees, costs and expenses paid or incurred by Buyers in connection with any
such event. It is the intent of Guarantor and Buyers that the obligations and
liabilities hereunder are, subject to the terms of this Guaranty, absolute and
unconditional under any and all circumstances and that until the Guaranteed
Obligations are fully and finally paid or this Guaranty terminates in
accordance with its terms, the obligations and liabilities of Guarantor
hereunder shall not be discharged or released, in whole or in part, by any act
or occurrence that might, but for the provisions of this Guaranty, be deemed a
legal or equitable discharge or release of Guarantor.

 



 

10. _NO DUPLICATION_.

 



 

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Guaranty, in no event shall (a)
Buyers be entitled to recover any amounts hereunder with respect to any
Guaranteed Obligation to the extent Buyers,

 



      
 

 



 

their Affiliates or any Buyer Indemnified Party has recovered such amounts
under the Agreement or any Transaction Document or (b) there be any
duplication of payments or recovery by Buyers, their Affiliates or any Buyer
Indemnified Party under different provisions of this Guaranty, or under any
provision of this Guaranty and any provision of the Agreement or any
Transaction Document.

 



 

11. _TERMINATION_.

 



 

This Guaranty and Guarantors obligations hereunder will terminate
automatically and immediately upon termination of the Agreement except to the
extent there is liability of Obligors under Section 10.2 of the Agreement, but
otherwise shall stay in effect until all Guaranteed Obligations have been
satisfied; provided that notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that
Buyers, any of their Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives
asserts, in oral argument before any Governmental Authority or in writing, in
any action, suit, proceeding, hearing or litigation that any of the provisions
of _Section 2_ or _Section 13(b)_ hereof are illegal, invalid or
unenforceable in whole or in part, then this Guaranty shall immediately
terminate and the obligations and liability of the Guarantor under this
Guaranty shall terminate and be of no further force and effect. The date that
this Guaranty terminates is referred to herein as the " _Termination Date_."
Upon any termination of this Guaranty, and from and after the Termination
Date, the Guarantor shall have no further obligation or liability under this
Guaranty or in respect of any Guaranteed Obligations, provided that
notwithstanding any termination of this Guaranty, any defenses or limitations
on liability available to the Guarantor (but not, for the avoidance of doubt,
any obligation or liability of Guarantor) under the terms of this Guaranty
shall survive any termination of this Guaranty and the Termination Date.

 



      
 

 



 

12. _NOTICE_. Any Payment Demand, notice, request, instruction, correspondence or other document to be given hereunder (collectively, " _Notice_ ") by Buyers to Guarantor, or by Guarantor to Buyers, as applicable, shall be in writing and may be delivered either by (a) U.S. certified mail with postage prepaid and return receipt requested, or (b) recognized nationwide courier service with delivery receipt requested, in either case to be delivered to the following address (or to such other U.S. address as may be specified via Notice provided by Guarantor or Buyers, as applicable, to the other in accordance with the requirements of this _Section 12_):

THIS CONSERVATION EASEMENT DEED (" _Conservation Easement_ ") is made as of
the day of , 2013, by Alta
Windpower Developent, LLC (" _Grantor_ "), in favor of Wildlife Heritage
Foundation (" _Grantee_ "), with reference to the following facts:

A. Grantor is the sole owner in fee simple of certain real property containing
approximately 37 acres, located in the County of Kern, State of California,
designated Assessors Parcel Numbers 237-064-45 and 237-064-46 ("
_Conservation Area_ "). The Conservation Area is legally described and
depicted in **Exhibit A** attached to this Conservation Easement and
incorporated in it by this reference.

 



 

B. The Conservation Area possesses wildlife and habitat values of great
importance to Grantee, the people of the State of California, and the people
of the United States. The Conservation Area provides high quality natural
habitat for the Bakersfield cactus ( _Opuntia basilaris_ var. _treleasei_ ).
Individually and collectively, these wildlife and habitat values comprise the
"Conservation Values" of the Conservation Area.

 



 

C. This Conservation Easement provides mitigation for certain impacts of the
Alta-Oak Creek Mojave Wind Project located in the County of Kern, State of
California, pursuant to California Endangered Species Act Incidental Take
Permit No. 2081-2010-011-04, dated May 13, 2010 (the " _ITP_ ").

 



 

D. As authorized by the ITP, certain wind energy project activities will take
place within the Conservation Area. Where properly managed, operation of a
wind energy project within the Conservation Area is consistent with the
purpose of this Conservation Easement and the preservation of the Conservation
Values of the Conservation Area. A management plan entitled the _Long-term
Management Plan for the Alta Oak Creek Mojave Mitigation Conservation Area_ ,
dated (the " _Conservation Area Plan_ "), attached as **Exhibit
B**, has been prepared for the Conservation Area and is incorporated by
reference herein. The Conservation Area Plan sets forth the wind energy
project activities, including without limitation, the construction, operation,
maintenance, reconstruction and repowering of wind energy project facilities,
that are permitted in perpetuity within the Conservation Area (" _Permitted
Project Activities_ ").

 



 

E. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife ("CDFW") has jurisdiction
over the

      
 

 



 

conservation, protection, and management of fish, wildlife, native plants and
the habitat necessary for biologically sustainable populations of these
species pursuant to California Fish and Wildlife Code Section 1802.

 



 

F. Grantee is authorized to hold this conservation easement pursuant to
California Civil Code Section 815.3 and Government Code Section 65965.
Specifically, Grantee is (i) a tax-exempt nonprofit organization qualified
under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and
qualified to do business in California; (ii) a "qualified organization" as
defined in section 170(h)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code; and (iii) an
organization which has as its primary and principal purpose and activity the
protection and preservation of natural lands or resources in its natural,
scenic, agricultural, forested, or open space condition or use.

 



 

G. The Conservation Area is currently improved with multiple Wind Turbine
Generators ("wind turbines") and related improvements and is subject to
certain leases that grant certain lessees the right to access and use the
Conservation Area in accordance with the leases that are described in the
Property Assessment and Warranty (as defined in Section 14(j) below) (the "
_Leases_ ") (Exhibit C).

beneficial use upon the Conservation Area, consistent with the purposes of
this Conservation Easement; and

 



      
 

 



 

(e) Except as described in the Conservation Area Plan and authorized by the
Conservation Area Plan and the Reserved Rights, all present and future
development rights appurtenant to, allocated, implied, reserved or inherent in
the Conservation Area; such rights are hereby terminated and extinguished, and
may not be used on or transferred to any portion of the Conservation Area, nor

3. _Prohibited Uses_. Any activity on or use of the Conservation Area inconsistent with the purposes of this Conservation Easement or the Conservation Area Plan is prohibited. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the following uses and activities by Grantor, Grantors agents, and third parties, are expressly prohibited, except that none of the following shall be prohibited uses to the extent such uses are consistent with or reasonably necessary to carry out the provisions of the Conservation Area Plan or to exercise the Reserved Rights:

or other agricultural chemicals; weed abatement activities; incompatible fire
protection activities; and any and all other activities and uses which may

Section 1 are being accomplished, Grantee and its successors and assigns
shall:

 



 

(1) Perform, at a minimum on an annual basis, compliance monitoring
inspections of the Conservation Plan Area; and

 



 

(2) Prepare reports on the results of the compliance monitoring inspections,
and provide these reports to CDFW on an annual basis.

 



 

(b) In the event that the Grantees interest in this easement is held by,
reverts to, or is transferred to the State of California, Section 4(a) shall
not apply.

 



 

5. _Grantor s Duties_. Grantor shall undertake all reasonable actions to prevent the unlawful entry and trespass by persons whose activities may degrade or harm the conservation values of the Conservation Area. In addition, Grantor shall undertake all necessary actions to perfect the rights of Grantee and the Third Party Beneficiary under Section 2 of this Conservation Easement, including but not limited to, Grantees water rights. Grantor shall observe and carry out the obligations of the Grantor under the Conservation Area Plan and shall ensure that the Permitted Project Activities are undertaken in accordance with the Conservation Area Plan. The Permitted Project Activities, undertaken in accordance with the Conservation Area Plan, are consistent with the purposes of this Conservation Easement and the conservation values of the Conservation Area.

 



 

6. _Grantor s Reserved Rights_. Grantor reserves to itself, and to its personal representatives, heirs, successors, and assigns, all rights accruing from its ownership of the Conservation Area, including the right to engage in or to permit or invite others to engage in all uses of the Conservation Area that are not prohibited or limited by, and are consistent with the purposes of, this Conservation Easement. These rights also include, but are not limited to, the right to operate or allow others to operate wind turbine generators and associated improvements on the Conservation Area in accordance with Section 6.1 and the Leases, to the extent consistent with the Conservation Area Plan. Associated improvements include, but are not limited to, utility poles and lines, storage areas and facilities, administrative facilities and other improvements described in the Leases. The rights reserved to Grantor pursuant to this Section 6 (including subsection 6.1) are sometimes referred to herein as the "Reserved Rights."

 



 

6.1 _Wind Turbine Generator Reserved Rights_. Grantor reserves to itself,
personal representatives, heirs, successors, grantees, assigns and lessees, to
the extent consistent with the Conservation Area Plan, the right to (i)
operate wind turbine generators and associated

 



      
 

 



 

improvements currently existing on the Conservation Plan Area in accordance
with the Leases; (ii) repair, maintain, remove and/or replace existing wind
turbine generators and related improvements; (iii) exercise all rights
permitted by the Leases; (iv) renew and/or extend existing Leases or enter
into new leases or easements related to the operation of wind turbine
generators and related improvements, provided such renewals, extensions, or
new leases or easements are on the same property or substantially afford the
same rights of use of the property; (v) construct new wind turbine generators
and related improvements provided that the overall square footage of land
occupied by the wind turbine generators, whether operational or not, and
related improvements is not increased above the square footage permitted by
the ITP; (vi) all air and/or the free flow of wind necessary or useful to
operate or maintain current and future wind turbine generators.

 



 

7. _Grantee s Remedies_. The Third Party Beneficiary shall have the same rights as Grantee under this section to enforce the terms of this Conservation Easement. If Grantee determines that a violation of the terms of this Conservation Easement has occurred or is threatened, Grantee shall give written notice to Grantor of such violation and demand in writing the cure of such violation. At the time of giving any such notice, Grantee shall provide copies of the notice to the Third Party Beneficiary. If Grantor fails to cure the violation within fifteen (15) days after receipt of written notice and demand from Grantee, or if the cure reasonably requires more than fifteen (15) days to complete and Grantor fails to begin the cure within the fifteen (15)-day period or fails to continue diligently to complete the cure, Grantee may bring an action at law or in equity in a court of competent jurisdiction to enforce the terms of this Conservation Easement, to recover any damages to which Grantee may be entitled for violation of the terms of this Conservation Easement or for any injury to the conservation values of the Conservation Area, to enjoin the violation, _ex parte_ as necessary, by temporary or permanent injunction without the necessity of proving either actual damages or the inadequacy of otherwise available legal remedies, or for other equitable relief, including, but not limited to, the restoration of the Conservation Area to the condition in which it existed prior to any such violation or injury. Without limiting Grantors liability therefor, Grantee may apply any damages recovered to the cost of undertaking any corrective action on the Conservation Area.

 



 

If Grantee, in its sole discretion, determines that circumstances require
immediate action to prevent or mitigate damage to the conservation values of
the Conservation Area, Grantee may pursue its remedies under this Section 7
without prior notice to Grantor or without waiting for the period provided for
cure to expire. Grantees rights under this section apply equally to actual or
threatened violations of the terms of this Conservation Easement. Grantor
agrees that Grantees remedies at law for any violation of the terms of this
Conservation Easement are inadequate and that Grantee shall be entitled to the
injunctive relief described in this section, both prohibitive and mandatory,
in addition to such other relief to which Grantee may be entitled, including
specific performance of the terms of this Conservation Easement, without the
necessity of proving either actual damages or the inadequacy of otherwise
available legal remedies. Grantees remedies described in this section shall
be cumulative and shall be in addition to all remedies now or hereafter
existing at law or in equity, including but not limited to, the remedies set
forth in Civil Code Section 815, _et seq._ , inclusive. The failure of Grantee
to discover a violation or to take immediate legal action shall not bar
Grantee from taking such action at a later time.

 



 

If at any time in the future Grantor or any subsequent transferee uses or
threatens to use the Conservation Area for purposes inconsistent with this
Conservation Easement then, notwithstanding Civil Code Section 815.7, the
California Attorney General or any entity or individual with a justiciable
interest in the preservation of this Conservation Easement has standing as
interested parties in any proceeding affecting this Conservation Easement.

 



      
 

 



 

7.1. _Costs of Enforcement_. Any costs incurred by Grantee or the Third Party
Beneficiary, where it is the prevailing party, in enforcing the terms of this
Conservation Easement against Grantor, including, but not limited to, costs of
suit and attorneys and experts fees, and any costs of restoration
necessitated by Grantors negligence or breach of this Conservation Easement
shall be borne by Grantor.

 



 

7.2. _Discretion of Grantee and Third Party Beneficiary_. Enforcement of the
terms of this Conservation Easement by Grantee or a Third Party Beneficiary
shall be at the discretion of the enforcing party, and any forbearance by
Grantee or a Third Party Beneficiary to exercise its rights under this
Conservation Easement in the event of any breach of any term of this
Conservation Easement shall not be deemed or construed to be a waiver by
Grantee or any Third Party Beneficiary of such term or of any subsequent
breach of the same or any other term of this Conservation Easement or of any
of Grantees rights (or any rights of a Third Party Beneficiary) under this
Conservation Easement. No delay or omission by Grantee or any Third Party
Beneficiary in the exercise of any right or remedy shall impair such right or
remedy or be construed as a waiver.

 



 

7.3. _Acts Beyond Grantor s Control_. Nothing contained in this Conservation
Easement shall be construed to entitle Grantee or a Third Party Beneficiary to
bring any action against Grantor for any injury to or change in the
Conservation Area resulting from (i) any natural cause beyond Grantors
control, including, without limitation, fire not caused by Grantor, flood,
storm, and earth movement, or any prudent action taken by Grantor under
emergency conditions to prevent, abate, or mitigate significant injury to the
Conservation Area resulting from such causes; or (ii) acts by Grantee or its
employees or a Third Party Beneficiary or its employees.

 



 

7.4. _Third Party Beneficiary Right of Enforcement_. All rights and remedies
conveyed to Grantee under this Conservation Easement Deed shall extend to and
are enforceable by the Third Party Beneficiary. These rights are in addition
to, and do not limit, the rights of enforcement under the ITP.

 



 

8. _Access_. This Conservation Easement does not convey a general right of access to the public.

 



 

9. _Costs and Liabilities_. Grantor retains all responsibilities and shall bear all costs and liabilities of any kind related to the ownership, operation, upkeep, and maintenance of the Conservation Area. Grantor agrees that neither Grantee nor the Third Party Beneficiary shall have any duty or responsibility for the operation, upkeep or maintenance of the Conservation Area, the monitoring of hazardous conditions thereon, or the protection of Grantor, the public or any third parties from risks relating to conditions on the Conservation Area. Grantor remains solely responsible for obtaining any applicable governmental permits and approvals for any activity or use permitted by this Conservation Easement, and any activity or use shall be undertaken in accordance with all applicable federal, state, local and administrative agency statutes, ordinances, rules, regulations, orders and requirements.

 



 

9.1. _Taxes; No Liens_. Grantor shall pay before delinquency all taxes,
assessments, fees, and charges of whatever description levied on or assessed
against the Conservation Area by competent authority (collectively " _taxes_
"), including any taxes imposed upon, or incurred as a result of, this
Conservation Easement, and shall furnish Grantee and CDFW with satisfactory
evidence of payment upon request. Grantor shall keep the Conservation Area
free from any liens, including those arising out of any obligations incurred
by Grantor for any labor or materials furnished or alleged to have been
furnished to or for Grantor at or for use on the Conservation Area.

 



      
 

 



 

9.2. _Hold Harmless_. Grantor shall hold harmless, protect and indemnify
Grantee and its directors, officers, employees, agents, contractors, and
representatives and the heirs, personal representatives, successors and
assigns of each of them (each a " _Grantee Indemnified Party_ " and,
collectively, " _Grantee s Indemnified Parties_") and the Third Party
Beneficiary and its respective directors, officers, employees, agents,
contractors, and representatives, and the heirs, personal representatives,
successors and assigns of each of them (each a " _Third Party Beneficiary
Indemnified Party_ " and, collectively, " _Third Party Beneficiary Indemnified
Parties_ ") from and against any and all liabilities, penalties, costs,
losses, damages, expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys fees and experts fees), causes of action, claims, demands, orders,
liens or judgments (each a " _Claim_ " and, collectively, " _Claims_ "),
arising from or in any way connected with: (1) injury to or the death of any
person, or physical damage to any property, resulting from any act, omission,
condition, or other matter related to or occurring on or about the
Conservation Area, regardless of cause, except that (a) this indemnification
shall be inapplicable to Grantees Indemnified Parties with respect to any
Claim due solely to the negligence of Grantee or any of its employees and (b)
this indemnification shall be inapplicable to Third Party Beneficiary
Indemnified Parties with respect to any Claim due solely to the negligence of
a Third Party Beneficiary or any of its employees; (2) the obligations
specified in Sections 4, 9, and 9.1; and (3) the existence or administration
of this Conservation Easement. If any action or proceeding is brought against
any of the Third Party Beneficiary Indemnified Parties by reason of any such
Claim, Grantor shall, at the election of and upon written notice from the
Third Party Beneficiary Indemnified Party, defend such action or proceeding by
counsel reasonably acceptable to the Third Party Beneficiary Indemnified Party
or reimburse the Third Party Indemnified Party for all charges incurred for
services of the California Attorney General in defending the action or
proceeding.

 



 

9.3. _Extinguishment_. If circumstances arise in the future that render the
purposes of this Conservation Easement impossible to accomplish, this
Conservation Easement can only be terminated or extinguished, in whole or in
part, by judicial proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction.

 



 

9.4. _Condemnation_. The purposes of this Conservation Easement are presumed
to be the best and most necessary public use as defined at Code of Civil
Procedure Section 1240.680 notwithstanding Code of Civil Procedure Sections
1240.690 and 1240.700.

 



 

10. _Transfer of Easement_. This Conservation Easement is transferable by Grantee, but Grantee may assign this Conservation Easement only to CDFW or another entity or organization authorized to acquire and hold conservation easements pursuant to Civil Code Section 815.3 (or any successor provision then applicable) or the laws of the United States. Grantee shall require the assignee to record the assignment in the county where the Conservation Area is located.

 



 

11. _Transfer of Conservation Area_. Grantor agrees to incorporate the terms of this Conservation Easement by reference in any deed or other legal instrument by which Grantor divests itself of any interest in all or any portion of the Conservation Area, including, without limitation, a leasehold interest. Grantor further agrees to give written notice to Grantee and the Third Party Beneficiary of the intent to transfer any interest at least thirty (30) days prior to the date of such transfer. Grantee or Third Party Beneficiary shall have the right to prevent subsequent transfers in which prospective subsequent claimants or transferees are not given notice of the covenants, terms, conditions and restrictions of this Conservation Easement. The failure of Grantor, Grantee or Third Party Beneficiary to perform any act provided in this section shall not impair the validity of this Conservation Easement or limit its enforceability in any way.

 



      
 

 



 

12. _Notices_. Any notice, demand, request, consent, approval, or communication that any party desires or is required to give to the other parties shall be in writing and be served personally or sent by recognized overnight courier that guarantees next-day delivery or by first class mail, postage fully prepaid, addressed as follows:

Conservation Area is legally described and depicted in **Exhibit A** attached
to this Conservation Easement and incorporated in it by this reference.

 



 

B. The Conservation Area possesses wildlife and habitat values of great
importance to Grantee, the people of the State of California, and the people

Project Activities_ ").

      
 

 



 

E. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife ("CDFW") has jurisdiction
over the conservation, protection, and management of fish, wildlife, native
plants and the habitat necessary for biologically sustainable populations of
these species pursuant to California Fish and Wildlife Code Section 1802.

 



 

F. Grantee is authorized to hold this conservation easement pursuant to
California Civil Code Section 815.3 and Government Code Section 65965.
Specifically, Grantee is (i) a tax-exempt nonprofit organization qualified
under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and
qualified to do business in California; (ii) a "qualified organization" as
defined in section 170(h)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code; and (iii) an
organization which has as its primary and principal purpose and activity the
protection and preservation of natural lands or resources in its natural,
scenic, agricultural, forested, or open space condition or use.

 



 

G. The Conservation Area is currently improved with multiple Wind Turbine
Generators ("wind turbines") and related improvements and is subject to
certain leases that grant certain lessees the right to access and use the
Conservation Area in accordance with the leases that are described in the
Property Assessment and Warranty (as defined in Section 14(j) below) (the "
_Leases_ ") (Exhibit C).

(c) To prevent any activity on or use of the Conservation Area that is
inconsistent with the purposes of this Conservation Easement and to require
the restoration of such areas or features of the Conservation Area that may be
damaged by any act, failure to act, or any use or activity that is
inconsistent with the purposes of this Conservation Easement;

 



 

(d) To require that all mineral, air and water rights as Grantee deems

(e) Except as described in the Conservation Area Plan and authorized by the
Conservation Area Plan and the Reserved Rights, all present and future
development rights appurtenant to, allocated, implied, reserved or inherent in
the Conservation Area; such rights are hereby terminated and extinguished, and
may not be used on or transferred to any portion of the Conservation Area, nor
any other property adjacent or otherwise.

 



 

3. _Prohibited Uses_. Any activity on or use of the Conservation Area inconsistent with the purposes of this Conservation Easement or the Conservation Area Plan is prohibited. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the following uses and activities by Grantor, Grantors agents, and third parties, are expressly prohibited, except that none of the following shall be prohibited uses to the extent such uses are consistent with or reasonably necessary to carry out the provisions of the Conservation Area Plan or to exercise the Reserved Rights:

4. _Grantee s Duties_.

 



 

(a) To ensure that the purposes of this Conservation Easement as described in
Section 1 are being accomplished, Grantee and its successors and assigns
shall:

 



 

(1) Perform, at a minimum on an annual basis, compliance monitoring
inspections of the Conservation Plan Area; and

 



 

(2) Prepare reports on the results of the compliance monitoring inspections,
and provide these reports to CDFW on an annual basis.

 



 

(b) In the event that the Grantees interest in this easement is held by,
reverts to, or is transferred to the State of California, Section 4(a) shall
not apply.

 



 

5. _Grantor s Duties_. Grantor shall undertake all reasonable actions to prevent the unlawful entry and trespass by persons whose activities may degrade or harm the conservation values of the Conservation Area. In addition, Grantor shall undertake all necessary actions to perfect the rights of Grantee and the Third Party Beneficiary under Section 2 of this Conservation Easement, including but not limited to, Grantees water rights. Grantor shall observe and carry out the obligations of the Grantor under the Conservation Area Plan and shall ensure that the Permitted Project Activities are undertaken in accordance with the Conservation Area Plan. The Permitted Project Activities, undertaken in accordance with the Conservation Area Plan, are consistent with the purposes of this Conservation Easement and the conservation values of the Conservation Area.

 



 

6. _Grantor s Reserved Rights_. Grantor reserves to itself, and to its personal representatives, heirs, successors, and assigns, all rights accruing from its ownership of the Conservation Area, including the right to engage in or to permit or invite others to engage in all uses of the Conservation Area that are not prohibited or limited by, and are consistent with the purposes of, this Conservation Easement. These rights also include, but are not limited to, the right to operate or allow others to operate wind turbine generators and associated improvements on the Conservation Area in accordance with Section 6.1 and the Leases, to the extent consistent with the Conservation Area Plan. Associated improvements include, but are not limited to, utility poles and lines, storage areas and facilities, administrative facilities and other improvements described in the Leases. The rights reserved to Grantor pursuant to this Section 6 (including subsection 6.1) are sometimes referred to herein as the "Reserved Rights."

 



 

6.1 _Wind Turbine Generator Reserved Rights_. Grantor reserves to itself,
personal representatives, heirs, successors, grantees, assigns and lessees, to
the extent consistent with the Conservation Area Plan, the right to (i)
operate wind turbine generators and associated

 



      
 

 



 

improvements currently existing on the Conservation Plan Area in accordance
with the Leases; (ii) repair, maintain, remove and/or replace existing wind
turbine generators and related improvements; (iii) exercise all rights
permitted by the Leases; (iv) renew and/or extend existing Leases or enter
into new leases or easements related to the operation of wind turbine
generators and related improvements, provided such renewals, extensions, or
new leases or easements are on the same property or substantially afford the
same rights of use of the property; (v) construct new wind turbine generators
and related improvements provided that the overall square footage of land
occupied by the wind turbine generators, whether operational or not, and
related improvements is not increased above the square footage permitted by
the ITP; (vi) all air and/or the free flow of wind necessary or useful to
operate or maintain current and future wind turbine generators.

 



 

7. _Grantee s Remedies_. The Third Party Beneficiary shall have the same rights as Grantee under this section to enforce the terms of this Conservation Easement. If Grantee determines that a violation of the terms of this Conservation Easement has occurred or is threatened, Grantee shall give written notice to Grantor of such violation and demand in writing the cure of such violation. At the time of giving any such notice, Grantee shall provide copies of the notice to the Third Party Beneficiary. If Grantor fails to cure the violation within fifteen (15) days after receipt of written notice and demand from Grantee, or if the cure reasonably requires more than fifteen (15) days to complete and Grantor fails to begin the cure within the fifteen (15)-day period or fails to continue diligently to complete the cure, Grantee may bring an action at law or in equity in a court of competent jurisdiction to enforce the terms of this Conservation Easement, to recover any damages to which Grantee may be entitled for violation of the terms of this Conservation Easement or for any injury to the conservation values of the Conservation Area, to enjoin the violation, _ex parte_ as necessary, by temporary or permanent injunction without the necessity of proving either actual damages or the inadequacy of otherwise available legal remedies, or for other equitable relief, including, but not limited to, the restoration of the Conservation Area to the condition in which it existed prior to any such violation or injury. Without limiting Grantors liability therefor, Grantee may apply any damages recovered to the cost of undertaking any corrective action on the Conservation Area.

 



 

If Grantee, in its sole discretion, determines that circumstances require
immediate action to prevent or mitigate damage to the conservation values of
the Conservation Area, Grantee may pursue its remedies under this Section 7
without prior notice to Grantor or without waiting for the period provided for
cure to expire. Grantees rights under this section apply equally to actual or
threatened violations of the terms of this Conservation Easement. Grantor
agrees that Grantees remedies at law for any violation of the terms of this
Conservation Easement are inadequate and that Grantee shall be entitled to the
injunctive relief described in this section, both prohibitive and mandatory,
in addition to such other relief to which Grantee may be entitled, including
specific performance of the terms of this Conservation Easement, without the
necessity of proving either actual damages or the inadequacy of otherwise
available legal remedies. Grantees remedies described in this section shall
be cumulative and shall be in addition to all remedies now or hereafter
existing at law or in equity, including but not limited to, the remedies set
forth in Civil Code Section 815, _et seq._ , inclusive. The failure of Grantee
to discover a violation or to take immediate legal action shall not bar
Grantee from taking such action at a later time.

 



 

If at any time in the future Grantor or any subsequent transferee uses or
threatens to use the Conservation Area for purposes inconsistent with this
Conservation Easement then, notwithstanding Civil Code Section 815.7, the
California Attorney General or any entity or individual with a justiciable
interest in the preservation of this Conservation Easement has standing as
interested parties in any proceeding affecting this Conservation Easement.

 



      
 

 



 

7.1. _Costs of Enforcement_. Any costs incurred by Grantee or the Third Party
Beneficiary, where it is the prevailing party, in enforcing the terms of this
Conservation Easement against Grantor, including, but not limited to, costs of
suit and attorneys and experts fees, and any costs of restoration
necessitated by Grantors negligence or breach of this Conservation Easement
shall be borne by Grantor.

 



 

7.2. _Discretion of Grantee and Third Party Beneficiary_. Enforcement of the
terms of this Conservation Easement by Grantee or a Third Party Beneficiary
shall be at the discretion of the enforcing party, and any forbearance by
Grantee or a Third Party Beneficiary to exercise its rights under this
Conservation Easement in the event of any breach of any term of this
Conservation Easement shall not be deemed or construed to be a waiver by
Grantee or any Third Party Beneficiary of such term or of any subsequent
breach of the same or any other term of this Conservation Easement or of any
of Grantees rights (or any rights of a Third Party Beneficiary) under this
Conservation Easement. No delay or omission by Grantee or any Third Party
Beneficiary in the exercise of any right or remedy shall impair such right or
remedy or be construed as a waiver.

 



 

7.3. _Acts Beyond Grantor s Control_. Nothing contained in this Conservation
Easement shall be construed to entitle Grantee or a Third Party Beneficiary to
bring any action against Grantor for any injury to or change in the
Conservation Area resulting from (i) any natural cause beyond Grantors
control, including, without limitation, fire not caused by Grantor, flood,
storm, and earth movement, or any prudent action taken by Grantor under
emergency conditions to prevent, abate, or mitigate significant injury to the
Conservation Area resulting from such causes; or (ii) acts by Grantee or its
employees or a Third Party Beneficiary or its employees.

 



 

7.4. _Third Party Beneficiary Right of Enforcement_. All rights and remedies
conveyed to Grantee under this Conservation Easement Deed shall extend to and
are enforceable by the Third Party Beneficiary. These rights are in addition
to, and do not limit, the rights of enforcement under the ITP.

 



 

8. _Access_. This Conservation Easement does not convey a general right of access to the public.

 



 

9. _Costs and Liabilities_. Grantor retains all responsibilities and shall bear all costs and liabilities of any kind related to the ownership, operation, upkeep, and maintenance of the Conservation Area. Grantor agrees that neither Grantee nor the Third Party Beneficiary shall have any duty or responsibility for the operation, upkeep or maintenance of the Conservation Area, the monitoring of hazardous conditions thereon, or the protection of Grantor, the public or any third parties from risks relating to conditions on the Conservation Area. Grantor remains solely responsible for obtaining any applicable governmental permits and approvals for any activity or use permitted by this Conservation Easement, and any activity or use shall be undertaken in accordance with all applicable federal, state, local and administrative agency statutes, ordinances, rules, regulations, orders and requirements.

 



 

9.1. _Taxes; No Liens_. Grantor shall pay before delinquency all taxes,
assessments, fees, and charges of whatever description levied on or assessed
against the Conservation Area by competent authority (collectively " _taxes_
"), including any taxes imposed upon, or incurred as a result of, this
Conservation Easement, and shall furnish Grantee and CDFW with satisfactory
evidence of payment upon request. Grantor shall keep the Conservation Area
free from any liens, including those arising out of any obligations incurred
by Grantor for any labor or materials furnished or alleged to have been
furnished to or for Grantor at or for use on the Conservation Area.

 



      
 

 



 

9.2. _Hold Harmless_. Grantor shall hold harmless, protect and indemnify
Grantee and its directors, officers, employees, agents, contractors, and
representatives and the heirs, personal representatives, successors and
assigns of each of them (each a " _Grantee Indemnified Party_ " and,
collectively, " _Grantee s Indemnified Parties_") and the Third Party
Beneficiary and its respective directors, officers, employees, agents,
contractors, and representatives, and the heirs, personal representatives,
successors and assigns of each of them (each a " _Third Party Beneficiary
Indemnified Party_ " and, collectively, " _Third Party Beneficiary Indemnified
Parties_ ") from and against any and all liabilities, penalties, costs,
losses, damages, expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys fees and experts fees), causes of action, claims, demands, orders,
liens or judgments (each a " _Claim_ " and, collectively, " _Claims_ "),
arising from or in any way connected with: (1) injury to or the death of any
person, or physical damage to any property, resulting from any act, omission,
condition, or other matter related to or occurring on or about the
Conservation Area, regardless of cause, except that (a) this indemnification
shall be inapplicable to Grantees Indemnified Parties with respect to any
Claim due solely to the negligence of Grantee or any of its employees and (b)
this indemnification shall be inapplicable to Third Party Beneficiary
Indemnified Parties with respect to any Claim due solely to the negligence of
a Third Party Beneficiary or any of its employees; (2) the obligations
specified in Sections 4, 9, and 9.1; and (3) the existence or administration
of this Conservation Easement. If any action or proceeding is brought against
any of the Third Party Beneficiary Indemnified Parties by reason of any such
Claim, Grantor shall, at the election of and upon written notice from the
Third Party Beneficiary Indemnified Party, defend such action or proceeding by
counsel reasonably acceptable to the Third Party Beneficiary Indemnified Party
or reimburse the Third Party Indemnified Party for all charges incurred for
services of the California Attorney General in defending the action or
proceeding.

 



 

9.3. _Extinguishment_. If circumstances arise in the future that render the
purposes of this Conservation Easement impossible to accomplish, this
Conservation Easement can only be terminated or extinguished, in whole or in
part, by judicial proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction.

 



 

9.4. _Condemnation_. The purposes of this Conservation Easement are presumed
to be the best and most necessary public use as defined at Code of Civil
Procedure Section 1240.680 notwithstanding Code of Civil Procedure Sections
1240.690 and 1240.700.

 



 

10. _Transfer of Easement_. This Conservation Easement is transferable by Grantee, but Grantee may assign this Conservation Easement only to CDFW or another entity or organization authorized to acquire and hold conservation easements pursuant to Civil Code Section 815.3 (or any successor provision then applicable) or the laws of the United States. Grantee shall require the assignee to record the assignment in the county where the Conservation Area is located.

 



 

11. _Transfer of Conservation Area_. Grantor agrees to incorporate the terms of this Conservation Easement by reference in any deed or other legal instrument by which Grantor divests itself of any interest in all or any portion of the Conservation Area, including, without limitation, a leasehold interest. Grantor further agrees to give written notice to Grantee and the Third Party Beneficiary of the intent to transfer any interest at least thirty (30) days prior to the date of such transfer. Grantee or Third Party Beneficiary shall have the right to prevent subsequent transfers in which prospective subsequent claimants or transferees are not given notice of the covenants, terms, conditions and restrictions of this Conservation Easement. The failure of Grantor, Grantee or Third Party Beneficiary to perform any act provided in this section shall not impair the validity of this Conservation Easement or limit its enforceability in any way.

 



      
 

 



 

12. _Notices_. Any notice, demand, request, consent, approval, or communication that any party desires or is required to give to the other parties shall be in writing and be served personally or sent by recognized overnight courier that guarantees next-day delivery or by first class mail, postage fully prepaid, addressed as follows:

Any such amendment shall be consistent with the purposes of this Conservation Easement and California law governing conservation easements and shall not affect its perpetual duration. Any such amendment shall be recorded in the official records of Kern County, State of California.

 



 

14. _General Provisions_.

Easement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California,
disregarding the conflicts of law principles of such state.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Liberal Construction_. Despite any general rule of construction to the
contrary, this Conservation Easement shall be liberally construed to effect
the purposes of this Conservation Easement and the policy and purpose of Civil
Code Section 815, _et seq_. If any provision in this instrument is found to be
ambiguous, an interpretation consistent with the purposes of this Conservation
Easement that would render the provision valid shall be favored over any
interpretation that would render it invalid.

 



 

(c) _Severability_. If a court of competent jurisdiction voids or invalidates
on its face any provision of this Conservation Easement, such action shall not
affect the remainder of this Conservation Easement. If a court of competent
jurisdiction voids or invalidates the application of any provision of this

affect the application of the provision to other persons or circumstances.

 



 

(d) _Entire Agreement_. This instrument sets forth the entire agreement of the
parties with respect to the Conservation Easement and supersedes all prior
discussions, negotiations, understandings, or agreements relating to the
Conservation Easement. No alteration or variation of this instrument shall be
valid or binding unless contained in an amendment in accordance with Section
13.

 



 

(e) _No Forfeiture_. Nothing contained herein will result in a forfeiture or
reversion of Grantors title in any respect.

 



 

(f) _Successors_. The covenants, terms, conditions, and restrictions of this
Conservation Easement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the
parties hereto and their respective personal representatives, heirs,
successors, and assigns and shall constitute a servitude running in perpetuity
with the Conservation Area.

 



 

(g) _Termination of Rights and Obligations_. A partys rights and obligations
under this Conservation Easement terminate upon transfer of the partys
interest in the Conservation Easement or Conservation Area, except that
liability for acts or omissions occurring prior to transfer shall survive
transfer.

 



 

(h) _Captions_. The captions in this instrument have been inserted solely for
convenience of reference and are not a part of this instrument and shall have
no effect upon its construction or interpretation.

 



 

(i) _No Hazardous Materials Liability_. Grantor represents and warrants that
it has no knowledge or notice of any Hazardous Materials (defined below) or
underground storage tanks existing, generated, treated, stored, used,
released, disposed of, deposited or abandoned in, on, under, or from the
Conservation Area, or transported to or from or affecting the Conservation
Area. Without limiting the obligations of Grantor under Section 9.2, Grantor
hereby releases and agrees to indemnify, protect and hold harmless the Grantee
Indemnified Parties and the Third Party Beneficiary Indemnified Parties (each
as defined in Section 9.2) from and against any and all Claims (as defined in
Section 9.2) arising from or connected with any Hazardous Materials or
underground storage tanks present, alleged to be present, or otherwise
associated with the Conservation Area at any time, except that (I) this
indemnification shall be inapplicable to the Grantee Indemnified Parties with
respect to any Hazardous Materials placed, disposed or released by Grantee,
its employees or agents and (II) this indemnification shall be inapplicable to
the Third Party Beneficiary Indemnified Parties with respect to any Hazardous
Materials placed, disposed or released by a Third Party Beneficiary, its
employees or agents. This release and indemnification includes, without
limitation, Claims for (i) injury to or death of any person or physical damage
to any property; and

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) the violation or alleged violation of, or other failure to comply with,
any Environmental Laws (defined below). If any action or proceeding is brought
against any of the Third Party Beneficiary Indemnified Parties by reason of
any such Claim, Grantor shall, at the election of and upon written notice from
the applicable Third Party Beneficiary Indemnified Party, defend such action
or proceeding by counsel reasonably acceptable to the Third Party Beneficiary
Indemnified Party or reimburse the Third Party Beneficiary Indemnified Party
for all charges incurred for services of the California Attorney General in
defending the action or proceeding.

 



 

Despite any contrary provision of this Conservation Easement Deed, the parties
do not intend this Conservation Easement to be, and this Conservation Easement
shall not be, construed such that it creates in or gives to Grantee or to any
Third Party Beneficiary any of the following:

 



 

(1) The obligations or liability of an "owner" or "operator," as those terms
are defined and used in Environmental Laws (defined below), including, without
limitation, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act of 1980, as amended (42 U.S.C. Section 9601 _et seq._ ;
hereinafter, " _CERCLA_ "); or

 



 

(2) The obligations or liabilities of a person described in 42 U.S.C. Section
9607(a)(3) or (4); or

 



 

(3) The obligations of a responsible person under any applicable Environmental

(5) Any control over Grantors ability to investigate, remove, remediate or
otherwise clean up any Hazardous Materials associated with the Conservation
Area.

 



 

The term " _Hazardous Materials_ " includes, without limitation, (a) material
that is flammable, explosive or radioactive; (b) petroleum products, including
by-products and fractions thereof; and (c) hazardous materials, hazardous
wastes, hazardous or toxic substances, or related materials defined in CERCLA,
the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (42 U.S.C. Section 6901 _et
seq._ ; hereinafter " _RCRA_ "); the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act

hereinafter " _HCL_ "); the Carpenter-Presley-Tanner Hazardous Substance
Account Act (California Health and Safety Code Section 25300 _et seq._ ;

not grant any additional easements, rights of way or other interests in the
Conservation Area (other than a security interest that is subordinate to this
Conservation Easement), or grant or otherwise abandon or relinquish any water
agreement relating to the Conservation Area, without first obtaining the
written consent of Grantee and Third Party Beneficiary. Grantee or Third Party
Beneficiary may withhold such consent if it determines that the proposed
interest or transfer is inconsistent with the purposes of this Conservation
Easement or will impair or interfere with the conservation values of the
Conservation Area. This Section 14(k) shall not prohibit transfer of a fee or
leasehold interest in the Conservation Area that is subject to this
Conservation Easement and complies with Section 11.

 



 

(l) _Recording_. Grantee shall record this Conservation Easement in the
Official Records of Kern County, California, and may re-record it at any time
as Grantee deems necessary to preserve its rights in this Conservation
Easement.

is third party beneficiary of this Conservation Easement with the right of
access to the Conservation Area and the right to enforce all of the
obligations of Grantor including, but not limited to, Grantors obligations

Conservation Easement.

undivided 1/5 interest (" _Grantor_ "), in favor of Wildlife Heritage
Foundation (" _Grantee_ "), with reference to the following facts:

 



 

 _R E C I T A L S_

 



 

A. Grantor is the sole owner in fee simple of certain real property containing
approximately 37 acres, located in the County of Kern, State of California,
designated Assessors Parcel Number 237-042-03 (" _Conservation Area_ "). The
Conservation Area is legally described and depicted in **Exhibit A** attached
to this Conservation Easement and incorporated in it by this reference.

 



 

B. The Conservation Area possesses wildlife and habitat values of great
importance to Grantee, the people of the State of California, and the people
of the United States. The Conservation Area provides high quality natural
habitat for the Bakersfield cactus ( _Opuntia basilaris_ var. _treleasei_ ).
Individually and collectively, these wildlife and habitat values comprise the
"Conservation Values" of the Conservation Area.

      
 

 



 

C. This Conservation Easement provides mitigation for certain impacts of the
Alta-Oak Creek Mojave Wind Project located in the County of Kern, State of
California, pursuant to California Endangered Species Act Incidental Take
Permit No. 2081-2010-011-04, dated May 13, 2010 (the " _ITP_ ").

 



 

D. As authorized by the ITP, certain wind energy project activities will take
place within the Conservation Area. Where properly managed, operation of a
wind energy project within the Conservation Area is consistent with the
purpose of this Conservation Easement and the preservation of the Conservation
Values of the Conservation Area. A management plan entitled the _Long-term
Management Plan for the Alta Oak Creek Mojave Mitigation Conservation Area_ ,
dated (the " _Conservation Area Plan_ "), attached as **Exhibit
B**, has been prepared for the Conservation Area and is incorporated by
reference herein. The Conservation Area Plan sets forth the wind energy
project activities, including without limitation, the construction, operation,
maintenance, reconstruction and repowering of wind energy project facilities,
that are permitted in perpetuity within the Conservation Area (" _Permitted
Project Activities_ ").

 



 

E. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife ("CDFW") has jurisdiction
over the conservation, protection, and management of fish, wildlife, native
plants and the habitat necessary for biologically sustainable populations of
these species pursuant to California Fish and Wildlife Code Section 1802.

 



 

F. Grantee is authorized to hold this conservation easement pursuant to
California Civil Code Section 815.3 and Government Code Section 65965.
Specifically, Grantee is (i) a tax-exempt nonprofit organization qualified
under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and
qualified to do business in California; (ii) a "qualified organization" as
defined in section 170(h)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code; and (iii) an
organization which has as its primary and principal purpose and activity the
protection and preservation of natural lands or resources in its natural,
scenic, agricultural, forested, or open space condition or use.

 



 

G. The Conservation Area is currently improved with multiple Wind Turbine
Generators ("wind turbines") and related improvements and is subject to
certain leases that grant certain lessees the right to access and use the
Conservation Area in accordance with the leases that are described in the
Property Assessment and Warranty (as defined in Section 14(j) below) (the "
_Leases_ ") (Exhibit C).

Grantor hereby voluntarily grants and conveys to Grantee a conservation
easement in perpetuity over the Conservation Area.

 



 

1. _Purposes_.

Values of the Conservation Area shall remain a part of and be put to
beneficial use upon the Conservation Area, consistent with the purposes of
this Conservation Easement; and

 



 

(e) Except as described in the Conservation Area Plan and authorized by the
Conservation Area Plan and the Reserved Rights, all present and future
development rights appurtenant to, allocated, implied, reserved or inherent in
the Conservation Area; such rights are hereby terminated and extinguished, and
may not be used on or transferred to any portion of the Conservation Area, nor
any other property adjacent or otherwise.

 



 

3. _Prohibited Uses_. Any activity on or use of the Conservation Area inconsistent with the purposes of this Conservation Easement or the Conservation Area Plan is prohibited. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the following uses and activities by Grantor, Grantors agents, and third parties, are expressly prohibited, except that none of the following shall be prohibited uses to the extent such uses are consistent with or reasonably necessary to carry out the provisions of the Conservation Area Plan or to exercise the Reserved Rights:

granting or authorizing surface entry for any of these purposes;

 



 

(k) Altering the surface or general topography of the Conservation Area,
including but not limited to any alterations to habitat, building roads or
trails, paving or otherwise covering the Conservation Plan Area with concrete,
asphalt or any other impervious material;

with, relevant federal, state, or local laws, regulations, or policies
applicable to Grantor, the Conservation Plan Area, or the use or activity in
question.

Section 1 are being accomplished, Grantee and its successors and assigns
shall:

 



 

(1) Perform, at a minimum on an annual basis, compliance monitoring
inspections of the Conservation Plan Area; and

 



 

(2) Prepare reports on the results of the compliance monitoring inspections,
and provide these reports to CDFW on an annual basis.

 



 

(b) In the event that the Grantees interest in this easement is held by,
reverts to, or is transferred to the State of California, Section 4(a) shall
not apply.

 



 

5. _Grantor s Duties_. Grantor shall undertake all reasonable actions to prevent the unlawful entry and trespass by persons whose activities may degrade or harm the conservation values of the Conservation Area. In addition, Grantor shall undertake all necessary actions to perfect the rights of Grantee and the Third Party Beneficiary under Section 2 of this Conservation Easement, including but not limited to, Grantees water rights. Grantor shall observe and carry out the obligations of the Grantor under the Conservation Area Plan and shall ensure that the Permitted Project Activities are undertaken in accordance with the Conservation Area Plan. The Permitted Project Activities, undertaken in accordance with the Conservation Area Plan, are consistent with the purposes of this Conservation Easement and the conservation values of the Conservation Area.

 



      
 

 



 

6. _Grantor s Reserved Rights_. Grantor reserves to itself, and to its personal representatives, heirs, successors, and assigns, all rights accruing from its ownership of the Conservation Area, including the right to engage in or to permit or invite others to engage in all uses of the Conservation Area that are not prohibited or limited by, and are consistent with the purposes of, this Conservation Easement. These rights also include, but are not limited to, the right to operate or allow others to operate wind turbine generators and associated improvements on the Conservation Area in accordance with Section 6.1 and the Leases, to the extent consistent with the Conservation Area Plan. Associated improvements include, but are not limited to, utility poles and lines, storage areas and facilities, administrative facilities and other improvements described in the Leases. The rights reserved to Grantor pursuant to this Section 6 (including subsection 6.1) are sometimes referred to herein as the "Reserved Rights."

 



 

6.1 _Wind Turbine Generator Reserved Rights_. Grantor reserves to itself,
personal representatives, heirs, successors, grantees, assigns and lessees, to
the extent consistent with the Conservation Area Plan, the right to (i)
operate wind turbine generators and associated improvements currently existing
on the Conservation Plan Area in accordance with the Leases; (ii) repair,
maintain, remove and/or replace existing wind turbine generators and related
improvements; (iii) exercise all rights permitted by the Leases; (iv) renew
and/or extend existing Leases or enter into new leases or easements related to
the operation of wind turbine generators and related improvements, provided
such renewals, extensions, or new leases or easements are on the same property
or substantially afford the same rights of use of the property; (v) construct
new wind turbine generators and related improvements provided that the overall
square footage of land occupied by the wind turbine generators, whether
operational or not, and related improvements is not increased above the square
footage permitted by the ITP; (vi) all air and/or the free flow of wind
necessary or useful to operate or maintain current and future wind turbine
generators.

 



 

7. _Grantee s Remedies_. The Third Party Beneficiary shall have the same rights as Grantee under this section to enforce the terms of this Conservation Easement. If Grantee determines that a violation of the terms of this Conservation Easement has occurred or is threatened, Grantee shall give written notice to Grantor of such violation and demand in writing the cure of such violation. At the time of giving any such notice, Grantee shall provide copies of the notice to the Third Party Beneficiary. If Grantor fails to cure the violation within fifteen (15) days after receipt of written notice and demand from Grantee, or if the cure reasonably requires more than fifteen (15) days to complete and Grantor fails to begin the cure within the fifteen (15)-day period or fails to continue diligently to complete the cure, Grantee may bring an action at law or in equity in a court of competent jurisdiction to enforce the terms of this Conservation Easement, to recover any damages to which Grantee may be entitled for violation of the terms of this Conservation Easement or for any injury to the conservation values of the Conservation Area, to enjoin the violation, _ex parte_ as necessary, by temporary or permanent injunction without the necessity of proving either actual damages or the inadequacy of otherwise available legal remedies, or for other equitable relief, including, but not limited to, the restoration of the Conservation Area to the condition in which it existed prior to any such violation or injury. Without limiting Grantors liability therefor, Grantee may apply any damages recovered to the cost of undertaking any corrective action on the Conservation Area.

 



 

If Grantee, in its sole discretion, determines that circumstances require
immediate action to prevent or mitigate damage to the conservation values of
the Conservation Area, Grantee may pursue its remedies under this Section 7
without prior notice to Grantor or without waiting for the period provided for
cure to expire. Grantees rights under this section apply equally to actual or
threatened violations of the terms of this Conservation Easement. Grantor
agrees that Grantees remedies at law for any violation of the terms of this
Conservation Easement are inadequate and that Grantee shall be entitled

 



       
 

 



 

to the injunctive relief described in this section, both prohibitive and
mandatory, in addition to such other relief to which Grantee may be entitled,
including specific performance of the terms of this Conservation Easement,
without the necessity of proving either actual damages or the inadequacy of
otherwise available legal remedies. Grantees remedies described in this
section shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to all remedies now or
hereafter existing at law or in equity, including but not limited to, the
remedies set forth in Civil Code Section 815, _et seq._ , inclusive. The
failure of Grantee to discover a violation or to take immediate legal action
shall not bar Grantee from taking such action at a later time.

 



 

If at any time in the future Grantor or any subsequent transferee uses or
threatens to use the Conservation Area for purposes inconsistent with this
Conservation Easement then, notwithstanding Civil Code Section 815.7, the
California Attorney General or any entity or individual with a justiciable
interest in the preservation of this Conservation Easement has standing as
interested parties in any proceeding affecting this Conservation Easement.

 



 

7.1. _Costs of Enforcement_. Any costs incurred by Grantee or the Third Party
Beneficiary, where it is the prevailing party, in enforcing the terms of this
Conservation Easement against Grantor, including, but not limited to, costs of
suit and attorneys and experts fees, and any costs of restoration
necessitated by Grantors negligence or breach of this Conservation Easement
shall be borne by Grantor.

 



 

7.2. _Discretion of Grantee and Third Party Beneficiary_. Enforcement of the
terms of this Conservation Easement by Grantee or a Third Party Beneficiary
shall be at the discretion of the enforcing party, and any forbearance by
Grantee or a Third Party Beneficiary to exercise its rights under this
Conservation Easement in the event of any breach of any term of this
Conservation Easement shall not be deemed or construed to be a waiver by
Grantee or any Third Party Beneficiary of such term or of any subsequent
breach of the same or any other term of this Conservation Easement or of any
of Grantees rights (or any rights of a Third Party Beneficiary) under this
Conservation Easement. No delay or omission by Grantee or any Third Party
Beneficiary in the exercise of any right or remedy shall impair such right or
remedy or be construed as a waiver.

 



 

7.3. _Acts Beyond Grantor s Control_. Nothing contained in this Conservation
Easement shall be construed to entitle Grantee or a Third Party Beneficiary to
bring any action against Grantor for any injury to or change in the
Conservation Area resulting from (i) any natural cause beyond Grantors
control, including, without limitation, fire not caused by Grantor, flood,
storm, and earth movement, or any prudent action taken by Grantor under
emergency conditions to prevent, abate, or mitigate significant injury to the
Conservation Area resulting from such causes; or (ii) acts by Grantee or its
employees or a Third Party Beneficiary or its employees.

 



 

7.4. _Third Party Beneficiary Right of Enforcement_. All rights and remedies
conveyed to Grantee under this Conservation Easement Deed shall extend to and
are enforceable by the Third Party Beneficiary. These rights are in addition
to, and do not limit, the rights of enforcement under the ITP.

 



 

8. _Access_. This Conservation Easement does not convey a general right of access to the public.

the purposes of this Conservation Easement and the policy and purpose of Civil
Code Section 815, _et seq_. If any provision in this instrument is found to be

parties with respect to the Conservation Easement and supersedes all prior
discussions, negotiations, understandings, or agreements relating to the
Conservation Easement. No alteration or variation of this instrument shall be

(g) _Termination of Rights and Obligations_. A partys rights and obligations
under this Conservation Easement terminate upon transfer of the partys
interest in the Conservation Easement or Conservation Area, except that

the Project Site and shall afford Client a reasonable opportunity to have a
representative of Client present to accompany Provider on the Project Site. If
Provider desires to have any third party accompany it on the Project Site,
Provider shall provide not less than five (5) days notice to Client
specifying the name and affiliation of any such third party. Client may, in
its reasonable discretion, deny access to representatives of the media and
non-governmental organizations. Provider and its guests shall

      
 

 



 

comply with all reasonable safety and environmental policies and protocols
established by Client to govern access to the Project Site.

 



 

Section 3.3 _Electricity, etc_. Client shall provide at its expense
electricity, communication services and other utility-type services required
to maintain the continuous operation of the Permanent Avian Monitoring
Building and the Monitoring Facilities on the Project Site. If this Agreement
is terminated pursuant to Section 1.3(b) or 1.3(c) and Provider continues to
maintain and operate the Monitoring Facilities on the Project Site, then
