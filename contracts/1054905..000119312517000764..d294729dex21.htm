Statement, the Draft Net Receivables Statement, the Draft Net Intercompany
Statement and the Draft Working Capital Statement, the "Draft Statements"), 
---|---|--- 

and deliver the Draft Statements, all relevant calculations, analysis and
other working papers to the Purchaser. In order to enable the preparation and
determination of these documents, the Purchaser shall, and shall procure that
the relevant members of the Purchasers Group shall, ensure that all Books
and Records relating to the EDS Business are kept up-to-date and shall provide
to the Seller and its Representatives such reasonable access to the Books and
Records of each of the EDS Entities and relevant personnel (including the
accountants or other service providers of each of the EDS Entities) as the
Seller or its Representatives shall reasonably require, within working hours
at the place where such Books and Records and the relevant personnel are
located and without disruption to the EDS Business, and shall generally
cooperate with the Sellers Representatives with regard to the preparation and
determination of the Draft Statements.



   6.3 | The Draft Statements will be subject to review by or on behalf of
the Purchaser. Within thirty (30) Business Days after the Purchaser has

well as the adjusted amount according to the Purchaser, all summarised and

relates. The Purchaser shall not propose adjustments to any line items in any
of the Draft Statements to the extent that such adjustments involve a judgment
as to the future earnings potential, prospects or feasibility of the EDS
Business or other aspects of a forward-looking nature, provided that such
judgment is consistent with past practice in determining the relevant line
items in the relevant Draft Statements. 
---|--- 
 



\- 43- accordance with Clause 6.3, the Draft Inventory Statement shall become the
Inventory Statement, the Draft Debt-Like Items Statement shall become
the Debt-Like Items Statement, the Draft Net Receivables Statement shall
become the Net Receivables Statement, the Draft Net Intercompany Statement
shall become the Net Intercompany Statement, the Draft Working Capital
Statement shall become the Working Capital Statement and the Draft Purchase
Price Statement shall become the Purchase Price Statement and each shall be
final and binding on the Purchaser and the Seller for the purposes of this
Agreement. 
---|--- 
 



   6.5 | If the Purchaser delivers an Objections Statement in accordance
with Clause 6.3, then the Seller shall have fifteen (15) Business Days from
its receipt of the Objections Statement to review and respond to
the Objections Statement, and: 
---|--- 



     | 6.5.1 | the Seller may, at its election, designate all or part of
the line items in the Draft Statements that are not included in the Objections
Statement as final and binding on the Parties for all purposes; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 6.5.2 | the Seller and the Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith
with a view to resolving the issues in dispute and accordingly to agree on
each Draft Statement within forty-five (45) Business Days following receipt of
the Objections Statement. If the Purchaser and the Seller reach agreement on
each Draft Statement within such forty-five (45) Business Day period, the
Draft Statements (as adjusted in accordance with the agreement so reached)
shall become the Inventory Statement, the Debt-Like Items Statement, the Net
Receivables Statement, the Net Intercompany Statement, the Working Capital
Statement or the Purchase Price Statement, as the case may be, and shall be
final and binding on the Purchaser and the Seller for the purposes of this
Agreement; and 
---|---|--- 



     | 6.5.3 | no adjustment with respect to any line item included in
the Draft Statements shall be made unless (i) the aggregate adjustment amount
for all items in such Draft Statement agreed or resolved in accordance with
this Agreement exceeds EUR 50,000 (fifty thousand euros), and (ii) the
aggregate net adjustment amount for all Draft Statements exceeds EUR 250,000
(two hundred and fifty thousand euros), in which case the aggregate net
adjustment amount, and not just the excess over EUR 250,000 (two hundred and
fifty thousand euros), shall be adjusted. 
---|---|--- 



   6.6 |

If the Purchaser and the Seller do not reach agreement on the Draft Statements
within such forty-five (45) Business Day period, then any Party may refer the
matters still in dispute (but not, for the avoidance of doubt, any other
matters which have been agreed in writing between the Seller and the
Purchaser) to PricewaterhouseCoopers, failing which an internationally
reputable accountancy firm independent from the Parties and appointed upon
application of either the Seller or the Purchaser by the President for the
time being of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of England and Wales who
in making such determination shall act as expert (the "Expert"). Each of the
Parties shall instruct the Expert as soon as reasonably practicable (as an
expert and 

---|--- 
 



\- 44- dispute (but not, for the avoidance of doubt, any other matters which have
been agreed in writing between the Seller and the Purchaser) on the Draft
Statements as soon as reasonably practicable, by applying the basis on which
the _pro forma_ statements set out in Schedule 11 ( _Pro Forma Statements_ )
were drawn up and the Accounting Principles and taking into account
the arrangements among the Parties in this Agreement, and to notify the
Purchaser and the Seller of its determination in writing. For such purpose,
each of Seller and the Purchaser shall provide to the Expert reasonable access
to such documents, Books and Records and relevant personnel of the Sellers
Group or Purchasers Group (as the case may be) as the Expert shall reasonably
request. The fees, costs and expenses of the Expert shall be allocated to and
borne by the Purchaser and the Seller based on the inverse percentage that
the Experts determination (before such allocation) bears to the total amount
of the total items in dispute as originally submitted to the Expert (for
example, should the items in dispute total in amount to US$1,000 and the
Expert awards US$600 in favour of the Sellers position, 60% of the costs of
its review would be borne by the Purchaser and 40% of the costs would be borne
by the Seller). The Draft Inventory Statement (as adjusted in accordance with
the determination of the Expert and any other agreements in writing previously
reached between the Seller and the Purchaser) shall become the Inventory
Statement, the Draft Debt-Like Items Statement (as adjusted in accordance
with the determination of the Expert and any other agreements in writing
previously agreed between the Seller and the Purchaser) shall become the Debt-
Like Items Statement, the Draft Net Intercompany Statement (as adjusted in
accordance with the determination of the Expert and any other agreements in
writing previously reached between the Seller and the Purchaser) shall become
the Net Intercompany Statement, the Draft Working Capital Statement (as
adjusted in accordance with the determination of the Expert and any other
agreements in writing previously reached between the Seller and the Purchaser)
shall become the Working Capital Statement and the Draft Purchase Price
Statement (as adjusted in accordance with the determination of the Expert and
any other agreements in writing previously reached between the Seller and the
Purchaser) shall become the Purchase Price Statement and each shall be final
and binding on the Purchaser and the Seller for the purposes hereof.

in US Dollars, in accordance with Clause 6.10. To the extent applicable, the

claims or payments.

EDS Entity for an amount equal to any Losses suffered or incurred by the

Losses to the relevant EDS Entity. 
---|--- 



   11.8 | After Completion, the Seller shall at its cost execute and
deliver all such further documents and/or take such other action as the
Purchaser may reasonably request in order to effect (i) the release and
discharge in full of the relevant member of the Purchasers Group from any

   14. | TAX MATTERS 
---|--- 

Tax Covenant and Warranties

 



   14.1 | As of and with effect from Completion, save where expressly
stated to the contrary, and subject to the limitations contained in, and

s Liability_), the provisions of Schedule 13 ( _Tax Matters_ ) shall apply
in relation to Tax. 
---|--- 



   14.2 | The only Warranties given in respect of Tax are those contained
in paragraph 19 (Taxation) of Schedule 7 ( _Seller s Warranties_) and none of

French _Code general des imp ots_ in connection with this Agreement shall be

VAT

 



   14.4 | All sums set out in this Agreement or otherwise payable by any
Party to any other Party under or pursuant to this Agreement shall (unless
expressly stated otherwise) be deemed to be exclusive of any VAT.  
---|--- 



   14.5 |

The Parties will work together to determine whether a transfer by the Seller
or one (1) or more of the Designated Sellers of all or part of the EDS Assets
and EDS Liabilities contemplated by this Agreement constitutes a transfer of a
totality of assets as referred to in Article 19 of the VAT Directive, any
provision imposed in a member state of the European Union pursuant thereto or
any equivalent provisions applicable elsewhere, as a result of which the
relevant transfer does not give rise to any supply for VAT purposes, or which
is otherwise outside the scope of VAT, or in respect of which no  

---|--- 
 



\- 67- treatment is available, the Parties will use reasonable endeavours to secure
that the foregoing treatment applies. If any Tax Authority determines
subsequently that the Parties have wrongfully applied Article 19 of the VAT
Directive or such other provision so that VAT is chargeable at a positive rate
on the supply of any of the EDS Assets and/or the EDS Liabilities, the Seller
or Designated Seller will be entitled to invoice the Purchaser or Designated
Purchaser for the VAT chargeable on such supply, and the Purchaser shall
procure payment of such VAT to the Seller or Designated Seller within ten (10)
Business Days from the receipt of a valid VAT invoice in respect of such
supply from the Seller or relevant Designated Seller. 
---|--- 



   14.6 | Subject to Clause 14.5, if any VAT is or becomes chargeable on
any supply or transfer made by any person (the "Supplier") under or pursuant
to this Agreement to any other person (the "Recipient") and the Supplier is
required to account for VAT in respect of that supply or transfer, then the
Recipient shall, subject to the receipt of a valid VAT invoice in respect of
such supply, pay to the Supplier an amount equal to such VAT in addition to
any other sum or consideration for that supply or transfer; and that payment
shall be made within ten (10) Business Days of demand or, if later, at the
same time as the sum or consideration for the supply or transfer is payable. 
---|--- 



   14.7 | The Purchaser, the Designated Purchaser or the Recipient, as the
case may be under Clause 14.5 or 14.6 above, must at the request of the
Seller, Designated Seller or Supplier, as the case may be, provide a
valid VAT identification number as soon as reasonably practicable if
available. 
---|--- 



   14.8 | Where under or pursuant to this Agreement a Party is required to
reimburse or indemnify another Party for any costs or expenses, that Party
shall also reimburse that other Party for any VAT incurred by that other
Party in respect of those costs or expenses, except to the extent that the
other Party is able to recover an amount or is entitled to a Relief, in each
case, in respect of that VAT. 
---|--- 
 



   14.9 | References in this Agreement to any person shall, when
construing any provision in relation to VAT, be deemed at any time when such
person (the "Relevant Person") is a member of a group or fiscal unity for
VAT purposes to include a reference, where appropriate, to (i) any other
member of such group or fiscal unity at such time which is or will be under an
obligation to account for, or pay, to any Tax Authority any VAT chargeable on
or in respect of any supplies or transfers constituted by or otherwise
arising from the activities of the Relevant Person, or (ii) in relation to any
amounts representing VAT incurred by the Relevant Person (as part of any cost
or expense incurred by such Relevant Person), any other member of such group
or fiscal unity at such time which is or will be entitled to a refund (by way
of credit, repayment or otherwise) of such VAT from any Tax Authority. 
---|--- 
 

No Withholding



   14.10 | Unless stated otherwise in this Agreement, all payments made by
a Party under this Agreement shall be made gross, free of any right of
counterclaim or set-off and without deduction or withholding of any kind other
than any deduction or withholding required by Law. 
---|--- 
 



\- 68- from a payment due under this Agreement, the sum due shall be increased to the
extent necessary to ensure that, after the making of any deduction
or withholding, the other Party receives a sum equal to the sum it would have
received had no deduction or withholding been made, unless the deduction or
withholding needs to be made in respect of the payment of the Purchase Price
and is made by reference to income, profits or gains (deemed) earned by the
Seller or Designated Seller. 
---|--- 



   14.12 | To the extent that any deduction or withholding in respect of
which an additional amount has been paid under Clause 14.11 above results in
the payee obtaining a Relief, the payee shall pay to the payer, within
ten (10) Business Days of obtaining and utilising the benefit of the Relief,
an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the value of the Relief obtained and (ii)
the additional sum paid under Clause 14.11 above in respect of such deduction
or withholding, in each case after deduction of any additional Taxes due in
respect thereof and costs reasonably made for obtaining the Relief. 
---|--- 



   14.13 | The Purchaser warrants and undertakes for the purpose of the
exclusion from the increased payment obligation with respect to the Purchase
Price set out in Clause 14.11: (i) that the Designated Purchaser of
Huntsman Performance Products Spain, S.L. will be a company incorporated in
England and Wales that is regularly subject to corporate tax in, and
considered tax resident for tax purposes solely of, the United Kingdom; and
(ii) that it is unaware of any requirement to make any deduction or
withholding on the payment of the Purchase Price.

any Third Party Rights (other than Permitted Encumbrances) arising
following Completion to any member of the Sellers Group nominated by the
Seller; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | do all such further acts and things and execute all such
other documents as may be necessary validly to effect the Conveyance of the

and pending such consent, approval, authorisation or waiver shall hold or
shall procure that the benefit of such Purchaser Wrong Pocket Asset be held
on trust for the benefit of the relevant member of the Purchasers Group or
its nominee.



   15.2 | All costs and expenses arising out of compliance with a transfer
of the Wrong Pocket Assets as set out in Clause 15.1 shall be allocated to the
Parties as though such Wrong Pocket Asset had been transferred at Completion
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 
---|--- 



   15.3 | If any Wrong Pocket Assets are identified in accordance with
Clause 15.1, the Seller and the Purchaser shall seek to agree within ten (10)
Business Days of written request by either Party, whether such Wrong

Completion, have resulted in any adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to
Clause 6 ( _Post-Completion Adjustment_ ) (the amount of any adjusting
payments required to put the Seller and the Purchaser in the position that
they would have been in if such Wrong Pocket Assets would have been identified

\- 70- are required; and (ii) the amount of the Wrong Pockets Adjustments, and that
the amount of which each of the Seller and the Purchaser has respectively
agreed to pay to the other shall be aggregated and set-off against each
other; whichever of the Purchaser or the Seller is then left with a payment
obligation shall make the applicable payment within five (5) Business Days;
and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 15.3.3 | do not agree as to whether any Wrong Pockets Adjustments
are required (or as to the amount of any Wrong Pockets Adjustment), then
either Party may deliver to the other Party a draft statement of the Wrong
Pockets Adjustments ("WP Statement"). 
---|---|--- 



   15.4 | The Party receiving the WP Statement shall notify the other
Party in writing (a "WP Objection Notice") within twenty (20) Business Days

payment obligation shall make the applicable payment within five (5) Business
Days.

   15.7 | The Parties acknowledge that the EDS Entities will no longer be
members of the Sellers Group after Completion and as such will no longer be
entitled to the rights and benefits to the extent inuring to the EDS Business
under any such Shared Business Contracts. In case any EDS Entity intends to
enter into a new agreement in order to obtain similar rights and benefits, the
Parties shall use all their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
introduce the Purchasers designated Representatives to the relevant
Representatives of the third parties who are party to any such Shared Business
Contracts and negotiate with the relevant counterparty with an aim to conclude

reasonable efforts to negotiate a mutually acceptable arrangement under which
(i) the relevant EDS Entities will obtain the benefits and assume the
obligations (including any minimum off-take or similar obligations) under such
Shared Business Contract to the extent related to the EDS Business,
including, to the extent permitted, making use of any divested entity
arrangements and/or entering into re-selling, sub-contracting, sub-licensing
or sub-leasing arrangements for the benefit and account of the relevant EDS
Entities, and (ii) the relevant member of the Sellers Group will enforce, for
the benefit of the relevant EDS Entities, with the Purchaser assuming all
obligations thereunder of all members of the Sellers Group to the
extent related to the EDS Business, any and all rights of the relevant member
of the Sellers Group against a third party, all to the extent related to the
EDS Business. The obligations will be treated as related to the EDS Business
to the extent these are consistent with the obligations incurred by the EDS
Business under the relevant Shared Business Contracts over the period of
twelve (12) months immediately preceding the Completion Date.

   15.9 | Pending implementation of the Sharing Arrangements, the Parties
shall each use and procure that their respective Affiliates use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to continue to operate each
Shared Business Contract, including fulfilling all their respective
obligations under that Shared Business Contract in each case until the earlier
of: 
---|--- 



     | 15.9.1 | the expiration or termination of the relevant Shared
Business Contract; 
---|---|--- 



     | 15.9.2 | the date with effect from which the Purchaser notifies
the Seller that it no longer wishes to receive the benefit of the relevant
Shared Business Contract; and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 15.9.3 | the date that a new agreement or arrangement is entered
into with the relevant counterparty pursuant to Clause 15.7. 
---|---|--- 



   15.10 | Notwithstanding the foregoing, following the expiration or
other termination of any Shared Business Contract, no Party will be obligated
to continue the Sharing Arrangements with respect to such expired or
terminated Shared Business Contract, as applicable; provided that the Parties
shall not, and shall procure that their respective Affiliates shall not,
terminate any such Shared Business Contract (other than through the passing of
time and not renewing same) without the prior written consent of the other
Parties. 
---|--- 



   15.11 |

Any (i) operational costs associated with the maintenance and administration
of the Sharing Arrangements, (ii) out-of-pocket costs of obtaining the
consent of the relevant counterparty to any of the arrangements contemplated
by Clause 15.8, including any payment or fee required to be made to such
counterparty in exchange for the grant of such consent, will be shared evenly
between the Seller and the Purchaser or as otherwise agreed between the Seller
and the Purchaser. Neither the Seller nor the Purchaser will make or commit to
make any such payments or fees, or incur any _non-de minimis_  out-of-pocket
costs, that will be subject to such Sharing Arrangement without the advance
written consent of the other such Party (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld); provided that either Party may agree to or commit to make,  

---|--- 
 



\- 72- Party but such payments or fees will then be at the sole cost of such Party
making such agreement or commitment. 
---|--- 
 



   15.12 | To the extent that any counterparty violates or otherwise
breaches any Shared Business Contract prior to the Completion Date, and such
violation or other breach gives rise to the right of any member of the Seller
Group that is a party thereto to asserts any Action against such
counterparty, the Purchaser may, from and after Completion, elect to give
notice of such fact to the Seller, in which event the Purchaser and the Seller
will negotiate in good faith to determine (i) whether and how to proceed with
such Action against such counterparty, and (ii) how to allocate the costs of
pursuing such cause of Action and any benefits that might arise from such
Action. It is the intent of the Parties that, in respect of such Shared
Business Contract, the costs of pursuing, and the benefits arising from, such
Action will be allocated between the Purchaser and the Seller in a manner
proportionate to the recoverable damages incurred by the EDS Business, on the
one hand, and the Retained Business, on the other hand.

Proposed Transaction Structure

 



   15.13 | The Parties agree that, if due to a change in Law occurring
after Signing, the Seller believes it is preferable to vary the structure of
the Transaction to Convey the EDS Business, the EDS Shares, the EDS Assets or
EDS Liabilities to the Purchaser in a manner other than as set out in this
Agreement, or to vary the steps set out in Schedule 5, the Seller may, subject
to Clause 15.14, propose to implement the Transaction, or the Disentanglement,
respectively, in any alternative manner on which Seller and Purchaser agree
(each acting reasonably) and which each Party considers to be appropriate,
provided that the outcome of the Transaction, or the Disentanglement,
respectively, remains at least economically equivalent for the Purchaser on
an after-Tax basis as in the case of the Conveyance, or the Disentanglement,
respectively, as set out in this Agreement (disregarding for the purpose of
this comparison the availability of any Reliefs).  
---|--- 



   15.14 | If Seller wishes to make any variations under Clause 15.13,
Seller shall notify the Purchaser immediately, and shall consult fully with
the Purchaser in connection therewith. 
---|--- 
 



   15.15 | If the Purchaser wishes to assume some or all of the Net
Intercompany Amount on Completion then the Parties shall discuss such
assumption in good faith.

prior written consent of the Seller, which consent may not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed, provided, however, that the Parties acknowledge that the
Seller may withhold its consent if such modification, adaptation,
reconfiguration or change of the format of the Business Data could result in
the Business Data relating to the period prior to the Completion Date no
longer being capable of being reasonably retrieved, accessed or processed by
the Sellers Groups Business Data systems. If compliance with this obligation
will reasonably require any member of the Purchasers Group to incur any

---|--- 
 

Inconsistency



   20.5 | If, and to the extent that there is any conflict or
inconsistency between the provisions of this Agreement, and any Ancillary

the rate of 8.5% p.a. (eight point five percent per annum) compounded annually

\- 83- Invalidity and severability

 



   20.17 | Should any provision of this Agreement, or any provision
incorporated into this Agreement, be or become illegal, invalid or
unenforceable under the Laws of any jurisdiction, the legality, validity or
enforceability in that jurisdiction of the other provisions of this Agreement
shall not be affected thereby. The invalid or unenforceable provision shall be
deemed to be substituted by a suitable and equitable provision which, to the
extent legally permissible, comes as close as possible to the intent and
purpose of the invalid or unenforceable provision. The same shall apply if any
provision of this Agreement is invalid because of the scope of any time period
of performance stipulated herein; in this case a legally permissible time
period or performance shall be deemed to have been agreed which comes as close
as possible to the stipulated time period or performance.

---|---|--- 



     | (a) | pay to the other Party from time to time on demand any sum
of money which the Permitted Assignee is at any time liable to pay to the
other Party or any of its Affiliates under or pursuant to this Agreement and
which has not been paid by the Permitted Assignee in default of the terms of
this Agreement on the basis that these obligations are primary obligations and
not those of a mere surety; and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | any reference to a liability or obligation of the Permitted
Assignee shall be deemed to incorporate a reference to an obligation on the

subsequently ceases to be either, in relation to the Seller, any member of the
Sellers Group, or, in relation to the Purchaser, any member of the
Purchasers Group, the Seller or the Purchaser (as applicable) shall be
deemed to have re-assigned that benefit to either itself, or another
continuing member of the Sellers Group or the Purchasers Group, as
applicable. 
---|---|--- 
 



   20.20 | Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser may, without Sellers
consent, assign the benefit of this Agreement, including any right or claims
arising hereunder, by way of security to any provider of any
financing (including the Financing) to the Purchaser; provided that the
Seller shall have no greater liability under this Agreement than it would
otherwise have had. 
---|---

contain any stipulation (other than in Clause 10.6) in favour of a third

notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party (a "Warning Notice"); and either 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | state in the Warning Notice that such notice should be
deemed to be the actual making of a Covenant Claim or Retained Environmental
Liability Claim in relation to the relevant matter; or 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | where paragraph (i) does not apply and the Indemnified
Party wishes to make a Covenant Claim or Retained Environmental Liability

estimate of the Environmental Losses, so far as reasonably available to
the Indemnified Party as at the date of such written notice; 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | not include any privileged legal advice given to the
Indemnified Party or any Relevant Protected Person in order for that person to
assess the merits of, or advice in relation, to the conduct of a Covenant
Claim or Retained Environmental Liability Claim.

Request shall not preclude the Indemnifying Party from making a Control
Request at a later date if there is a subsequent change in circumstances or

Indemnifying Party otherwise such admission of liability will not be a
prerequisite for raking control; 
---|---|---

Person in advance the full cost of taking or carrying out any step or action
required by the Indemnifying Party under this paragraph 8;

any works or investigations relating to the actual or potential Protected
Matter the Indemnifying Party reasonably considers that the Indemnified Party
will have (following determination by the Expert Procedure or otherwise) the

which are likely to arise in relation to that Protected Matter then the
Indemnifying Party will as soon as is reasonably practicable provide a
written notice to that effect to the Indemnified Party, who will have the
right to take over control and conduct from the Indemnifying Party.

incomplete, unrepresentative, unreliable or inconclusive that it would be
unreasonable for an expert to reach such a determination of the Unresolved
Issue on that basis ("Deficient Information), 
---|---

are not able to determine the Unresolved Issue on the grounds of Deficient

on and appoint a third independent environmental consultant having at least
ten years experience in respect of factual environmental disputes

arbitrator) to determine the Unresolved Issue. The Third Independent Expert
shall be offered the appointment within 7 days of the parties reaching
such mutual agreement and all reasonable details of the matter in dispute

final determination (the "Referral"). Failing such mutual agreement on
the appointment of the Third Independent Expert, the parties shall promptly
refer the issue of who to appoint, at their joint cost, to the President for
the time being of the Institute of Chartered Civil Engineers in the United

Expert within 7 days of receipt of such instructions who has not personally
been previously engaged (in the period of three years prior to the date of any
Claims Notice) and shall not be so employed in the period of three years

basis of the Criteria (where applicable) and the information provided by the
parties and the Two Independent Experts as soon as practicable (and in any
event within thirty (30) Business Days of the date of the Referral) at which
time the Third Independent Expert shall be required to serve on each Party his
formal and full written opinion (the "Final Notice"); 
---|---|---

and shall be conclusive in any proceedings between the parties hereto as to
the Unresolved Issue; and 
---|---|---

be borne equally by the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party (unless
otherwise directed by the Third Independent Expert);

is referred to the Third Independent Expert, the Third Independent Expert
shall be instructed to determine the Unresolved Issue on the basis of
the Criteria and the information provided by the parties, unless the Third
Independent Expert also _bona fide_ believes that such information is
Deficient Information. In the case of Deficient Information, the Third
Independent Expert shall be instructed to either: 
---|--- 



     | (a) | determine that it would be practicable and reasonable to
carry out further investigations in order to enable the Unresolved Issue to be
determined, in which case such further investigations shall be carried out
and paragraphs 8.8 to 8.12 shall be re-applied; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | determine that it would not be practicable and reasonable to
carry out further investigations in order to enable the Unresolved Issue to be
determined, in which case the Third Independent Expert shall decide
the Unresolved Issue on the most fair and reasonable basis available. 
---|---|---

matter giving rise to the Covenant Claim or Retained Environmental Liability
