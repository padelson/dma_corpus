       12.3  |  

Double Claims

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

 

If the same event, matter or circumstances can give rise to a Claim under
several provisions of Clause 12, the Beneficiary shall  only be indemnified
once, but the Purchaser shall have the option, in its absolute discretion, to
choose the Clause upon which it is to base its Claim.

 

 

 

       12.4  |  

Computation of Losses Incurred by the Purchaser

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

 

For the purposes of this Clause 12, any Loss incurred by the Company or any of
the Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be incurred by  the Purchaser in the same
amount. If a multiplier or any other factor or ratio has been used for
calculating the Purchase Price, it shall not be used for the computation of
any Loss.

 

 

 

       12.5  |  

Nature of any Payment to the Purchaser

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

 

Any amount paid by the Sellers to the Purchaser under this Clause 12 shall
constitute a reduction of the Purchase Price.

 

 

 

       12.6  |  

Tax Gross-Up and Tax Savings

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

 

 

         | 12.6.1  |  

If any amount paid under this Clause 12 is subject to any Tax, the amount so
payable shall be grossed up by such amount as will ensure that after payment
of such Tax  there shall be left a sum equal to the amount which would
otherwise be payable under this Clause 12, provided however that if the
Purchaser elects to designate the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries as
beneficiary of any amount  owed by the Sellers under Clause 12, the present
Clause 12.6.1 will not have the effect of requiring the Sellers to pay the
Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries an amount that is higher than the
amount that the Sellers would  otherwise have been liable to pay to the
Purchaser under Clause 12.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

 

 

       
    | 12.6.2  |  

Any amount for which the Sellers would otherwise have paid in respect of any
Claim under this Clause 12 shall be reduced by the amount of any Tax savings
made by the  Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries arising from the matter
in respect of which the Claim has been made.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

 

 

       
    | 12.6.3  |  

For the purpose of Clause 12.6.1, "Tax saving" means the amount by which any
Tax for which the Company or the relevant Subsidiary would otherwise have been
liable is  actually reduced or extinguished as a result of such matter,
provided that such actual Tax savings are made in respect of the taxable
period in which the matter occurred or the subsequent taxable period.
Accordingly, Clauses 12.6.1,  12.6.3 and 12.6.4 shall not apply if the
occurrence of the matter merely results in an increase of the Company's or the
relevant Subsidiary's tax losses carried forward ("overgedragen fiscale
verliezen" / "pertes fiscalement recuperables").

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

 

 

       
    | 12.6.4  |  

If the amount of the actual Tax saving is determined after payment by the
Sellers of any amount in discharge of the Claim, the Purchaser shall, or shall
cause that the  Company or the relevant Subsidiary shall, pay to the Sellers
an amount equal to the difference between:

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

 

 

       
    | (i)  |  

the amount paid by the Sellers to the Purchaser or the Company or the relevant
Subsidiary; and

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

 

 

27  

 

       
    | (ii)  |  

the amount that the Purchaser or the Company or the relevant Subsidiary would
have received if such actual Tax savings had been taken into account in
determining the  amount due by the Sellers in accordance with the Clauses
12.6.1, 12.6.3 and 12.6.4.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

 

 

       12.7  |  

No assignment of Purchaser's rights to any subsequent transferee of the
Securities

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

 

The Purchaser's rights under this Clause 12 are personal to the Purchaser and,
accordingly, no purchaser or other transferee of all  or part of the
Securities, other than an Affiliated Company of the Purchaser, shall be
entitled to make any Claim against the Sellers, it being understood that the
right of an Affiliated Company of the Purchaser to make a Claim against the 
Sellers shall cease to exist as of the moment at which such entity ceases to
be an Affiliated Company of the Purchaser.

limitation;

    
---|---|---

    | 13.1.2  |  

In case a claim notice has been made in accordance with clause 5.4. of the WandI
Insurance by the Purchaser within the time limitations set out in Clause
13.1.1, for  which the Insurer has either denied cover for the Loss claimed
or not determined its position within thirty (30) business days (as defined in
the WandI Insurance) after having received all required information in
accordance with  clause 5.4. of the WandI Insurance (the "WandI Insurance
Position Period"), the Purchaser may bring a Claim against the Sellers
within  sixty (60) days from the expiry of the WandI Insurance Position Period.

The Sellers shall have no obligation to indemnify the Beneficiary in respect
of any Claim for Breach of the Representations arising from any single Loss
where the  amount claimed by the Purchaser does not exceed EUR 20,000,
provided that if this amount is exceeded, the Sellers shall be liable for the
total of the Claim and  not only the amount exceeding EUR 20,000.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

 

 

       
    | 13.2.2  |  

With respect to Claims for Breach of the Representations, a series of Claims
arising from substantially identical facts shall be aggregated for the
purposes of this  Clause 13.2.

    | 13.3.1  |  

With respect to Claims for Breach of the Representations, the Sellers shall
have no obligation to indemnify the Beneficiary in respect of any Claim unless
the aggregate  amount for which the Sellers would otherwise be liable under
the Agreement in respect of all claims made by the Purchaser exceeds one
hundred ninety-five thousand euro  (EUR 195,000), provided that if this
amount is exceeded, the Sellers shall be liable for the amount exceeding one
hundred ninety-five thousand euro (EUR  195,000) only.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

 

 

       
    | 13.3.2  |  

Once the above-mentioned amount has been exceeded, this Clause 13.3 shall no

---|---|--- 
    

 

 

 

 

       
    | 13.4.2  |  

The limitation in the amount set out in Clause 13.4.1, shall not apply to the
Representations in respect to Environmental and Tax matters as set out in
Articles 20 and  21 of _Schedule 10_ , in respect of which it is agreed that
any amounts to be paid based on Claims of these Representations (and not
subject to the  limitation on the amount set out in Clause 13.4.1) shall not
be taken into account in the calculation of the maximum liability applicable
to the other Claims. For the Representations in respect to Environmental and
Tax matters as  set out in Articles 20 and 21 of _Schedule 10_ , a specific
aggregate liability of the Sellers under Clause 12 applies which shall not
exceed seven million  eight hundred twenty-five thousand euro (EUR
7,825,000). For the avoidance of doubt, it is clarified that, for any of the
aforementioned Representations in respect to Environmental and Tax matters,
the specific aggregate liability  of the Sellers under Clause 12 shall be
limited to the amount set out in this Clause 13.4.2, which shall not be
aggregated with the amount of the aggregate liability set out in Clause
13.4.1.

---|---|--- 
    

 

 

 

 

       
    | (i)  |  

a breach of the Sellers' Covenants; and

       13.6  |  

Provision in the (Subsidiaries') Annual Accounts

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

 

The Sellers shall have no obligations to indemnify the Beneficiary in respect
of any Claim (i) if and to the extent that the matter  giving rise to the
Claim is properly accounted or provided for in the Annual Accounts and/or any
of the Subsidiaries' Annual Accounts or (ii) if the matter giving rise to the
Claim has been subject to an appropriate provision in the Annual  Accounts
and/or any of the Subsidiaries' Annual Accounts by means of a provision
specifically linked to the matter at stake (and not by means of a general
provision) in accordance with the Accounting Principles, which have been

Insurance Payments and other Receivables vis-a-vis Third Parties

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

 

 

       
    | 13.7.1  |  

The Sellers shall not indemnify the Purchaser as a result of a breach if the
Loss resulting from the Claim:

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

 

 

       
    | (i)  |  

is covered by an insurance policy into force on the Closing Date;

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

 

 

       
    | (ii)  |  

would have been covered if the insurance policy would have been maintained
beyond the Closing Date (except if said insurance policy which has not been
maintained has  been replaced by an equivalent insurance policy); or

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

 

 

       
    | (iii)  |  

is effectively recoverable from third parties.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

 

 

       
    | 13.7.2  |  

Consequently, any amount due by the Sellers as a result of a Claim shall be
reduced by the amount of any insurance indemnity or any other recovery which
the Company,  any of the Subsidiaries or the Purchaser will have effectively
received from an insurance company or a third party.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

 

 

       
    | 13.7.3  |  

In case, before the Sellers pay an amount as a result of a Claim, the Company,
any of the Subsidiaries or the Purchaser shall be entitled to recover from any
insurance  company or any third party an amount which indemnifies them (in
whole or in part) of the Loss from which the Claim results, the Purchaser
shall undertake all reasonable measures in order to pursue such recovery
before to sue the  Sellers.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

 

 

       
    | 13.7.4  |  

In case, the Sellers have in first instance paid an amount as a result of a
Claim and the Purchaser or the Company or a Subsidiary recovers thereafter
from any  insurance company or any other third party an amount which
reasonably

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

 

 

30  

constitutes a second discharge of the Claim, the Purchaser shall pay to the
Sellers, or guarantee that  the Company or any of the Subsidiaries will pay
to the Sellers, an amount equal to the difference between:

 

 

 

       
    | (i)  |  

the amount paid by the Sellers to the Purchaser or the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries for such Claim; and

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

 

 

       
    | (ii)  |  

the amount that the Purchaser or the Company or any of the Subsidiary would
have received if the net amount of such recovery had been taken into account
in determining  the amount due by the Sellers pursuant to this Clause 13.7.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

 

 

       
    | 13.7.5  |  

If an amount is paid by the Sellers as a result of a Claim, the Purchaser or
the Company, or any of the Subsidiaries, for which the Purchaser shall
procure, shall  assign its rights resulting from the Loss being the purpose
of the Claim to any insurance company or any other third party, provided that
such assignment is allowed, in proportion to the amount paid by the Sellers in
comparison with  the amount of the Loss incurred.

---|---|--- 
    

 

 

 

 

       
    | (i)  |  

of an act or an omission of the Sellers or the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries upon the written request or with the written consent of the
Purchaser;

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

 

 

       
    | (ii)  |  

of a modification brought, after the Closing Date, to the evaluation rules of
the Company or the Subsidiaries or the Tax policy or practices of the Company
or the  Subsidiaries, except if the amendments are required in order to
comply with applicable legal provisions at Closing;

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

 

 

       
    | (iii)  |  

of the adoption or the amendment, after the Closing Date, of any legal or
