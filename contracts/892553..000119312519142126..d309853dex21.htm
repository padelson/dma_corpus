subleasing to the Acquiror, or under which the Company would enforce for the

Rights_ "), and the Company would promptly pay to the Acquiror when received

benefit net of any Tax cost incurred by the Company or its Affiliates.

immediately prior to the Closing (" _Closing Net Working Capital_ "). The
Acquiror shall provide the Company a reasonable level of supporting
documentation for the calculation of the Closing Target and the Closing Net

execution of a customary form of confidentiality agreement) will be permitted
to review the AcquirorÂ’s work papers relating to the Estimated Closing
Statement, and the Acquiror shall make reasonably available the individuals in
its employ responsible for and knowledgeable about the information used in,
and the preparation of, the Estimated Closing Statement, to respond to the
reasonable inquiries of the Company.

(a) The Company shall notify the Acquiror in writing (the " _Notice of
Disagreement_ ") prior to the expiration of the Review Period if the Company
disagrees with the Estimated Closing Statement or the Closing Target or the
Closing Net Working Capital set forth therein. The Notice of Disagreement
shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for such dispute, the amounts
involved and the CompanyÂ’s determination of the amount of the Closing Target
and the Closing Net Working Capital. If no Notice of Disagreement is received
by the Acquiror prior to expiration of the Review Period, then the Estimated
Closing Statement shall be deemed to have been accepted by the Company and
shall become final and binding upon the parties in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 2.8(c)_.

 

(b) During the thirty (30)-day period immediately following the delivery of
a Notice of Disagreement (the " _Consultation Period_ "), the Acquiror and

Notice of Disagreement (along with a copy of the Estimated Closing Statement
marked to indicate those line items that are not in dispute) to (i) an
independent certified public accounting firm in the United States of national
recognition mutually acceptable to the Acquiror and the Company (the "
_Independent Accounting Firm_ ") or (ii) if the Acquiror and the Company are
unable to agree upon such a firm within ten (10)

 



18

    

 Business Days after the end of the Consultation Period, then within an
additional ten (10) Business Days, the Acquiror and the Company shall each
select one such firm and those two firms shall select a third such firm, in
which event "Independent Accounting Firm" shall mean such third firm. Within

Accounting Firm shall, acting as an arbitrator and not as an expert, make a
final determination, binding on the parties to this Agreement, of the
appropriate amount of each of the line items in the Estimated Closing
Statement as to which the Acquiror and the Company disagree as set forth in
the Notice of Disagreement. With respect to each disputed line item, such
determination, if not in accordance with the position of either the Acquiror
or the Company, shall not be in excess of the amount that results in a higher
Closing Target or Closing Net Working Capital, nor less than the amount that
results in a lower Closing Target or Closing Net Working Capital, as
applicable, in each case as advocated by the Acquiror in the Estimated Closing
Statement or the Company in the Notice of Disagreement with respect to such
disputed line item, respectively. During such determination period, the
Independent Accounting Firm also shall (i) prepare a statement of the Closing
Target and the Closing Net Working Capital, based upon all of the line items
not disputed by the parties and the line items determined by the Independent
Accounting Firm and (ii) determine the amount of the Closing Net Working
Capital reflected on such statement. The statement of the Closing Target and
the Closing Net Working Capital that is final and binding on the parties, as
determined either through agreement of the parties pursuant to _Section_ __ _

Accounting Firm pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.8(c)_, is referred to as
the " _Final Closing Statement_ ", the Closing Target reflected on such Final
Closing Statement is referred to as the " _Final Target_ " and the Closing
Net Working Capital reflected on such Final Closing Statement is referred to
as the " _Final Net Working Capital_ ".

 

(d) The cost of the Independent Accounting FirmÂ’s review and determination
shall be shared equally by the Acquiror, on the one hand, and the Company, on
the other hand. During the review by the Independent Accounting Firm, the
Acquiror and the Company and their respective accountants will each make
available to the Independent Accounting Firm interviews with such
individuals, and such information, books and records and work papers, as may
be reasonably requested by the Independent Accounting Firm to fulfill its
obligations under _Section_ __ _ 2.8(c)_; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the
accountants of the Acquiror or the Company shall not be obliged to make any
work papers available to the Independent Accounting Firm except in accordance
with such accountantsÂ’ normal disclosure procedures and then only after the
Independent Accounting Firm has signed a customary agreement relating to such
access to work papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such
accountants. In acting under this Agreement, the Independent Accounting Firm
will be entitled to the privileges and immunities of an arbitrator.

(e) Subject to  _Section_ __ _ 11.11_, The Acquiror and the Company agree
that the procedures set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 2.8_ for resolving
disputes with respect to the Estimated Closing Statement and the calculation
of the Closing Target and the Closing Net Working Capital set forth therein
shall be the sole and exclusive method for resolving any such disputes;
_provided_ , _however_ , that this provision shall not prohibit any party from
instituting litigation to enforce any decision pursuant to the terms hereof
by the Independent Accounting Firm in any court of competent jurisdiction. The
substance of the Independent Accounting FirmÂ’s determination shall not be
subject to review or appeal, absent a showing of fraud.

Section 2.9 _Post-Closing Adjustment_. (i) If the Final Net Working
Capital exceeds the Final Target, the Acquiror shall pay the Company the
amount of such excess; and (ii) if the Final Target exceeds the Final Net
Working Capital, the Company shall pay the Acquiror the amount of such
excess. Any amounts owed pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.9_ (the " _Post-
Closing Adjustment_ "), shall be paid in one payment to either the Company or
the Acquiror, as the case may be, by wire transfer in immediately available
funds to an account specified by the receiving party within three (3) Business
Days after the Final Closing Statement becomes final, conclusive and binding
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.8(c)_.

 

Section 2.10 _Withholding_. The Acquiror shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold under the Code or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law; _provided_ that before making
any deduction or withholding pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 2.10_,
Acquiror shall give the Company at least ten (10) days prior written notice of
any anticipated deduction or withholding (together with any legal basis
therefor), provide the Company with sufficient opportunity to provide any
forms or other documentation or take such other steps in order to avoid such
deduction or withholding, and reasonably consult and cooperate with the
Company in good faith to attempt to reduce or eliminate any amounts
that would otherwise be deducted or withheld pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
2.10_. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the
appropriate taxing authority by the Acquiror, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Acquiror.

rights, assets, businesses, product lines or services of the Acquiror or any
of its Affiliates, (iii) terminate any Contract or other business
relationship, or (iv) extend any waiting period with any Governmental Entity

Governmental Entity that would reasonably be expected to restrain, prevent or
delay the Closing, including by defending through litigation, any action
asserted by any Person in any court or before any Governmental Entity and (B)

38

    

 not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse impact on the Business; _provided_ _further_ , _however_ ,
that the consummation of any such required Remedial Action shall be
conditioned upon the occurrence of the Closing.

Section 5.5 _Third Party Consents_ _; Shared Contracts; IT Asset
Contracts._

(a) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any
consent of any Person (other than Governmental Entities) required to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(other than the consent from a counterparty to any Assumed Contracts pursuant
to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is obligated to pay, or has
the right to receive, less than $250,000 in any twelve (12)-month period).
__The Acquiror agrees to cooperate reasonably with the Company in obtaining
such consents. To the extent that the Company is unable to obtain such
consents prior to the Closing (such consents, the " _Post-Closing Consents_
"), the Company shall, until the first (1st) anniversary of the Closing, use
commercially reasonable efforts to make or obtain (or cause to be made or
obtained), as promptly as practicable, all Post-Closing Consents. The
Acquiror agrees to cooperate reasonably with the Company in obtaining such
Post-Closing Consents.

(b) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each
Shared Contract to be separated into separate Contracts between the applicable
third party and each of (i) the Business, on the one hand, and (ii) the
business retained by the Company, on the other hand (it being understood
that, in connection with such separation, the Company shall not, subject to
_Section_ __ _ 5.5(e)_, (A) commit to make any payments other than cash
payments that are Excluded Liabilities or otherwise paid in full prior to the
Closing or (B) make any non-monetary concessions that would purport to bind
the Business or Acquiror or any of its Affiliates following the Closing). The
Acquiror shall reasonably cooperate with the Company in effecting the
separations of such Shared Contracts. The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts prior to the Closing and, to the extent not achieved prior
to the Closing, then for twelve (12) months thereafter, in effecting the
separation of such Shared Contracts on substantially the same terms as
currently in effect or other terms reasonably mutually agreeable by the
Acquiror and the Company. After the Closing and for twelve (12) months
thereafter, until any separate Contract (if any) is obtained therefor the
Acquiror shall reasonably cooperate with the Company, and the Company shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain for the Acquiror, at no cost
to the Company or the Acquiror or any of their respective Affiliates, an
arrangement with respect thereto to provide for the Acquiror substantially
comparable benefits therein and to otherwise put the Acquiror and the Company
in the position they would have been in had the rights and Liabilities
relating to the Business been transferred at the Closing. In furtherance of
the foregoing, if the Company or the Acquiror receives any benefit or payment
which under any Shared Contract was intended for the other party, the Company
and the Acquiror shall deliver such benefit or payment to the other party.

(c) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company and the Acquiror shall
reasonably cooperate to address the treatment of each IT Asset Contract in a
manner to be contemplated by the Transition Services Agreement (it being
understood that any such agreed-upon treatment shall not become effective
until the Closing). To the extent any right under any IT Asset Contract is
transferred to the Acquiror or its Affiliates, or any Liability under any IT
Asset Contract is assumed by the Acquiror or its Affiliates, either pursuant
to this _Section 5.5(c)_ at the Closing or pursuant to the Transition Services
Agreement following the Closing, such right or Liability, as applicable, shall
be deemed to be a Transferred Asset or Assumed Liability, as applicable, for
purposes of this Agreement.

(d) The Company shall request and use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain at or prior to the Closing a customary form of landlord estoppel
certificate in connection with the Leased Real Property.

 

(e) For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 5.5_, the term "commercially
reasonable efforts" shall not be deemed to require any Person to incur, pay,
reimburse or provide any

 



39

    

 commitment, liability, compensation, consideration or charge, or commence or
be a plaintiff in any Action or otherwise agree to any contractual
modification, in each case, in favor of any Person from whom any consent or
waiver may be required.

Section 5.6 _Exclusivity_. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company
shall not, and shall not cause its Representatives to, directly or indirectly,
solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage, knowingly facilitate or enter into any
negotiation, discussion or Contract, with any other party (other than the
Acquiror and its Representatives) with respect to, or furnish any confidential
or non-public information relating to, the Business, the Transferred Assets
or the Assumed Liabilities, or afford access to the business, properties,
assets, liabilities, books or records of the Business, to such other party, in
each case in connection with, the sale of , or other material transaction
involving, the Business or the Transferred Assets (an " _Acquisition_ ").
Until the earlier of the Closing and such time as this Agreement is terminated
in accordance with _Article IX_ , the Company shall promptly notify the
Acquiror if any Person makes any proposal, offer, inquiry or contact with
respect to any Acquisition and shall provide Acquiror with the terms thereof.

 

Section 5.7 _Contact with Customers and Suppliers_. During the Pre-
Closing Period, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Company and the
Acquiror shall reasonably cooperate in communicating with the customers and
suppliers of the Business concerning the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the AcquirorÂ’s intentions concerning the operation of the Business
following the Closing. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Acquiror and its
Representatives shall contact or communicate with the customers and suppliers
of the Business in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby only
with the prior written consent of the Company, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld and may be conditioned upon a designee of the Company being present
at any meeting or conference. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this
_Section_ __ _ 5.7_ shall prohibit the Acquiror from contacting the customers
and suppliers of the Business in the ordinary course of the AcquirorÂ’s
businesses for the purpose of selling products of the AcquirorÂ’s businesses or
for any other purpose unrelated to the Business or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 5.8 _Audited and Reviewed Financial Statements_. The Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to furnish to the Acquiror by May 31, 2019

31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 and the related combined statements of income
and cash flows of the Business for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018,

complies with the requirements of Item 9.01(a) of Form 8-K and Rule 3-05 of
Regulation S-X under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, for a
business acquisition required to be described in answer to Item 2.01 of Form
8-K. Further, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to furnish to
the Acquiror at or prior to the Closing such financial data, audit reports and
other information of the Business of the type required by Regulation S-X
and Regulation S-K under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for
registered public offerings of securities by the Acquiror or one of its
Affiliates, in each case, 

 



40

    

 as may be reasonably requested by the Acquiror in writing no later than ten
(10) days prior to the Closing. Following the delivery of the Audited and
Reviewed Financial Statements by the Company to the Acquiror in accordance
with this _Section_ __ _ 5.8_, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to promptly cause and enable its auditors to provide to the Acquiror
(and not withdraw) their consent to incorporation by reference into any
registration statements filed by the Acquiror or its Affiliates under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, of their audit reports with respect to the
Audited and Reviewed Financial Statements.

 

Section 5.9 _Credit and Performance Support Obligations_. The Acquiror
agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Company and its
Affiliates to be absolutely and unconditionally relieved on or prior to the
Closing Date of all Liabilities and obligations arising out of any guaranties,
letters of credit, performance bonds and other similar items issued and
outstanding in connection with or for the benefit of the Business or in
respect of the Transferred Assets (such Liabilities and obligations contained
in _Section_ __ _ 5.9_ of the Disclosure Schedule, the " _Support
Obligations_ "; _provided_ that the Company may supplement the Liabilities and
obligations listed on _Section_ __ _ 5.9_ of the Disclosure Schedule from
time to time prior to Closing to include any additional Support Obligations
relating to the Transferred Assets entered into in accordance with this
Agreement), including by causing one or more of the Acquiror or its Affiliates
to be substituted in all respects for the Company and its Affiliates in
respect of such Support Obligations. To the extent the Company or any of its
Affiliates is not absolutely and unconditionally relieved of all Support
Obligations on or prior to the Closing Date, the Acquiror shall, from and
after the Closing, indemnify the Company and its Affiliates against all
Losses of any kind whatsoever with respect to such failure and from and
against any continuing Support Obligations (each such Support Obligation,
until such time as it is released in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
5.9_, a " _Continuing Support Obligation_ "). From and after the Closing, the
Acquiror agrees to continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to
absolutely and unconditionally relieve the Company and its Affiliates of all
Continuing Support Obligations as promptly as practicable after the Closing
Date. To the extent that the Company or any of the CompanyÂ’s Affiliates has
any performance obligations under any Continuing Support Obligations from and
after the Closing, the Acquiror shall use reasonable best efforts to (x)
perform, or cause its Affiliates to perform, such obligations on behalf of the
Company or such Affiliate or (y) otherwise take such action as reasonably
requested by the Company or such Affiliate so as to put the Company or such
Affiliate in the same position as if the Acquiror had performed or was
performing such obligations.

 

Section 5.10 _Termination of Certain Support Services and Affiliated
Transactions._

 

(a) The Acquiror acknowledges that the Business currently receives from the
Company and its Affiliates certain administrative and corporate services and
benefits of a type generally provided to other businesses and Subsidiaries of
the Company, each category of which is set forth on _Section_ __ _ 5.10(a)_
of the Disclosure Schedule (the " _Support Services_ "). The Acquiror and the
Company acknowledge that, except as provided in the Transition Services
Agreement, the Support Services shall cease at Closing, and all agreements and
arrangements (whether or not in writing) in respect thereof shall terminate
as of the Closing, with no further obligation of any party thereto.

 



41

    

(b) All Contracts required to be disclosed on  _Section_ __ _ 3.18_ of
the Disclosure Schedule shall be terminated on or prior to the Closing such
that, following the Closing, no party to any such Contract will have any
further Liability thereunder.

 

Section 5.11 _Pre-Closing Insurance Matters_.

 

(a) The Acquiror acknowledges that the policies and insurance coverage
maintained on behalf of or for the benefit of the Business are part of the
corporate insurance program maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries
(such policies, the " _Corporate Policies_ "), and such policies will not be
transferred to the Acquiror or the Business. On and after the Closing, except
as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)_, the Company shall retain all right,
title and interest in and to the Corporate Policies, including the right to
any credit or return premiums due, paid or payable in connection with the
termination thereof. Except during the six-year period after the Closing as
provided in _Section_ __ _ 5.11(b)_, the Acquiror shall not, and shall cause
its Affiliates not to, assert, by way of claim, Action or otherwise, any
right to any Corporate Policy or any benefits under any such Corporate Policy.

 

(b) With respect to any events or circumstances pertaining to the Business
that relate to the period prior to the Closing and are eligible for coverage
under any occurrence-based Corporate Policy in effect as of the Closing (such
events or circumstances, a " _Pre-Closing Insurance Matter_"), for a period
of six (6) years after the Closing, the Company will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to provide the Acquiror with access to such Corporate
Policies and shall reasonably cooperate with the Acquiror, and take
commercially reasonable actions to assist the Acquiror in submitting claims
with respect to such Pre-Closing Insurance Matter. For a period of six (6)
years after the Closing, the Company will renew on substantially similar terms
all claims made and discovery-based Corporate Policies that are in effect at
the time of the Closing that would provide coverage for the Business for
events or circumstances pertaining to the Business that relate to the period
prior to the Closing and will use its commercially reasonable efforts to
provide the Acquiror with access to such policies. The Acquiror and its
Affiliates shall be solely responsible for (i) any deductibles or self-insured
retentions with respect to such Pre-Closing Insurance Matter, (ii) any out-of-
pocket costs and expenses of the Company or its Subsidiaries (including
reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees) with respect to such Pre-Closing Insurance Matter
that are not covered under the relevant Corporate Policy and (iii) any
collateral requirements with respect to such Pre-Closing Insurance Matter. For
the avoidance of doubt, neither the Acquiror nor any of its Affiliates shall
have, and the Acquiror shall not and shall cause its Affiliates not to seek,
(x) any rights with respect to any self-insurance programs of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, (y) any rights under any fronting insurance programs
or arrangements of the Company or its Subsidiaries or (z) any rights to cause
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to pay any deductible or self-insured
retention amount with respect to any claim. To the extent the Company or its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, have claims under any Corporate Policy and such
claims (along with any other claims previously made under the relevant
Corporate Policy), together with the claims for any Pre-Closing Insurance
Matter, would exceed the maximum coverage available under such Corporate
Policy, the claims of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall take precedence
over the Pre-Closing Insurance Matter. The Acquiror shall notify the Company
promptly of any such Pre-Closing Insurance Matter for which it seeks coverage
on behalf of the Business and each party shall keep the other fully informed
regarding the status of the Pre-Closing Insurance Matter. The Company and
its Subsidiaries shall have no obligation to maintain any Corporate Policies
beyond their current terms.

Section 5.12 _Retained Litigation_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company
shall, at its own expense, or at the expense of its insurers or indemnitors,
and with counsel selected by the Company or its insurers in their sole
discretion (" _Company Counsel_ "), have the right to continue to direct,
prosecute and defend the Retained Litigation in its sole discretion. After
the Closing, the Acquiror shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and its
AffiliatesÂ’ Representatives to, in each case at the CompanyÂ’s sole cost and
expense, reasonably cooperate with the Company in connection with
the prosecution and defense by the Company of the Retained Litigation,
including by (i) making Business personnel reasonably available for
interviews, consultations, preparation, meetings, depositions, trial
testimonies or pre-testimony preparation, physically (in each case only to the
extent in or around Tulsa, Oklahoma, except in the event of an actual trial
located elsewhere) or telephonically, in each case, as the Company or Company
Counsel shall request in writing with as much advance notice as practicable
given the applicable circumstances (provided, that, to the extent such
Business personnel are made available to the Company pursuant to this clause
(i), they shall be deemed to be consultants of the Company in connection with
any such assistance so provided), and (ii) providing the Company and Company
Counsel access to, such information, documents and records as shall be
necessary for the prosecution and defense of the Retained Litigation (in each
case only to the extent the Company or Company Counsel do not have access to
such information, documents and records following the Closing), and the
Acquiror shall retain such information, documents and records upon the
CompanyÂ’s or Company CounselÂ’s written request. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to schedule any such activity in a manner that is the
least inconvenient for the Acquiror and its personnel and nothing in this
Agreement shall require the Acquiror or any of its Affiliates (including the
Business) to file any claims or other court papers or actively initiate any
claim for Losses relating to the Retained Litigation against any Person. In
the event of any deposition, testimony or other similar proceedings involving
the Acquiror or its Affiliates or their respective Representatives, the
Acquiror shall be permitted to participate therein with one counsel of its own
at the CompanyÂ’s sole cost and expense.

(b) The Company and its insurers, in their sole discretion, shall have the
right to settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with
respect to the Retained Litigation; provided, however, that the Company may
not enter into any settlement or compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment with respect thereto without the prior written consent of the
Acquiror to the extent the proposed settlement, compromise or judgment (i)
would result in any restrictions on the operations of the Acquiror, its
Affiliates or the Business (other than requirements that such Persons operate
in accordance with applicable Laws and de minimis procedural requirements), or
(ii) would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the reputation of the
Acquiror, its Affiliates or the Business in any material respect, including
through an admission of wrongdoing by any such Person. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Company entering into a settlement agreement that does not contain
an admission of wrongdoing will not be deemed to adversely affect the
reputation of the Acquiror, its Affiliates or the Business for the purposes
of this _Section_ __ _ 5.12(b)_ in any material respect. The Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause such settlement agreement to contain
customary confidentiality provisions applicable to each party thereto.

 



43

    

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, (i) the Company shall,
without duplication, pay (or shall cause to be paid) promptly, and in any
event within ten (10) Business Days following the AcquirorÂ’s written request,
all out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the Acquiror, its Affiliates and
their respective Representatives in connection with all cooperation related to
the Retained Litigation (whether specifically contemplated by this _Section_
__ _ 5.12_ or otherwise), and (ii) any obligations under any such settlement,
compromise or judgment contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 5.12(b)_ shall be
deemed to be Excluded Liabilities hereunder.

Section 5.13 _Collection of Receivables_. The Acquiror shall have the
right and authority, from and after the Closing, to collect for its own
account all Receivables of the Business included in the Transferred Assets
(the " _Closing Receivables_ ") and to endorse with the name of the Company
any checks or drafts received with respect to any Closing Receivables. From
and after the Closing, the Company shall (i) deliver to the Acquiror such
documentation of, and information relating to, the Closing Receivables as
the Acquiror shall reasonably request and (ii) promptly deliver to the
Acquiror any cash or other property received by the Company and its Affiliates
in respect of any Receivables to be transferred pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
2.1(a)(iv)_ and the Acquiror shall reimburse the Company for its reasonable
and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection therewith. From
and after the Closing Date, the Acquiror promptly shall deliver or cause to be
delivered to the Company any proceeds of Receivables received directly or
indirectly by the Acquiror with respect to any Excluded Assets or businesses
or assets of the Company and its Affiliates other than the Transferred Assets
or the Business, and the Company shall reimburse the Acquiror for its
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection
therewith. Each party shall reasonably cooperate with the other party in
furtherance of the foregoing.

 

Section 5.14 _Post-Closing Cooperation_.

 

(a) After the Closing, upon reasonable notice, the Acquiror and the Company
shall furnish or cause to be furnished to each other and their employees,
counsel, auditors and other Representatives reasonable access (including the
ability to make copies), during normal business hours, to such employees,
counsel, auditors and other Representatives, Books and Records within the
control of such party or any of its Affiliates as is reasonably necessary for
(i) financial reporting, Tax and accounting matters and (ii) defense or
prosecution of litigation and disputes with third parties.

 

(b) Each of the Company and the Acquiror will retain all Books and Records
and other documents pertaining to the Business in existence on the Closing
Date for a period equal to the earlier of five (5) years following the Closing
and the dissolution of the Company or the Acquiror, as the case may be,
pursuant to applicable Law; _provided_ that no such Books and Records or
other documents shall be destroyed or disposed of by any retaining party
during such five (5) year period without first advising the other party in
writing and giving such party a reasonable opportunity to obtain
possession thereof for the purposes permitted by this _Section_ __ _ 5.14_.

 



44

    

(c) Each party shall reimburse the other for reasonable out-of-pocket costs
and expenses incurred in assisting the other pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
5.14_. Neither party shall be required by this _Section 5.14_ to take any
action that would unreasonably interfere with the conduct of its business or
unreasonably disrupt its normal operations.

 

Section 5.15 _License to Company Marks_.

 

(a) The Company hereby grants to Acquiror and its Affiliates a
worldwide, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-assignable, royalty free and
fully paid-up license to use the Company Marks, solely in a manner consistent
with past practice and customary "phase out" use: (i) on websites, for 30 days
after the Closing Date; (ii) on business cards, purchase orders, invoices,
sales orders, letterhead, shipping documents and other materials, for 90 days
after the Closing Date (provided that the Acquiror shall, as soon as
practicable after the Closing Date, use commercially reasonable efforts to
make clear in such materials that it is not currently affiliated with the
Company); and (iii) on all other materials such as signs, products and product
packaging, for 180 days after the Closing Date.

 

(b) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section_ __ _ 5.15_, the
Acquiror and its Affiliates shall cease and discontinue all uses of the
Company Marks on the Closing Date; _provided_ , that, for the avoidance of
doubt, the Acquiror and its Affiliates shall be permitted, subject to
_Section_ __ _ 11.4_, to communicate to third parties in a non-trademark
manner that the Acquiror has purchased the Business from the Company and
reference the CompanyÂ’s name in a non-trademark manner in such
communications.

(c) The Acquiror, for itself and its Affiliates, acknowledges and agrees
that, except to the extent expressly provided in this _Section_ __ _ 5.15_,
neither the Acquiror nor any of its Affiliates shall have any rights to use
any of the Company Marks and neither the Acquiror nor any of its Affiliates
shall contest the ownership or validity of any rights of the Company or any
of its Affiliates in or to any of the Company Marks.

 

Section 5.16 _Non-Competition;  Non-Hire_.

(a) The Company agrees that from the Closing until the fourth (4th)
anniversary of the Closing, it will not (and will cause its Controlled
Affiliates not to), directly or indirectly, engage in, manage, participate in,
operate, control or invest in any business anywhere in the world that is
competitive with the Business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section_
__ _ 5.16(a)_ shall not prohibit (i) the Company, directly or through any
Controlled Affiliate, from conducting any business activities conducted by it
as of the date of this Agreement (other than the Business), and the business
activities required of the Company pursuant to the Ancillary Agreements and
pursuant to this Agreement; (ii) the Company, directly or through any
Controlled Affiliate, from investing in or holding not more than 10% of the
outstanding capital stock or other ownership interests of any Person, in each
case so long as such investment or interest is passive and the Company does
not receive any board representation or other control rights in connection
therewith; and (iii) the Company, directly or through any Controlled
Affiliate, from hereafter acquiring and continuing to own and operate any
entity which has operations that compete with the Business if such
operations account for no more than 10% of such entityÂ’s consolidated
revenues at the time of such acquisition. __

 



45

    

(b) The Company agrees that from the Closing until the second
(2nd) anniversary of the Closing, it will not, and will cause its Controlled
Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, solicit for employment or hire any
employee of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
this  _Section_ __ _ 5.16(b)_ shall not be violated by the solicitation or
hiring of any such employee (i) through advertisements in newspapers, trade
periodicals or the like (or other solicitations directed at the public,
or general segments of the public, in general) or through the services of
executive search firms engaged in a broad-based search (and not engaged for
the purpose of circumventing such provisions), in each case, so long as such
advertisements or searches are not specifically targeted at employees of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) who has left the employment of Parent
and its Subsidiaries at least six (6) months prior to such solicitation or
hiring or (iii) whose employment has been terminated by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries.

(c) The Acquiror agrees that from the Closing until the second (2nd)
anniversary of the Closing, it will not, and will cause its Controlled
Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, solicit for employment or hire any
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, this _Section_ __ _ 5.16(c)_ shall not be violated by the
solicitation or hiring of any such employee (i) through advertisements in
newspapers, trade periodicals or the like (or other solicitations directed at
the public, or general segments of the public, in general) or through the
services of executive search firms engaged in a broad-based search (and not
engaged for the purpose of circumventing such provisions), in each case, so
long as such advertisements or searches are not specifically targeted at
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) who has left the
employment of the Company and its Subsidiaries at least six (6) months prior
to such solicitation or hiring or (iii) whose employment has been terminated
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(d) If a final judgment of a court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction
determines that any term or provision contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.16_
is invalid or unenforceable, then the parties agree that the court or tribunal
will have the power (but without affecting the right of the Company or the
Acquiror to obtain the relief provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 5.16_ in
any jurisdiction other than such courtÂ’s or tribunalÂ’s jurisdiction) to reduce
the scope, duration or geographic area of the term or provision, to delete
specific words or phrases or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable
term or provision. To the extent it may effectively do so under applicable
Law, each of the Company and the Acquiror hereby waives on its own behalf and
on behalf of its successors, any provision of Law which renders any provision
of this _Section_ __ _ 5.16_ invalid, void or unenforceable in any respect.

 

(e) Each of the Company and the Acquiror acknowledges and agrees that the
remedy of indemnity payments pursuant to  _Article X_ and other remedies at
law for any breach of the requirements of this _Section_ __ _ 5.16_ would be
inadequate, and agrees and consents that without intending to limit any
additional remedies that may be available, temporary and permanent injunctive
and other equitable relief may be granted without proof of actual damage or
inadequacy of legal remedy, in any proceeding which may be brought to enforce
any of the provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.16_. The parties mutually
agree that this _Section_ __ _ 5.15_ is reasonable and necessary to protect
and preserve the CompanyÂ’s and the AcquirorÂ’s legitimate business interests
and the value of the Business, the Transferred Assets and the CompanyÂ’s other
businesses, and to prevent any unfair advantage conferred on any party and
their respective successors.

 



46

    

Section 5.17 _Post-Closing Confidentiality_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its
SubsidiariesÂ’ other Representatives to, keep confidential and not use any non-
public information relating to the Business, the Transferred Assets and the
Assumed Liabilities (such information, the " _Business Confidential
Information_ "). In the event the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
required by any judicial, administrative, legislative or regulatory body (a "
_Legal Process_ ") to disclose any of the Business Confidential Information,
the Company or such Subsidiary shall provide the Acquiror with prompt prior
written notice of any such requirement, to the extent permitted by such Legal
Process, so that the Acquiror may seek a protective order or other
appropriate remedy or waive compliance with the provisions of this _Section_
__ _ 5.17(a)_. If, in the absence of a protective order or other remedy or
the receipt of a waiver by the Acquiror, the Company or such Subsidiary are
nonetheless required by such Legal Process to disclose Business Confidential
Information, the Company or such Subsidiary may disclose to the applicable
Governmental Entity only that portion of the Business
Confidential Information which counsel to the Company or such Subsidiary
advises the Company or such Subsidiary is legally required to be disclosed;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company or such Subsidiary shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain assurances that confidential
treatment will be accorded to the disclosed portion of such Business
Confidential Information.

 

(b) From and after the Closing, the Acquiror shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its
SubsidiariesÂ’ other Representatives to, keep confidential and not use any non-
public information relating to the Company, its Subsidiaries and the CompanyÂ’s
and its SubsidiariesÂ’ businesses (other than the Business) (such information,
the " _Company Confidential Information_ "). In the event the Acquiror or any
of its Subsidiaries is required by any Legal Process to disclose any of the
Company Confidential Information, the Acquiror or such Subsidiary shall
provide the Company with prompt prior written notice of any such requirement,
to the extent permitted by such Legal Process, so that the Company may seek a
protective order or other appropriate remedy or waive compliance with the
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.17(b)_. If, in the absence of a
protective order or other remedy or the receipt of a waiver by the Company,
the Acquiror or such Subsidiary are nonetheless required by such Legal
Process to disclose Company Confidential Information, the Acquiror or such
Subsidiary may disclose to the applicable Governmental Entity only that
portion of the Company Confidential Information which counsel to the Acquiror
or such Subsidiary advises the Acquiror or such Subsidiary is legally required
to be disclosed; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Acquiror or such Subsidiary
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain assurances that
confidential treatment will be accorded to the disclosed portion of such
Company Confidential Information.

 



47

    

Section 5.18 _Expenses; Transfer Taxes_.

 

(a) Whether or not the Closing takes place, and except as otherwise
specified in this Agreement, all costs and expenses incurred in connection
with this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby shall be paid by the party incurring such
expense.

 

(b) All sales (including bulk sales), use, value added, documentary, stamp,
gross receipts, registration, transfer, conveyance, excise, recording,
license, stock transfer stamps and other similar Taxes and fees (" _Transfer
Taxes_ ") applicable to the conveyance and transfer from the Company to the
Acquiror of the Business or the Transferred Assets shall be borne equally
(i.e., 50/50) by the Company and the Acquiror. The parties shall cooperate in
timely filling any Tax Returns required in connection with the payment of such
Transfer Taxes. Each party shall use reasonable efforts to avail itself of
any available exemptions from any such Transfer Taxes and to cooperate with
the other parties in providing any information and documentation that may be
necessary to obtain such exemptions. 

Section 5.19 _Misallocated Assets_. If, following the Closing, any right,
property or asset not included in the Transferred Assets is found to have
been transferred to the Acquiror in error, either directly or indirectly, the
Acquiror shall transfer, or shall cause its Affiliates to transfer, at no cost
to the Company, such right, property or asset (and any related Liability) as
soon as practicable to the Company. If, following the Closing, any right,
property or asset included in the Transferred Assets is found to have been
retained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in error, either directly
or indirectly, the Company shall transfer, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
transfer, at no additional cost to the Acquiror, such right, property or asset
(and any related Liability) as soon as practicable to the Acquiror.

 

Section 5.20 _Further Assurances_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, at any time and from time to time after the Closing, at the
request of either party hereto and without further consideration, the other
party shall execute and deliver to such requesting party such other
instruments of sale, transfer, conveyance, assignment and confirmation,
provide such materials and information and take such other actions as such
party may reasonably request in order to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 5.21 _Change of Name_. Within thirty (30) days following the
Closing, the Company shall change the name of Harsco Industrial Air-X-
Changers Pty. Ltd. to a name that does not contain (a) "Air-X-Changers", any
confusingly similar derivative thereof, or any other confusingly similar name,
or (b) any other name that is confusingly similar to any of the Transferred
IP.

Section 5.22 _Transfer of Indian Assets of the Business_. (i) Upon
the acceptance of an offer of employment from the Acquiror or any of its
Affiliates by an Indian Business Employee prior to the one (1) year
anniversary of the Closing, the Company shall cause each applicable Indian
Subsidiary which owns or holds any rights to any assets Related to the
Business that are used by such Indian Business Employee in connection with its
employment engagement or other services for the Company or its Subsidiaries to
transfer such assets to an 

 



48

    

 Affiliate of the Acquiror designated thereby (in each case without any
consideration paid therefor), and (ii) at any time prior to the one (1) year
anniversary of the Closing, upon the AcquirorÂ’s written request, the Company
shall cause each applicable Indian Subsidiary which owns or holds any rights
to any assets Related to the Business not specifically used by any such Indian
Business Employee to transfer such assets to an Affiliate of the Acquiror
designated thereby (in each case without any consideration paid therefor),
which assets shall include, for the avoidance of doubt, at least the items set
forth on _Section_ __ _ 5.22_ of the Disclosure Schedule (the assets
referred to in clauses (i) and (ii), collectively, the " _Indian Business
Assets_ "). Such transfer shall be effected by a short-form assignment and
assumption, sale or other similar short-form transfer agreement, including,
as necessary, notices of transfer, notarial deeds, powers of attorney and any
other ancillary agreements or documents reasonably requested by the Acquiror,
in all cases subject to and conforming with the requirements of applicable
local Law and the organizational documents of the applicable transferee and
transferor (collectively, the " _Local Agreements_ "). The parties shall
negotiate in good faith the provisions of the Local Agreements under the
fundamental principle that the operative provisions governing the transaction
contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 5.22_ shall be contained in this
Agreement to the maximum extent practicable so as to avoid confusion regarding
the terms of such transaction, and if there is any ambiguity, discrepancy or
conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and any Local Agreement,
then the provisions of this Agreement shall prevail. Unless otherwise required
by applicable local Law, the Local Agreements shall not contain any
representations, warranties, covenants, indemnities or conditions. Upon
consummation of the transfer of any Indian Business Asset, such Indian
Business Asset will be deemed to be a Transferred Asset for purposes of this
Agreement.

Section 5.23 _Transfer of Title to Vehicles_. As soon as practicable
following the Closing (and in any event within thirty (30) days thereafter),
the Company shall cause the title to each vehicle included in the Transferred
Assets to be transferred to, and registered in, the AcquirorÂ’s name with each
applicable Governmental Entity (and the Acquiror shall reasonably cooperate
with the Company in connection therewith).

ARTICLE VI

 

EMPLOYEE MATTERS

 

Section 6.1 _Business Employees; Continuation of Employment and Employee
Benefits_.

 

(a) The Acquiror shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, make
offers of employment to all Business Employees other than Inactive Business
Employees (the " _Active Business Employees_ ") as soon as practicable after
the date hereof but in no event less than fifteen (15) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date (or such other period required by applicable Law), to be
effective as of the Closing, on terms and conditions of employment in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 6.1(b)_. Each such offer of employment shall
include a consent, consistent with applicable Law, pursuant to which such
Business Employee may choose to elect to roll over to the Acquiror such
Business EmployeeÂ’s accrued and unused vacation and paid time off balances
(the " _PTO Rollover_ "). With respect to any Inactive Business Employee, the
Acquiror shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, make an offer of
employment (including a consent, consistent with applicable Law, to choose to
elect to effect the PTO Rollover) to each such individual on the
earliest practicable date following the return of such individual to work
with the Company, to be effective upon acceptance, provided that such Inactive
Business Employee returns to work

 



49

    

 within nine (9) months following the Closing Date (or such longer period as
required by applicable Law). Following the date hereof and while the Acquiror
has outstanding obligations pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.1(a)_, the
Company shall promptly notify the Acquiror of the occurrence of the end of any
such leave of absence with respect to any Inactive Business Employee. The
Company shall retain all costs, expenses and Liabilities related to any
Inactive Business Employee that arise out of or accrue as a result of an event
or events that occur on, prior to or as of the date that any Inactive Business
Employee commences employment with the Acquiror or an Affiliate thereof in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Each Active Business Employee and
Inactive Business Employee who accepts the offer of employment from the
Acquiror or any of its Affiliates is referred to herein as a " _Transferred
Employee_."

(b) From the Closing and until the twelve (12) month anniversary of the
Closing, the Acquiror shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, provide to each
Transferred Employee: (i) at least the same base salary or wage rate in effect
as of immediately prior to the Closing and at least the same cash incentive
target bonus opportunities, in each case, as is provided to such Transferred
Employee immediately prior to Closing (excluding any retention, equity and
equity-based compensation opportunities) and (ii) employee benefits (including
perquisites, vacation and severance benefits, but excluding any defined
benefit pension, nonqualified retirement, equity, equity-based compensation
opportunities, and voluntary benefit programs) which are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to those employee benefits provided to such
Transferred Employee immediately prior to the Closing, except, in each case,
as may otherwise be required under an individual arrangement or written
employment agreement as set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 6.1(b)_ of the
Disclosure Schedule. For the avoidance of doubt, the Acquiror shall be solely
responsible hereunder for the payment of 2019 annual performance bonuses.

 

Section 6.2 _401(k) Plan_. As soon as administratively practicable
following the Closing Date, the Company and the Acquiror shall discuss the
transfer of the assets and liabilities relating to the account balances
attributable to the Transferred Employees, including any promissory notes
evidencing outstanding loan balances, under the CompanyÂ’s tax-qualified
defined contribution plan (the " _Company_ _Â’_ _s 401(k) Plan_ ") to a defined
contribution plan sponsored or maintained by the Acquiror or one of its
Affiliates (the " _Acquiror_ _Â’_ _s 401(k) Plan_ ") (a " _Trust to Trust
Transfer_ "). Solely to the extent the Company and the Acquiror mutually agree
to effect a Trust to Trust Transfer, the Company shall cause to
be transferred from the CompanyÂ’s 401(k) Plan the assets and liabilities
relating to the Transferred Employee account balances (including any
promissory notes evidencing outstanding loan balances) and the Acquiror shall
cause the Acquiror 401(k) Plan to accept such transfer of assets and
liabilities and, effective as of the date of such transfer, to assume and
fully perform the obligations of the CompanyÂ’s 401(k) Plan relating to the
accounts of the Transferred Employees whose balances were transferred to the
AcquirorÂ’s 401(k) Plan. Such transfer of assets and liabilities shall consist
of a transfer in kind of all such account balances and shall be conducted in
accordance with the requirements of all applicable Laws, including Section
414(l) of the Code. To the extent a Trust to Trust Transfer is not mutually
agreed, the Acquiror and the Company shall each take all actions necessary to
provide that Transferred Employees who so elect may make a direct rollover
(as described in Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) of his or her account

the foregoing, including by providing the FSA ParticipantsÂ’ claims history, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, under the Company FSA in order to
verify the FSA Balances. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Business Employee

be an FSA Balance.

 

Section 6.5 _COBRA_. The Acquiror shall provide, or shall cause its

life, disability and other similar benefits) to any participating Transferred
Employees for all claims incurred prior to the Closing Date under and subject

defend and hold the Company and its Affiliates harmless from and against any
and all Liability of any kind or nature involving or related to the employment
of the Transferred Employees by the Acquiror or its Affiliates from and after

no current or former employee, director or independent contractor or any other
individual associated therewith or any Person other than the parties to this
Agreement shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of

of its Affiliates to amend or terminate any employee benefit plan, or require
the Acquiror or any of its Affiliates to establish or maintain any specific
employee benefit plan, (ii) require the Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries

in an instrument in writing expressly waiving or extending such agreement,
condition, term or

 



57

    

 provision signed by the party granting such extension or waiver. Neither the
waiver by any of the parties hereto of a breach of or a default under any of
the provisions of this Agreement, nor the failure or delay by any of the
parties, on one or more occasions, to enforce any of the provisions of this

(c) Upon receipt of a notice of a claim for indemnity from an Indemnified
Party pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 10.3(a)_ that is not a Third Party Claim
(such claim, a " _Direct Claim_ "), the Indemnifying Party shall have a period
of thirty (30) days within which to evaluate and respond in writing to
any Direct Claim. If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified
Party of its objection to such Direct Claim within such thirty (30) day-
period, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have accepted and agreed
with such Direct Claim. If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified
Party of its objection to such Direct Claim within such thirty (30) day-
period, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall, during the
thirty (30) days following receipt by the Indemnified Party of the
Indemnifying PartyÂ’s objection notice, attempt to resolve their dispute with
respect to such Direct Claim. If the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Party are unable to resolve their dispute with respect to such Direct Claim
within such thirty (30) day-period, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
pursue such remedies as may be available to it under this Agreement.

(d) Upon receipt of a notice of a claim for indemnity from an
Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.3(a)_ that is a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have at any time the right (but not the
obligation) to assume the defense and control of such Third Party Claim at its
sole cost and expense and with its own counsel if the Indemnifying Party
provides written notice to the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party
intends to undertake such defense and if (i) the Indemnifying PartyÂ’s counsel
is reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, (ii) the Indemnifying
Party provides written confirmation to the Indemnified Party of the
Indemnifying PartyÂ’s obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party, subject to
the limitations set forth in this _Article X_ , with respect to any Losses
with respect to such Third Party Claim, (iii) such Third Party Claim involves
only monetary damages and is not a criminal or quasi-criminal Action and does
not seek any material injunction or other material equitable relief against
any Indemnified Party, and (iv) such Third Party Claim is not asserted by (or
does not substantively involve) one of the then existing ten (10) largest
customers of the Business (as measured by sales of the Business for the
immediately preceding twelve (12) months) or any Governmental Entity. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense and control of such claim, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right (but not the obligation)
to participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim with its own separate
counsel and at its own expense (other than any fees

 



60

    

 and expenses of such separate counsel that are incurred between the date the
Indemnified Party provides the Indemnifying Party with the notice of such
Third Party Claim and the date the Indemnifying Party effectively assumes
control of such defense, which fees and expenses shall, notwithstanding the
foregoing but subject to the limitations set forth in this _Article X_ , be
borne by the Indemnifying Party to the extent the underlying matter is
determined to be subject to indemnification pursuant to this _Article X_ );
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Party may hire separate counsel,
and the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel shall be borne by the
Indemnifying Party (A) if the Indemnifying Party fails to actively and
diligently conduct the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified
Party has notified the Indemnifying Party of such failure and the Indemnifying
Party does not cure such failure within twenty (20) Business Days following
receipt of such notice, (B) upon reasonable advice of counsel to the
Indemnified Party that a conflict or potential conflict exists between the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party that would make such separate
representation advisable or (C) if one or more defenses are available to the
Indemnified Party that are not available to the Indemnifying Party. In the
event the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of (or otherwise elects to
negotiate or settle or compromise) a Third Party Claim as described above, the
Indemnified Party shall reimburse the Indemnifying Party for all costs and
expenses incurred by the Indemnifying Party in connection with such defense
(or negotiation, settlement or compromise) to the extent, if applicable, that
such costs and expenses do not exceed the amount of the remaining Deductible
Amount. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or
prosecute any such Third Party Claim, all of the parties hereto shall
reasonably cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof, including by (1)
retaining and providing the records and information of the Indemnified Party
that is relevant to such Third Party Claim and (2) making available employees
on a mutually convenient basis for providing additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. The Indemnifying Party shall
not consent to a settlement or compromise of, or the entry of any judgment
arising from, any Third Party Claim, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), except to the extent the proposed settlement, compromise or
judgment (x) includes an express, complete and unconditional general release
by the Person asserting the Third Party Claim of the Indemnified Party from
all Liabilities in respect of such Third Party Claim with prejudice, (y) does
not require any admission or finding of wrong doing on behalf of the
Indemnified Party and (z) does not impose any injunctive or other equitable
remedies or other obligation on the Indemnified Party other than the payment
of money damages for which such Indemnified Party will be indemnified. The
Indemnified Party shall not consent to any settlement or compromise of, or the
entry of any judgment arising from, any Third Party Claim, without the prior
written consent of the Indemnifying Party (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

Section 10.4 _Exclusive Remedies_. Except with respect to the matters
covered by _Sections 2.7_ through  _2.9_ , in the case of Fraud and other
than with respect to any equitable remedies contemplated by _Section_ __ _
11.11_, the Company and the Acquiror acknowledge and agree that, following the
Closing, (x) the indemnification provisions of this _Article X_ shall be the
sole and exclusive legal remedies for monetary damages of any Company
Indemnified Party and any Acquiror Indemnified Party, respectively, in each
case, for any Losses (including any Losses from claims for breach of
contract, warranty, tortious conduct (including negligence) or otherwise and
whether predicated on common law, statute, strict liability, or otherwise)
that it may at any time suffer or incur, or become subject to, as a result
of, or in connection with, this

 



61

    

 Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including any breach of
any representation or warranty in this Agreement by the Acquiror or the
Company, respectively, or any failure by the Acquiror or the Company,
respectively, to perform or comply with any covenant or agreement set forth
herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the parties hereto
hereby irrevocably waive any right of rescission they may otherwise have or
to which they may become entitled.

Section 10.5 _Additional Indemnification Provisions_.

 

(a) The amount which the Indemnifying Party is or may be required to pay to
any Indemnified Party pursuant to this  _Article X_ shall be reduced
(retroactively, if necessary, pursuant to the following sentence) by any
insurance proceeds or other amounts actually received by such Indemnified
Party or any of its Affiliates in reduction of the related Losses (in each
case net of all reasonable out-of-pocket costs of any such enforcement,
including deductibles and retro-premium adjustments and reasonable
attorneysÂ’ fees). If an Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates receives
an indemnification payment required by this Agreement from the Indemnifying
Party in respect of Losses and shall subsequently receive insurance proceeds
or other amounts in respect of such Losses from other third Persons, then
such Indemnified Party or Affiliate, as the case may be, shall promptly repay
to the Indemnifying Party a sum equal to the amount of such insurance proceeds
or other amounts actually received to the extent such amount would give rise
to a double recovery by such Indemnified Party (in each case net of all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs of any such enforcement, including deductibles
and retro-premium adjustments and reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees).

(b) If an Indemnifying Party makes any payment for any Losses suffered or
incurred by an Indemnified Party pursuant to the provisions of this _Article
X_ , such Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated, to the extent of such
payment, to all rights and remedies of the Indemnified Party to any insurance
benefits or other claims of the Indemnified Party against insurance companies
with respect to such Losses and with respect to the claim giving rise to such
Losses.

 

(c) If any fact, circumstance or condition forming a basis for a claim for
indemnification under this _Article X_  shall overlap with any fact,
circumstance, condition, agreement or event forming the basis of any other
claim for indemnification under this _Article X,_ there shall be no
duplication in the calculation of the amount of the Losses. In
addition, neither the Company nor the Acquiror shall have any Liability under
this _Article X_ for the amount of any Losses specifically included in the
calculation of the Final Net Working Capital.

 

(d) The parties agree to treat all payments made by or deemed to be made by
a party under this _Article X_ as adjustments to the Purchase Price for all
Tax purposes to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law.

 

Section 10.6 _Mitigatio_ _n_. Each of the parties agrees to take all
commercially reasonable steps to avoid, minimize and mitigate its Losses upon
and after becoming aware of any event or condition that would reasonably be
expected to give rise to any Losses that are indemnifiable hereunder, in each
case to the extent required by and in accordance with New York Law.

 



62

    

Section 10.7 _Limitation on Liability_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, none of the parties hereto shall be liable for
special, punitive, exemplary, incidental, consequential or indirect damages or
loss of revenue, income or profits, diminution of value or loss of
business reputation or opportunity of any other party or any of the other
Acquiror Indemnified Parties or Company Indemnified Parties, as applicable,
whether based on contract, tort, strict liability, other Law or otherwise and
whether or not arising from any such PersonÂ’s sole, joint or concurrent
negligence, strict liability or other fault, for any matter relating to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and in particular, no
"multiple of profits" or "multiple of cash flow" or similar valuation
methodology shall be used in calculating the amount of any Losses (" _Non-
Reimbursable Losses_"); _provided_ , _however_ , that any such amounts that
are actually required to be paid to third parties pursuant to a Third Party
Claim shall not be deemed to constitute Non- Reimbursable Losses.

Section 11.5 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any Law or
as a matter of public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties to
this Agreement shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement be consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent
possible.

 

Section 11.6 _Entire Agreement_. The Transaction Agreements, together with
the Confidentiality Agreement, constitute the entire agreement of the parties
hereto with respect to the subject matter of the Transaction Agreements and
supersede all prior agreements, undertakings and understandings, both written
and oral between or on behalf of the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter of the Transaction Agreements.

Section 11.7 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assigned by
operation of Law or otherwise without the prior written consent of each other
party, except that the Acquiror may assign all or any of its rights and
obligations hereunder to any Affiliate of the Acquiror;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no such assignment shall relieve the Acquiror of its
obligations hereunder.

 

Section 11.8 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in
_Article X_ with respect to the Company Indemnified Parties and the Acquiror
Indemnified Parties, this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties to
this Agreement and their permitted successors and assigns and nothing in this
Agreement or any other Transaction Agreements, including _Article VI_ hereto,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person,
including any employee or former employee of the Company or the Business, or
entity any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever, including any rights of employment for any specified period, under
or by reason of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Financing Sources may enforce on behalf of the
Financing Sources Related Parties (and each is an intended third party
beneficiary of) the provisions of this proviso to _Section_ __ _ 11.8_ and
_Section_ __ _ 11.9_, _Section_ __ _ 11.11_,  _Section_ __ _ 11.12(c)_ and
_Section_ __ _ 11.17_.

 

Section 11.9 _Amendment_. No provision of this Agreement, including any
Exhibits or Disclosure Schedule hereto, may be amended, supplemented or
modified except by a written instrument making specific reference hereto or
thereto signed by each party hereto. No consent from any Indemnified Party
under _Article X_ (other than the parties to this Agreement) shall be
required in order to amend this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, the proviso to _Section_ __ _ 11.8_, this
_Section_ __ _ 11.9_, Section 11.11,  _Section_ __ _ 11.12(c)_ and
_Section_ __ _ 11.17_ (and any other provision of this Agreement to the
extent an amendment, modification, waiver or termination of such provision
would modify the substance of any of the

 



65

    

 foregoing provisions) may not be amended, modified, waived or terminated in
a manner that is materially adverse to a Financing Sources Related Party, as
applicable, without the prior written consent of the applicable Financing
Sources.

Section 11.10 _Disclosure Schedule_. Any disclosure with respect to a
Section of this Agreement, including any Section of the Disclosure Schedule,
shall be deemed to be disclosed for other Sections of this Agreement,
including any Section of the Disclosure Schedule, to the extent that the
applicability of such disclosure to such other Sections of this Agreement
(including such other Section of the Disclosure Schedule) is reasonably
apparent on the face of such disclosure. Matters reflected in any Section of
this Agreement, including any Section of the Disclosure Schedule, are not
necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement to be so reflected.
Such additional matters are set forth for informational purposes and do not
necessarily include other matters of a similar nature. No reference to or
disclosure of any item or other matter in any Section of this Agreement,
including any Section of the Disclosure Schedule, shall be construed as an
admission or indication that such item or other matter is material or that
such item or other matter is required to be referred to or disclosed in this
Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, no such reference to or disclosure
of a possible breach or violation of any Contract, Law or Governmental Order
shall be construed as an admission or indication that breach or violation
exists or has actually occurred.

Section 11.11 _Specific Performance_. Each party hereto acknowledges and
agrees that each other party would be irreparably damaged if any of the
provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms and that any breach of this Agreement by any such party could
not be adequately compensated by monetary damages alone. Accordingly, in
addition to any other right or remedy to which any party hereto may be
entitled at Law or in equity, before or after the Closing, each party shall
be entitled to seek to enforce any provision of this Agreement by a decree of
specific performance and to temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive
relief to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of any of the provisions of
this Agreement, without posting any bond or other undertaking. Each of the
parties hereto further agrees that it shall not object to, or take any
position inconsistent with respect to, whether in a court of Law or otherwise,
(i) the appropriateness of the specific performance contemplated by this
_Section_ __ _ 11.11_ and (ii) the exclusive jurisdiction of the New York
Courts with respect to any action brought for any such remedy. If any party
hereto brings any claim to enforce specifically the performance of the terms
and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
the End Date shall automatically be extended by the period of time between
the commencement of such claim and the date on which such claim is fully and
finally resolved. Each party hereto further agrees that (A) by seeking the
remedies provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 11.11_, a party hereto shall
not in any respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may
be available to such party under this Agreement or in the event that the
remedies provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 11.11_ are not available or
otherwise are not granted, and (B) nothing set forth in this _Section_ __ _
11.11 _shall require any party hereto to institute any Action for (or limit
any partyÂ’s right to institute any Action for) specific performance under
this _Section_ __ _ 11.11_ prior or as a condition to exercising any
termination right under _Article IX_ , nor shall the commencement of any
action pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 11.11_ or anything set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 11.11_ restrict or limit any such partyÂ’s right to terminate
this Agreement in accordance with _Article IX_ or pursue any other remedies
under this Agreement that may be available then or thereafter.

 



66

    

 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, neither the
Company nor any of its Affiliates and Representatives shall have any rights or
claims against any Financing Sources Related Party in connection with this
Agreement, the Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.
No Financing Sources Related Parties shall be subject to any special,
consequential, punitive or indirect damages or damages of a tortious nature.

Section 11.12 _Governing Law_ _; Consent to Jurisdiction_. This Agreement
and its enforcement, and any controversy arising out of or relating to the
making or performance of this Agreement, shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the law of the State of New York, without regard to New YorkÂ’s
principles of conflicts of law.

(a) Each party hereto irrevocably agrees that the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York and, if such court does not have
jurisdiction over such dispute, the Supreme Court of the State of New York
located in the Borough of Manhattan (including the applicable appellate courts
thereof, collectively, the " _New York Courts_ ") shall have exclusive
jurisdiction to settle any claims, differences or disputes which may arise out
of or in connection with this Agreement.

 

(b) Each party hereto irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the
jurisdiction of the New York Courts for such purpose and waives any objection
it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any proceedings in
any New York Court and any claim that any proceedings brought in any such
court have been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each party hereto further
irrevocably agrees that a final judgment in any proceedings brought in an
applicable New York Court shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties and
may be enforced in the courts of any other jurisdiction.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company (on behalf of itself and
each of its Affiliates and Representatives) agrees (i) that it will not bring
or support any Person in any Action of any kind or description, whether in law
or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any of the
Financing Sources Related Parties in any way arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Financing,
any letter or definitive agreement related thereto or the
performance thereof, other than in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York, sitting in the Borough of Manhattan (or, if
such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the Supreme Court of the State
of New York sitting in the Borough of Manhattan) and any appellate court
thereof, and submits for itself and its property with respect to any such
Action to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts; (ii) that all Actions
(whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against any of
the Financing Sources Related Parties in any way relating to the Financing,
any letter or definitive agreement related thereto or the performance thereof,
shall be exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
internal laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to principles or
rules or conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules would require
or permit the application of laws of another jurisdiction (except to the
extent contemplated by such letter or definitive agreement); and (iii) to
waive, and hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
any objection which any of them may now or hereafter have to the laying of
venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any
Action in any such court.

 



67

    

Section 11.13 _Bulk Sales Laws_. Each party hereto hereby waives
compliance by the Company with the provisions of the "bulk sales", "bulk
transfer" or similar Laws of any jurisdiction inside or outside the United
States that may otherwise be applicable with respect to the sale of any
of the Transferred Assets, and the Acquiror shall not withhold any portion of
the Purchase Price based on such non-compliance.

essence with respect to the fulfillment of the respective obligations of the
parties hereto and the Closing of the transactions contemplated by this

succeeding Business Day.

 

Section 11.16 _Counterparts_. Each of the Transaction Agreements may be
executed in one or more counterparts, and by the different parties to each
such agreement in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be
deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one
