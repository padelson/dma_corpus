                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER


         AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (hereinafter referred to as this
"Agreement"), dated September 29, 2004, by and among Cendant Corporation, a
Delaware corporation ("Parent"), Robertson Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware
corporation and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Purchaser"),
and Orbitz, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company").

         WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of Parent, Purchaser and the
Company has approved, and deems it advisable and in the best interests of its
respective stockholders to consummate, the acquisition of the Company by Parent
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein;

         WHEREAS, in furtherance thereof, it is proposed that Purchaser (i)
make a cash tender offer to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of
class A common stock, par value $0.001 (such shares the "Class A Shares" and
such offer the "Class A Offer") and (ii) make a cash tender offer to acquire
all of the issued and outstanding shares of each series of class B common
stock, par value $0.001, which are not registered pursuant to the Exchange Act
(such shares the "Class B Shares," and, together with the Class A Shares, the
"Shares," and such offer the "Class B Offer," and, together with the Class A
Offer, the "Offers"), each for $27.50 per Share in cash (such price, or any
such higher price per Share as may be paid in the Offers, referred to herein as
the "Offers Price");

         WHEREAS, also in furtherance of such acquisition, the Board of
Directors of each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company has approved this
Agreement and the Merger following the Offers in accordance with the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL") and upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein;

         WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Company Board of
Directors") has determined that the consideration to be paid for each Share in
the Offers and the Merger is fair to the holders of such Shares and has
resolved to recommend that the holders of such Shares accept the Offers and
adopt and approve this Agreement and each of the Transactions upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth herein;

         WHEREAS, the Special Committee of the Company Board of Directors (the
"Special Committee") has determined that the consideration to be paid for each
Class A Share in the Class A Offer and the Merger is fair to the holders of
such Shares (other than the Stockholders (excluding Jeffrey G. Katz)) and has
resolved to recommend that the holders of such Shares (other than the
Stockholders (excluding Jeffrey G. Katz)) accept the Class A Offer and adopt
and approve this Agreement and each of the Transactions upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein;

         WHEREAS, as a condition and further inducement to Parent and Purchaser
to enter into this Agreement and incur the obligations set forth herein,
certain stockholders of the Company (each, a "Stockholder") concurrently
herewith are entering into a Stockholder Agreement (the "Stockholder
Agreement"), dated as of the date hereof, with Parent and Purchaser, in the
form attached hereto as Exhibit C, pursuant to which each such Stockholder
(other than Jeffrey G. Katz) has, among other things, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth therein, agreed to irrevocably tender such
Stockholder's Class B Shares in the Class B Offer and granted Parent an
irrevocable proxy with respect to the voting of certain Shares in favor of the
adoption of the Merger, and Jeffrey G. Katz has, among other things, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, agreed to irrevocably
tender his Class A Shares in the Class A Offer and granted Parent an
irrevocable proxy with respect to the voting of such Shares in favor of the
adoption of the Merger;

         WHEREAS, immediately following the execution of this Agreement, each
of the Stockholders (other than Jeffrey G. Katz) is delivering to the Company
written consents in lieu of a meeting of stockholders of the Company pursuant
to which such Stockholder has adopted this Agreement, the Merger and the
Transactions pursuant to Sections 8.2(a), 8.2(b) and, subject to the approval
of the Bankruptcy Court in the case of United, 8.2(c) of the Company
Certificate (each, a "Stockholders Transaction Consent");

         WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the
Company and the Stockholders (other than Jeffrey G. Katz) are each executing
and delivering a written waiver (each, a "Company Stockholders Agreement
Waiver") which waiver, upon its effectiveness, among other things, eliminates
any requirement under Section 4.3 of the Company Stockholders Agreement that
Purchaser (or any transferee or assignee thereof) as transferee in the Class B
Offer (i) be subject to the terms and conditions of the Company Stockholders
Agreement and/or (ii) assume (in writing or otherwise) any obligations under
the Company Stockholders Agreement, in either case upon, or as a condition to,
a "Qualified Transfer" (as defined in the Company Certificate);

         WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution hereof, each of the directors
designated by each holder of Class B Shares is tendering his resignation from
the Company Board of Directors effective as of the acquisition of the Class B
Shares owned by such holder pursuant to the Class B Offer; and

         WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Purchaser desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Offers and the Merger.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the
parties hereto agree as follows:

                                   Article I

                             THE OFFERS AND MERGER

         Section 1.1. The Offers. (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not
have been terminated in accordance with Section 8.1 and none of the events set
forth in paragraphs (a) (except to the extent any such suit, action or
proceeding described in such paragraph (a) has been brought or commenced by a
United States Trustee in a Bankruptcy Case), (b), (c), (d), (e), (h), (i) and
(k) of Annex I shall have occurred, as promptly as practicable, and in any
event, within ten business days of the date hereof, Purchaser shall
simultaneously commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder (the "Exchange Act")) each of the Offers to purchase for cash all
Shares at the Offers Price, subject to (i) there being validly tendered in the
Offers (in the aggregate) and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the
Offers that number of Shares which, together with the Shares then beneficially
owned by Parent or Purchaser, represents at least a majority of the Shares
outstanding on a fully-diluted basis and no less than a majority of the voting
power of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to
vote in the election of directors (collectively, the "Minimum Condition") and
(ii) the other conditions set forth in Annex I. Subject to the prior
satisfaction or waiver by Parent or Purchaser of the Minimum Condition and the
other conditions of the Offers set forth in Annex I, Purchaser shall
consummate the Offers in accordance with their terms and accept for payment
and pay for all Shares tendered pursuant to the Offers as soon as practicable
after Purchaser is legally permitted to do so under applicable law; provided,
however, that the initial expiration date of the Offers (and the first date
upon which Purchaser may accept Shares tendered pursuant to the Offers) shall
be the later of the date that is (i) 30 business days following the first
public announcement of this Agreement by Parent or (ii) 20 business days
following the commencement of the Offers (the "Initial Expiration Date"). The
obligations of Purchaser to commence the Offers and accept for payment and pay
for any Shares validly tendered on or prior to the expiration of the Offers
and not withdrawn shall be subject to the Minimum Condition and the other
conditions set forth in Annex I. The Offers shall be made by means of an offer
to purchase (the "Offer to Purchase") that contains the terms set forth in
this Agreement and the Stockholder Agreement in effect as of the date hereof,
the Minimum Condition and the other conditions set forth in Annex I. Purchaser
shall not decrease the Offers Price, pay a different price in one Offer than
the other, change the form of consideration payable in the Offers, decrease
the number of Shares sought in the Offers, impose additional conditions to the
Offers or amend any other condition to the Offers in any manner adverse to the
holders of the Shares without the prior written consent of the Company (such
consent, subject to Section 9.1, to be authorized by the Company Board of
Directors); provided, however, that (x) if on the Initial Expiration Date (as
it may be extended), all conditions to the Offers shall not have been
satisfied or waived, Purchaser may, from time to time, in its sole discretion,
extend the Initial Expiration Date for such period as Purchaser may determine
to a date that is no later than the Drop Dead Date and (y) Purchaser may, in
its sole discretion, provide a "subsequent offering period" in accordance with
Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act. In addition, Parent and Purchaser agree
that if at any one or more scheduled expiration dates of the Offers, the HSR
Condition, the Litigation Condition, the Governmental Approval Condition
(which for purposes of this Section 1.1(a) shall also be deemed to include the
conditions set forth in paragraphs (h) and (j) (to the extent arising out of
litigation) of Annex I) or the Stockholder Approval Condition, in each case,
set forth in Annex I have not been satisfied or waived, but at such scheduled
expiration date all of the other conditions to the Offers set forth in Annex I
shall then be satisfied, or if not then satisfied, are reasonably capable of
being satisfied, then, at the request of the Company (received at least 24
hours prior to the then-scheduled expiration date of the Offers and confirmed
in writing), Purchaser shall extend the Offers from time to time, in the case
of the Litigation Condition, Governmental Approval Condition or the
Stockholder Approval Condition not being satisfied, to a date that is no later
than January 31, 2005, and, in the case of the HSR Condition or the Litigation
Condition (to the extent relating solely to antitrust and competition law
matters) not being satisfied, to a date that is no later than April 30, 2005.
Without limiting the right of Purchaser to extend the Offers, in the event
that Parent shall receive a Notice of Superior Proposal at any time, Purchaser
shall, if the Matching Bid Date shall be later than the scheduled expiration
date of the Offers, extend the Offers until 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the
later of (i) the earlier of (x) the second full business day after Parent's
delivery of a Matching Bid, if any, or (y) the first full business day after
Purchaser notifies the Company in writing that Purchaser waives any and all
rights to make a Matching Bid under Section 5.3(b) (and releases the Company
from its obligations with respect thereto) or fails to provide such notice to
the Company and (ii) in the event the Company establishes a Final Deadline
pursuant to Section 5.3(b), the second full business day following such Final
Deadline (the later of the dates specified in clauses (i) and (ii) above, the
"Matching Bid Date"). Purchaser may increase the Offers Price and extend the
Offers to the extent required by law in connection with such increase, in each
case in its sole discretion and without the Company's consent. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, any increase or decrease in the Offers Price,
modification, amendment or waiver of any terms of or conditions to any Offer,
consents with respect to any Offer or extension if relevant or applicable of
any Offer shall, in each case, be made to both Offers simultaneously or not at
all. Purchaser shall not terminate the Offers prior to any scheduled
expiration date (as the same may be extended or required to be extended)
without the written consent of the Company except in the event that Purchaser
terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1.

         (b) As soon as practicable on the date the Offers are commenced,
Parent and Purchaser shall file with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the "SEC"), pursuant to Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act ("Regulation
M-A"), a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Class A
Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the
"Schedule TO"). The Schedule TO shall include the summary term sheet required
under Regulation M-A and, as exhibits, the Offer to Purchase and a form of
letter of transmittal and summary advertisement (collectively, together with
any amendments and supplements thereto, the "Offer Documents"). Parent and
Purchaser agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents to be
filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and
to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. Parent and
Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, agree to
promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents
if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect or as otherwise required by law. Parent and Purchaser further
agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents, as so corrected
(if applicable), to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of
Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal
securities laws. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents before they are
filed with the SEC, and Parent and Purchaser shall give due consideration to
all the reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the
Company and its counsel. In addition, Parent and Purchaser agree to provide the
Company and its counsel in writing with any comments, whether written or oral,
that Parent, Purchaser or their counsel may receive from time to time from the
SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents
promptly after Parent's or Purchaser's, as the case may be, receipt of such
comments, and any written or oral responses thereto. The Company and its
counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review any such written
responses and Parent and Purchaser shall give due consideration to all
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Company and
its counsel. If the Offers are terminated or withdrawn by Purchaser, or this
Agreement is terminated prior to the purchase of Shares in the Offers, Parent
and Purchaser shall promptly return, and shall cause any depository or paying
agent, including the Paying Agent, acting on behalf of Parent and Purchaser, to
return all tendered Shares to the registered holders thereof.

         Section 1.2 Company Actions. (a)  Promptly following the filing of the
Schedule TO, the Company shall, in a manner that complies with Rule 14d-9 under
the Exchange Act, file with the SEC a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation
Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the Offers (together with all
amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") that shall,
subject to the provisions of Section 5.3(b), contain the recommendation
referred to in clause (iii) of Section 3.5. The Company further agrees to take
all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required
by applicable federal securities laws. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent
and Purchaser, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that it shall
have become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise
required by law. The Company agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the
Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected (if applicable), to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to holders of the Shares, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable federal securities laws. Parent, Purchaser and their
counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review the Schedule 14D-9
before it is filed with the SEC and the Company shall give due consideration to
all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent,
Purchaser and their counsel. In addition, the Company agrees to provide Parent,
Purchaser and their counsel in writing with any comments, whether written or
oral, that the Company or its counsel may receive from time to time from the
SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the
Company's receipt of such comments, and any written or oral responses thereto.
Parent, Purchaser and their counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to
review any such written responses and the Company shall give due consideration
to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent,
Purchaser and their counsel.

         (b) In connection with the Class A Offer, the Company shall promptly
furnish or cause to be furnished to Purchaser mailing labels, security position
listings and any available listing or computer file containing the names and
addresses of the record holders of the Class A Shares as of a recent date, and
shall promptly furnish Purchaser with such information and assistance
(including, but not limited to, lists of holders of the Class A Shares, updated
promptly from time to time upon Purchaser's request, and their addresses,
mailing labels and lists of security positions) as Purchaser or its agent may
reasonably request for the purpose of communicating the Class A Offer to the
record and beneficial holders of the Class A Shares. Subject to the
requirements of applicable law, and except for such steps as are necessary to
disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate
the Offers, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the Parent and Purchaser shall hold in confidence the information
contained in any such labels, listings and files, shall use such information
only in connection with the Offers and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall
be terminated, shall promptly deliver to the Company all copies of such
information.

         Section 1.3 Directors. (a) Promptly upon the purchase of and payment
for any Shares by Parent or Purchaser pursuant to the Offers which represents
at least a majority of the Shares outstanding and no less than a majority of
the voting power of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company
entitled to vote in the election of directors and at all times thereafter,
Parent shall be entitled to elect or designate such number of directors,
rounded up to the next whole number, on the Company Board of Directors as is
equal to the product of the total number of directors on the Company Board of
Directors (giving effect to the directors elected or designated by Parent
pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by the percentage that the aggregate
number of Shares beneficially owned by Purchaser, Parent and any of their
affiliates bears to the total number of Shares then outstanding. The Company
shall, upon Parent's request at any time following the purchase of and payment
for Shares pursuant to the Offers, take such actions, including but not limited
to promptly filling vacancies or newly created directorships on the Company
Board of Directors, promptly increasing the size of the Company Board of
Directors (including by amending the Bylaws of the Company if necessary so as
to increase the size of the Company Board of Directors) and/or promptly
securing the resignations of such number of its incumbent directors (subject to
the right of any holder of Class B Shares to designate directors of the Company
as provided in the Company Certificate) as are necessary to enable Parent's
designees to be so elected or designated to the Company Board of Directors, and
shall use its commercial best efforts to cause Parent's designees to be so
elected or designated at such time. The Company shall, upon Parent's request
following the purchase of and payment for Shares pursuant to the Offers, also
cause persons elected or designated by Parent to constitute the same percentage
(rounded up to the next whole number) as is on the Company Board of Directors
of (i) each committee of the Company Board of Directors (other than the Special
Committee), (ii) each board of directors (or similar body) of each Company
Subsidiary and (iii) each committee (or similar body) of each such board, in
each case only to the extent permitted by applicable law or the rules of any
stock exchange on which the Class A Shares are listed. The Company's
obligations under this Section 1.3(a) shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly
upon execution of this Agreement take all actions required pursuant to Section
14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section
1.3(a), including mailing to stockholders (together with the Schedule 14D-9)
the information required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 as is necessary to
enable Parent's designees to be elected or designated to the Company Board of
Directors. Parent or Purchaser shall supply the Company with information with
respect to either of them and their nominees, officers, directors and
affiliates to the extent required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1. The
provisions of this Section 1.3(a) are in addition to and shall not limit any
rights that any of Purchaser, Parent or any of their respective affiliates may
have as a holder or beneficial owner of Shares as a matter of law with respect
to the election of directors or otherwise.

         (b) In the event that Parent's designees are elected or designated to
the Company Board of Directors pursuant to Section 1.3(a), then, until the
Effective Time, the Company shall cause the Company Board of Directors to
maintain three directors who are designated as Class A Directors on the date
hereof (the "Independent Directors"); provided, however, that if any
Independent Director is unable to serve due to death or disability, the
remaining Independent Director(s) shall be entitled to elect or designate
another person (or persons) to fill such vacancy, and such person (or persons)
shall be deemed to be an Independent Director for purposes of this Agreement.
If no Independent Director then remains, the other directors shall designate
three persons to fill such vacancies and such persons shall be deemed
Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, if Parent's designees constitute a majority
of the Company Board of Directors after the acceptance for payment of Shares
pursuant to the Offers and prior to the Effective Time, then the affirmative
vote of a majority of the Independent Directors shall (in addition to the

         Section 1.7 Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation. The
Company, Parent and Purchaser shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause
the directors of Purchaser immediately prior to the Effective Time, from and

interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of either of
the Company or Purchaser acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving

behalf of either the Company or Purchaser, all such deeds, bills of sale,
instruments of conveyance, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in
the name and on behalf of each of such corporations or otherwise, all such

                  (i) duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special
         meeting of its stockholders (the "Special Meeting") as soon as
         reasonably practicable following the acceptance for payment and
         purchase of Shares by Purchaser pursuant to the Offers for the purpose
         of considering and taking action upon this Agreement;

                  (ii) prepare and file with the SEC a preliminary proxy or
         information statement relating to the Merger and this Agreement and
         use its commercial best efforts to obtain and furnish the information
         required to be included by the SEC in the Proxy Statement and, after
         consultation with Parent, respond promptly to any comments made by the
         SEC with respect to the preliminary proxy or information statement and
         cause a definitive proxy or information statement (the "Proxy
         Statement") to be mailed to its stockholders;

                  (iv) subject to Sections 5.3(b) and 6.2, use its commercial

         applicable law to effect the Merger.

         (b) Parent agrees to vote, or cause to be voted, all of the Shares
then owned by it, Purchaser or any of its other subsidiaries and affiliates in
favor of the approval of the Merger and the adoption of this Agreement.

         Section 1.10 Merger Without Meeting of Stockholders. Notwithstanding
Section 1.9, in the event that Parent, Purchaser or any other subsidiary of
Parent shall acquire at least 90% of the outstanding shares of each class of
capital stock of the Company entitled to vote on the Merger, pursuant to the
Offers or otherwise in accordance with the provisions hereof, the parties
hereto agree, at the request of Parent and subject to Article VII, to take all
necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective as
soon as practicable after such acquisition, without a meeting of stockholders
of the Company, in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL.

                                  Article II

                            CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

         Section 2.1 Conversion of Capital Stock. As of the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any
securities of the Company or common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Purchaser (the "Purchaser Common Stock"):

         (a) Purchaser Common Stock. Each issued and outstanding share of
Purchaser Common Stock shall be converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

         (b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock. All Shares
that are owned by the Company as treasury stock and any Shares owned by Parent,
Purchaser or any other wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent shall be cancelled and
shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

         (c) Conversion of Common Stock. Each issued and outstanding Share
(other than Shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and other
than Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive the Offers
Price, payable to the holder thereof in cash, without interest (the "Common
Stock Merger Consideration"). From and after the Effective Time, all such
Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such
Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Common Stock Merger Consideration therefor upon the surrender of
such certificate in accordance with Section 2.2, without interest thereon.

         (d) Conversion of Series A Preferred Stock. Each issued and
outstanding share (the "Preferred Shares") of Series A Redeemable Non-Voting
Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 (the "Series A Preferred Stock"),
other than Dissenting Shares, shall be converted into the right to receive the
Liquidation Preference (as defined in the Company Certificate) payable to the
holder thereof in cash, without interest (the "Preferred Stock Merger
Consideration" and, together with the Common Stock Merger Consideration, the
"Merger Consideration"). From and after the Effective Time, all such Preferred
Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such
shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Preferred Stock Merger Consideration therefor upon the surrender of
such certificate to the Company, without interest thereon. Upon surrender of
such certificate for cancellation to the Company, the holder of such
certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Preferred
Stock Merger Consideration for each Preferred Share formerly represented by
such certificate and the certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. The Company shall provide all holders of Series A Preferred Stock
with the notice required by the Certificate of Designations, Preferences and
Rights of the Series A Preferred Stock attached as Exhibit A to the Company
Certificate.

         Section 2.2 Exchange of Certificates. (a)  Paying Agent. Parent shall
designate a bank or trust company to act as agent for the holders of Shares in
connection with the Merger (the "Paying Agent") and to receive the funds to
which holders of Shares shall become entitled pursuant to Section 2.1. Prior to
the Effective Time, Parent or Purchaser shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, with the Paying Agent the aggregate Common Stock Merger
Consideration. For purposes of determining the amount of Common Stock Merger
Consideration to be so deposited, Parent and Purchaser shall assume that no
stockholder of the Company will perfect any right to appraisal of his, her or
its Shares. Such funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, in its sole discretion, pending payment
thereof by the Paying Agent to the holders of the Shares. Earnings from such
investments shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation, and no part of such earnings shall accrue to the benefit
of holders of Shares.

         (b) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time, the Paying
Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates,
which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares
(the "Certificates"), whose shares were converted pursuant to Section 2.1 into
the right to receive the Common Stock Merger Consideration (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other
provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment of the
Common Stock Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be
appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed,
the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Common Stock Merger Consideration for each Share formerly
represented by such Certificate and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. If payment of the Common Stock Merger Consideration is
to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment that
(x) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be
otherwise in proper form for transfer and (y) the Person requesting such
payment shall have paid any transfer and other taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Common Stock Merger Consideration to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to
the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax either has been
paid or is not required to be paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 2.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective
Time to represent only the right to receive the Common Stock Merger
Consideration in cash as contemplated by this Section 2.2, without interest
thereon.

         (c) Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares or
Preferred Shares on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective
Time, the holders of certificates evidencing ownership of Shares or Preferred
Shares, as the case may be, outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares or Preferred Shares,
as the case may be, except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable
law. If, after the Effective Time, certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided
in this Article II.

         (d) Termination of Fund; No Liability. At any time following one year
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to
require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest
received with respect thereto) made available to the Paying Agent and not
disbursed (or for which disbursement is pending subject only to the Paying
Agent's routine administrative procedures) to holders of Certificates, and
thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) only
as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration payable
upon due surrender of their Certificates, without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate for Merger Consideration
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar law.

         (e) Withholding Rights. Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation
and the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the relevant Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement to any holder of Shares (including any holder of Shares who held
Company Restricted Stock that vested in accordance with its terms) or Preferred
Shares such amounts that Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment (or, in the case of Company Restricted Stock, the vesting of such
Company Restricted Stock in accordance with its terms) under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder or any provision of state, local or foreign law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares or Preferred
Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent,
Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.

         Section 2.3 Dissenting Shares.  (a)  Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Shares or Preferred Shares outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of
the adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who has
complied with Section 262 of the DGCL ("Dissenting Shares") shall not be
converted into a right to receive the Common Stock Merger Consideration or the
Preferred Stock Merger Consideration, as the case may be, unless such holder
fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses his or her right to appraisal.
A holder of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive payment of the
appraised value of such shares held by him or her in accordance with Section
262 of the DGCL, unless, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect
or withdraws or loses his or her right to appraisal, in which case such Shares
or Preferred Shares, as the case may be, shall be converted into and represent
only the right to receive the Common Stock Merger Consideration or the
Preferred Stock Merger Consideration, as the case may be, without interest
thereon, upon surrender of the Certificate or Certificates representing such
Shares or Preferred Shares, as the case may be.

         (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written
demands for appraisal of any Shares or Preferred Shares, attempted withdrawals
of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and
received by the Company relating to rights of appraisal and (ii) the
opportunity to participate in the conduct of all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. Except with the prior
written consent of Parent, the Company shall not voluntarily make any payment
with respect to any demands for appraisal or settle or offer to settle any such
demands for appraisal.

         Section 2.4 Option Plans. Effective as of the Effective Time, each
outstanding employee stock option or right to acquire shares of Class A Common
Stock (each, a "Company Stock Option") granted under the Company's 2000 Stock
Plan or the Company's Amended and Restated 2002 Stock Plan (together, the
"Company Option Plans"), whether or not then exercisable, shall (a) with
respect to the portion thereof that is vested immediately prior to the
Effective Time in accordance with the terms of the Company Option Plans as in
effect on the date of this Agreement and upon receipt of any necessary
optionholder consent, be cancelled in exchange for a single lump sum cash
payment equal to (reduced by any applicable withholding tax) the product of (i)
the excess, if any, of the Common Stock Merger Consideration over the per share
exercise price of such Company Stock Option immediately before the Effective
Time and (ii) the number of shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of the vested portion of such Company Stock Option immediately before
the Effective Time and (b) with respect to the unvested portion thereof (or the
vested portion thereof (as described above) to the extent necessary
optionholder consent is not obtained) be assumed by Parent and converted into
an option to purchase common stock of Parent, par value $0.01 per share
("Parent Common Stock") in accordance with this Section 2.4. Each unvested
portion of any Company Stock Option (or the vested portion thereof (as
described above) to the extent necessary optionholder consent is not obtained)
so converted shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and
conditions (including vesting schedule) as set forth in the applicable Company
Option Plan and any agreements thereunder immediately prior to the Effective
Time, except that, as of the Effective Time, (i) each Company Stock Option
shall be exercisable for that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock
equal to the product of the number of Shares that were issuable upon exercise
of such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied
by 1.2489 (the "Exchange Ratio"), rounded down to the nearest whole number of
shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) the per share exercise price for the
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Company Stock
Option so converted shall be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the
exercise price per Share at which such Company Stock Option was exercisable
immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to
the nearest whole cent. No later than five business days after the Closing,
Parent shall register the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise
of Company Stock Option converted pursuant to this Section 2.4 by filing an
effective registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form) or another
appropriate form with the SEC, and Parent shall use commercial best efforts to
maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement and maintain the
current status of the prospectus with respect thereto for so long as such
options remain outstanding.

         Section 2.5 Restricted Stock. Notwithstanding Section 2.1, as of the
Effective Time each outstanding award of restricted Class A Common Stock
("Company Restricted Stock") shall be converted into the right to receive the
Common Stock Merger Consideration subject to the applicable terms and
conditions of the corresponding Company Restricted Stock award agreement and
Company Option Plan pursuant to which such Company Restricted Stock has been
granted. Common Stock Merger Consideration in respect of Company Restricted
Stock shall be payable at such times as Company Restricted Stock would have
become vested pursuant to the applicable vesting schedules contained in the
Company Restricted Stock award agreements in effect as of the date hereof,
subject to acceleration as provided in employment or other agreements between
the Company and each holder of Company Restricted Stock. Prior to the payment
of Common Stock Merger Consideration in respect of any Company Restricted Stock
no Company Employee shall have any interest in such Common Stock Merger
Consideration beyond that of a general unsecured creditor of the Parent.


                                  Article III

organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation and has requisite corporate power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business
as it is now being conducted, except where the failure to be so organized,

individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. As
used in this Agreement, "Company Material Adverse Change" or "Company Material
Adverse Effect" means any fact(s), change(s), event(s), development(s) or
circumstance(s) which, individually or in the aggregate, would be reasonably

the Offers and the Merger; provided, however, that for purposes of clause (i)
above, any adverse effect resulting from (s) any seasonal reduction in revenues
or earnings that is of a magnitude consistent with prior periods, (t) changes

conditions generally, (u) changes in any of the industries in which the
business of the Company and/or the Company Subsidiaries is conducted

take action, or such other effects, changes or occurrences to which Parent has
consented in writing or (z) terrorist activities or material worsening of war
or armed hostilities if the effect thereof would reasonably be expected to be
transitory, shall be disregarded in determining whether there has been a
Company Material Adverse Effect or Company Material Adverse Change; and
provided, further, that the effects of terrorist activities (other than those
reasonably expected to be transitory), material worsening of war or armed
hostility or other national or international calamity shall not be regarded as
changes for purposes of clauses (t) and (u) above.

         (b) The Company is duly qualified or licensed to do business and in
good standing in each jurisdiction in which the property owned, leased or
operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so
qualified, licensed or in good standing would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 3.2 Subsidiaries and Affiliates. (a) Section 3.2(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth the name, jurisdiction of incorporation
or organization and authorized and outstanding capital of each Company
Subsidiary and the jurisdictions in which each Company Subsidiary is qualified

leased or operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes
such qualification or license necessary, except where the failure to be so
organized, existing and in good standing, to have such power and authority or
to be so qualified or licensed and in good standing would not, individually or
in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each such
jurisdiction is listed in Section 3.2(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

         (c) The Company has heretofore delivered or made available to Parent
complete and correct copies of the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate
of Incorporation (the "Company Certificate") and Amended and Restated Bylaws

purchase any shares, and no restricted shares, of any class or series of

have been granted to employees or directors of the Company and members of the
Company's consumer advisory board in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice. Since September 24, 2004, the Company has not granted any

sets forth a listing of all outstanding Company Stock Options and shares of

grant and the portion of which that is vested, (ii) the date upon which each
Company Stock Option expires, (iii) whether or not such Company Stock Option is
intended to qualify as an "incentive stock option" within the meaning of
Section 422 of the Code and (iv) whether or not such Company Stock Option or
Company Restricted Stock will accelerate, in whole or in part, pursuant to its
terms as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby.

         (c) Except as provided in the Amended and Restated Stockholders
Agreement, dated December 19, 2003, by and among the Company and certain of its
stockholders (the "Company Stockholders Agreement"), there are no voting trusts
or other agreements or understandings to which the Company or any Company
Subsidiary is a party with respect to the voting of the capital stock of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries.

         Section 3.4 Authorization; Validity of Agreement; Company Action. The
Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and, with respect to the
Merger, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of the
Stockholders Transaction Consents, to consummate the transactions provided for
or contemplated by this Agreement, including, but not limited to, the Offers
and the Merger (collectively, together with the Stockholder Agreement, the
"Transactions"). The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this
Agreement, and the consummation by it of the Transactions, have been duly and
validly authorized by the Company Board of Directors and, no other corporate
action on the part of the Company is necessary (other than, with respect to the
Merger, the approval and adoption of the Merger and this Agreement by the
Required Company Holders) to authorize the execution and delivery by the
Company of this Agreement and the consummation by it of the Transactions. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming due
and valid authorization, execution and delivery hereof by Parent and Purchaser,
is a valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable against the
Company in accordance with its terms, except that (i) such enforcement may be
subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar laws, now or
hereafter in effect, affecting creditors' rights generally and (ii) the remedy
of specific performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable relief may
be subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of the court before
which any proceeding therefor may be brought.

         Section 3.5 Board Approvals. The Company Board of Directors, at a
meeting duly called and held, has unanimously (i) determined that this
Agreement, the Offers and the Merger are advisable, fair to, and in the best
interests of the stockholders of the Company, (ii) duly and validly approved
and taken all corporate action required to be taken by the Company Board of
Directors to authorize the consummation of the Transactions and (iii)
recommended that the stockholders of the Company accept the Offers, tender
their Shares to Purchaser pursuant to the Offers, and approve and adopt this
Agreement and the Merger, and, except as permitted by Sections 5.2(d), 5.3(a)
and 5.3(b), none of the aforesaid actions by the Company Board of Directors has
been amended, rescinded or modified. The Special Committee, at a meeting duly
called and held, has unanimously (i) determined that this Agreement, the Class
A Offer and the Merger are fair to, and in the best interests of, the holders
of the Class A Shares (other than the Stockholders (excluding Jeffrey G. Katz))
and (ii) recommended that the holders of Class A Shares (other than the
Stockholders (excluding Jeffrey G. Katz)) accept the Class A Offer, tender
their Class A Shares to Purchaser pursuant to the Class A Offer, and approve
and adopt this Agreement and the Merger, and except as permitted by Sections
5.2(d), 5.3(a) and 5.3(b) none of the aforesaid actions by the Special
Committee have been amended, rescinded or modified. Assuming the accuracy of
the representation and warranty set forth in the first sentence of Section 4.8,
the action taken by the Company Board of Directors in approving this Agreement
and the Merger is sufficient to render inapplicable to this Agreement and the
Transactions the restrictions on business combinations contained in Section 203
of the DGCL. The Company Board of Directors has given all necessary board
approvals to cause the sale by the Stockholders of the Class B Shares to
Purchaser pursuant to the Class B Offer to be a "Qualified Transfer" for
purposes of Section 6.1(d) of the Company Certificate and, assuming that each
of the Company Stockholders Agreement Waivers has been duly authorized,
executed and delivered by each Stockholder, such Class B Shares shall not
automatically convert into Class A Shares upon their acquisition by Purchaser.
Assuming all Stockholders (other than Jeffrey G. Katz) transfer their Shares to
Purchaser in the Class B Offer, unless earlier terminated by the parties
thereto, the Company Stockholders Agreement shall terminate upon transfer of
such Shares to Purchaser in accordance with the terms thereof.

         Section 3.6 Required Vote. The affirmative vote of the holders of (i)
a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of Common Stock,
voting together as a single class and (ii) any approval required by Sections
8.2(a), 8.2(b) and 8.2(c) of the Company Certificate (the approvals in clauses
(i) and (ii) collectively, the "Required Company Holders") are the only votes
of the holders of any class or series of the Company's capital stock necessary
to adopt and approve the Merger and this Agreement. No vote of any other class
or series of the Company's capital stock, including, without limitation, the
Preferred Stock, is necessary to approve any of the Transactions, including the
Merger.

         Section 3.7 Consents and Approvals; No Violations. (a) Except as set
forth in Section 3.7 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, none of the execution,
delivery or performance of this Agreement by the Company, the consummation by
the Company of the Transactions or compliance by the Company with any of the
provisions of this Agreement will (i) assuming the adoption and approval of
this Agreement by the Required Company Holders, conflict with or result in any
breach of any provision of the Company Certificate, the Company Bylaws or
similar organizational documents of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, (ii)
require any filing by the Company with, or the permit, authorization, consent
or approval of, any court, arbitral tribunal, administrative agency or
commission or other governmental or other regulatory authority or agency,
foreign or domestic (a "Governmental Entity") (except for (A) compliance with
any applicable requirements of the Exchange Act, (B) any filings as may be
required under the DGCL in connection with the Merger, (C) filings, permits,
authorizations, consents and approvals as may be required under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR
Act"), (D) the filing with the SEC and the Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. of (1) the
Schedule 14D-9, (2) a Proxy Statement if stockholder approval is required by
law, (3) the information required by Rule 14f-1 under the Exchange Act and (4)
such reports under Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act as may be required in
connection with this Agreement and the Transactions or (E) such filings and
approvals as may be required by any applicable state securities or blue sky
laws), (iii) result in a modification, violation or breach of, or constitute
(with or without due notice or lapse of time or both) a default (or give rise
to any right, including, but not limited to, any right of termination,
amendment, cancellation or acceleration) under, any of the terms, conditions or
provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, lien, indenture, lease, license,
contract, understanding or agreement, whether oral or written, or other
instrument or obligation to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a
party or by which any of them or any of their respective properties or assets
is bound (the "Company Agreements") or (iv) violate any order, writ,
injunction, decree, statute, rule or regulation applicable to the Company, any
Company Subsidiary or any of their respective properties or assets, except in
the case of clauses (ii), (iii) or (iv) where (x) any failure to obtain such
permits, authorizations, consents or approvals, (y) any failure to make such
filings or (z) any such modifications, violations, breaches or defaults would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

         (b) The Company does not make any sales to customers that do not have
a credit card issued by a U.S. Bank and a U.S. billing address, does not
classify any revenue as non-U.S. revenue, does not have assets of a value
exceeding $1 million in any non-U.S. jurisdiction, does not have an interest in

Albania, Azerbaijan and Kazachtstan.

Company has filed with the SEC all forms, reports, schedules, statements and
other documents required by it to be filed since and including December 16,
2003 under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Securities Act") (together with all certifications required pursuant to the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act")) (such documents and any
other documents filed by the Company with the SEC, as have been amended since
the time of their filing, collectively, the "Company SEC Documents"). As of
their respective dates, or if amended, as of the date of the last such
amendment, the Company SEC Documents (a) did not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated

the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and (b) complied
in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act
or the Securities Act, as the case may be, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder. None of the Company

matter of accounting practices which materially impacts or would require the

years or interim periods for which the Company is required to provide financial
statements, such that they should no longer be relied upon.

Agreement and except as set forth in Section 3.9 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule or in the Company SEC Documents filed prior to the date hereof, since

                                  Article IV

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
                            OF PARENT AND PURCHASER

         Parent and Purchaser represent and warrant to the Company as
follows:

         Section 4.1 Organization. Each of Parent and Purchaser is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the jurisdiction of its respective incorporation and has the requisite
corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to
carry on its business as is now being conducted, except where the failure to be
so organized, existing and in good standing or to have such power and authority
would not, individually or in the aggregate, impair in any material respect the
ability of each of Parent and Purchaser, as the case may be, to perform its
obligations under this Agreement, or prevent or materially delay the
consummation of any of the Transactions.

         Section 4.2 Authorization; Validity of Agreement; Necessary Action.
Each of Parent and Purchaser has all necessary corporate power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the Transactions. The
execution, delivery and performance by Parent and Purchaser of this Agreement
and the consummation of the Transactions have been duly authorized by the
boards of directors of each of Parent and Purchaser, and by Parent as the sole
stockholder of Purchaser, and no other corporate authority or approval on the
part of Parent or Purchaser is necessary to authorize the execution and
delivery by Parent and Purchaser of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Transactions. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Parent and
Purchaser and, assuming due and valid authorization, execution and delivery
hereof by the Company, is the valid and binding obligation of each of Parent
and Purchaser enforceable against each of them in accordance with its terms,
except that (i) such enforcement may be subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency or other similar laws, now or hereafter in effect, affecting
creditors' rights generally and (ii) the remedy of specific performance and
injunctive and other forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable
defenses and to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding
therefor may be brought.

         Section 4.3 Consents and Approvals; No Violations. None of the
execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement by Parent or Purchaser,
the consummation by Parent or Purchaser of the Transactions, or compliance by
Parent or Purchaser with any of the provisions hereof will (a) conflict with or
result in any breach of any provision of the organizational documents of Parent
or the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of Purchaser, (b) require any
filing by Parent or Purchaser with, or the permit, authorization, consent or
approval of, any Governmental Entity (except for (i) compliance with any
applicable requirements of the Exchange Act, (ii) any filings as may be
required under the DGCL, (iii) filings, permits, authorizations, consents and
approvals as may be required under the HSR Act and comparable merger and
notifications laws or regulations of foreign jurisdictions, (iv) the filing or
deemed filing with the SEC, the Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. and the New York
Stock Exchange of (A) the Schedule TO, (B) the Proxy Statement, if stockholder
approval is required by law and (C) such reports under Section 13(a) of the
Exchange Act as may be required in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions, or (iv) such filings and approvals as may be required by any
applicable state securities, blue sky or takeover laws) or (c) violate any
order, writ, injunction, decree, statute, rule or regulation applicable to
Parent, any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their properties or assets, except
in the case of clause (b) or (c) such violations, breaches or defaults which
would not, individually or in the aggregate, impair in any material respect the
ability of each Parent and Purchaser to perform its obligations under this
Agreement, as the case may be, or prevent the consummation of any the
Transactions.

         Section 4.4 Litigation. There is no claim, action, suit, arbitration,
alternative dispute resolution action or any other judicial or administrative
proceeding pending against (or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened against
or naming as a party thereto) Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, nor, to the
knowledge of Parent, is there any investigation pending or threatened against
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, and none of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
is subject to any outstanding order, writ, injunction or decree, in each case,
which would, individually or in the aggregate, impair in any material respect
the ability of each Parent and Purchaser to perform its obligations under this
Agreement, as the case may be, or prevent the consummation of any the
Transactions.

         Section 4.5 Information in the Proxy Statement. None of the
information supplied by Parent or Purchaser in writing expressly for inclusion
or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement (or any amendment thereof
or supplement thereto) will, at the date mailed to stockholders and at the time
of the meeting of stockholders to be held in connection with the Merger,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading.

         Section 4.6 Information in the Offer Documents. The Offer Documents
will comply as to form in all material respects with the provisions of
applicable federal securities laws and, on the date first filed and published,
sent or given to the Company's stockholders, will not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading,
except that no representation or warranty is made by Parent or Purchaser with
respect to information supplied by the Company in writing expressly for
inclusion in the Offer Documents.

         Section 4.7 Cash Availability. Purchaser has cash on hand or existing
lines of credit to provide, in the aggregate, sufficient funds to consummate
the Transactions, including payment in full for all Shares validly tendered
into the Offers or outstanding at the Effective Time, subject to the terms and
conditions of the Offers and this Agreement, and to satisfy all other costs and
expenses required to be paid by Parent or Purchaser in connection therewith. As
of the date hereof, there is no breach or default by Parent existing, or with
notice or the passage of time may exist, under the credit or other agreements
with respect to such lines of credit. Parent and Purchaser have no reason to
believe that any of the conditions precedent to the draw-down of such lines of
credit will not be satisfied in connection with the consummation of the
Transactions.

         Section 4.8 Company Stock. Each of Parent and Purchaser is not, nor at
any time during the last three years has it been, an "interested stockholder"
of the Company as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL. Each of Parent and
Purchaser does not own (directly or indirectly, beneficially or of record) and
is not a party to any agreement, arrangement or understanding for the purpose
of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of, in each case, any shares of
capital stock of the Company (other than as contemplated by this Agreement or
the Stockholders Agreement).

         Section 4.9 Other Agreements. Except for the Stockholder Agreement or
as disclosed by Parent to the Company in writing prior to the date hereof,
neither Parent nor Purchaser has entered into any contract or agreement with
any officer or director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary in connection
with the Transactions.

Company Subsidiary, in each case pursuant to a customary confidentiality
agreement containing terms no less restrictive than the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated September 4, 2003 between Parent and the
Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement"); provided, however, that unless such
proposal contains a price per Share and/or exchange ratio (or a range thereof,
provided that the lowest price specified therein exceeds the Offers Price (in
the case of an exchange ratio, which shall be based upon the closing trading
price of the shares of common stock of such Third Party, calculated at the
applicable exchange ratio on the trading date preceding the receipt by the
Company of such Acquisition Proposal)), the Company may not provide non-public
information of greater scope, area or detail to such Third Party than was
provided to Parent prior to Parent making its proposal dated August 26, 2004
and (y) participate in discussions or negotiations regarding such proposal or
modifications thereto.

         (c) In addition to any prior notice obligations contained in Section

the identity of the person making such Acquisition Proposal, request or
inquiry. The Company shall inform Parent as promptly as practicable (and in any
event within two business days) of any written changes in the material terms or
conditions to any Acquisition Proposal received (including any change in the
price, structure or form of the consideration) and, upon Parent's request, the
Company shall update Parent on the general status of any ongoing discussions or
negotiations regarding or relating to any Acquisition Proposal received. The
Company shall provide or make available promptly to Parent copies of all
material non public information provided to any Third Party not previously
provided to Parent.

by any order or decree of a Governmental Entity.

         (e) For purposes of this Agreement:

                  (i) "Acquisition Proposal" means any offer, proposal or
         indication of interest, as the case may be, by any Third Party that
         relates to (1) a transaction or series of transactions (including any
         merger, consolidation, recapitalization, liquidation or other direct
         or indirect business combination) involving the Company or the
         issuance or acquisition of shares of capital stock or other equity
         securities of the Company representing 10% (in number or voting power)
         or more of the outstanding capital stock of the Company, (2) any
         tender or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any
         Person, together with all affiliates thereof, beneficially owning
         shares of capital stock or other equity securities of the Company
         representing 10% (in number or voting power) or more of the
         outstanding capital stock of the Company, or (3) the acquisition,
         license, purchase or other disposition of 10% or more of the or assets
         (including the capital stock or assets of any Company Subsidiary) of
         the Company; and

                  (ii) "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide written
         Acquisition Proposal (provided, that for the purposes of this
         definition, (A) the applicable percentages in clauses (1) and (2) of
         the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be more than 50% as
         opposed to 10%; provided, further that such transaction, if
         consummated, would also result in the applicable Third Party having
         the power to elect a majority of the Company Board of Directors
         immediately following consummation of such transaction and (B) any
         acquisition, license, purchase or other disposition referred to in
         clause (3) of the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be for all
         or substantially all of the assets (including the capital stock or
         assets of the Company Subsidiaries) of the Company), which on its most
         recently amended or modified terms, if amended or modified, the
         Company Board of Directors determines in good faith After Consultation
         (taking into account all of the terms and conditions (including,
         without limitation, legal and regulatory matters) of such Acquisition
         Proposal), if consummated, would result in a transaction that is more
         favorable to the Company's stockholders (in their capacities as
         stockholders), from a financial point of view, than the transactions
         contemplated by this Agreement.

         (f) The Company agrees not to release or permit the release of any
Person from, or to waive or permit the waiver of any provision of, and the
Company will use its commercial best efforts to enforce or cause to be
enforced, any "standstill" or similar agreement to which any of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary is a party, except that the Company shall be permitted
to release or permit the release of such Person from any standstill obligation
if the Company Board of Directors takes such action in the course of exercising
rights under, and consistent with, Sections 5.2(b) or 5.3(b); provided,
however, that the Company shall not, in any circumstance, release, or permit
the release from, or waive or permit the waiver of any provision of any
standstill or similar agreement the effect of which release or waiver would
permit such Person to effect a transaction without the approval of the Company
Board of Directors.

         Section 5.3 Board Recommendation. (a) Subject to Section 5.3(b),
neither the Company Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall (i)
withdraw, qualify, modify or amend in any manner adverse to Parent or to
Purchaser, the approval or recommendation by the Company Board of Directors or
any committee thereof of the Offers, this Agreement or the Merger (the "Company
Recommendation") or (ii) approve or recommend any Acquisition Proposal or cause
or permit the Company to enter into any definitive agreement or letter of
intent with respect to any Acquisition Proposal (each of the foregoing being
referred to as a "Company Change in Recommendation"); provided, however, that
nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from publicly
disclosing a Superior Proposal or modifying the Company Recommendation to
provide that the Company is unable to take a position with respect to the
Offers, this Agreement and the Merger in response to a Superior Proposal
following delivery to Parent of a Notice of Superior Proposal with respect to
such Superior Proposal (and such public disclosure or modification shall not be
deemed to be a "Company Change in Recommendation").

         (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.3(a), (i) if the
Company Board of Directors or the Special Committee determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to make a Company
Change in Recommendation would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the
Company Board of Directors under applicable law or (ii) prior to acceptance for
payment of Shares in the Offers, the Company Board of Directors in good faith
determines to accept a Superior Proposal, in each case the Company Board of
Directors may make a Company Change in Recommendation. If the Company Board of
Directors or the Special Committee desires to make such a Company Change in
Recommendation as a result of a Superior Proposal, such Company Change in
Recommendation may only be made: (A) if the Company has delivered to Parent a
written notice (a "Notice of Superior Proposal") that (x) advises Parent that
the Company Board of Directors has received a Superior Proposal, (y) specifies
the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and (z) identifies
the Person making such Superior Proposal and (B)(i) if Parent does not make,
within the two full business day period following Parent's receipt of the
Notice of Superior Proposal, an offer (a "Matching Bid") that the Company Board
of Directors determines in good faith After Consultation to be as favorable to
the Company's stockholders as the Superior Proposal to which the Notice of
Superior Proposal applies, (ii) if after Parent has made a Matching Bid within
the two full business day period referenced in clause (B)(i), such Acquisition
Proposal to which the Notice of Superior Proposal applied has been or is
modified or amended, and the Company Board of Directors in good faith
determines that the Acquisition Proposal, as so modified or amended, is a
Superior Proposal, Parent does not make within the two business days following
Parent's receipt of a Notice of Superior Proposal (as revised to reflect such
Superior Proposal) a Matching Bid that the Company Board of Directors
determines in good faith After Consultation to be as favorable to the Company's
stockholders as the Superior Proposal to which the Notice of Superior Proposal
applies or (iii) if the Company Board of Directors has elected, following
receipt of any initial Matching Bid from Parent, to establish a deadline (the
"Final Deadline") for the submission of final proposals from both Parent and
the Third Party making such Superior Proposal (which Final Deadline shall be
not less than three nor more than seven business days after notice of such
deadline is delivered to Parent (the "Final Notice Deadline"), and which Final
Notice Deadline shall in no event be made no later than 24 hours following
receipt by the Company of Parent's initial Matching Bid) and following receipt
of such final proposal Parent has not submitted a final proposal as of the
Final Deadline that the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith
After Consultation to be as favorable to the Company's stockholders as the
final proposal submitted by such Third Party as of the Final Deadline.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be entitled to enter into
any definitive agreement (or letter of intent) with respect to a Superior
Proposal unless this Agreement has been or concurrently is terminated by its
terms pursuant to Section 8.1(e) and the Company has paid or concurrently with
such termination pays, by cashiers check, the Termination Fee due to Parent
pursuant to Section 8.2(b).

         Section 5.4 Notification. The Company agrees that it will promptly
inform its and its Subsidiaries' respective Representatives of the obligations
undertaken in Section 5.2.


                                  Article VI

                             ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

         Section 6.1 Proxy Statement. As promptly as practicable after the
consummation of the Offers and if required by the Exchange Act, the Company
shall prepare and file with the SEC, and shall use its commercial best efforts
to respond promptly to any comments made by the SEC, and promptly thereafter
shall mail to stockholders, the Proxy Statement. In such event, subject to
Sections 5.2 and 5.3, the Proxy Statement shall contain the recommendation of
the Company Board of Directors in favor of the adoption of this Agreement.

         Section 6.2 Meeting of Stockholders of the Company. In connection with
the Special Meeting, if any, the Company shall use its commercial best efforts
to solicit from stockholders of the Company proxies in favor of the adoption of
this Agreement, and shall take all other action necessary or, in the reasonable
opinion of Purchaser, advisable to secure any vote or consent of such
stockholders required by the DGCL and the Company Certificate to effect the
Merger; provided, however, that the Company shall have no obligation to solicit
proxies (or take any other action advisable to secure any vote or consent of
holders of Class A Shares) if, following acceptance for payment of Shares in
the Offers, the Company Board of Directors makes a Company Change in
Recommendation in connection with a Superior Proposal. The Purchaser agrees
that it shall vote, or cause to be voted, in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement all Shares directly or indirectly beneficially owned by it.

         Section 6.3 Additional Agreements. In case at any time after the
Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement, the proper officers and directors of the Company,
Parent and Purchaser shall use all commercial best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all such necessary actions.

         Section 6.4 Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall give
prompt notice to Parent and Purchaser, and Parent and Purchaser shall give
prompt notice to the Company, of (a) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any
event that would be likely to cause any condition set forth in Annex I to be
unsatisfied in any material respect at any time from the date hereof to the
date Purchaser accepts for payment any Shares pursuant to the Offers (except to
the extent it refers to a specific date) and (b) any material failure of the
Company, Purchaser or Parent, as the case may be to comply with or satisfy any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
hereunder; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
Section 6.4 shall not affect the remedies available hereunder to the party
receiving such notice or the representations or warranties of the parties or
the conditions to the obligations of the parties hereto.

         Section 6.5 Access; Confidentiality. (a) Except as required pursuant
to any existing confidentiality agreement or obligation entered into prior to
the date hereof by the Company or any Company Subsidiary in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practice (excluding, for the avoidance of
doubt, confidentiality agreements entered into in connection with any
Acquisition Proposal), a summary of the material terms of which the Company
shall provide Parent upon any request for information by Parent that is subject
to such confidentiality agreement, and subject to applicable law or decree,
from the date of this Agreement until the Closing, the Company shall, and shall
cause the Company Subsidiaries to, (i) give Parent, its officers and a
reasonable number of its employees and its authorized representatives, upon
reasonable prior notice to the Company, reasonable access during normal
business hours to the Company Agreements, books, records, analysis,
projections, plans, personnel, offices and other facilities and properties of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and, subject to customary reasonable
request, their accountants and accountants' work papers and (ii) furnish Parent
on a timely basis with such financial and operating data and other information
with respect to the business and properties and Company Agreements of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries as Parent may from time to time reasonably
request and use commercial best efforts to make available at reasonable times
during normal business hours to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel,
financing sources and other representatives of the Parent the appropriate
individuals (including management personnel, attorneys, accountants and other
professionals) for discussion of the Company's business, properties, prospects
and personnel as Parent may reasonably request.

         (b) With respect to the information disclosed pursuant to this Section
6.5, the parties shall comply with, and shall use commercial best efforts to
cause their respective representatives to comply with, all of their obligations
under the Confidentiality Agreement.

         (c) As soon as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, the
Company shall permit Parent to implement an interface to the Company's
financial reporting system which will allow the transfer of general ledger data
to Parent's financial reporting system (the "Reporting System"). Access to the
Reporting System will be provided by Parent's financial reporting staff and the
tasks necessary to complete the interface to the Reporting System will be led
by Parent's accounting staff, with the necessary assistance from the Company's
accounting staff and other technical staff, if necessary, at no cost to the
Company and provided that neither such installment nor the operation or use by
Parent of the Reporting System shall interfere with or disrupt the normal
operation of the Company's business or its financial reporting system or
violate any applicable software licenses. Parent will provide the necessary
Reporting System software to be installed on a computer in the Company's
accounting department; provided, however, that the information retrieved from
the Company's financial reporting system will be made available only to the
Office of Corporate Controller of Parent (it being represented by Parent that
such Persons are not directly involved in pricing or any other competitive
activity at Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent); provided, further, that Parent
shall not use such information other than for diligence purposes of assessing
the financial condition of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for
purposes of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall not
share, provide or sell the information for any commercial purpose (other than
the Transactions) to any third party or use the information in any manner that
could reasonably be considered a restraint on competition or result in
violation of any applicable laws.

         (d) No investigation heretofore conducted or conducted pursuant to
this Section 6.5 shall affect any representation or warranty made by the
parties hereunder.

         Section 6.6 Consents and Approvals. (a) Subject to Section 6.6(f),
each of the Company and Parent shall use commercial best efforts to (i) take,
or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under any applicable law or otherwise to
consummate and make effective the Transactions as promptly as practicable, (ii)
obtain from any Governmental Entities any consents, licenses, permits, waivers,
clearances approvals, authorizations or orders required to be obtained or made
by Parent or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or avoid any
action or proceeding by any Governmental Entity (including, without limitation,
those in connection with the HSR Act), in connection with the authorization,
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Transactions, (iii) make or cause to be made the applications or filings
required to be made by Parent or the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries under or with respect to the HSR Act or any other applicable laws
in connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the consummation of the Transactions, and pay any fees due of it in
connection with such applications or filings, as promptly as is reasonably
practicable, and in any event within ten business days after the date hereof,
(iv) comply at the earliest practicable date with any request under or with
respect to the HSR Act and any such other applicable laws for additional
information, documents or other materials received by Parent or the Company or
any of their respective Subsidiaries from the Federal Trade Commission or the
Department of Justice or any other Governmental Entity in connection with such
applications or filings or the Transactions and (v) coordinate and cooperate
with, and give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or
changes suggested by the other party in connection with, making (A) any filing
under or with respect to the HSR Act or any such other applicable laws and (B)
any filings, conferences or other submissions related to resolving any
investigation or other inquiry by any such Governmental Entity. Each of the
Company and Parent shall, and shall cause their respective affiliates to,
furnish to the other party all information necessary for any such application
or other filing to be made in connection with the Transactions. Each of the
Company and Parent shall promptly inform the other of any communication with,
and any proposed understanding, undertaking or agreement with, any Governmental
Entity regarding any such application or filing. If a party hereto intends to
independently participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity in
respect of any such filings, investigation or other inquiry, then such party
shall give the other party reasonable prior notice of such meeting. The parties
shall coordinate and cooperate with one another in connection with any
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party in connection with
all meetings, actions and proceedings under or relating to any such application
or filing.

         (b) The Company and Parent shall give (or shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to give) any notices to third parties, and use, and cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use, commercial best efforts to obtain any third
party consents, (i) necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
Transactions, (ii) required to be disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule
or the Parent Disclosure Schedule, as applicable or (iii) required to prevent a
Company Material Adverse Effect from occurring prior to or after the
consummation of the Offers; provided, however, that the Company and Parent
shall coordinate and cooperate in determining whether any actions, notices,
consents, approvals or waivers are required to be given or obtained, or should
be given or obtained, from parties to any Company Material Contracts in
connection with consummation of the Transactions and seeking any such actions,
notices, consents, approvals or waivers. In the event that either party shall
fail to obtain any third party consent described in the first sentence of this
Section 6.6(b), such party shall use commercial best efforts, and shall take
any such actions reasonably requested by the other party hereto, to mitigate
any adverse effect upon the Company and Parent, their respective Subsidiaries,
and their respective businesses resulting, or which could reasonably be
expected to result after the consummation of the Offers, from the failure to
obtain such consent.

         (c) From the date of this Agreement until the consummation of the
Offers, each of Parent and the Company shall promptly notify the other in
writing of any pending or, to the knowledge of Parent or the Company (as the
case may be), threatened action, suit, arbitration or other proceeding or
investigation by any Governmental Entity or any other Person (i) challenging or
seeking material damages in connection with the Transactions or (ii) seeking to
restrain or prohibit the consummation of the Transactions or otherwise limit in
any material respect the right of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary to own or
operate all or any portion of the businesses or assets of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary.

         (d) If any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by a Governmental Entity
challenging the Transactions as violative of any applicable law, each of the
Company and Parent shall, and shall cause their respective affiliates to,
cooperate and use their commercial best efforts to contest and resist, except
insofar as the Company and Parent may otherwise agree, any such action or
proceeding, including any action or proceeding that seeks a temporary
restraining order or preliminary injunction that would prohibit, prevent or
restrict consummation of the Transactions.

         (e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or
Purchaser, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the
operations of the Company prior to the consummation of the Offers. Prior to the
consummation of the Offers, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, control and supervision over its
business operations.

         (f) Notwithstanding anything set forth in Section 6.6 and any other
provision hereof, in connection with the receipt of any necessary governmental
approvals or clearances (including under the HSR Act), neither Parent nor the
Company shall be required to sell, hold separate or otherwise dispose of or
conduct their business in a specified manner, or agree to sell, hold separate
or otherwise dispose of or conduct their business in a specified manner, or
permit the sale, holding separate or other disposition of, any assets of
Parent, the Company or their respective Subsidiaries or the conduct of their
business in a specified manner.

         Section 6.7 Publicity. So long as this Agreement is in effect, neither
the Company nor Parent, nor any of their respective controlled affiliates,
shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or other announcement
with respect to the Offers, the Merger or this Agreement without the prior
consent of the other party, except as such party reasonably believes, after
receiving the advice of outside counsel, is required by law or by any listing
agreement with or listing rules of a national securities exchange or trading
market in which event such party shall, on a basis reasonable under the
circumstances, to provide a meaningful opportunity to the other parties to
review and comment upon such press release or other announcement and shall give
due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto.

         Section 6.8 Directors' and Officers' Insurance and Indemnification.
(a) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation (or any successor to the Surviving Corporation) shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless the past and present officers and directors of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries (the "Covered Persons") as provided in the
terms of the Company Certificate or Company Bylaws and under any agreements
(the "Indemnification Agreements") as in effect on the date hereof (true and
correct copies of which have been previously provided to Parent) (provided,
that the Surviving Corporation's obligation to pay any amount in settlement
shall be conditioned upon such settlement being effected with the written
consent of the Parent, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld),
arising out of or in connection with actions or omissions occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time, whether or not asserted prior to the Effective Time
(including acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this
Agreement and the Transactions and the consummation of the Transactions);
provided, however, that in the event any claim or claims are asserted or made
within such six-year period, all rights to indemnification (including
advancement of expenses) in respect of any such claim or claims shall continue
until disposition of any and all such claims.

         (b) The Surviving Corporation (or any successor to the Surviving
Corporation) shall advance expenses (including legal fees and expenses)
incurred in the defense of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
with respect to any matters subject to indemnification hereunder pursuant to
the procedures set forth, and to the extent provided in the Company
Certificate, the Company Bylaws or the Indemnification Agreements; provided,
however, that any person to whom expenses are advanced undertakes, to the
extent required by the DGCL, to repay such advanced expenses if it is
ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification.

         (c) Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall maintain and extend all
existing officers' and directors' liability insurance ("D&O Insurance") (but
only with respect to the Side A coverage for Covered Persons where the existing
policies also include coverage for the Company) for a period of not less than
six years after the Effective Time with respect to claims arising in whole or
in part from facts or events that actually or allegedly occurred on or before
the Effective Date, including in connection with the approval of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that Parent may
substitute therefor policies of substantially equivalent coverage and amounts
containing terms no less favorable to the Covered Person; provided, further,
that if the existing D&O Insurance expires or is terminated or cancelled during
such period through no fault of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, then
Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall obtain substantially similar D&O
Insurance; provided further, however, that in no event shall Parent be required
to pay aggregate premiums for insurance under this Section 6.8(c) in excess of
300% of the aggregate premiums paid by the Company in 2004 on an annualized
basis for such purpose (the "Average Premium"), which true and correct amount
is set forth in Section 6.8(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule; and
provided, further, that if Parent or the Surviving Corporation is unable to
obtain the amount of insurance required by this Section 6.8(c) for such
aggregate premium, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall obtain as much
insurance as can be obtained for aggregate premiums not in excess of 300% of
the Average Premium. In lieu of the foregoing, the Company may elect to obtain
prepaid policies prior to the Effective Time, which policies provide the
Covered Persons with D&O Insurance coverage of equivalent amount and on at
least as favorable terms as that provided by the Company's current D&O
Insurance for an aggregate period of at least six years with respect to claims
arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time,
including, without limitation, in connection with the approval of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that the
aggregate premium for such prepaid policies shall not exceed 300% of the
Average Premium. If such prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
maintain such policies in full force and effect, and continue to honor the
obligations thereunder. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall consult
with Parent in connection with the purchase or acquisition of any D&O Insurance
on or after the date hereof, and the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall
not purchase or acquire any D&O Insurance on or after the date hereof without
first consulting with Parent.

         (d) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall
contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of Covered Persons than are currently
set forth in the Company Certificate and the Company Bylaws. The
Indemnification Agreements with Covered Persons in existence on the date of
this Agreement that survive the Merger shall continue in full force and effect
in accordance with their terms. Parent shall not permit the Surviving
Corporation to distribute or dispose of assets in a manner that would render
the Surviving Corporation unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations
pursuant to this Section 6.8.

         (e) In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any person, then and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that such continuing or surviving corporation or entity or transferee of such
assets, as the case may be, shall assume all of the applicable obligations set
forth in this Section 6.8.

         (f) The Covered Persons (and their successors and heirs) are intended
third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.8, and this Section 6.8 shall not
be amended in a manner that is adverse to the Covered Persons (including their
successors and heirs) or terminated without the consent of the Covered Persons
(including their successors and heirs) affected thereby.

         Section 6.9 Purchaser Compliance. Parent shall cause Purchaser to
comply with all of its obligations under this Agreement.

         Section 6.10 State Takeover Laws. If any state takeover statute
becomes or is deemed to become applicable to the Company, the Offers, the
acquisition of Shares pursuant to the Offers, or the Merger, then the Company
Board of Directors shall (i) in the case of Section 203 of the DGCL, take all
action necessary and (ii) in the case of any other state takeover statute, use
its commercial best efforts, to render such statute inapplicable to the
foregoing.

         Section 6.11 Certain Tax Matters. During the period from the date
hereof to the Effective Time, the Company shall and shall cause each of the
Company Subsidiaries to: (i) timely file all Tax Returns ("Post Signing
Returns") required to be filed by the Company or such Company Subsidiary, as
the case may be, and except as otherwise set forth in Section 6.11 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, all Post Signing Returns shall be prepared in a
manner consistent with past practice, (ii) timely pay all Taxes due and payable
by the Company and such Company Subsidiary, respectively and (iii) promptly
notify Parent of any federal or state income or franchise, or other material
Tax Claim pending against or with respect to the Company or any Company
Subsidiary (or any significant developments with respect to ongoing federal or
state income or franchise or other material Tax Claims), including material Tax
liabilities and material refund claims.

         Section 6.12 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the expiration date of the
Offers, Parent and the Company shall use their respective commercial best
efforts take all such reasonable steps as may be required by applicable SEC
"no-action" letters (to the extent permitted under applicable law) to cause any
dispositions of Shares or acquisitions of shares of Parent Common Stock
(including derivative securities with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock)
resulting from the transactions contemplated by Article I and Article II by
each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a)
of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act. Parent shall not designate, or cause to be
designated, any individuals who are officers of the Company immediately prior
to the consummation of the Offers as individuals subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to Parent as of
the Effective Time.

         Section 6.13 Employee Benefits. (a) Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, for purposes of this Section 6.13, "Company Employees" means
individuals who are, as of the Effective Time, employees of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary. The Company has previously delivered to Parent a list of
each individual who would be a Company Employee if the Effective Time occurred
on the date hereof and the current rate of base salary and target bonus for
each such employee. Without limiting any rights that any Company Employee may
have under any Benefit Plan, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and
each of its subsidiaries, for a period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending twelve months thereafter, to maintain and perform in accordance with
their respective terms any Company severance arrangement or policy set forth on
Section 6.13(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain and perform in accordance with
their respective terms the Company's annual or incentive bonus programs or
arrangements for the 2004 fiscal year set forth on Section 6.13(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule.

         (b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor in
accordance with their terms the employment agreements set forth on Section
3.12(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

         (c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its
subsidiaries, for the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending twelve
months thereafter, to maintain for Company Employees in the aggregate, subject
to paragraph (a) above, compensation levels (such term to include salary, bonus
opportunities and commissions) and benefits (other than equity-based benefits
and compensation) that in the aggregate are not materially less favorable than
the overall compensation levels and benefits (other than equity-based benefits
and compensation) maintained for and provided to such Company Employees
immediately before the Effective Time.

         (d) As of and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, give Company Employees full credit for purposes
of eligibility and vesting and for purposes of determining the level of
benefits under any employee compensation and incentive plans, benefit
(including vacation) plans, programs, policies and arrangements (other than
benefit accruals under defined benefit pension plans and benefits under retiree
medical plans) maintained for the benefit of Company Employees as of and after
the Effective Time by Parent, its subsidiaries and their predecessor entities
to the same extent recognized by the Company immediately before the Effective
Time. With respect to each employee benefit plan maintained, sponsored by or
contributed to by Parent that is a "welfare benefit plan" (as defined in
Section 3(1) of ERISA) the Parent or its subsidiaries shall (i) cause there to
be waived any pre-existing condition or eligibility limitations to the extent
waived under the corresponding Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Effective
Time and (ii) give effect, in determining any deductible and maximum
out-of-pocket limitations, to claims incurred and amounts paid by, and amounts
reimbursed to, Company Employees under the corresponding Benefit Plan
immediately before the Effective Time.

         Section 6.14 Bankruptcy Court Approval. The Company, Purchaser and
Parent shall use their commercial best efforts to facilitate, and cooperate
with the applicable bankruptcy courts to obtain, any approvals required by such
courts in connection with the Transactions.

         Section 6.15 Limitation on Amendments and Waivers to Certain
Stockholder Agreements. Without the prior consent of the Company, Parent and
Purchaser shall not enter into any amendment to or waive any provision of any
Stockholder Agreement with any Stockholder (other than Jeffrey G. Katz) which
(x) is not agreed or consented to by the other Stockholders (other than Jeffrey
G. Katz) and (y) if entered into and not consented to by any other Stockholder
(other than Jeffrey G. Katz) would entitle such other Stockholder to terminate
the Stockholder Agreement to which it is a party. The Company acknowledges and
agrees that no amendment or waiver to any Stockholder Agreement with any
Stockholder (other than Jeffrey G. Katz) shall be deemed an amendment or waiver
for purposes of this Section 6.15 unless it satisfies the requirements of
Section 12(j) of the applicable Stockholder Agreement.


                                  Article VII

                                   CONDITIONS

         Section 7.1 Conditions to Each Party's Obligations to Effect the
Merger. The respective obligations of each party to effect the Merger shall be
subject to the satisfaction on or prior to the Closing Date of each of the
following conditions, any and all of which may be waived in whole or in part by
Parent, Purchaser and the Company, as the case may be, to the extent permitted
by applicable law:

         (a) Stockholder Approval. The Merger and this Agreement shall have
been approved and adopted by the Required Company Holders, unless the condition
set forth in clause (iii) of the first paragraph of Annex I has been waived by
Purchaser;

         (b) Statutes; Court Orders. No statute, rule or regulation shall have
been enacted or promulgated by any Governmental Entity which prohibits the
consummation of the Merger, and there shall be no order or injunction of a
court of competent jurisdiction in effect preventing consummation of the
Merger; and

         (c) Purchase of Shares in Offers. The Purchaser shall have accepted
for payment and purchased, or caused to be accepted for payment and purchased,
all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offers; provided,
however, that this condition shall be deemed to have been satisfied with
respect to the obligation of Parent and Purchaser to effect the Merger if
Purchaser fails to accept for payment or pay for Shares validly tendered and
not withdrawn pursuant to the Offers in violation of the terms of the Offers or
of this Agreement.


                                 Article VIII

                                  TERMINATION

         Section 8.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the
Transactions may be abandoned at any time before the Effective Time, whether
before or after stockholder approval thereof:

         (a) By mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

         (b) By Parent, in the case of clause (iii) below, or by either Parent
or the Company, in the case of clauses (i), (ii) and (iv) below:

                  (i) if a court of competent jurisdiction or other
         Governmental Entity shall have issued a final, non-appealable order,
         decree or ruling or taken any other action, in each case permanently
         restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting any of the
         Transactions or any of the Stockholder Agreements or the granting of
         any approvals required from the Required Company Holders such that the
         conditions set forth in Article VII or Annex I shall not be capable of
         being satisfied;

                  (ii) prior to acceptance for payment of Shares pursuant to
         the Offers, if there has been a breach by the other party of any
         representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this
         Agreement, which breach shall result in any condition set forth in
         Annex I not being satisfied (and such breach is not reasonably capable
         of being cured and such condition is not reasonably capable of being
         satisfied within 20 days after the receipt of notice thereof by the
         defaulting party from the non-defaulting party);

                  (iii) prior to acceptance for payment of Shares pursuant to
         the Offers there shall have occurred a Company Material Adverse
         Change; or

                  (iv) if acceptance for payment of Shares pursuant to the
         Offers has not occurred by December 31, 2004; provided, however, that
         such date (x) shall be extended to January 31, 2005 if all conditions
         to the Offers other than the Litigation Condition, the Governmental
         Approval Condition (which for purposes of this Section 8.1(b)(iv) also
         shall be deemed to include the conditions set forth in paragraphs (h)
         and (j) (to the extent arising out of litigation) of Annex I), the
         Stockholder Approval Condition or the HSR Condition have been or are
         reasonably capable of being satisfied at the time of such extension
         and (y) shall be extended to April 30, 2005 if all conditions to the
         Offers other than the HSR Condition or the Litigation Condition (to
         the extent relating solely to antitrust and competition law matters)
         have been or are capable of being satisfied at the time of such
         extension (such date, as it may be extended, shall be referred to
         herein as the "Drop Dead Date"); provided, further, however, that the
         right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this clause (iv) shall
         not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation
         or whose breach of representation or warranty under this Agreement has
         been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the acceptance for
         payment of Shares pursuant to the Offers to have occurred by such
         date;

         (c) By Parent, at any time prior to the acceptance for payment of the
Shares pursuant to the Offers, if (i) the Board of Directors of the Company, or
any committee thereof, shall have made a Company Change in Recommendation or
(ii) the Company shall have breached any of its obligations under Sections 5.2
or 5.3 in any material respect;

         (d) By Parent, if the Offers shall have expired without acceptance for
payment of Shares thereunder (including as a result of the failure to satisfy
the Governmental Approval Condition), other than as a result of a breach by
Purchaser of its obligations hereunder or thereunder;

         (e) By the Company upon a Company Change in Recommendation in order to
enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, pursuant
to Section 5.3(b); provided, however, that prior to the Company's termination
of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(e), the Company shall have
complied with the provisions of Section 5.2 and 5.3; provided, further, that
for purposes of this Section 8.1(e) only, the Company shall be deemed to be in
compliance with Sections 5.2 and 5.3 if a breach of Section 5.2 or 5.3 by the
Company or its Representatives is immaterial and unintentional and does not
relate to the party who made such Superior Proposal;

         (f) By the Company, if Purchaser shall have failed to commence the
Offers as provided in Section 1.1(a) or if the Offers shall have terminated or
expired without acceptance for payment of Shares thereunder; provided, however,
that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(f) due
to Purchaser's failure to commence the Offers shall not be available to the
Company prior to December 31, 2004 if its failure to fulfill any obligation or
breach of representation or warranty under this Agreement has been the cause
of, or resulted in, the failure of the commencement of the Offers or of the
acceptance for payment of Shares thereunder;

         (g) By Parent, if within ten business days following the date hereof,
UAL Corporation ("United") shall not have filed a motion in the Bankruptcy
Court seeking an order (A) approving the Stockholder Agreement to which United
is a party and all other documents and instruments executed by United in
connection therewith and (B) authorizing (1) United to execute, deliver and
perform its obligations under each of the Stockholder Agreement, the
Stockholder Transaction Consent and the Company Stockholders Agreement Waiver
to which United is a party (including to adopt and approve this Agreement and
the Merger) and the other documents and instruments by United in connection
therewith and (2) United to tender and sell its Shares pursuant to the Class B
Offer and the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "United
Approval");

         (h) By Parent, prior to the acceptance of Shares pursuant to the
Offers, if any of the Stockholder Agreements is terminated by the Stockholder
that is a party thereto or shall otherwise not be in effect such that the
condition in clause (ii) of the first paragraph of Annex I would not be
satisfied; and

         Section 8.2 Effect of Termination. (a) In the event of the termination
of this Agreement as provided in Sections 8.1 or 8.3, written notice thereof
shall forthwith be given to the other party or parties specifying the provision
hereof pursuant to which such termination is made, and this Agreement shall
forthwith become null and void and there shall be no liability on the part of
Parent, Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective affiliates except (i)
as set forth in Sections 6.5(a), 8.2, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5, 9.7, 9.9, 9.10 and 9.12
and (ii) nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for any willful
breach of representations and warranties, or material breach of any covenant,
contained in this Agreement.

         (b) If (i) Parent shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to
clause (i) of Section 8.1(c), (ii) the Company shall have terminated this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e) or (iii)(x) Parent shall have terminated
this Agreement pursuant to Sections 8.1(d) and at the time of such termination
the condition set forth in clause (j) of Annex I shall not have been satisfied
or 8.1(g) and (y) following the date hereof but prior to such termination an
Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly made and not withdrawn (which
Acquisition Proposal provides the Company's stockholders an equal or higher
price per share than the Offers Price) and a definitive agreement with respect
to such Acquisition Proposal has been entered into within nine months after
termination of this Agreement, then the Company shall pay to Parent promptly,
but in no event later than two business days after the date of such termination
(unless such termination is pursuant to Section 8.1(e), in which case payment
shall be a condition to such termination), a termination fee of $40,570,000
(the "Termination Fee"). Except to the extent required by applicable law, the
Company shall not withhold any withholding taxes on any payment under this
Section 8.2.

         (c) Parent and Purchaser agree that the payment set forth in Section
8.2(b), if such payment is payable and is actually paid, shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of Parent and Purchaser upon the termination of this Agreement
in the circumstances described in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of Section 8.2.

         Section 8.3 Automatic Termination. This Agreement shall terminate
automatically if any Stockholder (other than Jeffrey G. Katz) terminates the
Stockholder Agreement to which such Stockholder is a party in accordance with
Sections 9(a) or 9(b) thereof.

any respect or amend or modify any condition to the Class A Offer in a manner
adverse to the holders of Class A Shares or (z) discriminate against the

         Section 9.5 Interpretation. When a reference is made in this Agreement
to Sections, such reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." As used in this Agreement, the term "affiliates" shall
have the meaning set forth in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act.

         Section 9.6 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed manually or
by facsimile by the parties hereto, in any number of counterparts, each of
which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective
when a counterpart hereof shall have been signed by each of the parties and
delivered to the other parties.

         Section 9.7 Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This
Agreement, the Company Stockholders Agreement Waiver executed by the Company
and the Confidentiality Agreement:

         (a) constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all other prior agreements
(except the Confidentiality Agreement) and understandings, both written and
oral, among the parties or any of them with respect to the subject matter
hereof and thereof, and

         (b) except as provided in Section 6.8, are not intended to confer upon
any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder.

         Section 9.8 Severability. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by rule of law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner adverse to any
party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the
Transactions are fulfilled to the extent possible.

         Section 9.9 Governing Law; Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware
without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law thereof. Each of
the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to submit to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, and
any appellate court thereof, for any litigation arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or the agreements delivered in connection herewith or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, to the extent the Court of
Chancery has jurisdiction over the claims alleged in such litigation, or, if
the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction over the claims alleged in
such litigation, the courts of the State of Delaware and of the United States
of America located in the State of Delaware, and each of the parties hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence any such litigation
except in such courts, (ii) waives any objection to the laying of venue of any
such litigation in such Delaware courts and (iii) agrees not to plead or claim
in any Delaware court that such litigation brought therein has been brought in
an inconvenient forum. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to
service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 9.4. Nothing
in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve
process in any other manner permitted by law.

         Section 9.10 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY IS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT
OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (B) IT
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (C) IT MAKES
SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS
SECTION 9.10.

         Section 9.11 Assignment. This Agreement shall not be assigned by any
of the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the
prior written consent of the other parties, except that Purchaser may assign,
in its sole discretion and without the consent of any other party, any or all
of its rights, interests and obligations hereunder to (i) Parent, (ii) to
Parent and one or more direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries of Parent
or (iii) to one or more direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries of Parent
(each, an "Assignee"). Any such Assignee may thereafter assign, in its sole
discretion and without the consent of any other party, any or all of its
rights, interests and obligations hereunder to one or more additional
Assignees. Subject to the preceding sentence, but without relieving any party
hereto of any obligation hereunder, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure
to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective
successors and assigns.

         Section 9.12 Enforcement. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms. It is accordingly
agreed that the parties hereto shall be entitled to specific performance of the
terms hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent, Purchaser and the Company have caused this
Agreement to be signed by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized

         Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Offers, and in addition to
(and not in limitation of) Purchaser's rights to extend and amend the Offers at
any time in its sole discretion (subject to the provisions of the Merger
Agreement and any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule
14e-l(c) under the Exchange Act), Purchaser shall not be required to accept for
payment, and may delay the acceptance for payment of any validly tendered
Shares unless the Minimum Condition shall have been satisfied. Furthermore,
notwithstanding any other provisions of the Offers, subject to the provisions
of the Merger Agreement and any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC,
including Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act, Purchaser shall not be required
to accept for payment or pay for any validly tendered Shares if, (i) any
applicable waiting period under the HSR Act has not expired or terminated prior
to the termination or expiration of the Offers (the "HSR Condition"), (ii) as
of the termination or expiration of the Offers, there shall be any Class B
Shares which Purchaser is not be permitted to accept for payment, and purchase,
without the consent or approval of any Governmental Entity (the "Governmental
Approval Condition") and such consent or approval has not been obtained;
provided, however, that the condition set forth in this clause (ii) shall be
deemed to have been satisfied at the termination or expiration of the Offers if
(A) the Stockholder Approval Condition has been satisfied and (B) all Class B
Shares (other than any single series of Class B Common Stock representing not
more than 15% of the issued and outstanding Shares) shall have been validly
tendered in the Class B Offer and may be accepted for payment and purchased in
the Offers, (iii) any approval required pursuant to Sections 8.2(a), 8.2(b) and
8.2(c) of the Company Certificate ("Stockholder Consent") has not been obtained
prior to, or is not in full force and effect as of, the expiration or
termination of, the Offers (the "Stockholder Approval Condition"), (iv) any
Stockholder or creditors' committee or United States Trustee in any bankruptcy
or reorganization case under Title 11 of the United States Code (a "Bankruptcy
Case") involving a Stockholder (other than Jeffrey G. Katz), shall have
asserted that any Stockholder Consent previously executed and delivered is not
valid, binding or enforceable or that the actions purportedly authorized
therein may not be taken as a result of a Bankruptcy Event involving a
Stockholder; provided, however, that this condition (iv) shall be deemed to
have been waived by Purchaser unless (x) within three business days of
Purchaser acquiring knowledge that such assertion has been made, Purchaser or
Parent shall have filed in the court with jurisdiction over such Stockholder's
Bankruptcy Case appropriate pleadings challenging such assertion and (y)
Purchaser shall not have abandoned the challenge of such assertion or (v) any
of the following events has occurred:

         (a) there shall be threatened in writing (and not withdrawn) or
pending (and not withdrawn) any suit, action or proceeding by any Governmental
Entity (the "Litigation Condition") against Purchaser, Parent, the Company or
any Company Subsidiary (i) seeking to prohibit or impose any material
limitations on Parent's or Purchaser's ownership or operation (or that of any
of their respective Subsidiaries or affiliates) of all or a material portion of
their or the Company's and the Company Subsidiaries' businesses or assets,
taken as a whole, or to compel Parent or Purchaser or their respective
Subsidiaries and affiliates to dispose of, license or hold separate any
material portion of the business or assets of the Company or Parent and their
respective Subsidiaries, in each case taken as a whole, except to the extent
any such suit, action or proceeding would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect, (ii) challenging the acquisition by Parent or
Purchaser of any Shares under the Offers or seeking to restrain or prohibit the
making or consummation of the Offers or the Merger or the performance of any of
the other Transactions that, if successful, would result in the condition set
forth in clause (ii) of the first paragraph of this Annex I not being
satisfied, (iii) seeking to impose material limitations on the ability of
Purchaser, or render Purchaser unable, to accept for payment, pay for or
purchase some or all of the Shares pursuant to the Offers and the Merger that,
if successful, would result in the condition set forth in clause (ii) of the
first paragraph of this Annex I not being satisfied, (iv) seeking to impose
material limitations on the ability of Purchaser or Parent effectively to
exercise full rights of ownership of the Shares, including, without limitation,
the right to vote the Shares purchased by it on all matters properly presented
to the Company's stockholders, (v) seeking to invalidate or otherwise
challenging any of the actions taken by any of the Stockholders pursuant to the
Stockholder Agreements or this Agreement (including, without limitation, the
approval of this Agreement and the Transactions) that, if successful, would
result in the condition set forth in clause (ii) of the first paragraph of this
Annex I not being satisfied or (vi) which otherwise would have a Company
Material Adverse Effect; provided, however, that the Litigation Condition with
respect to threatened (and not withdrawn) litigation shall be deemed to have
been satisfied if no suit or action in respect of such threatened litigation
shall have been filed or commenced within ten business days from such written
threat;

         (b) there shall be any statute, rule, regulation, judgment, order or
injunction enacted, entered, enforced, promulgated or which is deemed
applicable pursuant to an authoritative interpretation by or on behalf of a
Government Entity to the Offers or the Merger and which, in the case of any
judgment, order or injunction, has not been withdrawn or terminated, or any
other action shall be taken by any Governmental Entity, other than the
application to the Offers or the Merger of applicable waiting periods under HSR
Act, that is reasonably likely to result, directly or indirectly, in any of the
consequences referred to in clauses (i) through (v) of paragraph (a) above;

         (c) (i) any of the representations and warranties of the Company
contained in Sections 3.2(a) (but only as applied to each "significant
subsidiary" of the Company (as such term is defined in Rule 1.02 of Regulation
S-X)), 3.2(d), 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, the penultimate sentence of Section 3.8(a),
Section 3.13(b), the last sentence of Section 3.14, the first sentence of
Section 3.22 and Section 3.24 of this Agreement shall not be true in all
material respects as of the date of such determination, except for
representations and warranties that relate to a specific date or time (which
need only be true and correct in all material respects as of such date or
time), (ii) any of the representations and warranties of the Company contained
in Section 3.14(e) or Section 3.14(n) shall not be true, if the failure of such
representations and warranties to be true results from the failure to disclose
any Company Agreement which would impair (y) in any material respect, the
operation of the Company's business relative to the manner such business was
operated prior to the date hereof or (z) the operation of the combined
businesses of Parent and the Company in a manner that limits in a material
manner the synergies and benefits reasonably expected to be derived by Parent
from such combined businesses or (iii) except as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect, any of the
representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement,
other than representations and warranties referenced in clauses (i) or (ii) of
this paragraph (d), shall not be true and correct (except with respect to
Section 3.9(a), without giving effect to any references to materiality or
Company Material Adverse Effect contained therein) as of the date at
determination, except for representations and warranties that relate to a
specific date or time (which need only be true and correct (except with respect
to Section 3.9(a), without giving effect to any references to materiality or
Company Material Adverse Effect contained therein) as of such date);

         (d) since the date of the Merger Agreement, there shall have occurred
a Company Material Adverse Change;

         (e) (i) except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Company Material Adverse Effect, the Company shall have breached or failed to
perform or to comply with any agreement or covenant to be performed or complied
with by it under Sections 6.6(b) or (ii) the Company shall have breached or
failed, in any material respect, to perform or to comply with any agreement or
covenant to be performed or complied with by it under this Agreement (other
than the covenant referenced in clause (i) above) and such breach or failure
shall not have been cured;

         (f) Purchaser shall have failed to receive a certificate executed by
the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Company,
dated as of the scheduled expiration of the Offers, to the effect that the
conditions set forth in paragraphs (d), (e) and (g) of this Annex I have not
occurred;

         (g) the Merger Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with
its terms;

         (h) any party to a Stockholder Agreement other than Purchaser and
Parent shall have breached or failed to perform any of its covenants or
agreements under the Stockholder Agreement to which it is a party or breached
any of its representations and warranties contained in such Stockholder
Agreement, or any Stockholder Agreement (or any obligation contained therein)
shall not be valid, binding and enforceable (including by reason of occurrence
of a Bankruptcy Event (as defined herein)), except for such breaches or
failures or failures to be valid, binding and enforceable that would not result
in the Minimum Condition and the condition set forth in clause (ii) of the
first paragraph of this Annex A not being satisfied. "Bankruptcy Event" shall
mean a Stockholder has filed, or has filed against it, a petition for relief
under title 11 of the United States Code;

         (i) any of the Stockholder Agreements shall have been terminated and
such termination would result in the condition set forth in clause (ii) of the
first paragraph of this Annex I not being satisfied;

         (j) the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Illinois
(Eastern Division) (the "Bankruptcy Court") shall not have issued an order that
has become a Final Order authorizing (i) United to execute, deliver, and
perform under the Stockholder Agreement (including to approve the Merger
pursuant thereto) to which United is a party, the Stockholders Transaction
Consent executed and delivered by United and the Company Stockholders Agreement
Waiver executed by United and (ii) United to tender and sell its Shares
pursuant to the Offers and Stockholder Agreement, in form and substance
satisfactory to Parent and Purchaser. "Final Order" shall mean an order or
judgment of the Bankruptcy Court as to which (a) the time to appeal, petition
for certiorari, or motion for reargument or rehearing has expired and as to
which no appeal, petition for certiorari, or move for reargument or rehearing
shall then be pending or (b) in the event that an appeal, writ of certiorari,
reargument or rehearing thereof has been sought, such order of the Bankruptcy
Court shall have been affirmed by the highest court to which such order was
appealed, or certiorari has been denied, or from which reargument or rehearing
was sought, and the time to take any further appeal, petition for certiorari or
move for reargument or rehearing shall have expired; provided, however, that no
order shall fail to be a Final Order solely because of the possibility that a
motion pursuant to Rule 60 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or Rule 7024
of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure may be filed with respect to such
order, as long as such a motion has not actually been filed; or

         (k) there has been any Change in Tax Law that will materially increase
the risk that the IPO Exchange (as defined in the Company's 2003 Annual Report
filed on Form 10-K) will not (x) be treated as a fully taxable transaction
under Section 1001 of the Code or (y) result in the Company's adjusted tax
basis of the membership interests of Orbitz, LLC (contributed to the Company on
December 19, 2003) being equal to the fair market value of such membership
interests on December 19, 2003. "Change in Tax Law" means (i) any amendment to
the Code or final or temporary regulations promulgated under the Code, (ii) a
decision by any court or (iii) a revenue ruling, revenue procedure, notice, or
announcement, which (as the case may be) is enacted, promulgated, issued or
announced after the date of the Merger Agreement.

         The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and
Purchaser, may be asserted by Parent or Purchaser regardless of the
circumstances giving rise to such condition, and may be waived by Parent or
Purchaser in whole or in part at any time and from time to time and in the sole
discretion of Parent or Purchaser, subject in each case to the terms of this
Agreement. The failure by Parent or Purchaser at any time to exercise any of
the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and, each
such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time
and from time to time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Parent or Purchaser
waive any condition with respect to the Class B Offer, Parent and Purchaser
shall be deemed to have waived such conditions with respect to the Class A
Offer. Under no circumstances will Purchaser accept for payment any validly
tendered (i) Class B Shares unless Purchaser concurrently accept for payment
any validly tendered Class A Shares and (ii) Class A Shares unless Purchaser
concurrently accept for payment any validly tendered Class B Shares (and
Purchaser shall be deemed to have accepted for payment (i) such Class A Shares
immediately upon acceptance for payment of any such Class B Shares and (ii)
such Class B Shares immediately upon acceptance for payment of any such Class A
Shares). Parent and Purchaser shall not be permitted to waive the condition set
forth in paragraph (g) of this Annex I without the prior approval of the
Company Board of Directors (including the approval of a majority of the
Independent Directors).

         The capitalized terms used in this Annex I shall have the meanings set
forth in the Agreement to which it is annexed, except that the term "Merger
Agreement" shall be deemed to refer to the Agreement to which this Annex I is
annexed.
