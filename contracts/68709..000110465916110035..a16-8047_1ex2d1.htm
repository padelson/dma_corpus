and in the applicable provisions of the BCL. Without limiting the generality

2.5 _Directors and Officers_. The directors and officers of Merger Sub, in
each case, immediately prior to the Effective Time will, from and after the
Effective Time, be the directors and officers, respectively, of the Surviving
Corporation until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and

with the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation.

 



 

2.6 _Effects of Merger on Shares_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, Company or
any Shareholder:

 



 

a. _Conversion of Certain Shares_. All Shares that are owned by Parent, Merger
Sub or Company (as treasury stock or otherwise) or any of their respective
direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries will automatically be converted
into shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share of the Surviving
Corporation, except that the number of such Shares owned by any such Person
may be adjusted following the Merger to maintain relative ownership
percentages;

 



 

b. _Conversion of Shares_. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than: (1) Shares that are the subject of
**Section 2.6a**; and (2) Dissenting Shares) will be converted into the right
to receive in cash, without interest (unless otherwise provided in **Section
2.14b**, if any), in full satisfaction of the rights of the holder thereof
with respect thereto, an amount equal to: (x) the Aggregate Merger
Consideration divided by: (y) the total number of issued and outstanding
Shares owned by all Shareholders immediately prior to the Closing; subject to
and payable in accordance with **Sections 2.8, 2.9** , **2.13** and **2.14**
and the other provisions of this Agreement, at the respective times and
subject to the contingencies specified herein and therein; and

 



 

c. _Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock_. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time will be converted into and become one newly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation. It is the intention of the Parties

 



      
 

 



 

that immediately after the Merger, Parent will own all of the issued and
outstanding Capital Stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

2.7 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than Shares converted in accordance with **Section 2.6a**) and
held by a Shareholder who has not voted in favor of adoption of this Agreement
or consented thereto in writing and who has properly exercised appraisal
rights with respect to such Shares in accordance with Section 623 of the BCL
(such Shares being referred to collectively as " _Dissenting Shares_ " until
such time as such holder fails to perfect or otherwise loses such holders
appraisal rights under the BCL with respect to such Dissenting Shares) will
not be converted into a right to receive a portion of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration, but instead will entitle the Shareholder holding such
Dissenting Shares only to such relief as is provided by Section 623 of the
BCL; provided, however, that if, after the Effective Time, such Shareholder
fails to perfect, withdraws or loses such Shareholders right to appraisal
pursuant to Section 623 of the BCL or if a court of competent jurisdiction
determines that such Shareholder is not entitled to the relief provided by
Section 623 of the BCL, then, in either case, such Dissenting Shares will be
treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right
to receive the portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration, if any, without
any interest thereon (unless otherwise provided in **Section 2.14b**, if
any), to which such Shareholder is entitled pursuant to this **Article 2
**and elsewhere in this Agreement.

 



 

2.8 _Surrender Payment_.

 



 

a. _Cancellation of Shares_. At the Effective Time, pursuant to **Sections
2.6b** and **2.7** , all Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time will automatically be cancelled and retired and will cease to exist, and
each holder of a certificate formerly representing any Shares (each, a "
_Certificate_ ") will cease to have any rights in such holders capacity as a
shareholder of Company other than the right to receive the applicable portion
of the Aggregate Merger Consideration into which such Shares represented by
such Certificates have been converted pursuant to, and subject to the terms
and conditions of, this Agreement.

 



 

b. _Shareholder List_. Prior to the Effective Time, Company will deliver to
Parent and Exchange Agent a current list of the Shareholders and their
respective mailing addresses and other contact information, in substantially
the form attached hereto as **Exhibit D** (the " _Shareholder List_ ").

 



 

c. _Letters of Transmittal_. Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, the Exchange
Agent will: (1) at least Five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
provide to each Shareholder a letter of transmittal in substantially the form
attached as **Exhibit E** (a " _Letter of Transmittal_ "), including
instructions for effecting the surrender of Certificates in exchange for a
portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration to which such Shareholder is
entitled in accordance with the provisions of this **Article 2**; and (2) on
the later of: (x) the Closing Date; or (y) the date the Exchange Agent
receives a Certificate, together with a Letter of Transmittal duly completed
and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and any
other customary documents that the Exchange Agent may reasonably require in
connection therewith, pay to such Shareholder such Shareholders Participation
Percentage of the Payment Fund with

 



      
 

 



 

respect to such Shareholders Certificate or Certificates so surrendered,
whereupon the Certificate or Certificates will forthwith be cancelled by
Company. Unless otherwise provided herein, no interest will be paid or will
accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate. Until so
surrendered, each outstanding Certificate that prior to the Effective Time
represented Shares (other than Dissenting Shares) will be deemed from and
after the Effective Time, for all purposes, to evidence the right to receive
the appropriate Participation Percentage of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration. If after the Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to
the Exchange Agent, it will be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
**Section 2.8c.**

 



 

d. _Future Payments_. Each Shareholder will also be entitled to such
Shareholders Participation Percentage of any amounts that may be payable in
the future in respect of the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate
(from the Escrow Funds as provided in this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement)
on account of any post-Closing adjustment described in **Section 2.14** or
any other release of Escrow Funds, at the respective time and subject to the
contingencies specified herein. Unless otherwise provided herein, no interest
will be paid or accrued for the benefit of Shareholders with respect to any
such payments after such payments have been received by the Exchange Agent.

 



 

e. _Transferred Shares_. If any portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration
is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate is registered, it will be a condition to such payment that: (1)
such Certificate will be properly endorsed or will otherwise be in proper form
for transfer; and (2) the Person requesting such payment will pay to the
Exchange Agent any transfer or other Tax required as a result of such payment
to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish
to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been
paid or is not payable.

 



 

f. _Dissenting Shares_. Any portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration made
available to the Exchange Agent in respect of any Dissenting Shares will be
returned to Parent, upon demand, subject to **Section 2.7 **above.

 



 

g. _Escheat_. If a Shareholder has not delivered to the Exchange Agent a duly
completed and executed Letter of Transmittal with respect to any Shares held
by such Shareholder, together with the Certificate or Certificates
representing such Shares, prior to the date that is One (1) year after the
Effective Time, then the Aggregate Merger Consideration payable in respect of
such Shares, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, will become the
property of the Surviving Corporation and will be paid by the Exchange Agent
or the Escrow Agent, as the case may be, to the Surviving Corporation.
Thereafter, the former holders of such Shares will be entitled to look only to
the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Aggregate Merger Consideration
payable upon surrender of such Shares in accordance with the provisions of
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Shareholder
Representative Group, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the
Shareholders or any their respective Affiliates will be liable to any former
holder of Shares for any portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration paid to
any Government Entity pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Applicable Law.

 



      
 

 



 

2.9 _Escrow Amounts_. At the Closing, Parent will have, pursuant to **Section
6.6**, already deposited with the Escrow Agent: (a) the Post-Closing
Adjustment Escrow Amount, to be held pursuant to the Escrow Agreement for the
purpose of securing the post-Closing adjustment obligations of the
Shareholders set forth in **Section 2.14**; and (b) the Indemnification
Escrow Amount, to be held pursuant to the Escrow Agreement for the purpose of
securing the Shortfall Amount, if any, and the indemnification obligations of
the Shareholders set forth in **Sections 5.9b** and **7.1**. Any amounts being
held by the Escrow Agent at the Closing in excess of the sum of the Post-
Closing Adjustment Escrow Amount and the Indemnification Escrow Amount will be
wired by the Escrow Agent to the Exchange Agent. To the extent not used for
the purposes set forth in **Sections 5.9b** and **7.1** , the Escrow Funds
will be released to the Exchange Agent, on behalf of and for payment to the
Shareholders, pursuant to Section 1.3 or 1.4 of the Escrow Agreement, as the
case may be. The amount payable to each Shareholder will be equal to such
Shareholders Participation Percentage of the amount released as directed in
accordance with instructions executed by the Shareholder Representative Group
and provided prior to such payment being made and Parent and Merger Sub shall
not have any responsibility for the calculation by the Shareholder
Representative Group of any such payments.

 



 

2.10 _No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. All Aggregate Merger
Consideration paid or payable upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance
with the terms hereof will be deemed to have been paid or payable in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares formerly represented by
such Certificate, and from and after the Effective Time, there will be no
further registration of transfers of Shares on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation, they will be cancelled and exchanged
for the Aggregate Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with
the procedures set forth, in this **Article 2** and elsewhere in this
Agreement.

 



 

2.11 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and if required by Parent or
the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as
Parent or the Exchange Agent may reasonably determine is necessary as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Corporation, the Exchange Agent (or, if following one year after the Effective
Time and subject to **Section 2.8g**, the Surviving Corporation) will issue,
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Aggregate

Shareholder Representative Group a balance sheet of Company as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time, prepared in accordance with GAAP (the " _Closing
Balance Sheet_ "), that includes a calculation and statement of: (1) Current
Assets, Current Liabilities and Net Working Capital; (2) the Closing Cash; (3)

requested by the Shareholder Representative Group to verify the accuracy of
the Closing Balance Sheet (provided, the independent accountant of Parent
shall not be obligated to make any workpapers available to any Person unless
and until such Person has signed a customary confidentiality agreement
relating to such access to workpapers in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to such independent accountant).

 



 

b. _Payment_. The Closing Balance Sheet, as determined pursuant to this
**Section 2.14**, will be the " _Final Closing Balance Sheet_." If Aggregate
Merger Consideration, as reflected in the Final Closing Balance Sheet:

 



 

(1) exceeds the Estimated Aggregate Merger Consideration, then Parent will pay

the Shareholders. The amount payable to each Shareholder will be in accordance
with such Shareholders Participation Percentage as set forth in a written
statement prepared by the Shareholder Representative Group and delivered to
the Exchange Agent prior to the distribution of such payment by the Exchange
Agent to the Shareholders, and Parent and Merger Sub shall not have any
responsibility for the calculation by the Shareholder Representative Group of
any such payments; or

 



 

(2) is less than the Estimated Aggregate Merger Consideration, then an
aggregate amount equal to such deficit will be paid to Parent from the Post-
Closing Adjustment Escrow Fund in accordance with, and subject to, the terms
and conditions of the Escrow Agreement; provided, however, if the Post-Closing
Adjustment Escrow Fund is insufficient to cover such deficit (such shortfall,
the " _Shortfall Amount_ "), then the entire amount of the Post-Closing
Adjustment Escrow Fund will be paid to Parent and the Shortfall Amount will be
paid from the Indemnification Escrow Fund to Parent in accordance with, and
subject to, the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement.

 



 

Any payment required pursuant to this **Section 2.14b** will be paid within
Ten (10) days after the Final Closing Balance Sheet becomes final, binding and
non-appealable on the Parties pursuant to this **Section 2.14**, by wire
transfer or delivery of immediately available funds. Any amounts

 



      
 

 



 

not paid to the Exchange Agent or Parent, as applicable, when required
pursuant to this **Section 2.14b** will bear interest from the required date
of payment to the actual date of payment at a rate that is Two Percent (2%)

N.A. in New York, New York from time to time as its prime rate.

books and records reasonably necessary or relevant to determine the Aggregate
Merger Consideration. All such books and records will be retained by Parent

5.10**. The Shareholder Representative Group will have Forty-Five (45) days

Balance Sheet (such Forty-Five (45) day period, the " _Balance Sheet Review
Period_ "). Each of Parent and the Shareholder Representative Group will, and
Parent will cause Company to, cooperate with, make the records of Company

Representative Group of, and the resolution of any objections or disputes with
respect to, the Closing Balance Sheet. Upon prior written notice to Parent
from the Shareholder Representative Group, Parent will make available to the
Shareholder Representative Group and its Representatives, and Parent will
cause Company to make available to the Shareholder Representative Group and
its Representatives, during reasonable business hours, the management and
staff of Company and the Person or Persons who prepared the Closing Balance
Sheet and any workpapers, information and other relevant documents and records
that the Shareholder Representative Group and its Representatives may
reasonably request in connection with the review of the Closing Balance Sheet;
provided, however, the independent accountant of Parent or the Shareholder
Representative Group shall not be obligated to make any workpapers available
to any Person unless and until such Person has signed a customary
confidentiality agreement relating to such access to workpapers in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to such independent accountant.

 



 

d. _Dispute Resolution_.

 



 

(1) If a Balance Sheet Objections Statement is not delivered to Parent by the
Shareholder Representative Group on or before the last day of the Balance
Sheet Review Period, then the Closing Balance Sheet will automatically become
final, binding and non-appealable on the Parties.

 



 

(2) If within the Balance Sheet Review Period, the Shareholder Representative
Group has any objection to the Closing Balance Sheet, the Shareholder
Representative Group will deliver to Parent a statement on or prior to the
last day of the Balance Sheet Review Period indicating their objection to the
Closing Balance Sheet and setting forth their objections thereto (the "
_Balance Sheet Objections Statement_ "). The audit right set forth in
**Section 2.14c** can be used by the Shareholder Representative Group to
assist it in determining the basis for any objections. The Balance Sheet

 



      
 

 



 

Objections Statement will specify in reasonable detail each of the Shareholder
Representative Groups objections to the specific items in the Closing Balance
Sheet (each such disputed item, a " _Disputed Item_ ") and contain a statement
setting forth in reasonable detail the calculation of Current Assets, Current
Liabilities, Net Working Capital, the Closing Cash, the Closing Date
Indebtedness, the unpaid Transaction Expenses immediately prior to the
Effective Time and the Shareholder Representative Groups good faith
calculation of the resulting Aggregate Merger Consideration. Parent and the
Shareholder Representative Group will promptly use their commercially
reasonable efforts to negotiate in good faith to resolve any such objections.
If Parent and the Shareholder Representative Group, in their respective sole
discretion, agree in a writing executed by both on the content of the Closing
Balance Sheet, with such adjustments and amendments thereto, if any, as to
which they both agree, then such Closing Balance Sheet, as so adjusted and/or
amended, will become final, binding and non-appealable on the Parties on the
date of such writing.

 



 

(3) If Parent and the Shareholder Representative Group fail to resolve any
such objection within Fifteen (15) Business Days following Parents receipt of
the Balance Sheet Objections Statement, then the dispute will be submitted for
resolution to the Independent Accountant who will be promptly retained to
determine the Closing Balance Sheet, which determination will be made as
promptly as possible, but in no event more than Thirty (30) days after the
Independent Accountants engagement. Parent and the Shareholder Representative
Group must submit to the Independent Accountant specific values for the
Disputed Items that they believe to be correct and all relevant supporting
documentation for the basis for such value. The Independent Accountant will
determine, based solely on the supporting documentation provided by Parent and
the Shareholder Representative Group and not by independent review, the
Disputed Items and will render a written report as to the resolution of each
Disputed Item and the resulting Final Closing Balance Sheet and Aggregate
Merger Consideration. The Independent Accountants role shall be limited to
resolving such objections and determining the correct calculations to be used
with respect to only the Disputed Items, and the Independent Accountant shall
not make any other determination as to any other item on the Closing Balance
Sheet. The Independent Accountant shall not assign a value to any item greater
than the greatest value for such item claimed by Parent or the Shareholder
Representative Group or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by
the Parent or the Shareholder Representative Group. The fees, costs

 



      
 

 



 

and expenses of the Independent Accountant will be paid by the Shareholders
(out of the Post-Closing Adjustment Escrow Fund) and Parent on a several basis
in inverse proportion as they may prevail on the Disputed Items resolved by
the Independent Accountant, utilizing the values of such items as initially
submitted by the Parties to the Independent Accountant. Such proportional
allocations will be determined by the Independent Accountant at the time that
their determination is rendered on the Disputed Items. The Closing Balance
Sheet resulting from the determination of the Independent Accountant, absent
fraud and computational errors, will become final, binding and non-appealable
on the Parties on the date such determination is rendered, and no Party will
seek further recourse to courts, other tribunals or otherwise, other than to
enforce the final determination of the Independent Accountant. Judgment may be
entered to enforce the final determination of the Independent Accountant in
any court having proper jurisdiction.

Except as set forth in the correspondingly numbered Schedule, Company
represents and warrants to Parent that the statements contained in this
**Article 3** are true and correct as of the date hereof. Inclusion of any
item on a Schedule is not indicative that such item is material to Company,
any Subsidiary or the Business and does not constitute a representation by
Company that such item is material for purposes of this Agreement. Each
exception to a representation and warranty set forth on any Schedule will
qualify the representation and warranty which is referenced on the applicable
Schedule and any other representation and warranty to which the relevance of
such exception is reasonably apparent on its face.

its incorporation or other formation. Each of Company and its Subsidiaries is
duly licensed or qualified to conduct business and is in good standing under
the Applicable Law of each jurisdiction where the properties owned or leased
by it or the operation of its business as currently conducted makes such
licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so

receipt of the Requisite Company Vote. This Agreement has been duly executed
and delivered by Company, and (assuming due authorization, execution and
delivery by Parent and Merger Sub) this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid
and binding obligation of Company enforceable against Company in accordance

binding obligation of Company enforceable against Company in accordance with
its terms except as such enforcement may be limited by the Enforceability
Limitations.

is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code (a " _Qualified
Benefit Plan_ ") has received a favorable determination letter from the
Internal Revenue Service, or with respect to a prototype plan or volume
submitter plan, can rely on an opinion letter or advisory letter from the
Internal Revenue Service to the pre-approved plan sponsor, to the effect that
such Qualified Benefit Plan is so qualified and that the plan and the trust
related thereto are exempt from federal income Taxes under Sections 401(a) and
501(a), respectively, of the Code, and, to Companys Knowledge, nothing has
occurred that could reasonably be expected to cause the revocation of such

Revenue Service. Except as would not result in any material Liability:

 



 

(1) there are no plan document failures, operational failures, demographic

that would subject Company or its Subsidiaries, either directly or indirectly
by reason of their affiliation with any other member of their Controlled
Group, to any tax, fine, lien, penalty or other Liability imposed by ERISA,
the Code or other Applicable Law;

 



 

(4) no nonexempt "prohibited transaction" (as such term is defined in Section

connection with the administration or investment of the assets of any Benefit
Plan for which Company or any Subsidiary has any Liability therefor; and

or failure to satisfy the "minimum funding standard" within the meaning of
Sections 412 and 430 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA has occurred with

Applicable Law, including Section 4980H of the Code, the Patient Protection
and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act.
With respect to any Benefit Plan, to Companys Knowledge, no event has
occurred or is reasonably expected to occur that has resulted in or would
subject Company or any Subsidiary to a Tax under Section 4971 of the Code or
the assets of Company or any Subsidiary to a lien under Section 430(k) of the
Code. Each Benefit Plan that is subject to Section 409A of the Code has been
operated and administered in compliance with and is in written form in
compliance with Section 409A of the Code and any applicable regulatory
guidance promulgated thereunder.

of Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code; or (2) is a "multi-
employer plan" (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA), and neither Company,
its Subsidiaries nor any member of their Controlled Group has at any time
sponsored or contributed to, or has or had any Liability or obligation in
respect of, any multi-employer plan. Neither Company, its Subsidiaries nor any
member of their Controlled Group has ever maintained, contributed to, been
required to contribute, or otherwise had any Liability with respect to a plan
subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 or 4971 of the
Code.

 



      
 

 



 

d. _Post-Employment Benefits_. Except as set forth on **Schedule** **3.19**

neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the Merger or
other transactions contemplated hereby will either alone, or in combination
with any other event (e.g. termination of employment): (1) result in the
payment to any employee, director or consultant of any money or other
property; (2) accelerate the vesting of or provide any additional rights or
benefits (including funding of compensation or benefits through a trust or
otherwise) to any employee, director or consultant; (3) limit or restrict the
ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or its Affiliates to merge, amend
or terminate any Benefit Plan; or (4) require any contributions or payments to
fund any obligations, or otherwise give rise to any material Liability.
Neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the Merger or
other transactions contemplated hereby will either alone, or in combination
with any other event, result in "excess parachute payments" within the meaning
of Section 280G(b) of the Code.

 



 

g. _Foreign Benefit Plans_. Set forth on **Schedule 3.19g** is each Benefit
Plan (other than any Benefit Plan required by Applicable Law) that: (1) is
maintained outside the jurisdiction of the United States; or (2) covers any
employee residing or working outside the United States (each, a " _Foreign
Benefit Plan_ "). With respect to each Foreign Benefit Plan, the fair market
value of the assets of each funded Foreign Benefit Plan, the liability of each
insurer for any Foreign Benefit Plan funded through insurance or the book
reserve established for any Foreign Benefit Plan, together with any accrued
contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide for the accrued benefit
obligations, as of the date of this Agreement, with respect to all current and
former participants in such Foreign Benefit Plan according to the actuarial
assumptions and valuations most recently used to determine employer
contributions to such Foreign Benefit Plan, and no transaction contemplated by
this Agreement shall cause such assets or insurance obligations to be less
than such benefit obligations. Each Foreign Benefit Plan which, under the
Applicable Law of any jurisdiction outside of the United States, is required
to be registered or approved by any Government Entity, has been so registered
and approved and, to Companys Knowledge, has been maintained in good standing
with applicable requirements of the Government Entities, and if intended to
qualify for special tax treatment, to Companys Knowledge, there are no
existing circumstances or events that have occurred that could reasonably be
expected to affect adversely the special tax treatment with respect to such
Foreign Benefit Plans. Company has performed in all material respects all
obligations required with respect to each Foreign Benefit Plan. Each Foreign
Benefit Plan has been maintained, operated and administered in compliance in
all material respects with its terms and with any Applicable Law. All payments
(including premiums due) and all employer and employee contributions required
to have been collected in respect of each Foreign Benefit Plan have been made
or

 



      
 

 



 

collected when due, or if applicable, accrued on the balance sheet of Company.
No Foreign Benefit Plan has been declared to be fully or partially wound up,
nor has any act or event occurred pursuant to which any Foreign Benefit Plan
could be ordered to be wound up, in whole or in part, by any Government
Entity.

such violation, breach or default, would not have a material adverse effect on

4.4 _No Prior Merger Sub Operations_. Merger Sub was formed solely for the
purpose of effecting the Merger and has not engaged in any business activities
or conducted any operations other than in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other Covered Agreements.

 



      
 

 



 

4.5 _Brokers  Fees_. No broker, finder, investment banker or any other Person
is entitled to any brokerage, finders or other fee or commission in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other
Covered Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or
Merger Sub.

 



 

4.6 _Financing_. Parent has delivered to Company true and complete copies of:
(a) the executed commitment letter (the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ "), dated
as of the date hereof, between Parent and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the "
_Lender_ "), pursuant to which the Lender has agreed, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions thereof, to lend the amounts set forth therein (the
" _Debt Financing Commitment_ ") for the purpose of financing the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other Covered Agreements and related
fees and expenses and the refinancing of certain Indebtedness of Company and
its Subsidiaries at the Effective Time (for the avoidance of doubt, including
the New Notes, the " _Debt Financing_ "). (The Debt Commitment Letter and any
related fee letter (the " _Fee Letter_ ") are referred to collectively in this
Agreement as the " _Financing Agreements_.") As of the date hereof, the
Financing Agreements are in full force and effect and constitute the legal,
valid and binding obligation of Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent, the
other parties thereto (including the Lender), enforceable against Parent and,
to the knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, including the Lender,
in accordance with their terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by
the Enforceability Limitations. Except for the Fee Letter (a complete copy of
which has been provided to Company, subject to redaction as to the amount of
fees and other economic terms of the market flex provisions in a customary
manner (none of which redacted terms or amounts adversely affect the
availability of or impose any additional conditions on the availability of the
Debt Financing at Closing or reduce the amount of the Debt Financing to less
than the amount specified in the penultimate sentence of this **Section
4.6**)) and the engagement and fee credit letters with respect to the Debt
Financing (none of which letters contain any terms that would adversely affect
the availability of or impose any additional conditions on the availability of
the Debt Financing at Closing or reduce the amount of the Debt Financing to
less than the amount specified in the penultimate sentence of this **Section
4.6**)), as of the date hereof there are no side letters or other agreements,
contracts or arrangements related to the funding or investment, as applicable,
of the Debt Financing. Parent has fully paid any and all commitment fees or
other fees in connection with the Financing Agreements that are payable on or
prior to the date hereof. The only conditions precedent or other contingencies
related to the obligations of the Lender to fund the full amount of the Debt
Financing are those expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter. As of
the date hereof, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or
Merger Sub or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto, under any
term, or a failure of any condition, of the Financing Agreements or otherwise
be reasonably likely to result in any portion of the Debt Financing
contemplated thereby to be unavailable at the Closing. As of the date hereof,
neither Parent nor Merger Sub has any reason to believe that it will be unable
to satisfy on a timely basis and, in any event, on or prior to the Closing
Date, any term or condition of the Financing Agreements required to be
satisfied by it. Based on the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
proceeds from the Debt Financing will be sufficient to provide Parent and
Merger Sub with the funds necessary to pay the Aggregate Merger Consideration
pursuant to **Section 2.12**, any repayment or refinancing of debt
contemplated in this Agreement or the Financing Agreements (including
repayment of Debt to be Discharged), the payment of all other amounts required
to be

 



      
 

 



 

paid in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the other Covered Agreements and to allow Parent and Merger
Sub to perform all of their obligations under this Agreement and the other
Covered Agreements and pay all fees and expenses to be paid by Parent or
Merger Sub related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
other Covered Agreements. No Financing Agreement has been amended, restated or
otherwise modified prior to the date hereof, and the respective commitments
contained therein have not been withdrawn, modified or rescinded in any
respect prior to the date hereof.

 



 

4.7 _Litigation_. There is no Action pending or, to Parents or Merger Subs
knowledge, threatened in writing, against or by Parent, Merger Sub, any of
their respective Affiliates or any of their respective properties or rights,
nor is there any Government Order outstanding against Parent, Merger Sub, any
of their respective Affiliates or any of their respective properties or
rights, in each case that would have a material adverse effect on Parents or
Merger Subs ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any other Covered Agreement or that challenge or seek to prevent,
enjoin or otherwise delay the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

4.8 _Solvency_. Assuming: (a) the accuracy of the representations and
warranties of Company in **Article 3** of this Agreement (including any
Schedules referenced therein) and in any written certificate delivered
pursuant hereto; (b) the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
**Sections 6.1** and **6.2** ; and (c) any estimates, projections or forecasts
of Company and its Subsidiaries that have been provided to Parent prior to the
date hereof have been prepared in good faith based upon assumptions that were,
as the time made, and continue to be, on the Closing Date, reasonable;
immediately after giving effect to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other Covered Agreements and any
indebtedness incurred by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or any
Affiliate of any of them in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby and the use of the proceeds thereof, each of Parent and
each subsidiary of the Parent, including the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries, will: (i) be solvent; (ii) be able to realize upon its assets
and pay its debts and other Liabilities as they become due; (iii) own property
that has a fair saleable value greater than the amounts required to pay its
respective debts and Liabilities (including a reasonable estimate of the
amount of all contingent Liabilities); and (iv) have adequate capital to carry
on its business. No transfer of property is being made and no obligation is
being incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future
creditors of Parent or any subsidiary of Parent, including the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries.

 



 

4.9 _Investment_. Parent is acquiring the shares of the Surviving Corporation
pursuant to the Merger for its own account, for investment only and not with a
view to any resale or public distribution thereof. Parent will not offer to
sell or otherwise dispose of any such shares in violation of any Applicable
Law relating to any such offer, sale or other disposition. Parent acknowledges
that: (a) the shares of the Surviving Corporation have not been registered
under any securities laws; (b) there is no public market for such shares and
there can be no assurance that a public market will develop; and (c) Parent
must bear the economic risk of its investment in such shares for an indefinite
period of time.

Agreement and the Covered Agreements.

such other individuals as Mr. Hore may designate in writing from time to time.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other
Covered Agreement, neither Company nor any Subsidiary will be required to

5.5 _No Plant Closing/Mass Layoffs_. For a period of not less than Twelve (12)
months following the Closing Date, Parent will not, and will cause the

Corporations Subsidiaries.

 



 

5.6 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

a. _Assumption of Indemnification Obligations_. Parent and Merger Sub each
agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation by Company or any Subsidiary now existing in favor of each Person
who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof, or who becomes
prior to the Effective Time, an officer or director of Company or any
Subsidiary, or who is an heir or legal representative of any such Person (each
a " _D andO Indemnified Party_"), as provided in the Charter Documents of
Company or any Subsidiary, in each case as in effect on the date of this
Agreement or pursuant to any other Contracts in effect on the date hereof,
will: (1) be assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without
further action at the Effective Time; and (2) survive the Merger and remain in
full force and effect in accordance with their terms, and, if any Action is
pending or asserted or any claim made during such period, until the final
disposition of such proceeding or claim.

 



 

b. _Continuation of Indemnification Rights_. For Six (6) years after the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under Applicable Law, Parent
and the Surviving Corporation (the " _D andO Indemnifying Parties_") jointly and
severally will: (1) indemnify, defend and hold harmless each DandO Indemnified
Party against all Damages arising, in whole or in part, out of any action or
omission in their capacity as such occurring at or prior to the Effective Time

 



      
 

 



 

(including in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the other Covered Agreements); and (2) reimburse each DandO Indemnified
Party for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such DandO
Indemnified Party in connection with investigating or defending any such
Damages as such expenses are incurred, subject to the Surviving Corporations
receipt of an undertaking by such DandO Indemnified Party to repay such legal
and other fees and expenses paid in advance if it is ultimately determined in
a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that
such DandO Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified under Applicable
Law; provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation will not be liable for
any settlement effected without the Surviving Corporations prior written
consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

 



 

c. _Tail Insurance_. For a period of not less than Six (6) years following the
Closing Date, Parent will, or cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain and
fully pay for "tail" insurance policies with a claims period of at least Six
(6) years from the Effective Time with at least the same coverage and amount
and containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous to the
directors and officers of Company or its Subsidiaries as Companys and its
Subsidiaries existing policies with respect to claims arising out of or
relating to events that occurred before or at the Effective Time (including in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other
Covered Agreements) (the " _D andO Tail Policy_"); provided, however, that in
connection with this **Section 5.6c**, neither the Surviving Corporation nor
Parent shall pay a premium in excess of Three Hundred Percent (300%) of the
last annual premium paid by Company or its Subsidiaries under their existing
policies (which annual premium is set forth in **Schedule 5.6c** ). It is
understood and agreed that in the event such coverage cannot be obtained for
such amount or less, then Parent shall, or cause the Surviving Corporation to,
obtain the maximum amount of coverage as may be obtained for such amount.
During the term of the DandO Tail Policy, Parent will not (and will cause the
Surviving Corporation not to) take any action following the Closing to cause
the DandO Tail Policy to be cancelled or any provision therein to be amended or
waived; provided, however _,_ that Parent or the Surviving Corporation may
substitute such DandO Tail Policy with other policies with at least the same
coverage and amount and containing terms and conditions that are not less
advantageous to any beneficiaries thereof.

 



 

d. _Survival_. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under
this **Section 5.6** will survive the consummation of the Merger and will not
be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any DandO
Indemnified Party to whom this **Section 5.6** applies without the consent of
such affected DandO Indemnified Party, it being expressly agreed that the DandO
Indemnified Parties to whom this **Section 5.6** applies will be third-party
beneficiaries of this **Section 5.6**, each of whom may enforce the
provisions of this **Section 5.6**.

 



 

e. _Successors_. If Parent, the Surviving Corporation, any Subsidiary or any
of their respective successors or assigns: (1) consolidates with or merges
into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity in such consolidation or merger; or (2) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person; then, and in either such case,

"), a copy of which is attached hereto and made a part hereof as **Exhibit
I**, will govern the disclosure of confidential or proprietary information
between or among the Parties prior to the Closing as if Company, Parent and
Merger Sub were parties thereto and will survive in accordance with its terms
and continue to bind Company, Parent and Merger Sub after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, to the extent and for so long as may be necessary
to give effect to any surviving rights, duties and obligations of Company,
Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to the Existing Confidentiality Agreement,
subject to any applicable statutes of limitation.

 



 

5.9 _Tax Matters_.

 



 

a. _Filing of Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes_.

 



 

(1) Company (prior to the Closing) or the Shareholder Representative Group
(after the Closing) will prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed
all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to Company
and any of its Subsidiaries for Pre-Closing Tax Periods. Subject to the rights
to payment from the Shareholders under **Section 5.9a(3)**, Company will pay
or cause to be paid any Taxes shown due thereon. Such Tax Returns will be
prepared in a manner consistent with past practice, except as otherwise
required by Applicable Law. The Shareholder Representative Group will furnish
to Parent a draft of each such Tax Return, for review, comment and approval
(with such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
no later than Thirty (30) days before the due date for filing such Tax Return
(including extensions thereof).

 



 

(2) Parent will prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed all Tax
Returns of or with respect to Company and any of its Subsidiaries for Straddle
Periods. Such Tax Returns will be prepared in a manner consistent with past
practice, except as otherwise required by Applicable Law and following the
allocation methodology set forth in **Section 5.9d**. Parent will furnish a
draft of each such Tax Return to the Shareholder Representative Group for
review, comment and approval (with such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) not later than

 



      
 

 



 

Thirty (30) days before the due date for filing such Tax Return (including
extensions thereof), together with a statement setting forth the amount of
Taxes for which Shareholders are responsible pursuant to **Section 5.9b**
(the " _Tax Statement_ "). Subject to the rights to payment from the
Shareholders under **Section 5.9a(3)**, Company will pay or cause to be paid
any Taxes shown due thereon.

 



 

(3) Not later than Five (5) days before the due date for the payment of Taxes
with respect to any Tax Return covered by **Sections 5.9a(1) **or **5.9a(2)**
, and notwithstanding any dispute as to the Tax Statement, the Shareholders
will pay to Parent, out of the Indemnification Escrow Fund, an amount equal to
the Taxes shown on the Tax Statement as being the responsibility of the
Shareholders under **Section 5.9b**; provided that the Shareholders will not
be required to pay any such Tax to the extent of the amount of such Tax that
was specifically taken into account as a Current Liability in determining Net
Working Capital as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. No payment
pursuant to this **Section 5.9a(3)** will excuse the Shareholders from their
indemnification obligations pursuant to **Section 5.9b** if the amount of
Taxes as ultimately determined (on audit or otherwise) for the periods covered
by such Tax Returns that are the responsibility of Shareholders exceeds the
amount of any payments by Company and its Subsidiaries or Shareholders under
this **Section 5.9a**. If, as a result of a Tax audit of: (1) Companys 2012
C-Corporation U.S. federal income Tax Return and state income, franchise or
composite Tax Return; or (2) Companys New York State franchise/income Tax
Return for calendar years 2013, 2014 or 2015 or the short year commencing
January 1, 2016 and ending on the Closing Date (each, a " _Tax Audit_ "), the
amount of Taxes ultimately determined by the applicable Government Entity as
due in respect of any such audited Tax Return shows that Company has overpaid
the amount of Taxes for which Company is responsible, upon the actual receipt
by Parent or Company of a cash Tax refund or an actual reduction in cash Taxes
(calculated on a with and without basis) payable in the Tax period that
includes the Closing Date or the Two (2) succeeding taxable years, such excess
(net of any Taxes and all costs and expenses incurred in connection therewith)
will be refunded to the Shareholder Representative Group by Parent for
distribution to the Shareholders in accordance with their respective
Participation Percentages not later than Thirty (30) days after Parent or
Company actually receives such refund or actually realizes such reduction.
Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, Shareholders shall not
be entitled to

 



      
 

 



 

recover any Tax benefit arising from any Tax Audit more than once.

 



 

b. _Tax Indemnification_. From and after the Closing, the Shareholders will
severally (in accordance with their respective Participation Percentages), and
not jointly, subject to the limitations set forth in **Section 7.4**,
indemnify, defend and hold Company and its Subsidiaries and Parent Indemnitees
harmless from and against, and pay to the applicable indemnified parties, out
of the Indemnification Escrow Fund: (1) Taxes of Company and its Subsidiaries
for: (x) any Pre-Closing Tax Period; and (y) the portion of any Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date (allocated, with respect to a Straddle
Period, as provided in **Section 5.9d**); (2) the amount of any Taxes (as a
result of Treasury Regulation 1.1502-6 or any analogous provision of
Applicable Law or otherwise) of any Person that is or has ever been affiliated
with Company or any of its Subsidiaries or with whom Company or any of its
Subsidiaries otherwise joins or has ever joined (or is or has ever been
required to join) in filing any consolidated, combined, unitary, aggregate or
similar Tax Return, prior to the Closing Date; and (3) any payments required
to be made after the Closing Date under any Tax sharing, Tax indemnity, Tax
allocation or similar contracts (whether or not written) to which Company or
any of its Subsidiaries was obligated, or was a party, on or prior to the
Closing Date; provided, however, that in each case, the Shareholders will not
have any such obligation to the extent such Taxes were specifically taken into
account as a Current Liability in determining Net Working Capital as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Shareholders duty to indemnify,
defend and hold Company and Parent Indemnitees harmless as set forth above in
this **Section 5.9b** will survive the Closing until Sixty (60) days after
the date of the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (as
extended under Applicable Law) for assessment of the relevant Tax, but in no
event for a period of more than Five (5) years from the Closing Date; provided
that any claim for which notice has been given pursuant to **Section 5.9c**
prior to such date shall survive until such claim has been finally resolved.

 



 

c. _Tax Contests_.

 



 

(1) If a written notice of deficiency, audit, examination claim, litigation or
other administrative or court proceeding, suit or dispute with respect to
Taxes of Company is received by Parent, Company or any Subsidiary for which
Shareholders may be liable pursuant to **Section 5.9b **(a " _Tax Claim_ "),
Parent will give the Shareholder Representative Group prompt written notice of
such Tax Claim. The failure to give such prompt written notice will not
release, waive or otherwise affect the Shareholders obligations with respect
thereto except to the extent that the Shareholders are actually prejudiced as
a result of such failure.

 



 

(2) The Shareholders will have the right, at their expense, to represent the
interests of Company in any Tax Claim for any Pre-Closing Tax Period; provided
that: (a) the Shareholder Representative Group will keep Parent reasonably
informed and consult in good faith with Parent before taking any action with
respect to the

 



      
 

 



 

conduct of such Tax Claim; (b) the Shareholder Representative Group will
provide Parent with copies of all correspondence, notices and other written
material received from any Government Entity with respect to such Tax Claim
and will otherwise keep Parent apprised of substantive developments with
respect to such Tax Claim; (c) the Shareholder Representative Group will
provide Parent with a copy of, and an opportunity to review and comment on,
all submissions made to a Government Entity in connection with such Tax Claim
(provided that in no event shall Parents review and comment cause any
submission to be delayed or untimely); and (d) the Shareholder Representative
Group will not agree to a settlement or compromise thereof without the prior
written consent of Parent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding the above, Parent, and counsel of its
own choosing, shall have the right, at Parents sole cost and expense, to
participate fully in all aspects of the prosecution or defense of any such Tax
Claim if Parent reasonably determines that such Tax Claim could adversely
affect Parent, Company or their respective Affiliates in a material manner for
any taxable period, or portion thereof, beginning after the Closing Date.

 



 

(3) Parent will have the right to represent the interests of Company in any
Tax Claim for any Straddle Period; provided that: (a) Parent will keep the
Shareholder Representative Group reasonably informed and consult in good faith
with the Shareholder Representative Group before taking any action with
respect to the conduct of such Tax Claim; (b) Parent will provide the
Shareholder Representative Group with copies of all correspondence, notices
and other written material received from any Government Entity with respect to
such Tax Claim and will otherwise keep the Shareholder Representative Group
apprised of substantive developments with respect to such Tax Claim; (c)
Parent will provide the Shareholder Representative Group with a copy of, and
an opportunity to review and comment on, all submissions made to a Government
Entity in connection with such Tax Claim (provided that in no event shall
Shareholder Representative Groups review and comment cause any submission to
be delayed or untimely); and (d) neither Parent nor Company will agree to a
settlement or compromise thereof without the prior written consent of the
Shareholder Representative Group, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. The expense of representing the interests of
Company in any such Tax Claim shall be borne by Parent and the Shareholders in
the same proportion as the Tax Liability as determined in **Section 5.9d
**below. Notwithstanding the above, Shareholders, and counsel of their own

 



      
 

 



 

choosing, shall have the right, at Shareholders sole cost and expense, to
participate fully in all aspects of the prosecution or defense of any such Tax
Claim if Shareholders reasonably determine that such Tax Claim could adversely
affect the Shareholders in a material manner for any Straddle Period, or
portion thereof.

 



 

(4) Parent and Company will execute and deliver to the Shareholder
Representative Group or a Person designated by the Shareholder Representative
Group such powers of attorney as may be necessary to give effect to this
**Section 5.9c**.

 



 

d. _Straddle Period Tax Allocation_. For purposes of this Agreement, Taxes of
Company and its Subsidiaries that are for any Straddle Period will: (1) in the
case of any Taxes other than Taxes based on or measured by income, receipts or
profits earned during a Straddle Period, be deemed to be the amount of such
Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of
which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date
and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire taxable
period; and (2) in the case of Taxes based on or measured by income, receipts
or profits earned during a Straddle Period, be deemed equal to the amount that
would be payable if the relevant taxable period ended on and included the
Closing Date.

 



 

e. _Assistance and Cooperation_. After the Closing Date, the Shareholder
Representative Group, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, will
(and will cause their respective Affiliates to): (1) reasonably assist the
other Party or Parties, as the case may be, in preparing any Tax Returns that
such other Party or Parties, as the case may be, are responsible for preparing
and filing in accordance with **Section 5.9a**; (2) reasonably cooperate in
responding to any inquiries from or preparing for any audits of, or any
disputes with a Government Entity regarding, any Taxes or Tax Returns of
Company and its Subsidiaries; and (3) make available to the other Party or
Parties, as the case may be, as reasonably requested, all information, records
and documents in its possession relating to Company and its Subsidiaries that
may be relevant to any Tax Return, audit or examination, proceeding or
determination of Company and its Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period
or Straddle Period and to any Government Entity, as reasonably requested by
the Shareholder Representative Group or Parent, all information, records, and
documents relating to Taxes of Company and its Subsidiaries for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period.

 



 

f. _Disputes_. Any dispute between or among the Parties as to any matter
covered by this **Section 5.9** will be resolved as follows:

 



 

(1) Parent and Shareholder Representative Group will in good faith attempt to
negotiate a prompt resolution of such dispute;

 



 

(2) if Parent and the Shareholder Representative Group are unable to negotiate
a resolution of such dispute within Thirty (30) days, the dispute will be
submitted to the Independent Accountant;

 



       
 

 



 

(3) the Independent Accountant will: (a) resolve the dispute in a fair and
equitable manner, based solely on presentations by Parent and the Shareholder
Representative Group and not by independent review, and in accordance with
Applicable Law and the provisions of this Agreement; and (b) render a written
report as to the resolution of the dispute within Thirty (30) days after the
Parties have submitted the dispute to the Independent Accountant. The decision
of the Independent Accountant will be final, binding and non-appealable on the
Parties, absent fraud or computational errors, and no Party will seek further
recourse to courts, other tribunals or otherwise, other than to enforce the
final determination of the Independent Accountant. Judgment may be entered to
enforce the final determination of the Independent Accountant in any court
having proper jurisdiction;

 



 

(4) any payment to be made as a result of the resolution of such dispute will
be made, and any other action taken as a result of the resolution of such
dispute will be taken, on or before the Fifth (5th) day following the date on
which the dispute is resolved (except that if the resolution requires the
filing of an amended Tax Return, such amended Tax Return will be filed within
Thirty (30) days following the date on which the dispute is resolved); and

 



 

(5) the fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant will be paid Fifty
Percent (50%) by Parent and Fifty Percent (50%) by the Shareholders (from the
Indemnification Escrow Fund).

 



 

g. _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. Any indemnity payment made pursuant
to **Section 5.9b** or **Article 7** will be treated as an adjustment to the
Aggregate Merger Consideration for all federal, state, local and foreign
income Tax purposes, to the extent permissible under Applicable Law.

 



 

h. _Tax Benefits Associated with Transaction Expenses_. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that: (1) any Tax deductions arising from amounts
actually paid by Company on or prior to the Closing Date associated with: (a)
the Transaction Expenses; and (b) any bonuses or other compensatory payments
made as a result of the Merger or other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the other Covered Agreements will be: (i) for the sole benefit
of Company (and the Shareholders in their capacity as equity holders of
Company); and (ii) allocated to (and deemed to have been incurred in) the
applicable Pre-Closing Tax Periods ending on the day before the Closing Date
or portions of the applicable Straddle Periods ending on the Closing Date, in
each case to the extent permitted by Applicable Law; and (2) to the extent
such Tax deductions are included on Companys Tax Return for the applicable
Pre-Closing Tax Periods ending on the day before the Closing Date or portions
of the applicable Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date, the
Shareholders, as shareholders of Company as an S corporation for U.S. federal
and state income tax purposes during such Pre-Closing Tax Periods or portions
of Straddle Periods, will be entitled to such Tax deductions to

 



      
 

 



 

the extent such Tax deductions "flows-through" to Shareholders for U.S.
federal, state and local income Tax purposes and are permitted by Applicable
Law, to be allocated among the Shareholders in accordance with their
respective Participation Percentages. Further, if all or any portion of the
Transaction Expenses or bonus or other compensatory payments referred in
**Sections 5.9h(1)(a) **and **(b)** are required to be capitalized or
accrued on the books of Company and Parent or Company actually realizes a Tax
benefit (calculated on a with and without basis) attributable to the
amortization, depreciation or deduction of such amounts in the Tax period that
includes the Closing Date or the Two (2) succeeding taxable years, then Parent
or Company will pay to the Shareholders the amount of such Tax benefit no
later than Thirty (30) days after Parent or Company actually realizes such Tax
benefit.

 



 

i. _Amended Tax Returns_.

 



 

(1) The Shareholder Representative Group shall have the right to prepare or
cause to be prepared, at its sole cost and expense, pursuant to the procedures
set forth in **Section 5.9a(1)**, any amended Tax Return of Company or claim
for refund of Taxes on behalf of Company, in each case for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period, provided that the Shareholder Representative Group will not, without
the prior written consent of Parent (which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), make or cause to be made, any such filing.

 



 

(2) Any amended Tax Return of Company or claim for Tax refund on behalf of
Company for the benefit of Parent and/or the Shareholders in each case for any
Straddle Period will be prepared, or caused to be prepared, pursuant to the
procedures set forth in **Section 5.9a(2)** only by Parent. Parent will not,
without the prior written consent of the Shareholder Representative Group
(which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
make or cause to be made, any such filing, to the extent such filing could
increase the Tax Liability of the Shareholders for any Pre-Closing Tax Period
or portion of a Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date. Parent will
reasonably cooperate with the Shareholder Representative Group to file any
claim for a Tax refund of Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle
Period.

 



 

(3) Other than as required by Applicable Law or in the Ordinary Course of
Business, Parent will not, and will cause Company not to, make any Tax
election in a taxable period beginning after the Closing Date or portion of a
Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date that has retroactive effect
to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or portion of a Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date without the prior written consent of the Shareholder
Representative Group (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), to the extent such Tax election could

 



      
 

 



 

increase the Tax Liability of the Shareholders for Pre-Closing Tax Period or
portion of a Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date.

 



 

j. _Certain Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration
and other similar Taxes (including any penalties and interest) incurred in
connection with this Agreement will be paid by Parent when due, and Parent or
Company will, at their own respective expense, file all necessary Tax Returns
and other documentation with respect to all such transfer, documentary, sales,
use, stamp, registration and other similar Taxes, and, if required by
Applicable Law, the Shareholders will join in the execution of any such Tax
Returns and other documentation.

 



 

k. _Additional Tax Covenants_.

 



 

(1) Parent covenants that without obtaining the prior written consent of the
Shareholder Representative Group, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, it will not, and will not cause or permit
Company, Subsidiary or any Affiliate of Parent, Company or any Subsidiary, to:
(a) take any action on or after the Closing Date other than as required by
Applicable Law or in the Ordinary Course of Business that could give rise to
any Tax Liability of the Shareholders or any indemnification obligation of the
Shareholders under **Section 5.9b**; or (b) other than as required by
Applicable Law, make or change any material Tax election for any Pre-Closing
Tax Period or Straddle Period or amend any Tax Return for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period or Straddle Period, in each case if such action could have the effect
of increasing the Tax Liability of the Shareholders with respect to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period or portion of a Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date.

 



 

(2) After the Closing Date, Parent and Company will not, without obtaining the
prior written consent of the Shareholder Representative Group, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, agree to the
waiver or any extension of the statute of limitations relating to any Taxes of
Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or any Straddle Period other than in
the Ordinary Course of Business.

 



 

(3) The Shareholders will have the right to: (a) any refunds of Taxes for any
Pre-Closing Tax Period or portion of a Straddle Period ending on the Closing
Date; or (b) any credits actually realized against Taxes in lieu of refunds
described in clause (a), except, in each case, to the extent any such amount
was taken into account as a Current Asset in determining Net Working Capital
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time or to the extent any such amount
is attributable to the carryback of a Tax attribute (including net operating
losses, net capital losses, or tax credits) arising in a

 



      
 

 



 

taxable period beginning after the Closing Date or portion of a Straddle
Period beginning after the Closing Date. Parent will pay (or cause to be paid)
such amounts net of: (i) any Taxes of Parent, Company or any of its
Subsidiaries attributable to such Tax refund; and (ii) any reasonable costs
and expenses incurred by Parent, Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
obtaining such Tax refund, to the Shareholders no later than Thirty (30) days
after the receipt or realization by Company of such Tax refunds or credits.

 



 

(4) No Party will make an election pursuant to Section 336, 338(g) or
338(h)(10) of the Code for Company or any Subsidiary with respect to the
transactions that are the subject of this Agreement.

 



 

l. _Post-Closing Tax Benefits_. If: (1) pursuant to **Section 5.9b**,
Shareholders pay an incremental Tax for a Pre-Closing Tax Period as a result
of an adjustment by a Government Entity of a Tax Return of Company for such
Pre-Closing Tax Period; and (2) as a result of such adjustment, Parent or
Company actually realizes a Tax benefit (including a refund, credit or
reduction in Tax) (calculated on a with and without basis) arising from the
payment of such incremental Tax in the Tax period that includes the Closing
Date or the Two (2) succeeding taxable years; then Parent or Company will pay
the amount of such Tax benefit, net of all costs, Taxes and expenses incurred
or imposed on Parent or Company in connection therewith, to the Shareholder
Representative Group for the benefit of the Shareholders within Thirty (30)
days after actually realizing such Tax benefit.

 



 

5.10 _Books and Records_. In order to facilitate the resolution of any claims
made against or incurred by the Shareholders prior to the Closing or for any
other reasonable purpose, for a period of Seven (7) years after the Closing,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to:

 



 

a. retain the books and records (including personnel files) of Company and the
Subsidiaries relating to periods prior to the Closing in a manner reasonably
consistent with the prior practices of Company and the Subsidiaries; and

 



 

b. upon reasonable notice and at the requesting Shareholders sole expense,
afford such Shareholder reasonable access (including the right to make, at the
expense of such Shareholders, photocopies), during normal business hours, to
such books and records of Company and its Subsidiaries relating to the period
prior to the Closing, subject to such Shareholder executing a customary
confidentiality agreement.

 



 

5.11 _Employee Benefits_.

 



 

a. For a period of not less than One (1) year following the Effective Time,
Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to continue to provide employees
of Company or any Subsidiary who are in the employment of Company or any
Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time: (1) an annual base salary
or hourly wage rate at least equal to the amount that was being paid to each
such employee as of the day immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (2)
welfare and retirement benefits (excluding equity-based compensation, defined
benefit plan

 



      
 

 



 

benefits and retiree medical benefits) that are in the aggregate, no less
favorable than the welfare and retirement benefits (excluding equity-based
compensation, defined benefit plan benefits and retiree medical benefits) in
effect for employees of Company and its Subsidiaries as of the day immediately
prior to the Effective Time. With respect to Benefit Plans providing benefits
to employees of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries following the
Effective Time, Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts required so
that: (i) such employees will receive service credit for their employment with
Company and its Subsidiaries for all purposes, other than benefit accruals
under a defined benefit pension plan, to the same extent as such employee was
entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any
similar Benefit Plan in which such employee participated or was eligible to
participate immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided that the
foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application would result in a
duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service; and (ii)
such plans waive any applicable waiting periods, pre-existing conditions or
actively-at-work requirements and will give such employees credit under the
new coverages or benefit plans for deductibles, co-insurance and out-of-pocket
payments that have been paid during the plan year in which such coverage or
plan modification occurs, except to the extent the consent of a third party,
such as an insurer, is required and such consent cannot be obtained through
reasonable efforts. From and after the Closing Date, Parent will, and will
cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor and pay all compensation or other
payments of any kind under (without modification, unless such modification is
mutually agreed to in writing by the parties thereto) each agreement listed on
**Schedule 5.11a** , and the Shareholders will have no Liability to Parent or
the Surviving Corporation for any such payments. No individual who is a
Shareholder immediately prior to the Closing Date shall have a right to
payments or benefits from any Benefit Plan on and after the Closing Date
unless the individual is otherwise eligible to participate in any such Benefit
Plan as an eligible employee or dependent of an eligible employee, as
determined in accordance with the terms of such Benefit Plan.

 



 

b. The provisions of this **Section 5.11** are solely for the benefit of the
Parties, and no employee of Company, Parent or any of their respective
Affiliates (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) shall be regarded
for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement, and no
provision of this **Section 5.11** shall create such rights in any such
Persons. Subject to any requirement of Applicable Law, except as otherwise
provided in this **Section 5.11**, nothing herein shall: (1) guarantee
employment for any period of time or preclude the ability of Parent, Company
or their respective Affiliates to terminate the employment of any employee at
any time and for any reason; (2) require Company, Parent or any of their
respective Affiliates to continue any Benefit Plans, or other employee benefit
plans or arrangements or prevent the amendment, modification or termination
thereof after the Closing; or (3) amend any Benefit Plan or other employee
benefit plans or arrangements.

 



 

5.12 _Closing Conditions_. From the date hereof until the Closing, each Party
will use commercially reasonable efforts to take such actions as are
necessary, proper or advisable in order to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated hereby (including satisfaction, but not waiver, of
the closing conditions set forth in **Article 6** and receipt of all required
third party consents).

 



 

5.13 _Public Announcements_. No Party will make any public announcement in
respect of this Agreement or any other Covered Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby or

 



      
 

 



 

thereby or otherwise communicate with any news media without the prior written
consent of each other Party (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), and the Parties will cooperate as to the timing and
contents of any such announcement; provided, however, for the avoidance of
doubt, the Parties will not be precluded from communicating with their
directors, officers, shareholders, employees and other Representatives, who
have a need to know the information and who agree to keep such information
confidential, with respect to this Agreement, any other Covered Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby; and provided, further, the
foregoing shall not prevent any of the Parties from disclosing such
information, based upon advice of counsel to such Party, to the extent such
disclosure is required by Applicable Law, by rules and regulations of any
stock exchange on which such Partys securities are listed, by Government
Order or by subpoena, summons or legal process.

 



 

5.14 _Non-Recourse_. Except as provided in **Section 5.9b** and **Article 7
**in the case of the Shareholders, this Agreement may be enforced only
against, and any Action based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the
transactions contemplated hereby, may be commenced, only against the Persons
that are expressly identified as Parties to this Agreement in their capacities
as such and no past, present or future director, officer, employee, member,
partner, shareholder or other owner (whether direct or indirect), Affiliate or
Representative of any Party shall have any Liability for any obligations or
Liabilities of the Parties under this Agreement or any other agreements or
transactions contemplated hereby or for any Action based on, in respect of, or
by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. Any
certificate or certification contemplated by this Agreement and executed by an
officer of a Party will be deemed to have been delivered only in such
officers capacity as an officer of such Party (and not in his or her
individual capacity) and will not entitle any Party to assert a claim against
such officer in his or her individual capacity.

 



 

5.15 _Exclusivity_. From the date hereof through the Closing Date, Company
will not, and will direct each of its Affiliates, directors, officers,
Shareholders, employees and Representatives not to, directly or indirectly,
encourage, solicit, initiate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, or
provide any non-public information to, any Person (other than Parent, Merger
Sub or their respective Affiliates and Representatives) concerning any merger,
sale of substantial assets, sale of Shares, equity interests or similar
transactions involving Company or any of its Subsidiaries or enter into any
agreement with respect thereto.

 



 

5.16 _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, each Party will,
as and when reasonably requested, execute and deliver any deeds, bills of
sale, assignments or assurances or other documents or instruments and take and
do any other actions and things as any other Party may reasonably deem
necessary or desirable to carry out the intent and purpose of this Agreement.

 



 

5.17 _Related Party Transaction_. Except for those Related Party Transactions
set forth on **Schedule 5.17** , Company and its Subsidiaries shall take, or
cause to be taken, all actions necessary to terminate with respect to Company
or any Subsidiary, prior to the Closing, any Related Party Transactions,
including those identified on **Schedule 3.21,** without any payment by
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates or resulting obligations or
Liabilities of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates. Company and its
Subsidiaries shall take all actions

 



      
 

 



 

necessary to cause all Persons (other than Company and its Subsidiaries) to
cease being participating employers under all Benefit Plans, effective no
later than the Closing Date. Company shall provide reasonable evidence of such
termination, and neither Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor the Surviving
Corporations Subsidiaries shall have any Liability after the Closing with
respect to any Related Party Transactions, except for those Related Party
Transactions set forth on **Schedule 5.17**.

 



 

5.18 _Financing_.

 



 

a. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, or cause to be
obtained, the proceeds of the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions
described in the Debt Commitment Letter, including using its reasonable best
efforts to: (1) maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letter; (2) negotiate
and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing (the "
_Definitive Agreements_ ") consistent with the terms and conditions contained
therein or on other terms that are no less favorable to Parent than those
contained in the Financing Agreements; and (3) taking into account the
expected timing of the Marketing Period, satisfy on a timely basis all
conditions applicable to Parent to obtaining the Debt Financing that are
within Parents control. In the event that all conditions contained in the
Debt Commitment Letter have been satisfied (or upon funding will be
satisfied), Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to timely cause the
Lender to fund the Debt Financing at the Closing.

 



 

b. Parent shall not, without the prior written consent of Company: (1)
terminate the Debt Commitment Letter, unless the Debt Commitment Letter is
replaced in a manner consistent with the following clause (2); or (2) permit
any amendment or modification to, or any waiver of, any provision or remedy
under, or replace, the Debt Commitment Letter if such amendment, modification,
waiver or replacement: (x) would (1) add any new condition to the Debt
Financing Commitment (or modify any existing condition in a manner adverse to
Parent) or otherwise that would be reasonably expected to materially and
adversely affect (including with respect to timing, taking into account the
expected timing of the Marketing Period)) the ability of Parent to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Covered
Agreements; or (2) taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing
Period, be reasonably expected to make the timely funding of the Debt
Financing or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing
materially less likely to occur; (y) reduces the aggregate amount of the Debt
Financing to an amount such that the transactions contemplated hereby or by
the other Covered Agreements could not be consummated; or (z) taking into
account the expected timing of the Marketing Period, would reasonably be
expected to prevent, impede or materially delay the consummation of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other
Covered Agreements; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, it is hereby
understood and agreed that Parent may amend the Debt Commitment Letter to add
lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities
who had not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof and
provide such lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or
similar entities with consent rights with respect to existing conditions to
the consummation of the Debt Financing to the extent that the commitments in
the aggregate of the lenders to provide the Debt Financing are not reduced as
a result of any such amendment. Parent shall promptly deliver to Company
copies of any amendment, modification, waiver or replacement of any Debt
Financing

 



      
 

 



 

Commitment or of any fee or other letter or agreement relating thereto. Upon
any such amendment, supplement, modification or replacement of the Debt
Financing Commitment in accordance with this **Section 5.18b**, the term
"Debt Financing Commitment" shall mean the Debt Financing Commitment so
amended, supplemented, modified or replaced.

 



 

c. In the event that any portion of the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing
becomes unavailable, regardless of the reason therefor, Parent shall: (1)
promptly notify Company in writing of such unavailability and, to the
knowledge of the Parent, the reason therefor; and (2) use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain, at its sole expense, as promptly as practicable following
the occurrence of such event and in any event no later than the last day of
the Marketing Period, alternative financing (in an amount sufficient to enable
the transactions contemplated hereby and by the other Covered Agreements to be
consummated) from the same or other sources and on terms and conditions no
less favorable in any respect to Parent (including with respect to the matters
described in clauses (x), (y) and (z) of **Section 5.18b**) than such
unavailable Debt Financing. For the purposes of this Agreement, the terms
"Debt Commitment Letter", "Debt Financing Commitment" and "Fee Letter" shall
be deemed to include any commitment letter (or similar agreement) or
commitment or any fee letter referred to in such commitment letter with
respect to any alternative financing arranged in compliance with this
**Section 5.18c** (and any Debt Commitment Letter, Debt Financing Commitment
and Fee Letter remaining in effect at the time in question).

 



 

d. Parent shall provide Company with prompt oral and written notice: (1) of:
(x) any breach or default by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter or the
Definitive Agreements of which Parent has knowledge or any termination of the
Debt Commitment Letter; or (y) any material dispute or disagreement between
Parent, on the one hand, and the Lender, on the other hand, with respect to
the obligation to fund the Debt Financing or the amount of the Debt Financing
to be funded at Closing; and (2) if at any time for any reason Parent believes
in good faith that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the
aggregate amount of the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions, in the
manner or from the sources contemplated by any of the Debt Commitment Letter
or the Definitive Agreements; provided, however, that in no event will Parent
be under any obligation to disclose any information pursuant to clauses (x) or
(y) that is, based on advice of counsel, subject to attorney-client or similar
privilege if Parent shall have used its reasonable best efforts to disclose
such information in a way that would not waive such privilege. Parent shall
keep Company reasonably informed on a current basis (and in any event at
Companys reasonable request) of the status of its efforts to consummate the
Debt Financing.

 



 

e. Prior to the Closing, Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to, and to cause each of its Subsidiaries and Representatives to, use
commercially reasonable efforts, to provide such necessary and customary
cooperation as may be reasonably requested by Parent in connection with:

 



 

(1) causing the conditions applicable to Company in the Debt Commitment Letter
that are within Companys control to be satisfied; and

 



       
 

 



 

(2) arranging, obtaining and syndicating the Debt Financing and consummating
the offerings of the New Notes;

 



 

in each case to the extent such cooperation involves, as applicable, actions
and information relating to Company, its Subsidiaries and the Business that
are capable of being undertaken or provided using commercially reasonable
efforts, and which efforts include:

 



 

(A) using commercially reasonable efforts to make available, at reasonable
times during reasonable business hours, the management of Company for: (I)
participation in calls with Financing Sources; and (II) review of customary
and necessary offering memoranda and confidential information memoranda
relating to the Debt Financing; and

 



 

(B) using commercially reasonable efforts to make available to Parent and
Parents auditor, KPMG (subject to KPMGs execution of customary
confidentiality agreements), at reasonable times during reasonable business
hours, the management and staff of Company who participated in the audit of
the Financial Statements and any workpapers relating to the audit of the
Financial Statements that Parent or KPMG may reasonably request, solely for
the purposes of Parents re-audit of the Financial Statements.

 



 

f. Prior to the Closing, Company shall, in connection with the arranging,
obtaining and syndicating of the Debt Financing and consummating the offerings
of the "Senior Notes" as contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter
(collectively, the " _New Notes_ "), furnish Parent:

 



 

(1) with a consolidated balance sheet, statement of income and statement of
cash flows as of and for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2016, reviewed by
KPMG, within Forty-Five (45) days of such quarter end;

 



 

(2) with a consolidated balance sheet, statement of income and statement of
cash flows as of and for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2016, reviewed by
KPMG, within Forty-Five (45) days of such quarter end, to the extent that the
Closing has not occurred prior to such date; and

 



 

(3) a consolidated balance sheet, statement of income and statement of cash
flows as of and for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2015 and June 30,
2015, reviewed by KPMG;

 



 

(in the case of each of (1), (2) and (3), using the same format and scope as
is presently used by Company and disclosed to Parent prior to the date hereof)
(all such information described in the foregoing (1), (2) and (3), together
with the Financial Statements described in **Section 3.7a**

 



      
 

 



 

(which have already been made available to Parent) as re-audited by KPMG,
collectively the " _Required Information_ "); provided, however, that, for the
avoidance of doubt:

 



 

(A) The items described in (1) and (2) above shall not be deemed "Required
Information" prior to the date that is Forty-Five (45) days after the related
quarter end;

 



 

(B) Company shall not be required to incur any Liability (other than the
payment of reasonable out-of-pocket costs, subject in all cases to
reimbursement by Parent) in connection with the Debt Financing or the New
Notes offering prior to the Effective Time;

 



 

(C) Prior to the Effective Time, none of Company or its Subsidiaries or
Representatives shall be required to enter into any agreement or deliver any
certificate, document or other instrument, in connection with the Debt
Financing or the New Notes offering;

 



 

(D) No obligation of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives under any certificate, document or instrument
executed in connection with the Debt Financing, if any, shall be effective
until the Effective Time; and

 



 

(E) None of Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives shall be required to: (x) pay any commitment or other similar
fee or incur any other cost or expense that is not reimbursed by Parent
promptly after written request by Company or incur any other Liability, in
each case in connection with the Debt Financing prior to the Closing; or (y)
take any action that would unreasonably interfere with the Business of Company
and its Subsidiaries or conflict with or violate Companys organizational
documents, Contracts or any Applicable Law.

 



 

Nothing contained in this **Section 5.18f** or otherwise shall require
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to be an obligor with respect to the Debt
Financing that is prior to the Effective Time or not conditioned on the
Closing. Parent shall, promptly upon request by Company, reimburse Company for
all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by Company or its Subsidiaries or
their respective Representatives in connection with such cooperation and shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless Company and its Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives for and against any and all Damages actually
suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt
Financing, any action taken by them at the request of Parent pursuant to this
**Section 5.18f** and any information utilized in connection therewith (other
than information provided in writing by Company or its Subsidiaries
specifically for use in connection therewith). Parent acknowledges and agrees
that the obtaining of the Debt Financing, or any alternative financing, is not
a condition to its obligations to effect the Merger or to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

g. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
nothing contained in this **Section 5.18** shall require, and in no event
shall the reasonable best efforts of Parent be deemed or construed to require
Parent to (1) pay any fees to the Lender in excess of those contemplated in
the Debt Commitment Letter and related Fee Letters as of the date hereof,
whether to secure waiver of any conditions contained therein or otherwise or
(2) amend or waive any of the terms or conditions hereof or under the Debt
Financing Commitment.

 



      
 

 



 

5.19 _Endowed Chair_. After the Closing, Parent shall, or cause its
subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to establish an endowed chair,
funded with an aggregate of $1,000,000, and established in the name of James
F. Lally at a college or university mutually agreed by James F. Lally and
Parent and for an academic focus of his selection. Parent will offer James F.
Lally the opportunity to lead the interaction with the educational institution
regarding such program.

 



 

5.20 _General Employee Bonus Amount_. Parent acknowledges that Company has
accrued a liability on its books in an amount equal to the General Employee
Bonus Amount for the purpose of paying a discretionary bonus to certain
employees of Company and its Subsidiaries within Two and One-Half (2 ½) months
of Closing. At Closing, the Shareholder Representative Group shall provide to
Company a list of those employees of Company and its Subsidiaries who shall
receive such bonus if employed by Company or any Subsidiary at the time such
bonus is paid by Company, and the amount of such bonus that each such employee
is to receive, and Parent shall cause Company to pay such amounts pursuant to
this **Section 5.20** as soon as practicable following such date as is
designated by the Shareholder Representative Group, but no later than Two and
One-Half (2 ½) months after Closing. If any such employee is not employed by
Company or any Subsidiary at the time such bonus is paid by Company, such
employee shall not be entitled to such bonus and the amount of such bonus
shall be allocated to the remaining employees so identified on a pro rata
basis. The aggregate amount of such bonuses (including all Taxes and other
deductions and withholdings therefrom, as required under Applicable Law) shall
not exceed the General Employee Bonus Amount. Such bonus shall be paid to the
employees so identified to receive them through Companys payroll processing
company.

 ** _ARTICLE 7 
INDEMNIFICATION_**

 



 

7.1 _By Shareholders_. In addition to any indemnification provided pursuant to
**Section 5.9b**, and subject to **Section 7.4**, the Shareholders,
severally (in accordance with their respective Participation Percentages) and
not jointly, will indemnify, defend and hold harmless Parent and Parents
successors, assigns, Affiliates (which following the Closing shall include the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) and Representatives (collectively,
the " _Parent_

 



      
 

 



 

 _Indemnitees_ ") with respect to any and all Damages incurred or suffered by
the Parent Indemnitees that result from or arise out of:

 



 

a. any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of Company
contained in this Agreement and in any written certificate delivered pursuant
hereto (any qualification as to "material", "materiality" or "Material Adverse
Effect", "Companys Knowledge" or similar qualification contained in such
representations and warranties shall not be taken into account for purposes of
determining whether any inaccuracy or breach occurred or for purposes of
determining the amount of Damages incurred), either as of the date hereof or
as of the Closing Date as though made on and as of such date (except for those
representations and warranties that are made as of a certain date);

 



 

b. any breach or non-fulfillment of **Section 5.17** or any post-Closing
covenant, agreement or obligation to be performed by the Shareholders pursuant
to this Agreement (other than indemnification pursuant to **Section 5.9b**);
or

 



 

c. any STI Claim.

 



 

7.2 _By Parent_. Subject to **Section 7.4**, Parent will indemnify, defend
and hold harmless each Shareholder and his/her/its respective heirs, legal
representatives, successors, assigns, Affiliates and Representatives
(collectively, the " _Shareholder Indemnitees_ ") with respect to any and all
Damages incurred or suffered by the Shareholder Indemnitees that result from
or arise out of:

 



 

a. any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of Parent or
Merger Sub contained in this Agreement and any written certificate delivered
pursuant hereto (any qualification as to "material", "materiality" or
"material adverse effect", knowledge or similar qualification contained in
such representations and warranties shall not be taken into account for
purposes of determining whether any inaccuracy or breach occurred or for
purposes of determining the amount of Damages incurred), either as of the date
hereof or as of the Closing Date as though made on and as of such date (except
for those representations and warranties that are made as of a certain date);

 



 

b. any breach or non-fulfillment of any post-Closing covenant, agreement or
obligation to be performed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation pursuant to
this Agreement; or

 



 

c. any post-Closing operations of the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary.

 



 

7.3 _Indemnification Procedures_. A Party complying with its obligations
pursuant to **Sections 7.1** or **7.2** , as the case may be, will be an "
_Indemnifying Party_ ", and each Shareholder Indemnitee or Parent Indemnitee
benefitting therefrom will be an " _Indemnified Party_ ". The obligations of
the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party will be subject to the following
terms and conditions:

 



       
 

 



 

a. _Third-Party Claims_. If any Indemnified Party receives notice of the
assertion or commencement of any action, suit, claim or other legal proceeding
made or brought by any Person who is not a Party or an Affiliate of a Party or
a Representative of the foregoing against such Indemnified Party with respect
to which the Indemnifying Party may be obligated to provide indemnification
under this Agreement (a " _Third-Party Claim_ "), the Indemnified Party will
give the Indemnifying Party written notice thereof (an " _Indemnification
Notice_ ") promptly and in any event within Twenty (20) Business Days after
receipt by such Indemnified Party of notice of such Third-Party Claim. The
failure to timely give an Indemnification Notice will relieve the Indemnifying
Party of its indemnification obligations only to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced thereby. The Indemnification Notice
will describe the Third-Party Claim in reasonable detail, will include copies
of all material written evidence thereof and will indicate the estimated
amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Damages that have been or may be
sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party will have the right
to participate in or, by giving written notice to the Indemnified Party, to
assume the defense of any Third-Party Claim by the Indemnifying Partys own
counsel, and the Indemnified Party will cooperate in good faith in such
defense. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third-Party
Claim, subject to **Section 7.4**, it will: (1) promptly and diligently
conduct such defense with legal counsel reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnified Parties; and (2) have the right to take such action as it deems
necessary to avoid, dispute, defend, appeal or make counterclaims pertaining
to any such Third-Party Claim in the name and on behalf of the Indemnified
Party. Should the Indemnifying Party so elect to assume the defense of a
Third-Party Claim, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Indemnifying
Party will not be liable to the Indemnified Party for legal fees and expenses
subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense
thereof and further, all legal fees and expenses incurred by the Indemnifying
Party will be credited against and counted for purposes of computing the
remaining amount available under the Cap for the purposes of **Sections 5.9b**
and **7.1**. The Indemnified Party will have the right, at its own cost and
expense, to participate in the defense of any Third-Party Claim with counsel
selected by it, subject to the Indemnifying Partys right to control the
defense thereof; provided that the Indemnified Party will have the right, at
the Indemnifying Partys cost and expense, to participate in the defense of
any Third-Party Claim with counsel selected by the Indemnified Party and
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party if: (x) on the advice of
counsel, a conflict or potential conflict exists between the Indemnified Party
and the Indemnifying Party that would require such separate representation;
(y) on the advice of counsel, there exists one or more legal defenses
available to the Indemnified Party that are different from or in addition to
those available to the Indemnifying Party; or (z) the Indemnifying Party has
provided its prior written consent to such arrangement. If the Indemnifying
Party elects not to defend such Third-Party Claim or fails to promptly notify
the Indemnified Party in writing of its election to defend as provided in this
Agreement, the Indemnified Party may, subject to **Section 7.4**, pay,
compromise and defend such Third-Party Claim and seek indemnification for any
and all Damages based upon, arising from or relating to such Third-Party
Claim. The Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party will cooperate with
each other in all reasonable respects in connection with the defense of any
Third-Party Claim, including making available (subject to the provisions of
**Section 5.9**), records relating to such Third-Party Claim and furnishing,
without expense to the Indemnified Party, management employees of the
Indemnified Party as may be reasonably necessary for the preparation of the

      
 

 



 

defense of such Third-Party Claim. Any Third-Party Claim related to Taxes will
be addressed in the manner set forth in **Section 5.9c** and not this
**Section 7.3**.

 



 

b. _Settlement of Third-Party Claims_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party will not enter into settlement of any
Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party
(which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
except as otherwise provided in this **Section 7.3**. If a firm offer is made
to settle a Third-Party Claim, which offer: (1) provides for the payment of
monetary damages that are fully paid by the Indemnifying Party; (2) would not
result in: (a) the imposition of a consent order, injunction or decree that
would restrict the future activity or conduct of the Indemnified Party or any
other equitable relief upon the Indemnified Party; or (b) a finding or
admission or acknowledgement of any Liability or wrongdoing by the Indemnified
Party; and (3) provides, in customary form, for the unconditional release of
each Indemnified Party from all Liabilities and obligations in connection with
such Third-Party Claim, and the Indemnifying Party desires to accept and agree
to such offer, then the Indemnified Party will also accept and agree to such
offer. If the Indemnified Party has assumed the defense pursuant to this
**Section 7.3**, it will not agree to any settlement without the written
consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



 

c. _Direct Claims_. Any claim by an Indemnified Party on account of Damages
that do not result from a Third-Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ ") will be
asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying Party prompt written
notice thereof. The failure to give such prompt written notice will not,
however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations,
except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually
prejudiced thereby. Such notice by the Indemnified Party will describe the
Direct Claim in reasonable detail, will include copies of all material written
evidence thereof and will indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably
practicable, of the Damages that have been or may be sustained by the
Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party will have Thirty (30) days after its
receipt of such notice to respond in writing to such Direct Claim. During such
Thirty (30)-day period, the Indemnified Party will allow the Indemnifying
Party and its professional advisors to investigate the matter or circumstance
alleged to give rise to the Direct Claim, and whether and to what extent any
amount is payable in respect of the Direct Claim and the Indemnified Party
will assist the Indemnifying Partys investigation by giving such information
and assistance (including access to Companys premises and personnel and the
right to examine and copy any accounts, documents or records) as the
Indemnifying Party or any of its professional advisors may reasonably request.

 



 

7.4 _Certain Limitations_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, the obligations of the Parties pursuant to this Agreement will be
subject to each of the following:

 



 

a. _Survival of Representations and Warranties_.

 



 

(1) The representations and warranties contained in:

 



      
 

 



 

(a) **Sections 3.1** , **3.2** , **3.3** and **3.5** (collectively, the "
_Company Fundamental Representations_ "), **Sections 3.12** and **3.19** ; and

 



 

(b) **Sections 4.1** , **4.2** , **4.5** , **4.6** , **4.8** and **4.9**
(collectively, the " _Buyer Fundamental Representations_ ");

 



 

will survive the Closing Date until Sixty (60) days after the date of the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (as extended under
Applicable Law) but in no event for a period of more than Five (5) years from
the Closing Date.

 



 

(2) The representations and warranties contained in **Section 3.20** will
survive the Closing Date for a period of Five (5) years from the Closing Date.

 



 

(3) All other representations and warranties contained herein will survive the
Closing only for a period of Eighteen (18) months from the Closing Date.

 



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, all representations and warranties contained
herein shall survive beyond their applicable survival dates with respect to
any inaccuracy or breach thereof if a good faith claim is made hereunder prior
to such applicable survival dates, in which case such representation and
warranty shall survive as to such claim until such claim has been fully and
finally resolved.

 



 

b. _Survival of Covenants and STI Claim_. The covenants contained in **Section
5.17** shall survive the Closing Date for a period of Twelve (12) months. All
covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement that by their terms
contemplate performance after the Closing Date shall survive the Closing Date
for the period contemplated by their terms. The indemnification obligation of
the Shareholders pursuant to **Section 7.1c** shall survive the Closing Date
for a period of Five (5) years. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all covenants
or other agreements contained herein and the indemnification obligation of the
Shareholders pursuant to **Section 7.1c** shall survive beyond their
applicable survival dates with respect to any Damages thereof if a good faith
claim is made hereunder prior to such applicable survival dates, in which case
such covenant or agreement or obligation shall survive as to such claim until
such claim has been fully and finally resolved.

 



 

c. _De Minimis Claims_. Except as relates to actual fraud or Damages relating
to the breach or inaccuracy of any Company Fundamental Representation or any
representation or warranty contained in **Section 3.12**, the Shareholders
will not be liable to an Indemnified Party for indemnification under **7.1a**
for any single claim or series of related claims that do not exceed, in each
case, One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($150,000) in the aggregate, and such
claims will not be counted toward the Deductible.

 



      
 

 



 

d. _Deductible_. Except as relates to actual fraud or Damages relating to the
breach or inaccuracy of any Company Fundamental Representation or any
representation or warranty contained in **Section 3.12**, the Shareholders
will not be liable to an Indemnified Party for indemnification under **Section
7.1a** until the aggregate amount of all Damages in respect of indemnification
exceeds Seven Million Dollars ($7,000,000) (the " _Deductible_ "), in which
event the Indemnifying Party will be required to pay or be liable for Damages
only in excess of the Deductible.

 



 

e. _Cap_. Except as relates to actual fraud or Damages relating to the breach
or inaccuracy of any Company Fundamental Representation, the aggregate Damages
under **Section 5.9b** and **7.1** will in no event exceed the
Indemnification Escrow Amount then available (the " _Cap_ "). Except as
relates to actual fraud or Damages relating to the breach or inaccuracy of any
Buyer Fundamental Representation, the aggregate Damages under **Section 7.2**
will in no event exceed the Cap.

 



 

f. _Single Recovery_. No Indemnified Party will be entitled to recover from
any Indemnifying Party for the same Damages more than once. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the Parent Indemnitees will not be entitled
to indemnification under **Section 5.9b** or this **Article 7** with respect
to any Damage if any such Damage would constitute a duplicative payment of an
amount specifically taken into account in determining any post-Closing
adjustment, including the adjustment under **Section 2.14**, or to the extent
such Damage is reflected as a Liability on the Financial Statements or
reflected in the footnotes to the Financial Statements.

 



 

g. _Insurance Proceeds_. In computing the amount of any individual or
aggregate Damages, the amount of such Damages will be deemed to be an amount
net of any insurance proceeds actually received (net of the actual out-of-
pocket cost to recover any such amount) and net of any indemnity, contribution
or other similar payment actually made or paid by any Person other than the
Parent Indemnitees or the Shareholder Indemnitees (net of the actual out-of-
pocket cost to recover any such amount), as the case may be.

 



 

h. [ _Intentionally Omitted_.]

 



 

i. _No Consequential Damages_. Except with respect to Damages arising from any
Third-Party Claim to the extent payable to the applicable third party, in no
event will any Indemnifying Party be liable to any Indemnified Party for any
special, incidental, exemplary, consequential, punitive or any other indirect
losses, damages, costs or expenses of any kind or any losses, damages, costs
or expenses argued to be associated with lost profits, loss of future revenue
or income, loss of business reputation or opportunity or diminution in value.

 



 

j. _Duty to Mitigate_. Each Indemnified Party will take, and cause its
Affiliates to take, all commercially reasonable steps to mitigate any Damages
upon which a claim for indemnification may be made herein, upon becoming aware
of any event or circumstance that would be reasonably expected to give rise to
such claim. The Indemnified Party will act in a commercially reasonable manner
in addressing any events or actions that may provide the basis for
indemnification hereunder (that is, such Indemnified Party will respond to

 



      
 

 



 

such event or action in the same manner that it would respond in the absence
of the indemnification provided for in this Agreement, but in no event less
than a commercially reasonable response).

 



 

7.5 _Payments From Escrow Agreement_. Except as relates to actual fraud or
Damages relating to the breach or inaccuracy of any Company Fundamental
Representation, any indemnification payment as to which any Parent Indemnitee
becomes entitled under this Agreement will be made only from amounts held in
the Indemnification Escrow Fund in accordance with, and subject to, the terms
and conditions of the Escrow Agreement. Except as relates to actual fraud or
Damages relating to the breach or inaccuracy of any Company Fundamental
Representation, in no event will any Shareholder otherwise have any Liability
for or obligations in respect of any such indemnity obligation. With respect
to any such indemnification claims pursuant to **Section 7.1** based on
actual fraud or breaches of any Company Fundamental Representation, without
limiting any of the other provisions of **Section 5.9b** or this **Article
7**, no such claim may be made directly against any Shareholder unless and
until: (a) the Indemnified Party has exhausted its legal rights to claim
payment under all applicable policies of insurance; and thereafter, (b) the
Indemnification Escrow Fund is exhausted, and in such case each Shareholders
Liability will be several (in accordance with such Shareholders Participation
Percentage) and not joint. In no event will any Shareholder have any Liability
under this Agreement, in the aggregate, for more than the portion of the
Aggregate Merger Consideration actually paid to such Shareholder pursuant to
this Agreement.

 



 

7.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. Subject to the limitations set forth in **Section
8.21** and **8.22** , notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement: (a) the indemnification provided for in **Section 5.9b **and this
**Article 7** will be the sole and exclusive remedy of any Indemnified Party,
as the case may be, pursuant to this Agreement or any other Covered Agreement;
provided, however, that, subject to **Section 7.6b**, this **Section 7.6**
will not preclude any Party from bringing any action for specific performance
(as provided in **Section 8.22**) or other equitable remedy to require any
other Party to perform its agreements, covenants or obligations under this
Agreement; and (b) no Party will have any equitable or any other right of any
kind to rescind this Agreement, the Merger or any of other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement or any other Covered Agreement (other than
termination of this Agreement as provided in **Section 8.20**).

 



 

 ** _ARTICLE 8_**

 

 ** _MISCELLANEOUS_**

 



 

8.1 _Law_. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of the State of New York, without regard to principles of conflicts
of laws that would cause the applicability of the laws of any other
jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties hereby further agree
that, the Debt Commitment Letter and the other Financing Agreements and the
performance thereof by the Financing Sources shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, regardless of
the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts
of laws thereof.

 



      
 

 



 

8.2 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with all Exhibits and
Schedules attached hereto and made a part hereof, the Recitals and the other
Covered Agreements, constitutes the entire agreement among the Parties
regarding the subject matter herein and therein and supersedes all prior and
contemporaneous agreements among the Parties, whether written or oral, with
respect to such subject matter.

 



 

8.3 _Waiver_. Failure by any Party to insist upon strict performance of any
provision herein by any other Party will not be deemed a waiver by such Party
of its rights or remedies or a waiver by it of any subsequent default by such
other Party, and no waiver by any Party will be effective unless it is in
writing and duly executed by such Party.

 



 

8.4 _Assignment_. No Party will have the right to assign any of his/her/its
rights, duties or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of
all other Parties. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
under no circumstances will any such assignment hereunder be deemed to release
the assigning Party in any way from any of his/her/its duties or obligations
hereunder, and the assigning Party will be jointly and severally liable with
the assignee for all of such duties and obligations.

 



 

8.5 _Parties Bound_. This Agreement inures to the benefit of and is binding
upon the Parties and their respective heirs, legal representatives, successors
and permitted assigns, subject to the restrictions against assignment provided
in **Section 8.4**.

 



 

8.6 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended only by a writing executed by
all of the Parties; provided, however, that Parent and the Shareholder
Representative Group, on behalf of and for the benefit of Shareholders, may
amend this Agreement: (a) to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or
inconsistency herein; or (b) to make any change that does not adversely affect
the rights of any Shareholder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, **Sections 8.11, 8.13, 8.16, 8.21d, 8.24** and
this **Section 8.6** (and any provision of this Agreement to the extent an
amendment, supplement, waiver or modification of such provision would modify
the substance of any of such provisions in a manner that is materially adverse
to a Financing Source) may not be amended, supplemented, waived or otherwise
modified in a manner that is materially adverse to a Financing Source without
the prior written consent of such Financing Source, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



 

8.7 _Headings_. The headings herein are for reference purposes only and will
not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

 



 

8.8 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, any of which will be deemed an original, and all of which
together will constitute one and the same instrument.

 



 

8.9 _Notices_. All notices hereunder will be in writing and will be: (a)

identified in, and attached to, this Agreement are incorporated herein by
reference and made a part hereof.

 



 

8.11 _Disputes_. Except as otherwise provided in **Sections 2.14d** or
**5.9f** , any dispute arising between or among the Parties hereunder will be
subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of and will be finally settled in an
action commenced and maintained in any state or federal court having subject

consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of said courts and agree not
to challenge or assert any defense to the jurisdiction of said courts,
including _forum non conveniens_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, each of the Parties: (a) agrees that it will not bring or

third-party claim),

 



      
 

 



 

whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise,

in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way
to the Debt Financing, the Financing Agreements or the performance thereof, in

submits for itself and its property with respect to any such action to the
exclusive jurisdiction of such courts; (c) agrees that service of process,
summons, notice or document by registered mail addressed to it at its address

hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of, any such action in any such court; (e) agrees
that a final judgment in any such action shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by law; (f) agrees that the laws described in **Section 8.1** shall

8.12 _Expenses_. The nonprevailing Party or Parties in any litigation
hereunder will be required to reimburse the prevailing Party or Parties for
all reasonable costs and expenses incurred in any such litigation, including
reasonable attorneys fees and costs. The extent to which a Party is a
"prevailing party" will be determined by the court having jurisdiction over
such litigation, after taking into account the nature of the dispute, the
merits of the legal and factual positions of the Parties, the amount of the
Damages awarded, and the extent to which the Parties did or did not litigate
in good faith.

 



 

8.13 _Third Parties_. Except for Shareholder Indemnitees, Parent Indemnitees,
the Financing Sources and their respective Non-Party Affiliates (but as to
Financing Sources and their respective Non-Party Affiliates, only with respect
to **Sections 8.6, 8.11**, this **Section 8.13, Section 8.16, Section
8.21d** and **Section 8.24**, it being understood and agreed that each of
such Sections shall expressly inure to the benefit of the Financing Sources
and their respective Non-Party Affiliates and each of the Financing Sources
and their respective Non-Party Affiliates shall be entitled to rely on and
enforce the provisions of such Sections) and directors, officers and employees
as provided in **Section 5.6** who are intended third party beneficiaries
hereunder, nothing herein expressed or implied is intended or will be
construed to confer upon or give any Person other than the Parties and their
respective heirs, legal representatives, successors and permitted assigns, any
right or remedy under or by reason of this Agreement.

 



 

8.14 _Severability_. If any provision herein is determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, such provision
will be automatically reformed and construed so as to be valid, legal, and
enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law. The invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability of any part of this Agreement will not render
invalid the remainder of this Agreement.

 



       
 

 



 

8.15 _Construction_. All pronouns and any variation thereof will be deemed to
refer to the masculine, feminine, neuter, singular and/or plural as the
identity of the Person or as the context may require. The Parties have
participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. If an
ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement will
be construed as if drafted jointly by all Parties and no presumption or burden
of proof will arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the
authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement or the changes made

financing (in an amount sufficient to enable the transactions contemplated
hereby and by the other Covered Agreements to be consummated); or

 



 

d. by Parent or Company by written notice to the other Parties, if any
Applicable Law makes consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement illegal or otherwise prohibited or any Government Entity has issued

this Agreement, and such Government Order has become final and non-appealable.

 



 

e. _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this Agreement
in accordance with this **Section 8.20**, this Agreement will forthwith
become void and there will be no Liability on the part of any Party except:

the Escrow Agent a written notice to pay to Company the Parent Termination Fee
pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, and will simultaneously send a copy of such
written notice to Parent.

 



 

c. _Liquidated Damages_. Each of the Parties acknowledges that neither the
Company Termination Fee nor the Parent Termination Fee is a penalty, but
rather are liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate
Parent and Company, respectively, in the circumstances in which such fee is
due and payable, for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities
foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement
and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision.

 



 

d. _Sole Remedy of Company_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, in the circumstance in which Company receives payment
of the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to **Section 8.21b**, the Parent
Termination Fee shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of Company, any
of its Subsidiaries, any member of the Shareholder Representative Group or any
past, present or future director, officer, employee, member, partner,
shareholder or other owner (whether direct or indirect), Affiliate or
Representative of Company and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Company
Related Party_ ") against Parent, Merger Sub, Financing Sources and any past,
present or future director, officer, employee, member, partner, shareholder or
other owner (whether direct or indirect), Affiliate or Representative of
Parent and Merger Sub and the Financing Sources (collectively, the " _Parent
Related Party_ ") for all Damages suffered as a result of the failure of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated or for a breach
or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise arising out of, or directly or
indirectly relating to, this Agreement, the other Covered Agreements or the
negotiation, execution or performance hereof or thereof or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, and upon payment of such amount, no Parent
Related Party shall have any further Liability or obligation to any Company
Related Party relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the other Covered
Agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or in respect of
any other document, theory of law or equity or oral representations made or
alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith, in contract, in tort
or otherwise. Except as expressly provided in the immediately preceding
sentence, following the payment of the Parent Termination Fee: (A) no Company
Related Party shall be entitled to bring, maintain or support any Action
against any Parent Related Party arising out of or in connection with this
Agreement, the other Covered Agreements or the negotiation, execution or
performance hereof or thereof or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby (or the abandonment or termination thereof) or any matters forming the
basis for such termination; and (B) Company and the Shareholder Representative
Group shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause any Action pending in
connection with this Agreement, the other Covered Agreements or the
negotiation, execution or

 



      
 

 



 

performance hereof or thereof or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, to the extent maintained by any Company Related Party against any
Parent Related Party to be dismissed with prejudice promptly. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Financing Sources
shall be subject to no liability or claims whatsoever by the parties hereto
(or their respective controlled Affiliates) in any way relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter, the
other Financing Agreements, or the performance hereof or thereof, except that
the foregoing shall not affect the contractual commitments and obligations of
the Financing Sources to the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter and
the other Financing Agreements under the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter
and the other Financing Agreements.

 



 

e. _Sole Remedy of Parent_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
in this Agreement, in the circumstance in which Parent receives payment of the
Company Termination Fee pursuant to **Section 8.21a**, the Company
Termination Fee shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of any Parent
Related Party against any Company Related Party for all Damages suffered as a
result of the failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise
arising out of, or directly or indirectly relating to, this Agreement, the
other Covered Agreements or the negotiation, execution or performance hereof
or thereof or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and upon
payment of such amount, no Company Related Party shall have any further
Liability or obligation to any Parent Related Party relating to or arising out
of this Agreement, the other Covered Agreements or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or in respect of any other document, theory of
law or equity or oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection
herewith or therewith, in contract, in tort or otherwise. Except as expressly
provided in the immediately preceding sentence, following the payment of the
Company Termination Fee: (A) no Parent Related Party shall be entitled to
bring, maintain or support any Action against any Company Related Party
arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, the other Covered
Agreements or the negotiation, execution or performance hereof or thereof or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (or the abandonment or
termination thereof) or any matters forming the basis for such termination;
and (B) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any Action
pending in connection with this Agreement, the other Covered Agreements or the
negotiation, execution or performance hereof or thereof or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, to the extent maintained by any Parent Related
Party against any Company Related Party to be dismissed with prejudice
promptly.

 



 

8.22 _Specific Performance_.

 



 

a. Subject to **Section 8.22b** and the limitations set forth in **Sections
8.21d** and **8.21e** , the Parties agree that immediate and irreparable harm
and damage would occur for which monetary damages alone would not be an
adequate remedy if any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed
in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that in the event of such breach or non-performance,
subject to **Section 8.22b **and the limitations set forth in **Sections
8.21d** and **8.21e** , no Party will interfere with, delay, obstruct or
prevent the non-breaching Party from taking, or require such Party to take,
any steps prior to taking action to seek an interim and interlocutory
equitable remedy (including an injunction or order for specific performance)
on notice or _ex parte_ to enforce its rights or to preserve the status quo or
prevent irreparable harm, and each Party covenants and

 



      
 

 



 

agrees not to contest, object to, or otherwise oppose an application for
equitable relief by any other Party in such circumstances, and waives any and
all immunities from any equitable relief to which it may be entitled. Any such
relief or remedy will not be exclusive, but will be in addition to all other
available legal or equitable remedies.

 



 

b. Notwithstanding the right of Company or the Shareholder Representative
Group to obtain an injunction or other appropriate form of specific
performance or equitable relief described in **Section 8.22a**, the Parties
acknowledge and agree that the Company or the Shareholder Representative Group
shall not be entitled to enforce specifically the obligations of Parent or
Merger Sub to consummate the Merger unless: (1) all of the conditions set
forth in **Section 6.1** and **Section 6.3** (other than any condition that
by its nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but that is expected to
be satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied or waived; and (2) the full
proceeds to be provided to Parent or Merger Sub by the Debt Financing shall be
available to Parent or Merger Sub to complete the Merger.

 



 

8.23 _Shareholder Representative Group_.

 



 

a. _Authority_. By approving this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby or by executing and delivering a Letter of Transmittal, each
Shareholder will have irrevocably authorized and appointed the Shareholder
Representative Group as such Persons representatives and attorneys-in-fact to
act on behalf of such Person with respect to this Agreement and the other
Covered Agreements and to take any and all actions and make any decisions
required or permitted to be taken by the Shareholder Representative Group
pursuant to this Agreement or the other Covered Agreements, including the
power to:

 



 

(1) give and receive notices and communications to or from Parent (on behalf
of itself or any other Parent Indemnitee), Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation, the Escrow Agent or the Exchange Agent relating to this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Exchange Agent Agreement or any of the
transactions and other matters contemplated hereby or thereby (except to the
extent that this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Exchange Agreement
expressly contemplates that any such notice or communication will be given to
or received by the Shareholders individually);

 



 

(2) deposit into and disburse from the Shareholder Representative Group
Expense Fund amounts contemplated by this Agreement or the other Covered
Agreements;

 



 

(3) authorize delivery to Parent of cash from the Escrow Funds in satisfaction
of any amounts owed to Parent with respect to any post-Closing adjustment
under **Section 2.14** or in satisfaction of claims for indemnification made
by any Parent Indemnitee pursuant to **Section 5.9b** or **Article 7**;

 



       
 

 



 

(4) agree to, negotiate and enter into settlements and compromises of issues
and disputes with Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation;

 



 

(5) agree to, object to, negotiate, resolve, enter into settlements and
compromises of, demand litigation of, and comply with orders of courts with
respect to, claims for indemnification made by any Parent Indemnitee;

 



 

(6) litigate, arbitrate, resolve, settle or compromise any claim for
indemnification pursuant to this Agreement;

 



 

(7) undertake an audit pursuant to **Section 2.14c**;

 



 

(8) agree to, object to, negotiate, resolve, enter into settlements and
compromises of, and submit to review by the Independent Accountant, any
matters pursuant to **Sections 2.14d** or **5.9c** ;

 



 

(9) execute and deliver all documents necessary or desirable to carry out the
intent of this Agreement and any other Covered Agreement;

 



 

(10) make all elections or decisions contemplated by this Agreement and any
other Covered Agreement;

 



 

(11) engage, employ or appoint any agents or representatives (including
attorneys, accountants and consultants) to assist the Shareholder
Representative Group in complying with its duties and obligations; and

 



 

(12) take all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the
Shareholder Representative Group for the accomplishment of the foregoing.

 



 

b. _Interaction with Parent and Merger Sub_. Any decision or action of the
Shareholder Representative Group may be taken only with the approval of at
least Two (2) of the Three (3) members of the Shareholder Representative
Group. Parent and Merger Sub will be entitled to deal exclusively with the
Shareholder Representative Group on all matters relating to this Agreement,
and will be entitled to rely conclusively (without further evidence of any
kind whatsoever) on any document executed or purported to be executed on
behalf of the Shareholder Representative Group, and on any other action taken
or purported to be taken on behalf of any Shareholder by the Shareholder
Representative Group, as being fully binding upon such Person. Notices or
communications to or from the Shareholder Representative Group will constitute
notice to or from each of the Shareholders. Except as set forth in the final
sentence of this **Section 8.23b**: (1) any decision or action by the
Shareholder Representative Group hereunder, including any agreement between
the Shareholder Representative Group and Parent relating to

 



      
 

 



 

the defense, payment or settlement of any claims for indemnification
hereunder, will constitute a decision or action of all Shareholders and will
be final, binding and conclusive upon each such Person; and (2) no Shareholder
will have the right to object to, dissent from, protest or otherwise contest
the same. The provisions of this **Section 8.23b**, including the power of
attorney granted hereby, are independent and severable, are irrevocable and
coupled with an interest and will not be terminated by any act of any one
Shareholder or by operation of law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the Shareholder Representative Group will have no
authority to: (i) amend the terms of this Agreement if such amendment would
adversely affect in any material respect the rights of any Shareholder in a
manner different in any material respect from the rights of any other
Shareholder; (ii) bind any Shareholder with respect to Damages in excess of
such Shareholders Participation Percentage of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration; or (iii) make any admission of fault or Liability on behalf of
any Shareholder, other than with respect to the payment of any Damages under
**Section 5.9f** or **Article 7**. Parent and Merger Sub may rely upon all
actions taken or omitted to be taken by the Shareholder Representative Group
pursuant to this Agreement and the other Covered Agreements, all of which
actions or omissions shall be legally binding upon the Shareholder
Representative Group and all the Shareholders.

 



 

c. _Access_. Parent will ensure that, upon reasonable notice, the Shareholder
Representative Group has reasonable access to information about Company and
the reasonable assistance of Companys officers and employees for purposes of
performing the Shareholder Representative Groups duties hereunder and
exercising the Shareholder Representative Groups rights hereunder, provided
that each member of the Shareholder Representative Group will treat
confidentially and not disclose any nonpublic information from or about
Company to anyone (except on a need-to-know basis to the Shareholder
Representative Groups Representatives for such matter who agree to treat such
information confidentially).

 



 

d. _Shareholder Representative Group Expense Fund_. Prior to the Closing, the
Shareholder Representative Group will establish the Shareholder Representative
Group Expense Fund to be held for the purpose of funding any expenses of the
Shareholder Representative Group arising in connection with the administration
of the Shareholder Representative Groups duties in this Agreement after the
Effective Time. No bond will be required of the Shareholder Representative
Group or any member of the Shareholder Representative Group, and no member of
the Shareholder Representative Group will receive compensation for his or her
services, although such member may be reimbursed from the Shareholder
Representative Group Expense Fund for his or her reasonable expenses.

 



 

e. _Successor Member of Shareholder Representative Group_. Any member of the
Shareholder Representative Group may resign at any time, and may be removed
for any reason or no reason by the vote or written consent of a majority in
interest of the Shareholders according to each Shareholders Participation
Percentage (the " _Majority Holders_ "); provided, however, in no event will
any member of Shareholder Representative Group resign or be removed without
the Majority Holders having first appointed a successor member who will assume
such duties immediately upon the resignation or removal of such member of the
Shareholder Representative Group. In the event of the death, incapacity,
resignation or removal of any member of the Shareholder Representative Group,
a successor member will be appointed

 



      
 

 



 

by the vote or written consent of the Majority Holders. Notice of such vote or
a copy of the written consent appointing such member of the Shareholder
Representative Group will be sent to Parent, such appointment to be effective
upon the later of the date indicated in such consent or the date such notice
is received by Parent; provided, that until such notice is received, Parent,
Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation will be entitled to rely on the
decisions and actions of the Shareholder Representative Group as constituted
prior to such appointment as described above.

 



 

f. _Liability_. No member of the Shareholder Representative Group will be
liable to the Shareholders for actions taken pursuant to this Agreement or the
other Covered Agreements, except to the extent such actions will have been
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have constituted gross
negligence or involved fraud, intentional misconduct or bad faith (it being
understood that any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel,
accountants and other professionals and experts retained by the Shareholder
Representative Group will be conclusive evidence of good faith). The
Shareholders will severally (in accordance with their respective Participation
Percentages), and not jointly, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the members
of the Shareholder Representative Group from and against, compensate them for,
reimburse them for and pay any and all Damages arising out of and in
connection with their activities as members of the Shareholder Representative
Group under this Agreement and the other Covered Agreements (the "
_Representative Losses_ "), in each case as such Representative Losses are
suffered or incurred; provided, that if it is finally adjudicated that any
Representative Losses or any portion thereof was primarily caused by the gross
negligence, fraud, intentional misconduct or bad faith of any member of the
Shareholder Representative Group, such member will reimburse the Shareholders
the amount of such indemnified Representative Losses attributable to such
gross negligence, fraud, intentional misconduct or bad faith. As soon as
practicable after the date on which the Escrow Funds have been fully disbursed
pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, all obligations of the
Shareholders have been discharged and all other monetary obligations of the
Shareholders payable from the Shareholder Representative Group Expense Fund
have been paid in full, the Shareholder Representative Group will pay any
amounts remaining in the Shareholder Representative Group Expense Fund to the
Shareholders in accordance with their respective Participation Percentages.

 



 

8.24 _No Recourse to Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein: (a) no Company Related Party shall have any rights
or claims against any Financing Source or any of its respective Non-Party
Affiliates in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, whether at law or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise; and (b) no Financing Source or its respective
Non-Party Affiliates shall be subject to any special, consequential, punitive
or indirect damages or damages of a tortious nature. Company, on behalf of
each Company Related Party, hereby waives any rights or claims against the
Financing Sources and their respective Non-Party Affiliates in connection with
this Agreement or the Debt Financing, whether at law or equity, in contract,
in tort or otherwise and each Company Related Party agrees not to commence
(and if commenced agrees to dismiss or otherwise terminate) any legal
proceeding against any Financing Source or its respective Non-Party Affiliates
in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
(including any legal proceeding relating to the Debt Financing).
