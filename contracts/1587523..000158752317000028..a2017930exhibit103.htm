Unless otherwise required by applicable local Law (on a &#13;&#10;country-by-country basis), the Local Agreements shall not contain any representations, &#13;&#10;warranties, covenants or conditions.  Each Local Agreement with respect to each &#13;&#10;applicable jurisdiction shall be in substantively the same form except, as the Parties shall &#13;&#10;mutually agree, for (i) the deletion of provisions which are inapplicable to the Acquired &#13;&#10;Business (or portion thereof) in such jurisdiction, (ii) such changes as may be necessary &#13;&#10;to satisfy the requirements of applicable local Law or applicable organizational &#13;&#10;documents of any relevant Persons and (iii) such changes regarding employees and &#13;&#10;employee benefit matters in order to adapt such Local Agreement to the particular &#13;&#10;circumstances of the Acquired Business and jurisdiction.

To the extent the provisions of this Agreement are inconsistent with or &#13;&#10;additional to the provisions of a Local Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement shall &#13;&#10;prevail, unless mandated by local Law (on a county-by-country basis), and, upon &#13;&#10;recognition of such inconsistency the Parties shall promptly cause (i) the provisions of &#13;&#10;the applicable Local Agreement to be modified to the extent necessary to give effect to &#13;&#10;the provisions of this Agreement subject to being compliant with any applicable local &#13;&#10;Law in the applicable jurisdiction and (ii) the applicable Asset Seller or the Equity Seller, &#13;&#10;on the one hand, and Buyer or the applicable Designated Purchaser (if not Buyer &#13;&#10;directly), on the other hand, to (A) comply, to the extent lawful, with the provisions of &#13;&#10;this Agreement as though bound by such provisions in place of the provisions of the &#13;&#10;applicable Local Agreement and (B) waive or refrain from enforcing any provision in the &#13;&#10;applicable Local Agreement that is inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement. &#13;&#10;(c) Claims under Local Agreements.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any claim or demand &#13;&#10;made by a third party relating to a Tax for which Vectron may be Liable pursuant to this &#13;&#10;Agreement shall be governed by Section 5.1(c). &#13;&#10;(b) Defense. &#13;&#10;(i) If a Third Party Claim is made against the Indemnified Party, then &#13;&#10;the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof at the &#13;&#10;Indemnifying Party&#8217;s expense and, if the Indemnifying Party so chooses (in its &#13;&#10;sole discretion), to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by the &#13;&#10;Indemnifying Party, unless (A) the Indemnifying Party is also a party to such &#13;&#10;Proceeding and, in the reasonable opinion of counsel to such Indemnified Party, &#13;&#10;joint representation would result in a legal conflict of interest or require the &#13;&#10;assertion of conflicting defenses or counterclaims, (B) the Indemnifying Party has &#13;&#10;failed and is failing to vigorously defend such Third Party Claim, (C) the Third &#13;&#10;Party Claim is reasonably likely to involve monetary liability of the Indemnified &#13;&#10;Party in excess of the applicable limitation set forth in Section 9.1 to such claim &#13;&#10;or (D) the Third Party Claim alleges a violation of Law by, or would involve &#13;&#10;injunctive or equitable relief against, an Indemnified Party). &#13;&#10;(ii) If the Indemnifying Party so elects to assume the defense of a &#13;&#10;Third Party Claim, then (A) the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the &#13;&#10;Indemnified Party for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel subsequently &#13;&#10;incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof and &#13;&#10;(B) the Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof &#13;&#10;and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;</FONT></DIV>
