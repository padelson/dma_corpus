extent any of the foregoing primarily relate to the Acquired Business; (x)

Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor Vectron shall cause any
Asset Seller to sell or transfer to Buyer, and Buyer shall not purchase or
accept from any Asset Seller, any of the Excluded Assets. (b) Liabilities.
Upon the terms set forth in this Agreement and subject to the provisions of
Section 1.2(c), at the Closing, Buyer shall assume and agree to pay, perform
and discharge, as and when due, the Assumed Liabilities. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, or anything in this Agreement to the contrary, and regardless of
any disclosure to Buyer or its Affiliates, Buyer (including each of its
Affiliates) shall not assume, nor be deemed to have assumed, and shall not in
any way be liable or responsible for, any of the Excluded Liabilities, all of
which shall be retained and paid, performed or discharged as and when due by
the applicable Asset Seller or their respective Affiliates. (c) Nonassignable
Assets. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, to the
extent that any Acquired Asset is not assignable to Buyer without the
consent, approval, waiver, agreement or action of any other Person (other than
Parent, Vectron or their respective Affiliates), pursuant to Contract or
otherwise (each such asset, a "Nonassignable Asset"), there shall be no
assignment or attempted assignment to Buyer of such Nonassignable Asset at
the Closing under this Agreement in the absence of such Person's consent,
approval, waiver, agreement or action, unless otherwise agreed to in writing
by the Parties, and this Agreement shall not be deemed to constitute an
assignment or attempted assignment thereof. In the case of each Nonassignable
Asset, for a period ending one hundred eighty (180) days following the
Closing, the Parties shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, use their
respective reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent, approval, waiver,
agreement or action of such Person to the assignment of such Nonassignable
Asset to Buyer. If any such consent, approval, waiver, agreement or action is
not obtained from such Person prior to the Closing, then the Parties shall,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, cooperate with each other to agree
to a reasonable arrangement whereby, from and after the Closing, (i) Parent,
Vectron or their respective Affiliates provide or cause to be provided without
cost to Buyer the benefits intended to be assigned to Buyer arising from or
relating to such  

  

 ![](a2017930exhibit103008.jpg) 

4 OMM_US:75933001.11 Nonassignable Asset, and each of Parent, Vectron and
their respective Affiliates agrees to enforce, upon the written request of
Buyer and for the benefit of Buyer, any rights of Parent, Vectron or their
respective Affiliates in respect of such Nonassignable Asset and (ii) Buyer
assumes, performs and discharges any Assumed Liabilities associated with such
Non-assignable Asset; provided, however, that once such consent, approval,
waiver, agreement or action is obtained (if ever), such Nonassignable Asset
shall promptly be assigned by Vectron or its Affiliates to Buyer at no
additional cost to Buyer. (d) Post-Closing Asset Transfers. At any time
following the Closing, if the Parties determine that any assets, rights or
properties that properly constitute assets of the Acquired Business were not
transferred to Buyer or the applicable Designated Purchaser at Closing,
subject to Section 1.2(c), Parent and Vectron shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to transfer and deliver (or to cause to be transferred and
delivered) such assets to Buyer or the applicable Designated Purchaser
without the payment of any further consideration therefor. At any time
following the Closing, if the Parties determine that assets, rights or
properties that did not properly constitute assets of the Acquired Business
as of the Closing Date were inadvertently transferred to Buyer or the
applicable Designated Purchaser at Closing, then Buyer shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to transfer and deliver, or cause to be transferred and
delivered, any and all of such assets, to Vectron or, at Vectron's request,
an Affiliate of Vectron without the payment by Vectron or any such Affiliate
of any consideration therefor. Section 1.3 Designated Purchasers. Buyer may,
upon written notice delivered to Vectron not less than ten (10) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, assign its rights to receive Acquired Assets and
the Acquired Shares at the Closing, in whole or in part, under this Agreement
to one or more of its Affiliates (each such entity, a "Designated Purchaser")
for the purpose of carrying out the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; provided, however, that Buyer shall be and remain jointly and
severally liable with each Designated Purchaser for all obligations of Buyer
and any such Designated Purchaser under this Agreement and under all
documents and instruments to be executed and delivered by Buyer or any such
Designated Purchaser pursuant hereto. Section 1.4 Local Agreements. (a)
Execution and Delivery. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the
implementation of the transactions contemplated by Sections 1.1 and 1.2 will
be effected at the Closing pursuant to certain short-form assignment and
assumption, merger, sale or other similar short-form transfer agreements,
including, as necessary, notices of transfer, certificates of merger,
notarial deeds, powers of attorney and any other ancillary agreement or
document as mutually agreed upon by the Parties, in all cases subject to,
conforming with and to the extent reasonably required by, the requirements of
applicable local Law (on a country-by-country basis, and including employment
Laws) and, as applicable, the organizational documents of the Acquired
Company (collectively, the "Local Agreements"). From the date hereof until
the Closing (or earlier termination of this Agreement), the Parties shall
negotiate in good faith the provisions of the Local Agreements, which shall
be in a form mutually agreed upon by the Parties prior to the Closing, under
the fundamental principle that the operative provisions governing the  

  

 ![](a2017930exhibit103009.jpg) 

5 OMM_US:75933001.11 transactions contemplated by Sections 1.1 and 1.2 shall
be contained in this Agreement to the maximum extent practicable so as to
avoid confusion or inconsistency regarding the terms of such transactions.
Unless otherwise required by applicable local Law (on a country-by-country
basis), the Local Agreements shall not contain any representations,
warranties, covenants or conditions. Each Local Agreement with respect to each
applicable jurisdiction shall be in substantively the same form except, as the
Parties shall mutually agree, for (i) the deletion of provisions which are
inapplicable to the Acquired Business (or portion thereof) in such
jurisdiction, (ii) such changes as may be necessary to satisfy the
requirements of applicable local Law or applicable organizational documents
of any relevant Persons and (iii) such changes regarding employees and
employee benefit matters in order to adapt such Local Agreement to the
particular circumstances of the Acquired Business and jurisdiction. The
Parties will cooperate to prepare the Local Agreements as soon as reasonably
practicable following the date hereof and will execute and deliver or cause
their respective Affiliates to execute and deliver such Local Agreements at
the Closing, in each case, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement. (b) Conflict with this Agreement. The Local Agreements are
not intended to supersede or modify in any way the representations,
warranties, covenants and conditions set forth in this Agreement. The
applicable Local Agreement will be entered into solely for the purpose of
implementing (in the relevant jurisdictions) the sale, purchase and delivery
of the Acquired Shares and the Acquired Assets, and the assignment and
assumption of the Assumed Liabilities, as provided under the provisions of
this Agreement. To the extent the provisions of this Agreement are
inconsistent with or additional to the provisions of a Local Agreement, the
provisions of this Agreement shall prevail, unless mandated by local Law (on
a county-by-country basis), and, upon recognition of such inconsistency the
Parties shall promptly cause (i) the provisions of the applicable Local
Agreement to be modified to the extent necessary to give effect to the
provisions of this Agreement subject to being compliant with any applicable
local Law in the applicable jurisdiction and (ii) the applicable Asset Seller
or the Equity Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer or the applicable Designated
Purchaser (if not Buyer directly), on the other hand, to (A) comply, to the
extent lawful, with the provisions of this Agreement as though bound by such
provisions in place of the provisions of the applicable Local Agreement and
(B) waive or refrain from enforcing any provision in the applicable Local
Agreement that is inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement. (c)
Claims under Local Agreements. Without limiting any rights hereunder, each
Party agrees not to, and to cause its Affiliates not to, bring any claim in
respect of or based upon the Local Agreements, except to the extent necessary
to implement any purchase and assignment of the Acquired Shares and the
Acquired Assets or any assignment of the Assumed Liabilities, in a manner
consistent with the provisions of this Agreement or applicable Local
Agreements.

Business (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the Excluded Assets,
Excluded Liabilities, the Due Diligence Fee Amount and any intercompany
accounts involving Parent, Vectron, the Equity Seller or any Affiliate

Closing Date (the "Preliminary Cash Determination") and (C) Transaction

Capital Determination and the Preliminary Cash Determination, the
"Preliminary Closing Statement"). (b) Parent and Vectron shall have an
opportunity to review the Preliminary Closing Statement for a period of
forty-five (45) days after receipt thereof. If Parent and Vectron disagree
with any aspect of the Preliminary Closing Statement, such Parties shall
together deliver one and only one written notice to Buyer prior to the
expiration of such forty-five (45) day period indicating in reasonable detail
the basis for such disagreement (a "Dispute Notice"). If Parent and Vectron
do not deliver a Dispute Notice prior to or as of the expiration of such
forty-five (45) day period, then the Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet
and the Preliminary Working Capital Determination, Preliminary Cash
Determination and Preliminary Transaction Expenses Determination set forth in
the Preliminary Closing Statement shall be final and binding on the Parties,
effective as of the expiration of such forty-five (45) day period, as the
"Closing Date Balance Sheet," the "Closing Date Working Capital," the "Closing
Date Cash" and the "Closing Date Transaction Expenses," respectively. (c) If
Vectron delivers a Dispute Notice to Buyer in a timely manner, the Parties
shall attempt in good faith to resolve the disagreements set forth in such
Dispute Notice for a period of forty-five (45) days (or such longer period as
they may mutually agree in writing) after Buyer's receipt of such Dispute
Notice. During such period, each of Vectron and Buyer shall be permitted to
discuss with the other Party the Preliminary Closing Statement and shall be
provided copies of such work papers and supporting records related to the
items set forth on the Preliminary Closing Statement as it may reasonably
request from the other Party so as to allow it to become informed regarding
the calculation of such items and the accounting procedures, methodologies,
tests and approaches used in connection therewith; provided that neither
Party's accountants shall be obligated to make any work papers available
except in accordance with such accountants' normal disclosure procedures and
then only after such firm has signed a  

  

 ![](a2017930exhibit103013.jpg) 

9 OMM_US:75933001.11 customary agreement relating to such access to work
papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such accountants. If
the Parties are able to resolve the disagreements set forth in the Dispute
Notice prior to the expiration of such forty-five (45) day period (or such
longer period as they may mutually agree in writing), then the determinations
agreed to by the Parties shall be final and binding on the Parties as the
"Closing Date Balance Sheet," the "Closing Date Working Capital," the "Closing
Date Cash" and the "Closing Date Transaction Expenses", respectively. (d) If
the Parties are not able to resolve the disagreements set forth in the
Dispute Notice within forty-five (45) days (or such longer period as they may
mutually agree in writing) after Buyer's receipt of such Dispute Notice, then
such disagreements shall be promptly referred to Crowe Horwath LLP or, if
Crowe Horwath LLP cannot or does not agree to serve, another independent
accounting firm of national reputation mutually acceptable to the Parties
(the "Independent Auditor"). The Parties shall enter into reasonable and
customary arrangements for the services to be rendered by the Independent
Auditor under this Section 2.3(d), such services to be provided in the
Independent Auditor's capacity as an arbitrator. The Independent Auditor shall
have authority, and shall be instructed, to resolve only the specific
disputes presented to it by the Parties based on the Preliminary Closing
Statement and the Dispute Notice as promptly as reasonably practicable, shall
base such resolution solely on written presentations of the Parties submitted
to the Independent Auditor (and not by independent review), and shall
endeavor to complete such process within a period of no more than thirty (30)
days following the engagement thereof by the Parties. The Independent Auditor
shall apply the provisions of this Agreement concerning the determination of
the amounts set forth in the Preliminary Closing Statement, including, for
the avoidance of doubt, the Accounting Principles and Exhibit C, and the
Independent Auditor's decision shall be solely based on (i) whether any item
objected to was prepared in accordance with the guidelines set forth in this
Agreement or (ii) whether such item objected to contains a mathematical or
clerical error. The Independent Auditor shall be instructed that, in making
such determination, it may not assign a value greater than the greatest value
for such item claimed by any Party or smaller than the smallest value for
such item claimed by any Party. The Independent Auditor shall deliver to the
Parties concurrently a written statement setting forth its determination,
which shall be final and binding on the Parties, effective as of the date the
Independent Auditor's written statement is received by the Parties, and the

shall be final and binding on the Parties as the "Closing Date Balance
Sheet," the "Closing Date Working Capital," the "Closing Date Cash" and the
"Closing Date Transaction Expenses," respectively. (e) The Parties shall make
available to the Independent Auditor (if applicable) such books, records and
other information (including work papers) as the Independent Auditor may

borne by Buyer, on the one hand, and Parent and Vectron, on the other hand,
in inverse relation to their success (based on the aggregate dollar amount
awarded) with respect to any

resolution procedures set forth in any other Section of this Agreement.

shall be allocated among the Acquired Shares and the aggregate Acquired
Assets sold by each Asset Seller in accordance with Schedule 2.6(a). (b)
Post-Closing Allocation. (i) Within forty-five (45) days following the
determination of the Closing Date Working Capital and Closing Date Cash
pursuant to Section 2.3, Buyer shall deliver to Vectron (x) a schedule (the
"Preliminary Allocation Schedule") setting forth in reasonable detail an
allocation of the Purchase Price (which for this purpose shall include any
Assumed Liabilities properly taken into account for tax purposes) among the
Acquired Shares and the aggregate Acquired Assets sold by each Asset Seller,
such allocation to be based on the relative fair market values and (y) with
respect to the Acquired Assets, with respect to the amount so allocated to
the aggregate Acquired Assets sold by such Asset Seller, a schedule further
allocating such amount among the Acquired Assets (the schedule for each such
Asset Seller, a "Preliminary Asset Allocation Schedule"). The Preliminary
Allocation Schedule shall be consistent with Schedule 2.6(a), in each case
increased or decreased to reflect a reasonable allocation of the difference
between the Purchase Price and the Base Purchase Price (it being understood
that, to the extent reasonably necessary to reflect changes in Working
Capital, Cash and Cash Equivalents and Transaction Expenses taken into
account in determining the Purchase Price, certain allocated amounts may be
more than as allocated on Schedule 2.6(a), while at the same time other
allocated amounts may be less, provided the overall allocation equals the
Purchase Price). Each Preliminary Asset Allocation Schedule shall be prepared
in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and applicable Treasury
Regulations thereunder. (ii) Parent and Vectron shall have an opportunity to
review the Preliminary Allocation Schedule and each Preliminary Asset
Allocation Schedule for a period of forty-five (45) days. If Parent and
Vectron concur with the Preliminary Allocation Schedule, Parent and Vectron
shall together deliver a written statement to Buyer within such forty-five
(45) day period accepting the Preliminary Allocation Schedule (an "Allocation
Acceptance Notice"), in which case the Preliminary Allocation Schedule shall
be final and binding on the Parties. If Parent and Vectron disagree with any
aspect of the Preliminary Allocation Schedule, Parent and Vectron shall
together deliver one and only one written notice thereof to Buyer prior to
the expiration of such forty-five (45) day period indicating in reasonable
detail the basis for such disagreement (an "Allocation Dispute Notice"). If
Parent and Vectron deliver an Allocation Dispute Notice to Buyer, the Parties
shall attempt in good faith to resolve the disagreements set  

  

 ![](a2017930exhibit103017.jpg) 

13 OMM_US:75933001.11 forth in such Allocation Dispute Notice for a period
of at least thirty (30) days (or such longer period as they may mutually
agree in writing) after Buyer's receipt of such Allocation Dispute Notice. If
the Parties are able to resolve the disagreements set forth in the Allocation
Dispute Notice prior to the expiration of such thirty (30) day period (or
such longer period as they may mutually agree in writing), then the Parties
shall reduce such resolution to writing, which shall be final and binding on
the Parties (the Preliminary Allocation Schedule, when final and binding
pursuant to an Allocation Acceptance Notice or the resolution of an
Allocation Dispute Notice, the "Final Allocation Schedule"). Each Party shall
(and shall cause its respective Affiliates to) file all Tax Returns in a
manner consistent with the Final Allocation Schedule, if any, and no Party
shall (or permit its respective Affiliates to) take any position for Tax
purposes inconsistent with the Final Allocation Schedule. (iii) If the
Parties are not able to resolve the disagreements set forth in the Allocation
Dispute Notice within thirty (30) days (or such longer period as they may
mutually agree in writing) after Buyer's receipt of such Allocation Dispute
Notice, then each of the Parties shall be entitled to allocate the difference
between the Purchase Price and the Base Purchase Price among the Acquired
Shares and the aggregate Acquired Assets sold by each Asset Seller in any
manner it so determines in its sole discretion and none shall have any
obligation to any other with respect to any such allocation. (iv) If Parent
and Vectron delivers an Allocation Acceptance Notice pursuant to Section
2.6(b)(ii) and also concurs with one or more Preliminary Asset Allocation
Schedules, Parent and Vectron shall, concurrent with delivery of the
Allocation Acceptance Notice, deliver with respect to each such Preliminary
Asset Allocation Schedule a written statement to Buyer accepting the
Preliminary Asset Allocation Schedule (each, an "Asset Allocation Acceptance
Notice"), in which case such Preliminary Asset Allocation Schedule shall,
with respect to the Acquired Assets sold by the relevant Asset Seller, be
final and binding on the Parties. If Parent and Vectron disagree with any
aspect of one or more Preliminary Asset Allocation Schedules, then within
thirty (30) days of (A) the Parties' agreement on a Final Allocation Schedule
pursuant to Section 2.6(b)(ii) or (B) in the absence of such agreement, the
passing of the time period specified in Section 2.6(b)(iii), Parent and
Vectron shall together deliver with respect to each such Preliminary Asset
Allocation Schedule written notice thereof to Buyer indicating in reasonable
detail the basis for such disagreement (each, an "Asset Allocation Dispute
Notice"). The Parties shall attempt in good faith to resolve the
disagreements set forth in any Asset Allocation Dispute Notice for a period of
at least thirty (30) days (or such longer period as they may mutually agree
in writing) after Buyer's receipt of such Asset Allocation Dispute Notice. If
the Parties are able to resolve the disagreements set forth in the Asset
Allocation Dispute Notice prior to the expiration of such thirty (30) day
period (or such longer period as they may mutually agree in writing), then
the Parties shall reduce such resolution to writing, which shall be final and
binding on the Parties (each Preliminary Asset Allocation Schedule, when
final and binding pursuant to an  

  

 ![](a2017930exhibit103018.jpg) 

14 OMM_US:75933001.11 Asset Allocation Acceptance Notice or the resolution
of an Asset Allocation Dispute Notice, a "Final Asset Allocation Schedule").
Each of the Parties shall (and shall cause its respective Affiliates to) file
all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with each Final Asset Allocation
Schedule, if any, and none of the Parties shall (or shall permit their
respective Affiliates to) take any position for Tax purposes inconsistent
with any Final Asset Allocation Schedule. If, at the conclusion of the
foregoing procedures, the Parties are not able to resolve the disagreements
set forth in any Asset Allocation Dispute Notice, then each of the Parties
shall be entitled to allocate, with respect to the Acquired Assets to which
such Asset Allocation Dispute Notice relates, the portion of the Purchase
Price allocated to such assets pursuant to Section 2.6(a) and Section 2.6(b)
in any manner it so determines in its sole discretion and neither shall have
any obligation to the other with respect to any such allocation. (c) Deemed
Allocation. The amount received or paid by Parent, Vectron, the Designated
Seller or any other designee of Vectron pursuant to Section 2.5, net of the
amount allocated pursuant to Section 2.2(b), shall be deemed to have been
received or paid, as the case may be, by such Person on behalf of the Equity
Seller and the applicable Asset Sellers in accordance with the allocation of
the Purchase Price (whether reflected in the Final Allocation Schedule or in
the allocation by Vectron in its discretion). Article III REPRESENTATIONS

Vectron. The following representations and warranties by Parent and Vectron
are qualified in their entirety by reference to the disclosures set forth in

prior to the date hereof an accurate and complete copy of each Governing
Document of the Acquired Company, as in effect as of the date of this

 ![](a2017930exhibit103048.jpg) 

44 OMM_US:75933001.11 as reasonably possible following the date hereof.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing in this
Agreement shall be construed so as to require (i) any Party or its
Subsidiaries or other Affiliates to commit to or effect by consent decree,
hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, licensing or
disposition of any assets or businesses of such Party or its Subsidiaries or
other Affiliates (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, following the

product lines or assets of Buyer or its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, following the Closing, the Acquired
Company or the Acquired Assets). (c) Cooperation. With respect to any
matters related to compliance with Competition Laws, each Party shall (i)
promptly inform the other Party of any substantive or otherwise material
communication from any Governmental Entity regarding any of the transactions

challenges the transactions contemplated hereby or (b) any notice or other
communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or
may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this

intercompany accounts involving Parent, Vectron, the Equity Seller or any
Affiliate thereof, on the one hand, and the Acquired Company or any Asset
Seller (with respect to any Acquired Assets), on the other hand, to be fully
settled and discharged (through payment, dividend, capitalization or
otherwise), and in the event such settlement and discharge has not occurred,
Parent and Vectron shall indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified
Parties with respect thereto. Buyer shall not assume, and the Acquired
Company shall not retain, any Liability with respect to any such intercompany
accounts. On or  

  

 ![](a2017930exhibit103049.jpg) 

45 OMM_US:75933001.11 prior to the Closing Date, Vectron shall use
reasonable best efforts cause to be terminated and cancelled all indemnity
obligations from the Acquired Company or an Asset Seller (with respect to any
Acquired Assets), on the one hand, to Parent, Vectron, the Equity Seller or
any Affiliate thereof, on the other hand, and shall cause to be released any
Liens on any assets of the Acquired Company or on any Acquired Assets to the
extent such Liens secure any Indebtedness of Parent, Vectron or their
respective Affiliates (other than the Acquired Company and the Asset Sellers),
and in the event such release has not occurred, Parent and Vectron shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified Parties with respect
thereto. Section 4.7 Guaranties. Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause Parent and its Affiliates to be fully and irrevocably

Proceeding, offer or grant any accommodation or undertake any obligation or
Liability (in each case financial or otherwise) to any third party. Article V
ADDITIONAL COVENANTS Section 5.1 Tax Matters. (a) Liability for Taxes. (i)
If the Closing occurs, Parent and Vectron shall be jointly and severally
liable for and pay (A) Taxes imposed on the Acquired Company for any taxable
year or period that ends on or before the Closing Date and, with respect to
any Straddle Period, the portion of such Straddle Period ending on and
including the Closing Date and (B) Taxes imposed on the Acquired Company
pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or similar provision of
state, local or foreign Law solely as a result of the Acquired Company having
been a member of a Consolidated Tax Group; provided, however, that Parent and
Vectron shall not be liable for or pay, and shall not indemnify Buyer from
and against, (x) any Taxes to the extent of the amount taken into account in
the determination of Closing Date Working Capital, (y) any Taxes that result
from any actual or the deemed election of Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer, or
from Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer engaging in any activity or transaction,
in either case that would cause the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to be treated as a purchase or sale of assets of the Acquired
Company for Tax purposes and (z) any Taxes imposed on the Acquired Company as
a result of transactions occurring on the Closing Date that are properly
allocable to the portion of the Closing Date after the Closing (Taxes
described in this proviso, the "Excluded Taxes"). (ii) Vectron shall be
entitled to any refund of (or credit against) Taxes for which it is liable
under this Agreement (other than to the extent such refunds  

  

 ![](a2017930exhibit103050.jpg) 

46 OMM_US:75933001.11 or credits are taken into account in the determination
of Closing Date Working Capital), or otherwise related to the activities of
the Acquired Business and allocable to any taxable year or period that ends
on or before the Closing Date and, with respect to any Straddle Period, the
portion of such Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date.
(iii) For the avoidance of doubt, Parent and Vectron shall not be liable for
or pay (A) any Taxes imposed on the Acquired Company for any taxable year or
period that begins after the Closing Date and, with respect to any Straddle
Period, the portion of such Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date
(other than any Taxes arising as a result of a breach of any representation or
warranty set forth in Section 3.1(g)(iv)) or (B) any Excluded Taxes. (iv)
Real and personal property taxes, ad valorem taxes, and franchise fees or
taxes (that are imposed on a periodic basis (as opposed to a net income
basis)) with respect to the Acquired Assets ("Periodic Taxes") shall be
prorated between Parent and Vectron, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other
hand, for any taxable period that includes but does not end on the Closing
Date. Periodic Taxes shall be prorated between Buyer, on the one hand, and
Vectron and Parent, on the other hand, based on the relative periods the
Acquired Assets were owned by each respective Party (or its Affiliates)
during the fiscal period of the taxing jurisdiction for which such taxes were
imposed by such jurisdiction (as such fiscal period is or may be reflected on
the bill rendered by such taxing jurisdiction). Buyer, Parent or Vectron
shall promptly forward an invoice to the other party for its reimbursable pro
rata share, if any, of Periodic Taxes. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer
shall be liable for any German real estate transfer Taxes. (v) For purposes
of Sections 5.1(a)(i), 5.1(a)(ii) and 5.1(a)(iii) whenever it is necessary to
determine the Liability for Taxes of the Acquired Company for the portion of
a Straddle Period that ends on or before the Closing Date, and the portion of
a Straddle Period that begins after the Closing Date, the determination shall
be made by assuming that such Straddle Period consisted of two (2) taxable
years or periods, one which ended at the close of the Closing Date and the
other which began at the beginning of the day following the Closing Date, and
items of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit for the Straddle Period shall
be allocated between such two (2) taxable years or periods on a "closing of
the books basis" by assuming that the books of the Acquired Company were
closed at the close of the Closing Date; provided, however, that (A)
transactions occurring on the Closing Date that are properly allocable to the
portion of the Closing Date after the Closing shall be allocated to the
taxable year or period that is deemed to begin at the beginning of the day
following the Closing Date, and (B) exemptions, allowances or deductions that
are calculated on an annual basis, such as property Taxes and depreciation
deductions, shall be apportioned between such two (2) taxable years or
periods on a daily basis. (vi) Parent and Vectron, on the one hand, and Buyer
on the other hand, will each be liable for fifty percent (50%) of all real
property transfer or gains  

  

 ![](a2017930exhibit103051.jpg) 

47 OMM_US:75933001.11 Tax, sales Tax, use Tax, stamp Tax, stock transfer Tax
or other similar Tax imposed on the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be borne by the Party required to pay such Tax under
applicable Law. Parent, Vectron and Buyer will cooperate in the execution and
delivery of all instruments and certificates necessary to comply with any
filing requirements for such Taxes. (vii) Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, Parent, Vectron and Buyer agree that Parent and
Vectron make no representation, warranty, and provide no other assurance or
indemnification, with respect to the amount of any Tax Attributes of the
Acquired Company or the Acquired Assets, or with respect to the availability
on and after the Closing Date of any Tax Attributes of the Acquired Company
or the Acquired Assets. Parent and Vectron shall have no Liability for any
Taxes resulting from or arising with respect to any sale of the Acquired
Company (or any assets thereof) or the Acquired Assets following the Closing.
(b) Tax Returns. (i) Vectron shall timely file or cause to be timely filed
when due (taking into account all extensions properly obtained) (x) all Tax
Returns that are required to be filed with respect to the Acquired Company on
a combined, consolidated or unitary basis by Vectron or any Affiliate thereof
(other than the Acquired Company), and (y) all Tax Returns that are required
to be filed by the Acquired Company (taking into account all extensions
properly obtained) on or prior to the Closing Date. In each case, Vectron
shall remit or cause to be remitted any Taxes due in respect of such Tax
Returns. Vectron shall provide any such non-consolidated Tax Returns to Buyer
for Buyer's review and comment at least ten (10) days prior to the due date
for such Tax Returns. Buyer shall cause to be timely filed when due (taking
into account all extensions properly obtained) all Tax Returns that are
required to be filed by the Acquired Company after the Closing Date and Buyer
shall remit or cause to be remitted any Taxes due in respect of such Tax
Returns; provided that Vectron shall pay to Buyer the amount of any such
Taxes of any taxable year or period ending on or prior to the Closing Date or
the portion of any Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date
to the extent Vectron is liable for such Taxes pursuant to Section 5.1(a)(i).
(ii) All Tax Returns of the Acquired Company that Buyer is required to cause
to be filed in accordance with this Section 5.1(b) that relate to any taxable
year or period ending on or before the Closing Date or, with respect to any
non-income Tax Returns, any Straddle Period shall be prepared and filed in a
manner consistent with past practice and, on such Tax Returns, no position
shall be taken, election made or method adopted that is inconsistent with
positions taken, elections made or methods used in preparing and filing
similar Tax Returns in prior periods unless a deviation from past practice is
required by mandatory law or Vectron has given its consent (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to the respective deviation
from past practice. With respect to any such Tax Return of the Acquired
Company that relates to any  

  

 ![](a2017930exhibit103052.jpg) 

48 OMM_US:75933001.11 taxable year or period ending on or before the Closing
Date or any Straddle Period other than monthly self-assessments of the
Acquired Company with respect to value added tax and wage tax, not less than
thirty (30) days prior to the due date for such Tax Return, taking into
account extensions (or, if such due date is within thirty (30) days following
the Closing Date, as promptly as practicable following the Closing Date),
Buyer shall provide Vectron with a draft copy of such Tax Return for
Vectron's approval that must not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. Solely with respect to Tax Returns for value added tax and wage tax,
Buyer shall cause the Acquired Company (x) to amend the draft Tax Return in
accordance with the written instructions of Vectron, provided that such
instructions of Vectron relate to any taxable year or period ending on or
before the Closing Date or the portion of any Straddle Period ending on and
including the portion of the Closing Date until the Closing and comply with
applicable laws, and (y) to timely file the Tax Return in such amended form
when due (taking into account all extensions properly obtained). (iii) None
of Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer shall (or shall cause or permit the
Acquired Company to) make or change any Tax election or amend, refile or
otherwise modify (or grant an extension of any statute of limitation with
respect to) any Tax Return of the Acquired Company with respect to any taxable
year or period ending on or before the Closing Date without the prior written
consent of Vectron, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
(c) Contest Provisions. (i) Buyer shall promptly notify Vectron in writing
upon receipt by Buyer or any of its Affiliates of notice of any pending or
threatened federal, state, local or foreign Tax audits or assessments
relating to any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date or any
Straddle Period or relating to a Tax for which Vectron may be Liable pursuant
to this Agreement. (ii) Vectron shall have the sole right to represent the
Acquired Company's interests in any Tax Proceeding relating to a taxable year
ending on or before the Closing Date relating to a Tax for which Vectron
would be liable pursuant to this Agreement, and to employ counsel of
Vectron's choice at Vectron's expense; provided, however, that, except to the
extent related to any combined, consolidated or unitary Tax Return, Buyer and
its representatives shall be permitted, at Buyer's expense, to be present at,
and participate in, any such Proceeding. Neither Buyer nor any Affiliate of
Buyer shall be entitled to settle, either administratively or after the
commencement of a Proceeding, any claim for Taxes which could adversely
affect the Liability for Taxes relating to any taxable year or period ending
on or before the Closing Date or relating to a Tax for which Vectron would be
liable pursuant to this Agreement without the prior written consent of
Vectron, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Vectron may
discharge at any time its indemnification obligation under this Section 5.1
by paying Buyer the amount payable pursuant to this Section 5.1, calculated
on the date of such payment.  

  

 ![](a2017930exhibit103053.jpg) 

49 OMM_US:75933001.11 (d) Assistance and Cooperation. After the Closing
Date, each of Vectron and Buyer shall (and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to): (i) timely sign and deliver such certificates or forms as may
be necessary or appropriate to establish an exemption from (or otherwise
reduce), or file Tax Returns or other reports with respect to, Taxes
described in Section 5.1(a)(iv) (relating to sales, transfer and similar
Taxes); (ii) assist the other Party in preparing any Tax Returns which such
other Party is responsible for preparing and filing in accordance with
Section 5.1(b), and in connection therewith, provide the other Party with any
necessary powers of attorney; (iii) cooperate fully in preparing for and
defending any audits of, or disputes with taxing authorities regarding, any
Tax Returns of the Acquired Company and any Tax Returns related to any of the
activities of the Acquired Company, including the issuing of power of
attorney forms when necessary; (iv) make available to the other and to any
taxing authority as reasonably requested all information, records and
documents relating to Taxes of the Acquired Company or otherwise related to
the activities of the Acquired Business; and (v) furnish the other with
copies of all correspondence received from any taxing authority in connection
with any Tax audit or information request relating to Taxes for which the
other may be liable. (e) Entity Classification Election. Buyer acknowledges
that Vectron intends, prior to Closing Date, to elect pursuant to Treas. Reg.
Section 301.7701-3 to have the Acquired Company treated as an entity that is
disregarded as separate from its owner for U.S. federal income Tax purposes.
Section 5.2 Employee Matters. (a) Transferred Employees. (i) Buyer shall
determine, in its sole discretion, the Current Employees who are employed by
an Asset Seller as of the date hereof (collectively, the "Asset Employees")
to whom Buyer or one of its Affiliates will not offer employment, such
determination to be made and communicated to the Asset Sellers no later than
November 7, 2017. Buyer shall make offers of employment to all other Asset
Employees, which shall be effective as of, and contingent upon, the Closing
(except as otherwise provided in a Transition Services Agreement), and may
provide, as determined by Buyer in its sole discretion and to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, that any or all such employment relationships
shall be terminable "at-will" by Buyer (or one of its Affiliates) or the
applicable employee. As of the Closing (except as otherwise provided in a
Transition Services Agreement) and in accordance with all  

  

 ![](a2017930exhibit103054.jpg) 

50 OMM_US:75933001.11 applicable Laws, Vectron and its Affiliates shall
terminate the employment of all Asset Employees to whom Buyer or one of its
Affiliates has not offered employment pursuant to this Section 5.2(a).
Vectron and its Affiliates shall cooperate with and use their commercially
reasonable efforts to assist Buyer in its efforts to secure employment
arrangements satisfactory to Buyer with those Asset Employees to whom Buyer
or any of its Affiliates makes an offer of employment. The offers of
employment for each such Asset Employee will supersede any prior agreements
regarding the terms and conditions of employment between such Asset Employee
and the applicable Asset Seller as in effect prior to the Closing (or such
later date as provided in a Transition Services Agreement), and the Asset
Sellers hereby waive any and all non-competition, non-solicitation,
confidentiality and similar contractual provisions or agreements to the
extent they would otherwise apply to the employment of any Transferred
Employee by Buyer, effective as of the date of any such hiring; provided,
that in no event shall any prior agreement with respect to Intellectual
Property be superseded with respect to any activities prior to the Closing
Date, except that all Asset Employees shall be permitted to disclose to Buyer
and its Affiliates all information in their possession or otherwise known by
them which is related to the Acquired Business. Asset Employees who accept
such an offer of employment from Buyer or one of its Affiliates and who
actually commence employment with Buyer or one of its Affiliates immediately
after the Closing, and all of the employees of the Acquired Company as of the
Closing shall collectively be referred to as the "Transferred Employees."
(ii) For a period commencing on the Closing Date and ending no earlier than
the one-year anniversary of the Closing Date (or, if earlier, the termination
of the Transferred Employee's employment), Buyer (or an Affiliate of Buyer)
shall provide the Asset Employees who become Transferred Employees with
employee benefits that are substantially comparable to the benefits provided
by Buyer and its Affiliates to their similarly situated employees. Subject to
applicable law and the consent of any applicable insurance provider, all
compensation and benefit plans and programs established or maintained by Buyer
or one of its Affiliates in which a Transferred Employee participates shall
recognize such Transferred Employee's service with the Asset Sellers or the
Acquired Company (or their respective predecessors), as the case may be, for
purposes of eligibility, vesting and level of vacation, severance and similar
benefits, to the same extent as recognized by Vectron and its Affiliates for
purposes of the corresponding Benefit Plan as of the Closing Date; provided
that such recognition of service shall not apply for purposes of pension
benefit accrual or result in the duplication of benefits. (b) Employee
Benefit Plans Generally. As of the Closing Date, except as otherwise set
forth in the Transition Services Agreement, the Acquired Company shall
terminate its participation in each Benefit Plan that is not an Assumed
Benefit Plan, and in no event shall any Transferred Employee be entitled to
accrue any benefits under such Benefit Plans with respect to services
rendered or compensation paid on or after the Closing Date, provided that to
the extent a Transferred Employee participates in a Benefit  

  

 ![](a2017930exhibit103055.jpg) 

51 OMM_US:75933001.11 Plan that provides a bonus opportunity for 2017, Buyer
and its Affiliates will pay to the Transferred Employee a pro-rated bonus
under such plan following the Closing at such time as Buyer pays year-end
bonuses in the ordinary course for the portion of 2017 that has elapsed as of
the Closing Date. Buyer (or an Affiliate) and the Acquired Company shall
retain or assume all rights and obligations under each Assumed Benefit Plan,
whether arising prior to, on or after the Closing Date, including all assets
of such plan. Neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates will contribute to or
assume sponsorship of, or have any other liability with respect to, any
Retained Benefit Plan or other compensation or benefit plan or agreement of
Vectron or its Affiliates (other than the Assumed Benefit Plans). (c)
Severance Benefits. Vectron and its Affiliates shall be responsible for, and
shall pay or cause to be paid, any claim for separation costs, severance pay
or other termination benefits in accordance with the terms and conditions of
any applicable plans, agreements or policies, which claims arise out of or
result from any termination of employment with Vectron or any of its
Affiliates of any current or former employee of Vectron or any of its
Affiliates; provided, however, that Buyer shall instead be responsible for
and reimburse, indemnify and hold harmless the Vectron Indemnified Parties
from (i) all severance pay and benefits and all termination costs and
liabilities (excluding payment for accrued base compensation and vacation
through the termination date, which shall be paid by Vectron and its
Affiliates) as to any Asset Employee identified on Schedule 3.1(q)(i) who is
not offered employment by Buyer or one of its Affiliates as contemplated by
Section 5.2(a) and whose employment is terminated by Vectron or one of its
Affiliates on or before the Closing (except to the extent that such
termination is required to occur following the Closing pursuant to Law or
contract) and (ii) to the extent such terminations result in obligations or
liabilities under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of
1988 or any similar state, local or other Law or result from claims of
violations of Law as a result of Buyer's hiring or other decisions, the
payment of such obligations and liabilities. Any severance benefits payable
by Buyer to an Asset Employee pursuant to the foregoing clause (i) shall be
determined in accordance with the severance plan or employment agreement that
is applicable to such Asset Employee (each of which severance plans and
employment agreements is set forth on Schedule 5.2(c) and has been provided
to Buyer prior to the hereof) or any applicable Law. In addition, Buyer shall
be responsible for, and shall pay or cause to be paid, any claim for

Insurance. From and after the Closing, the Acquired Company shall cease to be
insured by Vectron's (or any of its Affiliates' (other than the Acquired

rights to control such insurance policies and self- insurance programs,
including the right to exhaust, settle, release, commute, buy back or
otherwise resolve disputes with respect to any of its insurance policies and
self-insurance programs. The Parties acknowledge that the Acquired Company
and the Acquired Business may be entitled to the benefit of coverage under
the insurance policies made available through Vectron as described on
Schedule 5.5 to the extent such policies are in existence at the Closing (the
"Retained Policies"), in each case with respect to acts, facts, circumstances
or omissions occurring prior to the Closing ("Pre-Closing Occurrences"). For
a period of twenty (20) months after the Closing, Buyer may report to Vectron
any and all Pre-Closing Occurrences arising in connection with the Acquired
Company or the Acquired Business to the applicable insurance providers to the
extent permitted under the Retained Policies as in effect as of the date
hereof ("Retained Policy Claims"). Vectron shall consider in good faith such
Retained Policy Claims, and if in the good faith judgment of Vectron the
submission of such Retained Policy Claims would not be materially harmful to
Vectron or its subsidiaries or their businesses, Vectron shall submit such
Retained Policy Claims to the insurer; provided that Buyer agrees to reimburse
Vectron promptly upon request for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs or
expenses incurred by Vectron or any Affiliate of Vectron in connection with
making or pursuing any claim pursuant to this Section 5.5, including the
costs of filing a claim and any deductibles that are or become payable by
such other party or any Affiliate of such other party under the applicable  

  

 ![](a2017930exhibit103059.jpg) 

55 OMM_US:75933001.11 policies or self-insurance programs as a direct result
of claims made pursuant to this Section 5.5 (such costs and expenses referred
to in this clause (b), "Recovery Costs"). With respect to Pre- Closing
Occurrences, Vectron (with respect to the Retained Policies) shall be under no
obligation to continue to maintain such Retained Policies if Vectron
determines in good faith that the interests of Vectron, its subsidiaries and
its businesses would be better served by not continuing such policies.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.5 to the contrary, this Section 5.5
shall be subject in all respects to the terms of Vectron's insurance policies
as of the date hereof, and to the extent such insurance policies do not
permit any of the matters described in this Section 5.5, then Vectron shall
be under no obligation to Buyer with respect to such matters. Section 5.6
Further Assurances. From time to time after the Closing Date and without
further consideration, (a) upon the request of any Party, the other Parties
shall execute and deliver to the requesting Party such documents and take
such actions as the requesting Party reasonably requests to consummate more

any Designated Purchaser's title to the Acquired Shares and the Acquired
Assets, to put Buyer or a Designated Purchaser in actual possession and

respective Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly (whether by itself,
through an Affiliate or in partnership or conjunction with, or as a member,
owner, consultant or agent of, any other Person): (i) for a period of three
(3) years following the Closing Date, undertake, participate or carry on or
be engaged in, or in any other manner advise or knowingly assist any other

(including the Acquired Company) or otherwise hire, employ, engage or
contract with any Transferred Employee, to perform services other than for
the benefit of Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Acquired Company). (b)
Notwithstanding Section 5.7(a), Parent, Vectron and their respective
Affiliates shall not be prohibited from or restricted in any way with respect
to: (i) advertising job openings by use of newspapers, magazines, the
Internet and other media not directed at individual Transferred Employees, or
hiring any such Transferred Employees or other Persons as a result thereof,

employment with Buyer, the Acquired Company or any Affiliate thereof, so long
as there was no solicitation by Parent, Vectron or any of their respective
Affiliates prior thereto, (iii) holding not more than two percent (2%) of a
class of stock of a publicly-held corporation which is traded on a national
securities exchange or in the over-the-counter market, so long as Parent,
Vectron or such Affiliate, as applicable, with such ownership interest does
not have any participation in the business or management of such entity or
(iv) acquiring, and following such acquisition engaging in any business that
has a Subsidiary, division, group, franchise or segment that is engaged in
any Competing Business Activity, so long as for the most recent fiscal year
ending prior to the date of such acquisition, the revenues derived from the
Competing Business Activities were less than seven and one-half percent
(7.5%) of the total consolidated revenues of such business. (c) As a
material inducement to Parent and Vectron to enter into this Agreement, Buyer
agrees that it shall not, and shall cause each of its Affiliates not to,

partnership or conjunction with, or as a member, owner, consultant or agent
of, any other Person) for a period of three (3) years following the Closing
Date, solicit, entice, encourage or influence, or attempt to solicit, entice,
encourage or influence, any of the Persons identified on Schedule 5.7(c) to
resign or otherwise leave the employ of Parent, Vectron or any of their
respective Affiliates or otherwise hire, employ, engage or contract with any
such Person identified on Schedule 5.7(c) to perform services; provided,
however, that Buyer and its Affiliates shall not be prohibited from or
restricted in any way with respect to: (i) advertising job openings by use of
newspapers, magazines, the Internet and other media not directed at any such
Person identified on Schedule 5.7(c) or hiring any such Person identified on
Schedule 5.7(c) as a result thereof or (ii) hiring or soliciting any such
Person who has terminated employment with Parent, Vectron or any Affiliate
thereof, so long as there was no solicitation by Buyer or its Affiliates prior
thereto. (d) If any court of competent jurisdiction will, at any time, deem
the term of any particular restrictive covenant contained in this Section 5.7
too lengthy, the geographic area covered too extensive or the scope too
broad, the other provisions of this Section 5.7 will nevertheless stand, and
the covenant, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, will be
deemed reformed such that the term will be deemed to be  

  

 ![](a2017930exhibit103061.jpg) 

57 OMM_US:75933001.11 the longest period permissible by applicable Law under
the circumstances, the geographic area covered will be deemed to comprise the
largest territory permissible by applicable Law under the circumstances and
the scope will be as broad as permissible by applicable Law under the
circumstances. The court of competent jurisdiction in each case will reduce
the term, geographic area and/or scope covered to permissible duration, size
or breadth. (e) Each of Parent and Vectron represents that it is familiar
with the covenants not to compete and not to solicit contained herein and is
fully aware of its obligations hereunder. Each of Parent and Vectron further
agrees that the length of time, scope and geographic coverage is reasonable
given the benefits it has received hereunder. Each of Parent Vectron further
acknowledges and agrees that the covenants set forth in this Section 5.7 are
necessary for the protection of Buyer's business interests, including the
goodwill and confidential information being transferred by reason of the
Transaction, that irreparable injury will result to Buyer if Parent, Vectron
or any of their respective Affiliates breaches any of the terms of this
Section 5.7, and that in the event of an actual or threatened breach by
Parent, Vectron or any of their respective Affiliates of any of the
provisions contained in this Section 5.7, Buyer will have no adequate remedy
at Law. Each of Parent and Vectron accordingly agrees that in the event of
any actual or threatened breach by Parent, Vectron or any of their respective
Affiliates of any of the provisions contained in this Section 5.7, Buyer will
be entitled to injunctive and other equitable relief. Nothing contained
herein will be construed as prohibiting Buyer or any of its Affiliates from
pursuing any other remedies available to it for such breach or threatened
breach, including the recovery of any damages that it is able to prove.
Section 5.8 Exclusive Dealing. During the period from the date of this
Agreement through the earlier of the Closing or the termination of this

attorneys, accountants or other agents or representatives not to, take any
action to solicit, encourage, initiate, engage in or continue discussions,
negotiations or other communications with, provide any information to or
otherwise cooperate in any way with, or accept any proposal or offer from, or
enter into any agreement with any Person (other than Buyer and/or its
Affiliates) concerning (a) any direct or indirect purchase, transfer or
issuance of the Acquired Company's equity securities, (b) any merger,

Procedures Relating to Indemnification Between the Parties. Following the
discovery of any facts or conditions that could reasonably be expected to give
rise to a Loss or Losses for which indemnification under this Article IX can
be obtained, the Party seeking indemnification under this Article IX (the
"Indemnified Party") shall promptly provide written notice to the Party from
whom indemnification is sought (the "Indemnifying Party"), setting forth the
specific facts and circumstances, in reasonable detail (to the extent known),
relating to such Loss or Losses, the amount of Loss or Losses (or a non-
binding, reasonable estimate thereof if the actual amount is not known or not
capable of reasonable calculation) and the specific Section(s) of this
Agreement upon which the Indemnified Party is relying in seeking such
indemnification (an "Indemnification Notice"); provided, however, that any
failure of an Indemnified Party to timely deliver such notice shall not limit
the obligations of the Indemnifying Party hereunder except to the extent that
(and only to the extent that) the Indemnifying Party shall have been actually
and materially prejudiced as a result of such failure.  

  

 ![](a2017930exhibit103069.jpg) 

65 OMM_US:75933001.11 If any Party asserts a claim for indemnification
against any other Party for any Losses pursuant to this Section 9.3, the
Parties shall attempt to resolve such claim through good faith negotiations
between them and, if not resolved through negotiations, such dispute shall be
resolved in accordance with Article XI. Section 9.4 Procedures Relating to
Indemnification for Third Party Claims. (a) Notice. In order for an
Indemnified Party to be entitled to any indemnification provided for under
this Article IX arising out of or involving a claim or demand made by any
third party, including any Governmental Entity (a "Third Party Claim"), the
Indemnified Party must provide an Indemnification Notice to the Indemnifying
Party relating to the Third Party Claim as soon as practicable after the
Indemnified Party's receipt of notice of the Third Party Claim, but in no
event later than fifteen (15) Business Days thereafter; provided, however,
that any failure of an Indemnified Party to promptly deliver such notice
shall not limit the obligations of the Indemnifying Party hereunder except to
the extent that (and only to the extent that) the Indemnifying Party shall
have been actually and materially prejudiced as a result of such failure.
Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party,
promptly after the Indemnified Party's receipt thereof, copies of all notices
and documents, including all court papers, received by the Indemnified Party
relating to the Third Party Claim, except to the extent such delivery does
not affect any privilege relating to the Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, any claim or demand made by a third party relating to a Tax
for which Vectron may be Liable pursuant to this Agreement shall be governed
by Section 5.1(c). (b) Defense. (i) If a Third Party Claim is made against
the Indemnified Party, then the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to
participate in the defense thereof at the Indemnifying Party's expense and,
if the Indemnifying Party so chooses (in its sole discretion), to assume the
defense thereof with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party, unless (A)
the Indemnifying Party is also a party to such Proceeding and, in the
reasonable opinion of counsel to such Indemnified Party, joint representation
would result in a legal conflict of interest or require the assertion of
conflicting defenses or counterclaims, (B) the Indemnifying Party has failed
and is failing to vigorously defend such Third Party Claim, (C) the Third
Party Claim is reasonably likely to involve monetary liability of the
Indemnified Party in excess of the applicable limitation set forth in Section
9.1 to such claim or (D) the Third Party Claim alleges a violation of Law by,
or would involve injunctive or equitable relief against, an Indemnified
Party). (ii) If the Indemnifying Party so elects to assume the defense of a
Third Party Claim, then (A) the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the
Indemnified Party for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel subsequently
incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof and
(B) the Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense
thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel  

  

 ![](a2017930exhibit103070.jpg) 

66 OMM_US:75933001.11 by the Indemnifying Party, it being understood,
however, that the Indemnifying Party shall control such defense in all
respects. If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend any Third Party Claim,
then the Parties shall cooperate in all reasonable respects in the defense
and/or settlement of such Third Party Claim, which cooperation shall include
the retention and (upon the Indemnifying Party's request) the provision
(subject to Section 4.3) to the Indemnifying Party of records that are
reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim and making employees available
on a mutually convenient basis as may be reasonably necessary for the
preparation of the defense of such Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party
shall not consent to a settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising
from, any Third Party Claim without the consent of the Indemnified Party
unless such settlement (x) is solely for money damages and the Indemnifying
Party agrees to pay all such money damages, (y) does not involve any finding
or admission by any Indemnified Party of any violation of Law or Order or
other wrongdoing by any Indemnified Party and (z) contains a complete and
unconditional release of the Indemnified Party of all Liability with respect
to any such Proceeding. If the Indemnifying Party, within thirty (30) days
after receipt of an Indemnification Notice relating to a Third Party Claim,
chooses not to or does not assume the defense of a Third Party Claim or fails
to defend such Third Party Claim actively and in good faith, then the
Indemnified Party shall (upon further notice to the Indemnifying Party) have
the right to defend, compromise or settle such Third Party Claim or consent
to the entry of judgment with respect to such Third Party Claim at the
expense of the Indemnifying Party; provided, however, that the Indemnified
Party shall not compromise or settle such Third Party Claim or consent to the
entry of judgment with respect to such Third Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Section 9.5 Environmental
Matters. Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 9.3 and 9.4, the
following shall apply to any indemnification claims asserted by a Buyer
Indemnified Party relating to Pre-Closing Environmental Matters or any
alleged breach of the representations and warranties set forth in Section
3.1(l) (collectively, "Environmental Matters"): (a) To the extent that Losses
for Environmental Matters for which Parent and Vectron would otherwise be
obligated to indemnify a Buyer Indemnified Party under this Agreement are
increased as a result of any action of Buyer or any Buyer Indemnified Party
(including the Acquired Company), or any employee, agent, contractor, tenant,
lessee, sublessee, licensee, permittee or invitee of any of the foregoing
(other than the perpetuation or continuation of any pattern or practice of
the Acquired Business that was being undertaken prior to the Closing), after
the Closing, then Parent and Vectron shall not be liable for the amount of
such increase except to the extent such increase is caused by excavation,
construction or renovation on any Acquired Real Property (consistent with
commercially reasonable practices) including if and as required to perform
utility maintenance, to construct and/or repair building foundations or other
improvements, renovations or expansions, or to perform other subsurface work
reasonably necessary to sustain or expand the ongoing operations on the
Acquired Real Property, in which case Parent and Vectron shall be liable to
such extent.  

  

 ![](a2017930exhibit103071.jpg) 

67 OMM_US:75933001.11 (b) With respect to the Existing Environmental
Matters, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Acquired Company to, cooperate with
respect to any ongoing monitoring activities, including allowing the party
responsible to complete the ongoing remedial activity and the relevant
Governmental Entity continued access to the relevant Acquired Real Property
at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice, and without unreasonable
interference with business operations; provided, however, that neither Buyer
nor the Acquired Company after the Closing Date shall be required to incur
any costs related to such cooperation and access. (c) Parent and Vectron
shall have the right to defend and control any indemnity claim relating to an
Environmental Matter, except for Environmental Matters relating to violations
of Environmental Laws alleged by a Governmental Entity against the Acquired
Company, including the disclosure, investigation, negotiation, performance
and settlement thereof; provided, however, that Parent and Vectron shall: (i)
keep Buyer reasonably informed relating to the progress of such claim
(including providing Buyer with the opportunity to participate in any
meetings (whether in person or telephonic) with Governmental Entities) and
provide reasonable opportunity for Buyer to comment on any proposed
activities (including any written communications with Governmental Entities)
relating to such Environmental Matter (and Parent and Vectron shall consider
in good faith any reasonable comments of Buyer); (ii) select counsel,
contractors and consultants of recognized standing and competence in
connection with such Environmental Matter; (iii) diligently and promptly
pursue the resolution thereof; and (iv) not prevent or interfere with the
ordinary course operations of the Acquired Business or the Acquired Company
or with any continuing use of any Acquired Real Property; provided that in the
event Parent's and Vectron's proposed resolution of an Environmental Matter
would reasonably be expected to have a material impact on the ongoing
operations of the Acquired Business, Parent's and Vectron's defense and
control of such Environmental Matter, including the disclosure,
investigation, negotiation, performance and settlement thereof, shall be
subject to Buyer's participation and consent. (d) Any obligation of Parent or
Vectron to undertake remedial action in respect of any Environmental Matter,
including at any Acquired Real Property, shall be limited to, and their
respective obligations under this Agreement shall be satisfied upon,
completion of remedial action sufficient to achieve commercial/industrial
cleanup standards under applicable Environmental Laws as in effect at the
time such Environmental Matter is addressed and, if applicable, by any Order
or requirement of the relevant Governmental Entity, or, for any Leased Real
Property, required to address the reasonable demands of the landlord based on
the terms of any applicable lease agreement in effect as of the Closing Date.
Neither Parent nor Vectron shall be liable for Losses incurred in connection
with the sale or closure of any Acquired Real Property to the extent
attributable to any change in use from industrial/commercial use. Section 9.6
Determination of Indemnification Amounts. (a) Without limiting the effect of
any other limitation contained in this Article IX, for purposes of computing
the amount of any and all Losses recoverable under this Article IX, there
shall be deducted an amount equal to the amount of any  

  

 ![](a2017930exhibit103072.jpg) 

68 OMM_US:75933001.11 insurance proceeds, indemnification payments,
contribution payments or reimbursements actually received (net of costs of
enforcement, deductibles and retro-premium adjustments) by the Indemnified
Party or any of its Affiliates in connection with such Losses or any of the
circumstances giving rise thereto and less the present value of all insurance
policy premium increases reasonably anticipated to result therefrom in the
three (3) years following the Closing and any costs incurred by the
Indemnified Party in pursuing recovery under such policies (it being
understood that the Indemnified Party and any of its Affiliates shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such proceeds, payments or
reimbursements). (b) The calculation of Losses shall not include losses
arising because of a change after the Closing in applicable Law or accounting
principle. (c) For purposes of computing the amount of any and all Losses
recoverable under this Article IX with respect to the Acquired Company, there
shall be deducted all reductions in federal, state, local and other Taxes
(including estimated Taxes) realized or reasonably expected to be realized by
the Acquired Company, Buyer or any of their other Affiliates as a result of
the event giving rise to such Loss (the "Indemnified Event") in the taxable
year or period of the Indemnified Event and the subsequent two (2) taxable
years or periods. (d) In any case where an Indemnified Party recovers from
third Persons any amount in respect of a matter with respect to which an
Indemnifying Party has indemnified it pursuant to this Article IX, such
Indemnified Party shall promptly pay over to the Indemnifying Party the
amount so recovered (after deducting therefrom the full amount of the
expenses incurred by it in procuring such recovery), but not in excess of the
sum of (i) any amount previously so paid by the Indemnifying Party to or on
behalf of the Indemnified Party in respect of such matter and (ii) any amount
expended by the Indemnifying Party in pursuing or defending any claim arising
out of such matter. (e) No Indemnifying Party shall be required to indemnify
and hold harmless any Indemnified Party for any indemnification claim
pursuant to Section 9.1 or 9.2, as applicable, to the extent such Indemnified
Party is otherwise actually compensated for such claim pursuant to an
adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to Article II. (f) For purposes of
Section 9.1(a), the amount of any Losses associated therewith, shall be
determined without regard for any materiality, material adverse effect or
similar qualification. Section 9.7 Subrogation Rights. Upon making any
payment to an Indemnified Party in respect of any Losses, the Indemnifying
Party shall, to the extent of such payment and to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnified Party against
any third party (including with respect to any amounts already recovered or
potentially recoverable by the Indemnified Party from any other third party)
in respect of the Losses to which such payment relates.  

  

 ![](a2017930exhibit103073.jpg) 

69 OMM_US:75933001.11 Section 9.8 Exclusive Remedy. Except (a) for rights
expressly provided in Section 2.3, Section 2.5, Section 2.6, Section 5.1,
Section 5.7 and Section 11.15, and (b) that each Party shall retain the right
to bring claims based on fraud grounds if any other Party or any of its
respective directors, officers or employees has committed fraud in connection
with this Agreement, the indemnification provisions of this Article IX shall
be the sole and exclusive monetary remedy with respect to the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, for the avoidance
of doubt, any and all claims arising out of or relating to Buyer's
investigation of the Acquired Company, the Acquired Business and the Acquired
Assets, the negotiation and execution of this Agreement by any Party, and the
inaccuracy in or breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement of any Party, regardless of whether such claims arise in contract,
tort, breach of warranty or any other legal or equitable theory. Section 9.9
Purchase Price Adjustment. All indemnification payments made under this
Agreement shall be treated for Tax purposes only as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price. Section 9.10 Special Rule for Fraud. Notwithstanding anything
in this Article IX to the contrary, in the event of fraud, any Party which
suffers Losses by reason thereof shall be entitled to seek recovery therefor
from the other Party without regard to any limitation set forth in this
Agreement (whether temporal limitation, dollar limitation or otherwise).
Article X TERMINATION Section 10.1 General. This Agreement may be
terminated, and the transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned at any
time prior to the Closing, only as follows: (a) by the written agreement of
the Parties; (b) by any Party, upon written notice provided to the other
Party, if the Closing shall not have occurred on or prior to three (3) months
following the date hereof (the "Termination Date") or such other date as the
Parties agree in writing; provided, however, that if on such date, all
conditions set forth in Sections 6.1 and 7.1 have been satisfied (other than
the conditions set forth in Sections 6.1(e), and 7.1(e) and those conditions
that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing), then either Vectron
or Buyer may, in its sole discretion, extend the Termination Date for up to
an additional sixty (60) days by delivery of written notice of such extension
to the other party not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the initial
Termination Date; and provided, further, however, that the right to terminate

whose failure to fulfill any of its obligations under this Agreement has been
the cause of or resulted in the failure of the Closing to occur on or before
such date; (c) by any Party, upon written notice provided to the other
Party, if a Governmental Entity with competent jurisdiction has issued an
Order or taken other final and non-appealable action permanently restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby; provided, however, that the right

(ii) Parent, Vectron or one of their respective Affiliates has breached, or
caused the breach of, its respective representations, warranties, covenants,
agreements or other obligations hereunder in a manner that would reasonably

(30) days following written notification thereof to Parent and Vectron by
Buyer; or (e) by Parent or Vectron, upon written notice provided to Buyer, if
(i) the condition set forth in Section 7.1(e) shall have become incapable of
fulfillment (without regard to the Termination Date) or (ii) Buyer or one of

been cured within thirty (30) days following written notification thereof to
Buyer by Parent or Vectron. Section 10.2 Post-Termination Obligations. To
