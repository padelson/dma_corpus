Section 2.1 _The Merger; Effects of the Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to
the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and
in accordance with the MD REIT Law, at the Effective Time the Company shall be
merged with and into Merger Sub, whereupon the separate existence of the
Company will cease, with Merger Sub surviving the Merger (Merger Sub, as the
surviving entity in the Merger, sometimes being referred to herein as the "
_Surviving Entity_ "), such that following the Merger, the Surviving Entity
will continue as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. The Merger shall have
the effects provided in this Agreement and as specified in the MD REIT Law.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, from
and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall possess all
properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and
Merger Sub, and all of the claims, obligations, liabilities, debts and duties
of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the claims, obligations,
liabilities, debts and duties of the Surviving Entity.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 2.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at the offices of Sullivan and Worcester LLP, One Post Office Square,
Boston, Massachusetts 02109 on a date that is the third (3rd) Business Day
after all the conditions set forth in _Article 8_ (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or valid waiver of such conditions at the Closing)
shall have been satisfied or validly waived by the Party entitled to the
benefit of such condition (subject to applicable Law), or on such other date
and such other time as may be mutually agreed upon by the Parties in writing
(the actual date of Closing being referred to herein, the " _Closing Date_ ").

 



 

Section 2.3 _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date, the Parties shall cause
articles of merger with respect to the Merger (the " _Articles of Merger_ ")
to be duly executed and filed with the Maryland SDAT in accordance with the MD
REIT Law and make any other filings, recordings or publications required to be
made by any Party under the MD REIT Law in connection with the Merger. The
Merger shall become effective at such date and time as the Articles of Merger
are accepted for filing by the Maryland SDAT or on such later date and time
(not to exceed thirty (30) days from the date the Articles of Merger are
accepted for filing by the Maryland SDAT) as shall be agreed to by the Company
and Parent and specified in the Articles of Merger (such date and time the
Merger becomes effective being hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective
Time_ ").

 



 

Section 2.4 _Parent Articles of Amendment_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Parent Charter shall be amended pursuant to Articles of Amendment in the form
of Exhibit C (the " _Parent Articles of Amendment_ ").

 



 

Section 2.5 _Governing Documents_. At the Effective Time, the declaration of
trust and the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the declaration of trust and the bylaws of the
Surviving Entity, until thereafter amended, subject to _Section 7.5_, in
accordance with applicable Law and the applicable provisions of the
declaration of trust and the bylaws of the Surviving Entity.

 



 

Section 2.6 _Trustees and Officers of the Surviving Entity_. The trustees and
officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
trustees and officers of the Surviving Entity immediately after the Effective
Time, each to serve until such time as his or her resignation or removal or
such time as his or her successor shall be duly elected and qualified, in each
case in accordance with the declaration of trust and the bylaws of the
Surviving Entity.

 



 

Section 2.7 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended that, for United States federal
income Tax purposes, the Merger shall qualify as a reorganization under, and
within the meaning of, Section 368(a) of the Code, and that this Agreement be,
and is hereby adopted as, a plan of reorganization for purposes of Sections
354 and 361 of the Code.

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE 3**

 



 

 **TREATMENT OF SECURITIES**

 



 

Section 3.1 _Treatment of Securities_.

 



 

(a) _Treatment_ ___of_ ___Company_ ___Common_ ___Shares_. Subject to _Section_
___3.2(e)_ , _Section_ ___3.3_ and _Section_ ___3.5_ , at the Effective Time,
as a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parties or
any holder of any shares of beneficial interest of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company, each Eligible Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive 1.04 Parent Common
Shares (subject to adjustment as set forth in _Section_ ___3.5_ , _Section_
___6.1(a)(iii)_ and _Section_ ___6.2(a)(iii)_ , as so adjusted, the "
_Exchange_ ___Ratio_ ") for each Company Common Share (the " _Merger_
___Consideration_ "), shall no longer be outstanding, shall be automatically
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each evidence of shares in book-entry
form previously evidencing any Eligible Shares issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Company_ ___Book-Entry_
___Shares_ ") and each certificate previously representing any Eligible Shares
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "
_Company_ ___Certificates_ "), if any, shall thereafter represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration and the right, if any, to receive
pursuant to _Section_ ___3.2(e)_ cash in lieu of fractional shares into which
such Eligible Shares have been converted pursuant to this _Section_ ___3.1(a)_
and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to _Section_ ___3.2(c)_ or
_Section_ ___7.11_.

 



 

(b) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Company Common Share issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is held by any wholly
owned Company Subsidiary, by Parent or by any wholly owned Parent Subsidiary
(such Company Common Shares, collectively, the " _Excluded Shares_ ") shall no
longer be outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled without payment of any
consideration therefor and shall cease to exist.

 



 

(c) _Merger Sub Common Shares of Beneficial Interest_. At the Effective Time,
all of the common shares of beneficial interest of Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as a result of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Parties or any holder
thereof, remain unchanged and continue to remain issued and outstanding as
common shares of beneficial interest of the Surviving Entity, and Parent shall
continue as the sole shareholder of the Surviving Entity owning all of the
common shares of beneficial interest of the Surviving Entity.

 



 

Section 3.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time on the Closing
Date, Parent or Merger Sub shall deposit or shall cause to be deposited with a
nationally recognized financial institution or trust company selected by
Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company to serve as the exchange agent
(the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Eligible Shares,
for exchange in accordance with this Article 3, (i) an aggregate number of
duly authorized, validly issued and fully paid and non-assessable Parent
Common Shares to be issued in uncertificated or book-entry form comprising the
number of Parent

 



      
 

 



 

Common Shares required to be issued pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_, and (ii) an
aggregate amount of cash comprising a good faith estimate of the amount
required to be delivered pursuant to _Section 3.2(e)_. In addition, Parent
shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent, as necessary
from time to time after the Effective Time, any dividends or other
distributions, if any, to which the holders of Eligible Shares may be entitled
pursuant to _Section 3.2(c)_ with both a record and payment date after the
Effective Time and prior to the surrender of such Eligible Shares. Such Parent
Common Shares, cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to
_Section 3.2(e)_ and the amount of any dividends or other distributions
deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to this _Section 3.2(a)_ are
referred to collectively in this Agreement as the " _Exchange Fund_." The
Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than for the purpose
provided for in this Agreement and shall be held in trust for the benefit of
the holders of Eligible Shares, subject to _Section 3.2(f)_. In the event
that the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to make the payments contemplated
by this _Section 3.2_, Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be
deposited, additional funds with the Exchange Agent in an amount sufficient to
make such payments. The cash portion of the Exchange Fund shall be invested by
the Exchange Agent as directed by Parent or the Surviving Entity. Interest and
other income on the Exchange Fund shall be the sole and exclusive property of
Parent and the Surviving Entity and shall be paid to Parent or the Surviving
Entity as Parent directs. No investment of the cash portion of the Exchange
Fund shall relieve Parent, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent from
making the payments required by this _Article 3_, and, following any losses
from any such investment, Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to
the Exchange Agent to the extent necessary to satisfy Parents obligations
hereunder for the benefit of the each holder of record of Eligible Shares at
the Effective Time, which additional funds will be deemed to be part of the
Exchange Fund.

 



 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

 



 

(i) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within five (5)
Business Days thereafter), the Surviving Entity shall cause the Exchange Agent
to mail to each holder of record of Eligible Shares that are evidenced by a
Company Certificate notice advising such holders of the effectiveness of the
Merger, including (A) appropriate transmittal materials specifying that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Company Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of Company Certificates (or affidavits of loss
in lieu of Company Certificates, as provided in _Section 3.6_) to the
Exchange Agent, and (B) instructions for surrendering Company Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu of Company Certificates, as provided in _Section
3.6_) to the Exchange Agent in exchange for the Merger Consideration, cash in
lieu of fractional Parent Common Shares, if any, to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor, and any dividends or other distributions, in each
case, to which such holders are entitled pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement. Payment of the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional
Parent Common Shares, if any, to be issued or paid in consideration therefor
and any dividends or other distributions, in each case to which such holders
are entitled pursuant to the terms of this Agreement with respect to Company
Book-Entry Shares, shall be made promptly following the Effective Time without
any action on the part of the Person in whose name such Company Book-Entry
Shares are registered.

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due
surrender of Eligible Shares, and any Company Certificate or ledger entry
relating to Company Book-Entry Shares formerly representing Company Common
Shares that have been so surrendered shall be cancelled by the Exchange Agent.

 



 

(iii) In the event of a transfer of ownership of certificated Eligible Shares
that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the number of
whole Parent Common Shares that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to
_Section 3.1(a)_, together with an amount (if any) of cash in immediately
available funds or, if no wire transfer instructions are provided, a check,
and in each case, after deducting any required Tax withholdings as provided in
_Section 3.3_ in lieu of fractional shares to be paid upon due surrender of
the Company Certificate pursuant to _Section 3.2(e)_ and any dividends or
other distributions in respect thereof in accordance with _Section 3.2(c)_,
may be issued or paid to such a transferee if the Company Certificate formerly
representing such Eligible Shares is presented to the Exchange Agent,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and
to evidence that any applicable transfer and other similar Taxes have been
paid, in each case, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Exchange Agent and the Surviving Entity. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this _Section 3.2(b)_, each Company Certificate and Company Book-Entry Share
shall be deemed at any time at or after the Effective Time to represent only
the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with this _Article
3_, any amount payable in cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with
_Section 3.2(e)_, and any dividends or other distributions in accordance with
_Section 3.2(c)_, in each case without interest.

 



 

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. Whenever a dividend or
other distribution is authorized by the Parent Board and declared by Parent in
respect of Parent Common Shares, the record date for which is after the
Effective Time, that declaration shall include dividends or other
distributions in respect of all Parent Common Shares issuable pursuant to this
Agreement. With respect to Eligible Shares represented by a Company
Certificate, no dividends or other distributions in respect of Parent Common
Shares shall be paid to any holder of any such Eligible Share until the
Company Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the Company Certificate
as provided in _Section 3.6_) is surrendered for exchange in accordance with
this _Article 3_. Subject to applicable Laws, following such surrender, there
shall be issued or paid to the holder of record of the whole Parent Common
Shares issued in exchange for Eligible Shares in accordance with this _Article
3_, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore
payable with respect to such whole Parent Common Shares and not paid and (ii)
at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable
with respect to such whole Parent Common Shares with a record date after the
Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to surrender.

 



 

(d) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the share transfer books of the Company of the Company Common
Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and
after the Effective Time, the holders of Company Certificates or Company Book-
Entry Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease
to have any rights with respect to such Company Common Shares, except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement or by applicable Law. If, after the

 



       
 

 



 

Effective Time, Company Certificates or Company Book-Entry Shares are
presented to the Surviving Entity for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Agreement.

 



 

(e) _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, no fractional Parent Common Shares shall be issued
upon the conversion of Eligible Shares pursuant to this Agreement. Any holder
of Eligible Shares otherwise entitled to receive a fractional Parent Common
Share but for this _Section 3.2(e)_ shall be entitled to receive, upon
surrender of the applicable Eligible Shares, a cash payment, without interest,
in lieu of any fractional share, in an amount rounded to the nearest whole
cent equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the fractional share
interest (rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) to
which such holder (after taking into account all Company Common Shares held at
the Effective Time by such holder) would otherwise be entitled by (ii) the
average of the closing price on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (" _Nasdaq_ "), as
reported in _The Wall Street Journal_ , for a Parent Common Share for the five
(5) consecutive full trading days ending on the last trading day immediately
preceding the Closing Date. No holder of Eligible Shares shall be entitled by
virtue of the right to receive cash in lieu of fractional Parent Common Shares
described in this _Section 3.2(e)_ to any dividends, voting rights or any
other rights in respect of any fractional Parent Common Share. The payment of
cash in lieu of fractional Parent Common Shares is not a separately bargained-
for consideration and solely represents a mechanical rounding-off of the
fractions in the exchange.

 



 

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to holders of Eligible Shares on the first (1st)
anniversary of the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand,
and any former holders of the Company Common Shares who have not theretofore
complied with this _Article 3_ shall thereafter look only to Parent for
delivery of any Parent Common Shares and any payment of cash and any dividends
and other distributions in respect thereof payable or issuable pursuant to
_Section 3.1(a)_, _Section 3.2(c)_ or _Section 3.2(e)_, in each case,
without any interest thereon and subject to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws.

 



 

(g) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, none of the Surviving Entity, Parent, the Exchange Agent or any
other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Company Common Shares for
any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
that remains undistributed to the holders of Eligible Shares immediately prior
to the time at which the Exchange Fund would otherwise escheat to, or become
property of, any Governmental Authority, shall, to the extent permitted by
Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest
of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

Section 3.3 _Withholding Rights_. Each Person making any payment or vesting
any property pursuant to this Agreement, or otherwise with respect to the
Merger or the other Transactions, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from any amounts or property otherwise paid, distributed or vested (or
portions thereof) as it determines it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment or distribution, or vesting of such
property, under the Code, and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, or any provision of applicable Law. In the case of any noncash
payment or distribution or the vesting of any

 



      
 

 



 

property, the applicable withholding party may collect the amount required to
be withheld by reducing to cash for remittance to the appropriate Governmental
Authority a sufficient portion of the property that the recipient would
otherwise receive or own (or already owns), if the cash portion of any such
payment or distribution is not sufficient to cover the withholding liability,
all on behalf of the recipient Person, and the recipient Person will bear any
brokerage or other costs for this withholding procedure. To the extent that
amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate
Governmental Authority by any Person, such withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been distributed, paid or
otherwise included in income to the Person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made. To the extent shares are reduced to cash to satisfy
any withholding obligation, only a whole number of shares will be reduced to
cash, and the Person in respect of which the deduction and withholding was
made shall receive as of the Effective Time the excess cash over the
withholding obligation as a cash payment, without interest.

 



 

Section 3.4 _Treatment of Company Share Awards_. To the extent not previously
obtained, the Company shall obtain (as soon as practicable following the date
hereof) from each of the Companys executive officers and the other
individuals set forth in _Section 3.4_ of the Company Disclosure Letter a
waiver of such individuals right to accelerated vesting of any unvested or
partially vested Company Equity Awards held by such individual in connection
with the Merger, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit D (the " _Waiver Form_
") and shall following the date hereof use reasonable efforts to cause the
vesting of any unvested or partially vested Company Equity Awards held by each
other holder thereof not to accelerate in connection with the consummation of
the Merger. At the Effective Time, each unvested or partially vested Company
Equity Award shall be converted into an award under the Parent Equity
Compensation Plan with respect to a number of Parent Common Shares (rounded
down to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of (a) the Exchange
Ratio multiplied by (b) the number of Company Common Shares subject to such
unvested or partially vested Company Equity Award at the Effective Time. Such
award shall continue to be subject to the same vesting and other terms and
conditions as were in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except
as specifically set forth in the Waiver Form or as otherwise amended. No
fractional Parent Common Shares shall be issued upon the conversion of Company
Equity Awards pursuant to this _Section 3.4_. Any holder of Company Equity
Awards otherwise entitled to receive a fractional Parent Common Share but for
this _Section 3.4_ shall be entitled to receive a cash payment in accordance
with the provisions of _Section 3.2(e)_, without duplication. Any cash
payment pursuant to this _Section 3.4_ shall be subject to appropriate
withholding for Taxes in accordance with _Section 3.3_, without duplication.
As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement,
and in any event prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or an
authorized committee thereof) shall adopt such resolutions and take such other
actions as the Company Board (or such committee) determines may be required to
effect the provisions of this _Section 3.4_.

 



 

Any Company Equity Award that vests upon the consummation of the Merger shall,
at the Effective Time, receive the same treatment as Eligible Shares pursuant
to this Agreement. Any vesting of such Company Equity Awards upon the
consummation of the Merger shall be subject to appropriate withholding for
Taxes in accordance with _Section 3.3_, without duplication, and holders
thereof shall have the right to have Parent Common Shares withheld to satisfy
any Tax liability associated with such vesting.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 3.5 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. If, at any time during the
period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, (a) there is
a change in the number of issued and outstanding Company Common Shares or the
number of issued and outstanding Parent Common Shares, or securities
convertible or exchangeable into Company Common Shares or Parent Common Shares
in each case, as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including
reverse stock split), stock dividend or stock distribution, recapitalization,
merger, combination, exchange of shares, subdivision or other similar
transaction, or (b) there shall have been declared on the Parent Common Shares
a share dividend, share distribution or share split (including reverse share
split) with a record date prior to the Effective Time, the Exchange Ratio
shall be equitably adjusted to provide the holders of Eligible Shares and
Company Equity Awards and Parent with the same economic effect as contemplated
by this Agreement prior to such event. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Companys declaration and payment of the ILPT Distribution shall not result in
any adjustment to the Exchange Ratio.

 



 

Section 3.6 _Lost Certificates_. If any Company Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Company Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if requested by Parent in its reasonable discretion, the posting by such
Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Company
Certificate, the Exchange Agent (or, if subsequent to the termination of the
Exchange Fund and subject to _Section 3.2(f)_ or _Section 3.2(g)_, Parent or
the Surviving Entity) shall deliver, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Company Certificate, the Parent Common Shares into which the Company
Common Shares represented by such Company Certificate were converted pursuant
to _Section 3.1(a)_, any cash in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends
and other distributions deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 3.7 _Dissenters Rights_. No dissenters or appraisal rights shall be
available with respect to the Merger or any of the other Transactions.

 **REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY**

commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar contract or arrangement, including any contract
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the Company or
any Company Subsidiary, on the one hand, and any other Affiliate of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, including any structured finance, special
purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any "off-
balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under
the Securities Act) where the result, purpose or effect is to avoid disclosure

or any Company Subsidiary in the Companys or any such Company Subsidiarys
audited financial statements or other Company SEC Documents.

be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(f) The Company has established and maintains a system of "internal control
over financial reporting" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the

Companys and each Company Subsidiarys assets that could have a material
effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Company has
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of such internal control over
financial reporting prior to the date of this Agreement, to the Companys
auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board (x) any significant
deficiency and material weakness in the design or operation of the Companys
internal control over financial reporting that is reasonably likely to
adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize or report
financial information, and (y) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves Company management. For purposes of this Agreement, the terms
"significant deficiency" and "material weakness" shall have the meaning
assigned to them in the auditing standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board, as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

 



 

(g) The Companys "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) are designed to ensure that all
information (both financial and non-financial) required to be disclosed by the
Company in the reports that it files or

 



       
 

 



 

submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that
all such information is accumulated and communicated to Company management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications of the chief executive officer and chief financial
officer of the Company required under the Exchange Act with respect to such
reports. Company management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness
of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, presented in any applicable Company SEC Document
that is a report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q, or any amendment thereto, its
conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures

including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or
Person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined

purpose or effect is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction
involving, or material liabilities of, Parent or any Parent Subsidiary in
Parents or any such Parent Subsidiarys audited financial statements or other
Parent SEC Documents.

 



 

(e) Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has outstanding (nor has arranged

Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(f) Parent has established and maintains a system of "internal control over
financial reporting" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the

designed to provide reasonable assurance (i) regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP, (ii) that receipts and expenditures of
Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of Parent management and the Parent Board (or an authorized

Subsidiarys assets that could have a material effect on Parents consolidated
financial statements. Parent has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation of such internal control over financial reporting prior to the date
of this Agreement, to Parents auditors and the audit committee of the Parent

operation of Parents internal control over financial reporting that is
reasonably likely to adversely affect Parents ability to record, process,
summarize or report financial information, and (y) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves Parent management.

 



 

(g) Parents "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) are designed to ensure that all
information (both financial and non-financial) required to be disclosed by
Parent in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information is
accumulated and communicated to Parent management as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of Parent required
under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports. Parent management has
completed an assessment of the effectiveness of Parents disclosure controls
and procedures and, to the extent required by applicable Law, presented in any
applicable Parent SEC Document that is a report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q, or
any amendment thereto, its conclusions about the effectiveness of the
disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by such
report or amendment based on such evaluation.

connection with or as a result of this Agreement, the Merger or the other

taxable year.

 



 

(f) Each of Parent and each Parent Subsidiary has complied with all applicable
Laws, rules and regulations relating to the payment and withholding of Taxes
(including withholding of Taxes pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442, 1445, 1446,

over to the appropriate Governmental Authorities all amounts required to be so
withheld and paid over on or prior to the due date thereof under all
applicable Laws.

 



 

(g) There are no Parent Tax Protection Agreements in force at the date of this
Agreement, and no Person has raised in writing, or to the Knowledge of Parent
threatened to raise, a claim against Parent or any Parent Subsidiary for any
breach of any Parent Tax Protection Agreement or a claim that the Merger or
the other Transactions will give rise to any liability or obligation to make
any payment under any Parent Tax Protection Agreement.

other than (i) agreements or arrangements solely by or among two or more of
Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries, or (ii) customary indemnification
provisions contained in credit or other commercial agreements (which

corporation" (all within the meaning of Section 355 of the Code), in each case
in a distribution of shares qualifying or intended to qualify for tax-free

the Code (or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or foreign
income Tax Law).

to include any item of income in, or exclude any item of deduction from,

Effect.

Section 7.1 _Preparation of Form S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement; Shareholder
Approvals_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, (i) the Company and Parent shall jointly prepare and cause to be
filed with the SEC as part of the Form S-4 the Joint Proxy Statement in
preliminary form relating to the Company Shareholder Meeting and the Parent
Shareholder Meeting, and (ii) Parent shall prepare (with the Companys
reasonable cooperation) and cause to be filed with the SEC, the Form S-4,
which will include the Joint Proxy Statement as a prospectus, for the
registration under the Securities Act of the Parent Common Shares to be issued
in the Merger. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to (A) have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act
as promptly as practicable after such filing, (B) ensure that the Form S-4
complies in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the
Exchange Act and the Securities Act and (C) keep the Form S-4 effective for so
long as necessary to complete the Merger unless this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to _Section 9.1_. Each of the Company and Parent shall furnish all
information concerning itself, its Affiliates and the holders of its shares of
beneficial interest or other equity interests to the other and provide such
other assistance as may be reasonably requested by the other in connection
with the preparation, filing and distribution of the Form S-4 and the Joint
Proxy Statement and shall provide to their and each others counsel such
representations as are reasonably necessary to render the opinions required to
be filed therewith. The Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement shall include
all information reasonably requested by such other Party to be included
therein. Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other upon
the receipt of any comments from the SEC or any request from the SEC for
amendments or supplements to the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement, and
shall, as promptly

 



      
 

 



 

as practicable after receipt thereof, provide the other with copies of all
correspondence between it and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the
SEC, on the other hand, and all written comments with respect to the Form S-4
or the Joint Proxy Statement received from the SEC and advise the other Party
of any oral comments with respect to the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement
received from the SEC. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments from the
SEC with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement, and Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments
from the SEC with respect to the Form S-4. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
prior to filing the Form S-4 (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or
mailing the Joint Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or
responding to any comments from the SEC with respect thereto, each of the
Company and Parent shall cooperate and provide the other a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such document or response (including the
proposed final version of such document or response). Parent shall advise the
Company, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time of
effectiveness of the Form S-4, the issuance of any stop order relating thereto
or the suspension of the registration or qualification of the Parent Common
Shares issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, and Parent and the Company shall use their reasonable best
efforts to have any such stop order or suspension lifted, reversed or
otherwise terminated. Parent shall also take any other action reasonably
required to be taken under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any
applicable foreign or state securities or "blue sky" Laws and the rules and
regulations thereunder in connection with the issuance of the Parent Common
Shares in the Merger, and the Company shall furnish all information concerning
the Company and the holders of the Company Common Shares as may be reasonably
requested in connection with any such actions.

 



 

(b) If, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval
or the Parent Shareholder Approval, any information relating to the Company or
Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, should be discovered by the
Company or Parent which, in the reasonable judgment of the Company or Parent,
should be set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to, any of the Form
S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement, so that any of such documents would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the Party that discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other Parties hereto, and the Company
and Parent shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary
amendment of, or supplement to, the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement and,
to the extent required by Law, in disseminating the information contained in
such amendment or supplement to holders of the Company Common Shares and
holders of the Parent Common Shares. Nothing in this _Section 7.1(b)_ shall
limit the obligations of any Party under _Section 7.1(a)_. For purposes of
_Section 4.6_ and this _Section 7.1_ , any information concerning or related
to the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, the ILPT Entities or the Company
Shareholder Meeting will be deemed to have been provided by the Company, and
any information concerning or related to Parent, the Parent Subsidiaries or
the Parent Shareholder Meeting will be deemed to have been provided by Parent.

Agreement, the Company shall, in accordance with applicable Law and the
Company Governing Documents, establish a record date for, duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold the Company Shareholder Meeting. The Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint Proxy

 



      
 

 



 

Statement to be mailed to the holders of the Company Common Shares entitled to
vote at the Company Shareholder Meeting and to hold the Company Shareholder
Meeting as soon as reasonably practicable after the Form S-4 is declared
effective under the Securities Act. The Company shall include the Company
Board Recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval, except to the extent
that the Company Board shall have made an Adverse Recommendation Change as
permitted by _Section 7.3(d)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
this _Section 7.1(c)_, if, on a date for which the Company Shareholder
Meeting is scheduled, the Company has not received proxies representing a
sufficient number of Company Common Shares to obtain the Company Shareholder
Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, the Company shall have the right
to make one or more successive postponements or adjournments of the Company
Shareholder Meeting; _provided_ that the Company Shareholder Meeting may not
be postponed or adjourned to a date after the date that is three (3) Business
Days prior to the Outside Date.

 



 

(d) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, Parent shall, in accordance with applicable Law and the Parent
Governing Documents, establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Parent Shareholder Meeting. Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to the
shareholders of Parent entitled to vote at the Parent Shareholder Meeting and
to hold the Parent Shareholder Meeting as soon as reasonably practicable after
the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act. Parent shall
include the Parent Board Recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement and use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Parent Shareholder Approval, except
to the extent that the Parent Board shall have made an Adverse Recommendation
Change as permitted by _Section 7.3(d)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this _Section 7.1(d)_, if, on a date for which the Parent
Shareholder Meeting is scheduled, Parent has not received proxies representing
a sufficient number of Parent Common Shares to obtain the Parent Shareholder
Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, Parent shall have the right to
make one or more successive postponements or adjournments of the Parent
Shareholder Meeting; _provided_ that the Parent Shareholder Meeting may not be
postponed or adjourned to a date that is after the date that is three (3)
Business Days prior to the Outside Date.

 



 

(e) The Company and Parent will use their respective reasonable best efforts
to hold the Company Shareholder Meeting and the Parent Shareholder Meeting on
the same date and as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 7.2 _Access; Confidentiality_.

 



 

(a) During the Interim Period, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the
Company, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, shall, and the
Company and Parent shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and the Parent
Subsidiaries, respectively, and their respective Representatives to, afford to
the other Party and its Representatives reasonable access (including for the
purpose of coordinating transition planning) during normal business hours and
upon reasonable advance notice to all of their respective properties, offices,
books, contracts, commitments and records and to their officers, accountants,
managers employees, counsel and other Representatives, and those of the
Company Subsidiaries or the Parent Subsidiaries, as applicable, and, during
such period, each Party shall reasonably promptly make available to the

 



      
 

 



 

other Party, (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and
other document filed or received by it during such period pursuant to the
requirements of federal or state securities Laws, and (ii) all other
information (financial or otherwise) concerning its business and properties as
such other Party may reasonably request. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither the Company nor Parent shall be required by this _Section 7.2_ to
provide the other Party or the Representatives of such other Party with access
to or to disclose information (A) relating to meetings or deliberations of its
board of trustees (or an authorized committee thereof) or communications among
the members thereof or with their Representatives, (B) relating to the
consideration, negotiation or performance of this Agreement and related
agreements, (C) the disclosure of which would violate any Law, legal duty or
contractual obligation of the Party or any of its Representatives to any third
party ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the withholding Party shall use its
reasonable best efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit
reasonable disclosure not in violation of any Law, legal duty or contractual
obligation and _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ that this subclause (C)
shall not apply to any contractual obligation pursuant to an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement), or (D) if it would jeopardize attorney work
product or attorney client privilege.

 



 

(b) Each of the Parties will hold, and will cause its Representatives and
Affiliates to hold, any nonpublic information, including any information
exchanged pursuant to this _Section 7.2_, in confidence to the extent
required by and in accordance with, and will otherwise comply with, the terms
of the form of confidentiality agreement attached hereto as Exhibit B as if
such Party was a "Recipient" as defined therein.

 



 

Section 7.3 _No Solicitation; Change in Recommendation_.

 



 

(a) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 7.3_, during the Interim
Period, Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause the Parent Subsidiaries
and the Company Subsidiaries, respectively, and their respective
Representatives, (i) to immediately cease any solicitation, encouragement,
discussions or negotiations with any Persons that may be ongoing with respect
to a Competing Proposal (or that may be ongoing with respect to any inquiry or
proposal that may be reasonably expected to lead to a Competing Proposal),
request that any such Person and its Representatives promptly return or
destroy all confidential information concerning Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries and the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and immediately
terminate all physical and electronic data room access granted to any such
Person or its Representatives and (ii) not to, directly or indirectly, (A)
solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage any inquiry
or the making of any proposal which constitutes, or may reasonably be expected
to lead to, any Competing Proposal, (B) engage in, continue or otherwise
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
other Person information in connection with or for the purpose of encouraging
or facilitating, a Competing Proposal, or (C) enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement,
agreement in principle or other agreement with respect to a Competing Proposal
(other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) (each, an " _Acquisition
Agreement_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing in this _Section 7.3(a)_, upon
the unsolicited request of a third party, the Party receiving such request
(the " _Request Recipient_ ") may grant a waiver of a standstill,
confidentiality, or similar obligation for the purpose of allowing a third
party to make a confidential unsolicited Competing Proposal to the Request
Recipients board of trustees (or an authorized committee thereof) if
contemporaneously with

 



      
 

 



 

granting such waiver, the Request Recipient notifies the other Party of such
waiver, such notice to be made orally and confirmed in writing, and of the
identity of the Person(s) receiving such waiver. It is agreed that any
violation of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 7.3(a)_ by any
Representative of Parent or the Company or any of the Parent Subsidiaries or
the Company Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section
7.3(a)_ by Parent or the Company, as applicable.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section
7.3(b)_, if a Party or any Parent Subsidiary or Company Subsidiary, as
applicable, receives a written Competing Proposal (such Party, the " _Proposal
Recipient_ ") from any Person or group of Persons at any time on or after the
date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the Parent Shareholder Approval
or the Company Shareholder Approval, as applicable, that the Proposal
Recipients board of trustees (or an authorized committee thereof) determines
in good faith, after consultation with the Proposal Recipients outside
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, constitutes or is reasonably
likely to result in a Superior Proposal, which Competing Proposal was received
in circumstances not otherwise involving a material breach by the Proposal
Recipient of this _Section 7.3_, the Proposal Recipient may, or may cause its
Representatives to, in response to such Competing Proposal, and subject to
compliance with _Section 7.3(c)_, (i) contact such Person or group of Persons
to clarify the terms and conditions thereof, (ii) furnish, pursuant to an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, information (including non-public
information) with respect to the Proposal Recipient and the Parent
Subsidiaries or the Company Subsidiaries, as applicable, to the Person or
group of Persons who has made such Competing Proposal, provided that the
Proposal Recipient shall, prior to or concurrently with the time such
information is provided to such Person or group of Persons, provide to the
other Party any non-public information concerning the Proposal Recipient or
any of the Parent Subsidiaries or the Company Subsidiaries, as applicable,
that is provided to any such Person or group of Persons which was not
previously provided to the other Party or its Representatives, and (iii)
engage in or otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with the
Person or group of Persons making such Competing Proposal regarding such
Competing Proposal. It is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set
forth in this _Section 7.3(b)_ by any Representative of the Proposal
Recipient, or any Parent Subsidiary or Company Subsidiary, as applicable,
shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 7.3(b)_ by the Proposal
Recipient.

 



 

(c) The Proposal Recipient shall (i) promptly, and in any event no later than
forty eight (48) hours after receipt of any Competing Proposal or request for
non-public information in connection therewith, as applicable, advise the
other Party in writing of the receipt of such Competing Proposal and any
request for confidential information in connection with such Competing
Proposal, the material terms of such Competing Proposal and the identity of
the Person or group of Persons making such Competing Proposal or request for
confidential information and (ii) keep the other Party reasonably advised of
all material developments affecting the terms (including all changes to the
material terms) and status of such Competing Proposal, including the status of
discussions or negotiations regarding such Competing Proposal.

 



 

(d) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 7.3(d)_, neither the
Parent Board (or an authorized committee thereof) nor the Company Board (or an
authorized committee thereof) shall (i) (A) in the case of the Parent Board
(or an authorized committee thereof), fail to recommend to the holders of the
Parent Common Shares that the Parent Shareholder Approval be

 



      
 

 



 

given or fail to include the Parent Board Recommendation in the Joint Proxy
Statement, and, in the case of the Company Board (or an authorized committee
thereof), fail to recommend to the holders of the Company Common Shares that
the Company Shareholder Approval be given or fail to include the Company Board
Recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement, (B) change, qualify, withhold,
withdraw or modify, or publicly propose to change, qualify, withhold, withdraw
or modify the Parent Board Recommendation (or the Parent Special Committees
recommendation to the Parent Board with respect to the Merger or the other
Transactions) or the Company Board Recommendation (or the Company Special
Committees recommendation to the Company Board with respect to the Merger or
the other Transactions), as applicable, in each case in a manner adverse to
the other Party, or (C) adopt, approve or recommend, or publicly propose to
adopt, approve or recommend, a Competing Proposal (actions described in this
clause _(i)_ being referred to as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), or
(ii) authorize, cause or permit Parent or the Company, as applicable, or any
of the Parent Subsidiaries or the Company Subsidiaries, as applicable, to
enter into any Acquisition Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, prior to the time the Parent Shareholder Approval, in the case of
Parent, or the Company Shareholder Approval, in the case of the Company, is
obtained, and subject to material compliance with this _Section 7.3(d)_ and
_Sections 7.3(a)-(c)_ , the Parent Board (or an authorized committee thereof)
or the Company Board (or an authorized committee thereof), as applicable, may
make an Adverse Recommendation Change and/or terminate this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 9.1(c)(iii)_ , in the case of Parent, or _Section 9.1(d)(iii)_ ,
in the case of the Company, if (A) (1) a written Competing Proposal is
received by it and such Competing Proposal is not withdrawn, and (2) prior to
taking such action, the Proposal Recipients board of trustees (or an
authorized committee thereof), has determined in good faith after consultation
with the Proposal Recipients outside legal counsel and outside financial
advisors, that such Competing Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, or (B)
an Intervening Event occurs with respect to Parent or the Company and the
Parent Board (or an authorized committee thereof) or the Company Board (or an
authorized committee thereof), as applicable, determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with their trustees duties under
applicable Law of the State of Maryland; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Parent Board (or an authorized committee thereof) or the Company Board (or an
authorized committee thereof), as applicable, may not take any action
contemplated by clause (A) or (B) of this sentence unless:

 



 

(1) if such action is taken in connection with any such Competing Proposal,
(a) the Proposal Recipient has given the other Party at least three (3)
Business Days prior written notice of its intention to take such action
(which notice shall include the information with respect to such Competing
Proposal that is specified in _Section 7.3(c)_ as well as a copy of any
proposal and any then existing drafts of the definitive agreement and other
material documentation providing for such Competing Proposal), (b) the
Proposal Recipient has negotiated in good faith with the other Party, to the
extent the other Party wishes to negotiate, during such notice period to
enable the other Party to propose in writing revisions to the terms of this
Agreement such that it would cause such Superior Proposal to no longer
constitute (in the good faith determination of the board of trustees of the
Proposal Recipient (or an authorized committee thereof) after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and outside financial advisors) a Superior
Proposal, (c) following the end of such notice period, the Proposal
Recipients board of trustees (or an authorized committee thereof) shall have
considered

 



      
 

 



 

in good faith any proposed revisions to this Agreement proposed in writing by
the other Party and shall have determined that, after consultation with the
Proposal Recipients outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, the
Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if such
revisions were to be given effect, and (d) in the event of any change to the
material terms of such Superior Proposal, the Proposal Recipient shall, in
each case, have delivered to the other Party an additional notice consistent
with that described in subclause (a) above and the notice period shall have
recommenced, except that the notice period shall be at least one (1) Business
Day; and

 



 

(2) if such action is taken in connection with any such Intervening Event, (x)
Parent or the Company, as applicable, has given the other Party at least three
(3) Business Days prior written notice of its intention to take such action
(which notice shall include in reasonable detail the basis for such action),
(y) such Party has negotiated in good faith with the other Party, to the
extent the other Party wishes to negotiate, during such notice period to
enable the other Party to propose in writing revisions to the terms of this
Agreement such that the failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change would
no longer be inconsistent with their trustees duties under applicable Law of
the State of Maryland, and (z) following the end of such notice period, the
Parent Board (or an authorized committee thereof) or the Company Board (or an
authorized committee thereof), as applicable, shall have considered in good
faith any proposed revisions to this Agreement proposed in writing by the
other Party and shall have determined that, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, the failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change
would still be inconsistent with their trustees duties under applicable Law
of the State of Maryland if such revisions were to be given effect.

 



 

(e) Except to the extent provided in _Section 7.3(c)_ or _Section 7.3(d)_,
nothing in this _Section 7.3_ shall prohibit the Parent Board (or an
authorized committee thereof) or the Company Board (or an authorized committee
thereof) from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange
Act or otherwise complying with its disclosure obligations under applicable
Law with regard to a Competing Proposal; _provided_ that, if such disclosure
has the effect of withdrawing or adversely modifying the Parent Board
Recommendation or the Company Board Recommendation, as applicable, such
disclosure shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company Board
shall not be required to submit this Agreement to the holders of the Company
Common Shares if the Company Board shall have effected an Adverse
Recommendation Change permitted by this _Section 7.3_, and the Parent Board
shall not be required to submit this Agreement to the holders of the Parent
Common Shares if the Parent Board shall have effected an Adverse
Recommendation Change permitted by this _Section 7.3_, and either the Parent
Board or the Company Board may submit to the holders of Parent Common Shares
or Company Common Shares, as applicable, any Competing Proposal.

 



 

(f) As used in this Agreement, a " _Competing Proposal_ " means any proposal
or offer from any Person (other than any Party) or "group", within the meaning
of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, to a Party relating to, in a single
transaction or series of related transactions, any direct or indirect (i)
acquisition or purchase of twenty percent (20%) or more of

 



      
 

 



 

the consolidated assets (including equity interests in subsidiaries) of such
Party (based on the fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by
the board of trustees of such Party (or an authorized committee thereof) as
applicable, after consultation with such Partys outside financial advisors
and independent accountants), as applicable, or assets comprising twenty
percent (20%) or more of the revenues or earnings on a consolidated basis of
such Party, (ii) acquisition of twenty percent (20%) or more of the
outstanding equity securities of such Party or any class of equity securities
of such Party, (iii) tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated,
would result in any Person beneficially owning twenty percent (20%) or more of
any class of equity securities of such Party, (iv) merger, consolidation,
share exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or similar transaction involving such Party or any Parent
Subsidiary or Company Subsidiary, as applicable, that comprise twenty percent
(20%) or more of the assets, revenues or earnings on a consolidated basis of
such Party, as applicable, or (v) any combination of the foregoing types of
transactions, if the sum of the percentage of consolidated assets,
consolidated revenues or earnings and any class of equity securities of such
Party involved is twenty percent (20%) or more. For the avoidance of doubt, in
no event shall any of the sales or dispositions of Company Properties set
forth in _Section 6.1(a)(vii)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter or Parent
Properties set forth in _Section 6.2(a)(vii)_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter
constitute, individually or in the aggregate, a Competing Proposal.

 



 

(g) As used in this Agreement, a " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide
written Competing Proposal (except that, for purposes of this definition, the
references in the definition of "Competing Proposal" to "twenty percent (20%)"
shall be replaced by "seventy-five percent (75%)") made by a Person or
"group", within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, on terms
that the Proposal Recipients board of trustees (or an authorized committee
thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with the Proposal
Recipients outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, taking into
account all relevant financial, legal, regulatory and any other aspects of
such proposal that the Proposal Recipients board of trustees (or such
committee) deems relevant, including the identity of the Person making such
proposal, financing terms and conditions to consummation, as well as any
changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by the other Party in response
to such proposal or otherwise, (i) would, if consummated, result in a
transaction that is more favorable to the holders of the Proposal Recipients
equity interests (solely in their capacity as such) from a financial point of
view than the Merger and the other Transactions, (ii) for which the third
party has demonstrated that the financing for such offer is fully committed or
is reasonably likely to be obtained, and (iii) is reasonably likely to receive
all required approvals from any Governmental Authority and otherwise
reasonably likely to be consummated on the terms proposed.

 



 

Section 7.4 _Public Announcements_. The initial press releases and initial
investor presentations with respect to the execution and delivery of this
Agreement shall be reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Except
with respect to any Adverse Recommendation Change or any action taken pursuant
to, and in accordance with _Section 7.3_, so long as this Agreement is in
effect, the Parties hereto shall, to the extent reasonable under the
circumstances, consult with each other before issuing any press release or
otherwise making any public statements or filings with respect to this
Agreement, the Merger or any of the other Transactions and provide such Party
with an opportunity to review and comment upon such press release or other
public announcement or filing, which comments the other Party shall consider
in good

 



      
 

 



 

faith; _provided_ , that a Party may, without consulting with or pursuing the
other Parties review, issue such press release or make such public statement
or filing with respect to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other
Transactions as may be required by Law, Order or the applicable rules of
Nasdaq.

 



 

Section 7.5 _Indemnification; Trustees , Directors and Officers Insurance_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall honor and
comply with, to the fullest extent permissible under applicable Law, the
obligations of the Company with respect to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation and related matters, under the Company Governing
Documents in effect on the date hereof and under any indemnification or other
similar agreements in effect on the date hereof (the " _Indemnification
Agreements_ ") to individuals who at or prior to the Effective Time were
officers, trustees, directors or agents of the Company or a Company Subsidiary
and covered by such Company Governing Documents or Indemnification Agreements
(the " _Covered Persons_ ") arising out of or relating to actions or omissions
in their capacity as such occurring at or prior to the Effective Time,
including, but not limited to, in connection with the approval of this
Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the provisions of _Section 7.5(a)_, for a period of six
(6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall: (i) indemnify
and hold harmless each Covered Person against and from any costs or expenses
(including attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation arises out of or pertains to: (A) any action or
omission or alleged action or omission in such Covered Persons capacity as
such, or (B) this Agreement, the Merger and any of the other Transactions; and
(ii) pay in advance of the final disposition of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation the expenses (including attorneys fees) of any
Covered Person upon receipt of an undertaking, substantially in the form of
that required under the Indemnification Agreements or in such other form as
may be required by applicable Law as in effect at such time, by or on behalf
of such Covered Person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be
determined by order of a court, regulatory authority or authorized
adjudicating body that such Covered Person is not entitled to be indemnified.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 7.5_ or
elsewhere in this Agreement, (x) the Surviving Entity shall not settle or
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek
termination with respect to any claim, action, suit or proceeding against or
investigation of a Covered Person for which indemnification may be sought
under this _Section 7.5(b)_ without the Covered Persons prior written
consent unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an
unconditional release of such Covered Person from all liability arising out of
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, (y) the Surviving
Entity shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior
written consent and (z) the Surviving Entity shall not have any obligation
hereunder to any Covered Person to the extent that a court of competent

this Agreement and (B) not amend, modify or repeal such provisions in any
manner that would materially and adversely affect the rights or protections

Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions).

Effective Time with respect to any claim related to any period of time at or
prior to the Effective Time from one or more insurance carriers with the same
or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with
respect to DandO Insurance with terms, conditions and retentions that are no
less favorable in the aggregate than the coverage provided under the Companys
existing policies (true, correct and complete copies of which have been
provided to Parent prior to the date hereof) and with limits of liability that
are no lower than the limits on the Companys existing policies so long as the
premium in the aggregate does not exceed three hundred percent (300%) of the
annual aggregate premium(s) under the Companys existing policies; _provided_
, that if the premium of such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, the

substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then and in each
such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns
of Parent or the Surviving Entity, as applicable, or such continuing or
surviving corporation or entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may
be, shall assume all of the applicable obligations set forth in this _Section

consents from any Person not covered by _Section 7.6(a)_ that are necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate the Merger or the other Transactions. Each
of the Parties will furnish to the other such necessary information and
reasonable assistance as the other may reasonably request in connection with
the preparation of any required governmental filings or submissions and will

including promptly informing the other Party of such inquiry, consulting in

Representatives to, participate independently in any meeting or engage in any
substantive conversation with any Governmental Authority in respect of any
filing, investigation or other inquiry without giving the other Party prior

notice to Parent and Merger Sub, and Parent and Merger Sub shall give prompt
notice to the Company, if, to the Knowledge of such Party, the occurrence of

forth herein not to be satisfied or satisfaction to be materially delayed.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the failure by the

shareholder approval is obtained with appropriate disclosure.

 



 

Section 8.3 _Conditions to Obligations of the Company_. The obligations of the
Company to effect the Merger and to consummate the other Transactions are
subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by applicable Law)
waiver (in writing) by the Company, on or prior to the Closing Date, of each
of the following additional conditions:

 



 

(a) _Representations and Warranties_. (i) The representations and warranties
set forth in _Section 5.1_ (Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries),

_Section 5.10(b)_ (REIT Qualification), _Section 5.18_ (Opinion of Financial
Advisor), _Section 5.19_ (Approval Required), _Section 5.20_ (Brokers), and
_Section 5.22_ (Takeover Statutes) shall be true and correct in all respects
(in the case of any representation or warranty qualified by materiality or
Parent Material Adverse Effect) or in all material respects (in the case of
any representation or warranty not qualified by materiality or Parent Material
Adverse Effect) as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing, as
though made as of the Closing (except to the extent such representations and
warranties are made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier
date), and (ii) each of the other representations and warranties of Parent
contained in this Agreement shall be true and correct as of the date of this
Agreement and as of the Closing, as though made as of the Closing (except to
the extent such representations and warranties are made as of an earlier date,
in which case as of such earlier date), except in the case of _clause (ii)_
where such failure(s) to be true and correct (without giving effect to any
materiality or Parent Material Adverse Effect qualifications set forth
therein) have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) _Performance of Obligations of Parent and Merger Sub_. Parent and Merger
Sub shall have performed or complied in all material respects with all
obligations, agreements and covenants required by this Agreement to be
performed or complied with by each of them at or prior to the Effective Time.

 



       
 

 



 

(c) _No Parent Material Adverse Effect_. Since the date hereof, there shall
not have occurred any event, change, effect or development that, individually
or in the aggregate, has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(d) _Delivery of Certificate_. Parent shall have delivered to the Company a
certificate, dated the Closing Date and signed by its chief executive officer
and chief financial officer (or equivalent officers) on behalf of Parent and
Merger Sub, certifying to the effect that the conditions set forth in _Section
8.3(a)_, _Section 8.3(b)_ and _Section 8.3(c)_ and have been satisfied.

 



 

(e) _REIT Tax Opinion_. Parent shall have received and delivered to the
Company a tax opinion of Parent REIT Counsel, on which the Company shall be
entitled to rely, dated as of the Closing Date and substantially in the form
of Exhibit J.

 



 

(f) _Section 368 Opinion_. The Company shall have received the written
opinion of its counsel, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, dated as of
the Closing Date and in substantially the same form as Exhibit K, to the
effect that, on the basis of facts, representations and assumptions set forth
or referred to in such opinion, (i) the Merger will qualify as a
reorganization under, and within the meaning of, Section 368(a) of the Code,
and (ii) Parent and the Company will each be a party to that reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code. In rendering such opinion,
Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP may rely upon the Company Tax
Representation Letter and the Parent Tax Representation Letter. The condition
set forth in this _Section 8.3(f)_ shall not be waivable after receipt of the
Company Shareholder Approval, unless further shareholder approval is obtained
with appropriate disclosure.

_Section 9.1(b)(i)_ shall not be available to any Party if the failure of

Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal in accordance with _Section
7.3(d)_.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) by the Company:

 



 

(i) if Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached, violated or failed to perform
any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in
this Agreement, which breach, violation or failure to perform, either
individually or in the aggregate, (A) would result in the failure of any of
the conditions set forth in _Section_ ___8.3(a)_ or _Section_ ___8.3(b)_ (a "
_Parent_ ___Terminating_ ___Breach_ "), and (B) cannot be cured, or, if
curable, is not cured by Parent, or waived by the Company, by the earlier of
(x) the Outside Date and (y) twenty (20) days after the receipt by Parent of
written notice of such breach, violation or failure from the Company;
_provided_ , that the Company shall not have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ ___9.1(d)(i)_ if a Company Terminating
Breach shall have occurred and be continuing at the time the Company delivers
notice of its election to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_
___9.1(d)(i)_ ;

 



 

(ii) if, prior to obtaining the Parent Shareholder Approval, Parent or the
Parent Board (or an authorized committee thereof), as applicable, (A) shall

termination of this Agreement as provided in _Section 9.1_, written notice
thereof shall be given by the terminating Party to the other Party, specifying
the provisions hereof pursuant to which such termination is made and
describing the basis therefor in reasonable detail, and this Agreement shall
forthwith become void and have no effect, without any liability or obligation
on the part of any Party, and all rights and obligations of any Party shall
cease; _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding anything in the
foregoing to the contrary, (a) the provisions of _Section 7.2(b)_ (Access;
Confidentiality), _Section 7.4_ (Public Announcements), this _Section 9.2_
(Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination), _Section 9.3_ (Fees and
Expenses) and _Article 10_ (General Provisions) and the definitions of all

this Agreement, and (b) subject to _Section 10.11_, no such termination shall
relieve any Party from any liability or damages resulting from any material
breach of any of such Partys representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement prior to such termination of this
Agreement that is a consequence of a deliberate act undertaken, or a
deliberate failure to act, by the breaching Party with the knowledge that the
taking of or failure to take such act would cause a material breach of this
Agreement, in which case the non-breaching Party shall be entitled to all
rights and remedies available at law or in equity. If this Agreement is
terminated as provided herein, all filings, applications and other submissions
made pursuant to

 



      
 

 



 

this Agreement, to the extent practicable, shall be withdrawn from the
Governmental Authority or other Person to which they were made.

be required to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 10**

Section 10.1 _Non-survival of Representations and Warranties_. None of the
representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any schedule,

Section 10.3 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any present or future
Law or public policy in any jurisdiction, as to that jurisdiction, (a) such
term or other provision shall be fully separable, (b) this Agreement shall be
construed and enforced as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision
had never comprised a part hereof, (c) all other conditions and provisions of
this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected
by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable term or other provision or by its
severance herefrom so long as the economic or legal substance of the Merger or
the other Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
Party, and (d) such terms or other provisions shall not affect the validity or
enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any
other jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced in any jurisdiction, the
Parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in a mutually
acceptable manner in order that the Merger or the other Transactions be
consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 



 

Section 10.4 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which together shall be
deemed one and the same agreement, and shall become effective when one or more
counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered (by
electronic delivery or otherwise) to the other Parties. Signatures to this
Agreement transmitted by facsimile transmission, by electronic mail in .pdf
format, or by any other electronic means intended to preserve the original
graphic and pictorial appearance of a document, will have the same effect as

Section 10.5 _Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement (including the Company Disclosure Letter, the Parent
Disclosure Letter, the exhibits hereto and the documents and instruments
referred to herein) and the Registration Agreement constitute the entire
agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written
and oral, between the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement.

 



 

(b) This Agreement is intended to and shall not confer any rights or remedies
upon any Person other than the Parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns, except for _Section 7.5_ (which, from and after the
Effective Time shall be for the benefit of the Covered Persons). The
representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the Parties and are for the sole benefit of the Parties
other than as described in this _Section 10.5_. Any inaccuracies in such
representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the Parties in
accordance with _Section 10.7_ without notice or liability to any other
Person. The representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an
allocation among the Parties of risks associated with particular matters
regardless of the Knowledge of Parent or Knowledge of the Company, as
applicable. Accordingly, Persons other than the Parties may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

 



 

Section 10.6 _Amendment and Modification_. Subject to compliance with
applicable Law, this Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented in any
respect by mutual written agreement of the Parties at any time before or after
receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval or the Parent Shareholder Approval
and prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that after the
Company Shareholder Approval or the Parent Shareholder Approval has been
obtained, there shall not be any amendment, modification or supplement of this
Agreement, which by applicable Law or in accordance with the rules of Nasdaq
requires the further approval of the holders of the Company Common Shares or
the holders of the Parent Common Shares, without such further approval of such
shareholders.

 



 

Section 10.7 _Extension and Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
subject to applicable Law, any Party may (a) extend the time for the
performance of any obligation or other act of any other Party, (b) waive any
inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of the other Party contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) waive compliance
with any agreement or condition contained herein. Any agreement on the part of
a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed by the Party or Parties to be bound thereby.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company, Parent or
Merger Sub in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof
nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further
exercise of any other right hereunder.

 



 

Section 10.8 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement, and all Actions (whether at Law, in contract or in tort)
that may be based upon, arise out of or related to this Agreement or the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the

 



      
 

 



 

Laws of the State of Maryland without giving effect to any choice or conflict
of Law principles (whether of the State of Maryland or any other jurisdiction)
that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than
the State of Maryland.

 



 

(b) All Actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard
and determined exclusively in any Maryland state or federal court. Each of the
Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of any Maryland state or federal court, for the purpose of any
Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by any Party, (ii)
agrees not to commence any such action or proceeding except in such courts,
(iii) agrees that any claim in respect of any such action or proceeding may be
heard and determined in any Maryland state or federal court, (iv) waives, to
the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which
it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such action or
proceeding, and (v) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding. Each of the Parties agrees that a final judgment in any such
action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.
Each of the Parties irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner
provided for notices in _Section 10.2_. Nothing in this Agreement will affect
the right of any Party to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.

 



 

Section 10.9 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO
THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING (WHETHER
BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE OTHER AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN
CONNECTION HEREWITH, THE MERGER OR THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY (A)
CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY
OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR
PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT
AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT,
BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION
10.9_.

 



 

Section 10.10 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned or delegated,
in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the Parties
without the prior written consent of the other Parties and any attempt to make
any such assignment without such consent shall be null and void. Subject to
the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective successors
and assigns.

 



 

Section 10.11 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur if any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached,
and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy
therefor. It is accordingly agreed that, prior to the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Article 9_, each Party shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to

 



      
 

 



 

enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement. Each of the
Parties hereby waives (a) any defense in an Action for specific performance
that a remedy at Law would be adequate, and (b) any requirement under any Law
to post a security as prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief. Each Party
agrees that the right of specific performance and other equitable relief is an
integral part of the Merger and the other Transactions, and without that
right, neither the Company, on the one hand, nor Parent or Merger Sub, on the
other hand, would have entered into this Agreement. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Parties may pursue both a grant of specific performance or other
equitable remedies to the extent permitted by this _Section 10.11_ and the
payment of damages, but shall not be entitled or permitted to receive an award
of damages if specific performance or other equitable remedies are awarded and
consummation of the Merger occurs and shall not be entitled or permitted to
receive an award of specific performance or other equitable remedies if
damages are awarded.

 



 

Section 10.12 _Non-liability of Trustees of the Company and Parent_. The
Company Charter and the Parent Charter, each as filed with the Maryland SDAT,
provide that no trustee, officer, shareholder, employee or agent of the
Company or Parent, respectively, shall be held to any personal liability,
jointly or severally, for any obligation of, or claim against, the Company or
Parent, respectively. All Persons dealing with the Company or Parent in any
way shall look only to the assets of the Company or Parent, respectively, for
the payment of any sum or the performance of any obligation.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have caused this Agreement to be executed and
delivered by their respective duly authorized officers, all as of the date
first written above.
