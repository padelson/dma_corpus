Section 1.7. _Jaguar Representative_.

 



 

(a) Each Jaguar Party (on behalf of itself, its Subsidiaries, its Jaguar
Designees and their respective successors, assigns and heirs) hereby
irrevocably appoints Jaguar Properties as the representative of the Jaguar
Parties (the " _Jaguar Representative_ ") and to be the agent, proxy and
attorney-in-fact for such Person regarding any matter relating to or arising
from this Agreement, any Ancillary Document or the Transactions, including the
full power and authority on such Persons behalf (i) to execute the
Partnership Agreement Amendment and Restatement and any other Ancillary
Documents and otherwise to consummate the transactions contemplated herein and
therein, (ii) to pay such Persons expenses incurred in connection with the
negotiation and performance of this Agreement, the Ancillary Documents and any
other agreement entered into in connection herewith (whether incurred on or
after the date hereof), (iii) to disburse any funds received hereunder to the
Jaguar Parties (as applicable), (iv) to endorse and deliver any certificates
or instruments representing the Equity Consideration and execute such further
agreements or instruments of assignment as the Giants Parties shall reasonably
request or which the Jaguar Representative shall consider necessary or proper
to effectuate the Transactions, all of which shall have the effect of binding
the Jaguar Parties, their Subsidiaries and the Jaguar Designees as if such
Person had personally executed such agreement or instrument, (v) to give and
receive notices, communications and other deliverables hereunder or under any
Ancillary Document on behalf of such Person, (vi) to take all other actions to
be taken

 



      
 

 



 

by or on behalf of such Person in connection herewith, including under any
Ancillary Document, (vii) to dispute, compromise, settle and pay any claims
made in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions, (viii) to retain
legal and other professional advisors on behalf of, and at the expense of such
Persons in connection with its actions hereunder and (ix) to take all actions
necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Jaguar Representative for the
accomplishment of the foregoing. Each Jaguar Party agrees that such agency,
proxy and attorney-in-fact and all authority granted hereunder are coupled
with an interest, and are therefore irrevocable without the consent of the
Jaguar Representative and shall survive the death, incapacity, bankruptcy,
dissolution or liquidation of any Person. If, after the execution of this
Agreement, any Jaguar Party, its Subsidiaries or its Jaguar Designee dies,
dissolves or liquidates or becomes incapacitated or incompetent, then the
Jaguar Representative is nevertheless authorized, empowered and directed to
act in accordance with this Agreement as if that death, dissolution,
liquidation, incapacity or incompetency had not occurred and regardless of
notice thereof. All actions, decisions or determinations so made or taken by
the Jaguar Representative (to the extent authorized by this Agreement) shall
be deemed the actions, decisions or determinations of each such Person, and
any notice, communication, document, certificate or information required
(other than any notice required by Law or under any Jaguar Partys or its
Subsidiaries Governing Documents) to be given to any Jaguar Party, its
Subsidiaries or its Jaguar Designees hereunder or pursuant to any other
agreement entered into in connection herewith shall be deemed so given if
given to the Jaguar Representative.

 



 

(b) Each Jaguar Party will severally, for itself, its Subsidiaries, and its
Jaguar Designees only, and not jointly, indemnify the Jaguar Representative
and hold the Jaguar Representative harmless against all expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement
actually and reasonably incurred without gross negligence or willful
misconduct on the part of the Jaguar Representative and arising out of or in
connection with the good faith acceptance or administration of its duties
hereunder, and any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel will
be conclusive evidence of such good faith.

 



 

(c) The Jaguar Representative hereby accepts its appointment as representative
of the Jaguar Parties under this Agreement. The Jaguar Representative shall
act in good faith. Subject to the Jaguar Representatives right to pay
expenses reasonably incurred in connection with the negotiation and
performance of this Agreement or otherwise to satisfy the reasonable expenses
and obligations of the Jaguar Parties, their Subsidiaries and their Jaguar
Designees, the Jaguar Representative shall promptly disburse to each Person
such Persons share of any Cash Consideration and Equity Consideration (as
applicable) received by the Jaguar Representative in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement. The Jaguar Representative shall have only the duties
expressly stated in this Agreement and shall have no other duty, express or
implied. The Jaguar Representative is not, by virtue of serving as the Jaguar
Representative, a fiduciary of the Jaguar Parties or any other Person. The
Jaguar Representative, in his capacity as such, has no personal responsibility
or liability for any representation, warranty or covenant of the Jaguar
Parties.

 



 

(d) The Jaguar Representative shall not be liable to any Jaguar Party or any
other Person for any action taken or omitted by it or any agent employed by it
hereunder or under any other document entered into in connection herewith,
except that the Jaguar Representative shall not be relieved of any liability
imposed by Law for fraud or bad faith. The Jaguar

 



      
 

 



 

Representative shall not be liable to the Jaguar Parties or any other Person
for any apportionment or distribution of consideration made by the Jaguar
Representative in good faith, and, if any such apportionment or distribution
is subsequently determined to have been made in error, the sole recourse of
any Person to whom payment was due, but not made, shall be to recover from
other Jaguar Parties any payment in excess of the amount to which they are
determined to have been entitled. The Jaguar Representative shall not be
required to make any inquiry concerning either the performance or observance
of any of the terms, provisions or conditions of this Agreement. Neither the
Jaguar Representative nor any agent employed by it shall incur any liability
to any Jaguar Party or any other Person by virtue of the failure or refusal of
the Jaguar Representative for any reason to consummate the Transactions or
relating to the performance of its other duties hereunder, except for actions
or omissions constituting fraud or bad faith.

 



 

(e) The Jaguar Representative shall not be entitled to and shall not charge or
collect from the Jaguar Parties or any other Person any fees or other
compensation for its services as the Jaguar Representative under this
Agreement. The Jaguar Representative, however, shall be entitled to
reimbursement from the Jaguar Parties for its reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in connection with its services as the Jaguar Representative
under this Agreement.

 



 

(f) If the Jaguar Representative resigns or is otherwise unable or unwilling
to serve in such capacity, then the Jaguar Parties will appoint a new Person
to serve as the Jaguar Representative and will provide prompt written notice
thereof to Giants. Until such notice is received, the Giants Parties will be
entitled to rely on the actions and statements of the previous Jaguar
Representative.

 



 

Section 1.8. _Withholding_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Giants Parties shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
any amounts otherwise payable in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions to any Person such amounts as are required to be deducted and
withheld under the Code or any provision of applicable Law. Any amounts so
withheld shall be paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity to the
extent required by Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and
withheld, such deducted and withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to such Person in respect of whom such
deduction and withholding were made.

case may be, including any amendments or supplements thereto, from and after
April 15, 2014 (collectively, the " _Giants SEC Filing_ s"). Each Giants SEC
Filing, as amended or supplemented, if applicable, (i) as of its date (or, if
amended or supplemented, as of the date of the most recent amendment or
supplement thereto, in each case, to the extent filed prior to the date of
this Agreement) complied in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the applicable
rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder, and (ii) did not, at the time it
was filed (or became effective in the case of registration statements) or
furnished (or, if amended or supplemented, as of the date of the most recent
amendment or supplement thereto in each case, to the extent filed prior to the
date of this Agreement) contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading. To the knowledge of Giants, none
of the Giants SEC Filings is the subject of ongoing SEC review and Giants does

any Giants SEC Filing, nor any inquiry or information request from the SEC. As

available to the Jaguar Parties complete and correct copies of all material
written correspondence between the SEC, on the one hand, and Giants, on the
other hand, since April 15, 2014.

indicated in the notes thereto) (i) was prepared from the books and records of
Giants and the Giants Subsidiaries (as applicable), (ii) was prepared in
accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("
_GAAP_ ") applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as

statements, for normal and recurring year-end adjustments), and (iii) fairly
present, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position,
results of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows of Giants and its
consolidated subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and for the
periods referred to therein (subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly
financial statements, to normal year-end adjustments).

 



 

(d) Neither Giants nor any Giants Subsidiary is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar contract or arrangement, including any contract
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among Giants and any
Giants Subsidiary, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate of Giants
or any Giants Subsidiary, including any structure finance, special purpose or
limited purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet
arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), which
is intended to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or
material liability of, Giants or any Giants Subsidiary that

 



      
 

 



 

would otherwise be required to be disclosed on such Giants or Giants
Subsidiarys audited financial statements or other Giants SEC Filings.

 



 

Section 3.7. _Internal Controls_. After taking into account that services are
provided under the Giants Advisory Agreement, the records, systems, controls,
data and information of Giants and the Giants Subsidiaries that are used in
the system of internal accounting controls described in the following sentence
are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means that are under the
exclusive ownership and direct control of Giants or the Giants Subsidiaries or
accountants, except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control
that would not reasonably be expected to have a materially adverse effect on
the system of internal accounting controls. After taking into account that
services are provided under the Giants Advisory Agreement, Giants and the
Giants Subsidiaries have devised and maintain a system of internal accounting
controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with GAAP, including that: (1) transactions
are executed only in accordance with managements authorization; (2)
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial
statements of Giants and the Giants Subsidiaries and to maintain
accountability for the assets of Giants and the Giants Subsidiaries; (3)
access to such assets is permitted only in accordance with managements
authorization; (4) the reporting of such assets is compared with existing
assets at regular intervals; and (5) accounts, notes and other receivables and
inventory are recorded accurately, and proper and adequate procedures are
implemented to effect the collection thereof on a current and timely basis.
Giants principal executive officer and its principal financial officer have
disclosed to Giants auditors and the audit committee of the Giants Board (i)
all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably
likely to adversely affect Giants ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial data, and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Giants
internal controls, and Giants has made available to the Jaguar Parties copies
of any material written materials relating to the foregoing. After taking into
account that services are provided under the Giants Advisory Agreement, Giants
has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as such term
is defined in Rule 13a-15 promulgated under the Exchange Act) designed to
ensure that material information relating to Giants required to be included in
reports filed under the Exchange Act, including its consolidated subsidiaries,
is made known to Giants principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer by others within those entities, particularly during the
periods in which the periodic reports required under the Exchange Act are
being prepared, and such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in
timely alerting Giants principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer to material information required to be included in Giants
periodic reports required under the Exchange Act.

subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether
accrued, contingent or otherwise) which are required by GAAP to be reflected
in a consolidated balance sheet, except for liabilities or obligations (i)
expressly contemplated by, or arising out of, or under this Agreement, (ii)
incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice

proceeding, in Law or equity (each, an " _Action_ "), pending against (or to
the knowledge of the Giants Parties, threatened in writing against), Giants, a
Giants Subsidiary or any executive officer or director of Giants (in their
capacity as such) nor, to the knowledge of the Giants Parties, is there any

had or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,

Person who is a "disqualified individual" (as such term is defined in Treasury

relating to the Transactions, and (iii) upon becoming aware of the occurrence
or impending occurrence of any event, change, development or circumstance
relating to it or any Giants Subsidiary or any Subsidiary of such Jaguar
Party, respectively, which makes or is reasonably likely to make any of the

Section 5.2. _Consents and Approvals_.

 



 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts (unless, with
respect to any action, another standard is set forth herein) to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other Parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Law or pursuant to any contract or agreement to
consummate and make effective, as promptly as practicable, the Transactions,
including using commercially reasonable efforts (i) to cause the conditions to
Closing set forth in _Article VII_ to be satisfied, (ii) to obtain all
necessary actions or nonactions, waiting period expirations or terminations,
waivers, consents, authorizations and approvals from Governmental Entities or
other Persons necessary in connection with the consummation of the
Transactions, including, with respect to the Giants Parties, the consents
listed on _Section 3.5(a)_ of the Giants Disclosure Letter and with respect
to the Jaguar Parties, the consents listed on _Section 4.3_ of the Jaguar
Disclosure Letter, and the making of all necessary registrations and filings
(including filings with Governmental Entities, if any) to obtain an approval,
waiting period expirations or terminations or waiver from, or to avoid an
action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity or other Persons necessary in
connection with the consummation of the Transactions, (iii) to defend any
lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging this Agreement or the Transactions, including seeking to have any
stay or temporary restraining order

 



       
 

 



 

entered by any court or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed, and
avoid each and every impediment under any antitrust, merger control,
competition or trade regulation Law that may be asserted by any Governmental
Entity with respect to the Transactions so as to enable the Closing to occur
as soon as reasonably possible, and (iv) to execute and deliver any additional
instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions and to fully carry out
the purposes of this Agreement. The Jaguar Parties shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts, to satisfy the condition set forth in Section
7.2(i), and, to the extent not otherwise satisfied, shall take all actions
within their respective control to make capital calls from their respective
limited partners or members who have unfunded capital commitments to cause
such condition to be satisfied.

 



 

(b) In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, each of the Giants
Parties and the Jaguar Parties shall give (or shall cause to be given) any
notices to any Person, and the Giants Parties and the Jaguar Parties shall
use, and cause each of their respective Affiliates to use, commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any consents, terminations, waivers,
authorizations and approvals not covered by _Section 5.2(a)_ that are proper
or advisable to consummate the Transactions.

 



 

(c) Any material notices pursuant to _Sections 5.2(a)_ and _(b)_ shall be
subject to the review and consent of the other Party, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. Any material notice with
respect to any waiver, consent, authorization or approval shall be subject to
the review and consent of the other Party, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned.

 



 

(d) Each of the Parties will furnish to the other such necessary information
and reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection with the
preparation of any required governmental filings or submissions and will
cooperate in responding to any inquiry from a Governmental Entity, including
promptly informing the other Party of such inquiry, consulting in advance
before making any presentations or submissions to a Governmental Entity, and
supplying each other with copies of all material correspondence, filings,
productions or communications between either Party and any Governmental Entity
with respect to this Agreement. To the extent reasonably practicable, the
Parties or their Representatives shall have the right to review in advance and
each of the Parties will consult the others on, all the information relating
to the other and each of their Affiliates that appears in any filing made
with, or written materials submitted to, any Governmental Entity in connection
with the Transactions, except that confidential competitively sensitive
business information may be redacted from such exchanges. The Parties may, as
they deem advisable and necessary, designate any competitively sensitive
materials provided to the other under this _Section 5.2_ as "outside counsel
only". Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given
only to outside counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such
outside counsel to employees, officers, or directors of the recipient without
the advance written consent of the Party providing such materials. To the
extent reasonably practicable, neither the Giants Parties nor the Jaguar
Parties shall, nor shall they permit their respective Representatives to,
participate independently in any meeting or engage in any substantive
conversation with any Governmental Entity in respect of any filing,
investigation or other inquiry relating to the Transactions without giving the
other Party prior notice of such meeting or conversation and, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law and the Governmental Entity, without giving the
other Party the opportunity to attend or participate (whether by telephone or
in person) in any such meeting with such Governmental Entity.

 



      
 

 



 

Subject to applicable law, the Parties will consult and cooperate with each
other in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda,
briefs, arguments, and proposals made or submitted to any Governmental Entity
regarding the Transactions.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection
with obtaining any approval or consent from any Person with respect to the
Transactions, none of the Giants Parties, or any of their Representatives,
shall without the consent of the Jaguar Parties, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, (i) pay or commit to pay to
such Person whose approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other
consideration, make any accommodation or commitment or incur any Liability or
other obligation to such Person prior to the Closing, except that the Giants
Parties may incur (A) legal, servicers and other similar fees required to be
paid under the applicable agreement in connection with obtaining such approval
or consent, (B) assumption fees required to be paid under the applicable
agreement, which will be payable at Closing, and (C) filing fees due to
Governmental Entities in connection with required filings or notifications
regarding the Transactions or (ii) agree or otherwise be required to sell,
divest, dispose of, license, hold separate, or take or commit to take any
action that limits in any respect its freedom of action with respect to, or
its ability to retain, any businesses, products, rights, services, licenses or
assets. Subject to the immediately preceding sentence, the Parties shall
cooperate with respect to accommodations that may be requested or appropriate
to obtain such consents. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the
Giants Parties shall not agree to any material economic concessions or any
material changes to any contract listed on _Section 3.5(a)_ of the Giants
Disclosure Letter in connection with obtaining its consent, except as set
forth on _Section 5.2_ of the Giants Disclosure Letter without the written
consent of the Jaguar Parties, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement except for
actions permitted under _Section 5.5(b)(xii)_ and _5.5(b)(xiii)_ , in
connection with obtaining any approval or consent from any Person with respect
to the Transactions, none of the Jaguar Parties, or any of their
Representatives, shall without the consent of the Giants Parties, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, (i) make
any material accommodation or commitment or incur any material Liability or
other obligation to such Person prior to the Closing, (ii) agree or otherwise
be required to sell, divest, dispose of, license, hold separate, or take or
commit to take any action that limits in any respect its freedom of action
with respect to, or its ability to retain, any businesses, products, rights,
services, licenses or assets or (iii) agree to any material economic
concessions or any material changes to any contract listed on _Section _
_4.3_ of the Jaguar Disclosure Letter _provided_ , _however_ , that the Jaguar
Parties may pay or commit to pay to any such Persons whose approval or consent
is being solicited any Jaguar Consent Expenses and any filing fees due to
Governmental Entities in connection with required filings or notifications
regarding the Transactions.

 



 

(g) The Giants Parties and the Jaguar Parties agree: (i) to make, or cause
their ultimate parent entities as that term is defined in the HSR Act to make,
or cause to be made, appropriate filings of the Notification and Report Form
under the HSR Act if applicable, with respect to the Transactions as promptly
as practicable; and (ii) to take all other actions reasonably necessary to
cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under
the HSR Act as soon as practicable. The responsibility for the payment of any
filings fees

 



      
 

 



 

in connection with any filings under the HSR Act shall be apportioned 35% by
Giants, and 65% by the Jaguar Parties.

 



 

(h) _Additional Jaguar Third Party Consent Procedures; Designation of Kickout
Interests_.

 



 

(i) If a Required Jaguar Debt Consent has not been obtained within 120 days of
the date hereof, then, except with the consent of the Giants Parties (not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the Jaguar Parties shall
use commercially reasonable efforts either (i) to refinance the applicable
Indebtedness (A) for a principal amount not to exceed the sum of the
outstanding principal amount under the Indebtedness being refinanced plus all
costs specifically necessary to accomplish such refinancing, (B) for a term
that is no shorter than the term then remaining on the Indebtedness being
refinanced, and (C) on other market terms and on terms which do not restrict
the consummation of the Transactions or (ii) to increase the capacity of the
Credit Facility, if necessary, in an amount sufficient to draw down and repay
the outstanding principal amount of such Indebtedness and to use such
additional amounts available under the Credit Facility to repay the
Indebtedness under which such Required Jaguar Debt Consent is required (a "
_Jaguar Debt Refinancin_ g"). The Jaguar Parties shall provide Giants copies
of any term sheets, commitments, agreements or instruments to be executed in
connection with any Jaguar Debt Refinancing prior to the execution thereof,
and shall promptly provide to Giants written notice of the consummation of any
Jaguar Debt Refinancing. If, prior to the Closing, the Jaguar Parties are not
able to obtain such Required Jaguar Debt Consent or consummate a Jaguar Debt
Refinancing with respect to the Indebtedness relating, directly or indirectly,
to any Included Properties set forth on _Section 5.2(h)(i)_, the Included
Interest the contribution of which requires such Required Jaguar Debt Consent
will be deemed a "Kickout Interest" for purposes of this Agreement and the
contribution of such Kickout Interest shall not occur.;

 



 

(ii) If the Jaguar Parties are not able to obtain any Required Jaguar Ground
Lease Consent with respect to any Included Interest holding a direct or
indirect interest in the Included Properties set forth on _Section
5.2(h)(ii)(A)_ of the Jaguar Disclosure Letter prior to the Closing, the
applicable Included Interest the contribution of which requires such Required
Jaguar Ground Lease Consent will be deemed a "Kickout Interest" for purposes
of this Agreement and the contribution of such Kickout Interest shall not
occur. If a Required Jaguar Ground Lease Consent with respect to any Included
Interest holding a direct or indirect interest in the Included Properties set
forth on _Section 5.2(h)(ii)(B)_ of the Jaguar Disclosure Letter is not
obtained prior to the Closing, then the Managing Member Interest with respect
to any such Included Interest will be deemed an "Excluded Managing Member
Interest" for purposes of this Agreement and shall not be contributed to
Giants, the Operating Partnership or any Giants Subsidiary.

 



 

(iii) If a Required Jaguar JV Consent with respect to any Included Interest
holding a direct or indirect interest in the Included Properties set forth on
_Section 5.2(h)(iii)(A)_ of the Jaguar Disclosure Letter is not obtained
prior to the Closing, the applicable Included Interest the contribution of
which requires such Required Jaguar JV Consent will be deemed a "Kickout
Interest" for purposes of this Agreement and the

 



      
 

 



 

contribution of such Kickout Interest shall not occur. If a Required JV
Consent with respect to any Included Interest holding a direct or indirect
interest in the Included Properties set forth on _Section 5.2(h)(iii)(B)_ of
the Jaguar Disclosure Letter is not obtained prior to the Closing, then the
Managing Member Interest with respect to any such Included Interest will be
deemed an "Excluded Managing Member Interest" for purposes of this Agreement
and shall not be contributed to Giants, the Operating Partnership or any
Giants Subsidiary.

 



 

(iv) If an Included Interest identified on _Section 5._ _2(h)(iv)_ of the
Jaguar Disclosure Letter is not acquired prior to or concurrently with the
Closing and therefore is not able to be contributed at the time of Closing for
any reason, then such Included Interest will be deemed a "Kickout Interest"
for purposes of this Agreement and the contribution of such Kickout Interest
shall not occur.

 



 

(i) The Giant Parties will use commercially reasonable efforts to replace
recourse guarantees in respect of any Indebtedness that will continue in place
after the Closing Date or other similar obligations of any Jaguar Party or
Affiliate of any Jaguar Party related to an Included Assets and which such
Jaguar Party reasonably believe would be advisable in connection with this
Transaction, with respect to liabilities arising thereunder from and after the
Closing Date. To the extent the Parties are unable to replace such guarantee
or other similar obligation, then Giants or a suitable Giants Subsidiary will
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the applicable Jaguar Party and its
agents, assigns and successors from and against all Liabilities and expenses
incurred by such Jaguar Party to the beneficiaries of the guarantees or other
similar agreement arising out of, relating to, or resulting from the failure
of Giants to obtain a release of such guarantees or similar agreements
previously made by such Jaguar Party with respect to an Included Asset with
respect to liabilities arising thereunder from and after the Closing Date.

 



 

Section 5.3. _Publicity_. So long as this Agreement is in effect, none of the
Giants Parties or the Jaguar Parties, nor any of their respective Affiliates
or Representatives, shall issue or cause the publication of any press release
or other public announcement with respect to the Transactions or this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party, unless such
Party determines, after consultation with outside counsel, that it is required
by applicable Law or by any listing agreement with or the listing rules of a
national securities exchange or trading market to issue or cause the
publication of any press release or other public announcement with respect to
the Transactions or this Agreement, in which event such Party shall endeavor,
on a basis reasonable under the circumstances, to provide a meaningful
opportunity to the other Party to review and comment upon such press release
or other public announcement and shall give due consideration to all
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) the Giants Parties shall not be required to provide any
such review or comment to the Jaguar Parties in connection with the receipt
and existence of a Takeover Proposal and matters related thereto or an Adverse
Recommendation Change and (ii) this _Section 5.3_ does not apply to the
information that the Parties are required to include in any notification
required under the HSR Act or in connection with their responses to any
inquiries from a Governmental Entity regarding the Transactions.

or replacement) except as provided in _Section 5.4_ of the Giants Disclosure
Letter, (C) perform and otherwise comply, or cause its agents to perform and
otherwise comply, in all material respects with, all of the obligations of the

respects the Giants Properties in their current condition (ordinary wear and

any information relating to Giants or the Jaguar Parties, or any of their
respective Affiliates or, in the case of the Jaguar Parties, management,
should be discovered by Giants or the Jaguar Parties which, in the reasonable
judgment of Giants or the Jaguar Parties, should be set forth in an amendment
of, or a supplement to, the Proxy Statement, so that such document would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto, and Giants and the

(i) solicit, initiate, knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage any
inquiries or discussion regarding, or the making of any proposal or offer that

(ii) continue, enter into or participate in any discussions with any Person

connection with, or knowingly facilitate any third party in making a Takeover
Proposal (other than to state that Giants is not permitted to have
discussions), (iii) approve, recommend, publicly declare advisable or execute
or enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle or Contract with respect to a Takeover Proposal (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement), or requiring or having the effect of

existing discussions, negotiations or communications with any third party
conducted heretofore with respect to a Takeover Proposal, and (ii) take such
action as is necessary to enforce any confidentiality provisions or provisions
of similar effect to which Giants or any Giants Subsidiary is a party or of
which Giants or any Giants Subsidiary is a beneficiary; _provided_ , that
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, it is understood
and agreed that Giants, the Operating Partnership and each other Giants
Subsidiary (as applicable) by execution of this Agreement shall be deemed to
have waived immediately prior to the date of this Agreement any provision in
any agreement that prohibits the counterparty thereto from confidentially
requesting Giants, the Operating Partnership or any other Giants Subsidiary
(as applicable) to amend or waive the standstill provision in such agreement
(i.e., a "dont ask, dont waive" provision) to the extent necessary (and only
to such extent) to enable such counterparty to convey a Takeover Proposal to
the Giants Board;

 



      
 

 



 

 _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this Agreement, the Giants Board shall be permitted to modify,
waive, amend or release any existing standstill obligation owed by any Person
that prohibits a confidential Takeover Proposal being made directly, or
indirectly through Representatives of Giants, to Giants, the Operating
Partnership or any other Giants Subsidiary (as applicable) to the extent the
Giants Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
directors duties under applicable Law, so long as (A) such modification,
waiver, amendment or release is limited only to permitting such a confidential
Takeover Proposal and (B) Giants promptly (and in any event, within twenty-
four (24) hours) notifies the Jaguar Parties of the granting of such
modification, waiver, amendment or release. Giants shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause all third parties who have been furnished
confidential information regarding Giants or any Giants Subsidiary in
connection with the solicitation of or discussions regarding a Takeover
Proposal within the twelve (12) months prior to the date of this Agreement to
promptly return or destroy such information (to the extent that they are
entitled to have such information returned or destroyed).

 



 

(b) At any time prior to obtaining the Giants Stockholder Approval, following
the receipt by Giants of an unsolicited bona fide Takeover Proposal (that was
not the result of a breach of this _Section 5.7_) after the date of this
Agreement, (i) the Giants Board shall be permitted to participate in
discussions regarding such Takeover Proposal solely to clarify the terms of
such Takeover Proposal (provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, Giants
shall be required to comply with the provisions of _Section 5.7(c)_ with
respect thereto), and (ii) if the Giants Board determines in good faith after
consultation with outside legal counsel that such Takeover Proposal
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal,
then Giants may, in response to such Takeover Proposal, (x) furnish access and
non-public information with respect to Giants and any of the Giants
Subsidiaries to the Person who has made such Takeover Proposal pursuant to an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, so long as any written material non-
public information provided under this clause (x) has previously been provided
to the Jaguar Parties or is provided to the Jaguar Parties substantially
concurrently with the time it is provided to such Person, and (y) participate
in discussions and negotiations regarding such Takeover Proposal.

 



 

(c) From and after the date of this Agreement, Giants shall promptly advise
the Jaguar Parties of (i) the receipt of any Takeover Proposal or any inquiry
from any Person seeking to have discussion or negotiations with Giants or any
of its Representatives relating to a possible Takeover Proposal, specifying
the identity of the third party making the Takeover Proposal or such inquiry
and the material terms and conditions thereof (including a copy thereof if in
writing, and any related documentation or correspondence), and (ii) any
material modifications to the financial or other material terms and conditions
of such Takeover Proposal (and any related documentation or correspondence
related thereto), in each case, within twenty-four (24) hours after Giants
receipt thereof. Giants shall also promptly, and in any event within twenty-
four (24) hours, notify the Jaguar Parties orally and in writing, if Giants
(i) enters into discussions or negotiations concerning any Takeover Proposal,
or (ii) provides non-public information or data to any third party in
accordance with _Section 5.7(b)_, and keep the Jaguar Parties reasonably
informed of the status and material terms of any such Takeover Proposal on a
reasonably current basis, including by providing a copy of all material
documentation or material correspondence relating thereto.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Except as set forth in _Section 5.7(e)_ and _Section 5.7(f)_, the Giants
Board shall not (i) withhold, withdraw, qualify, modify or amend the Giants
Board Recommendation or publicly propose to do any of the foregoing in any
manner adverse to the Jaguar Parties, (ii) approve, endorse, recommend or
otherwise declare advisable a Takeover Proposal (or publicly propose to do any
of the foregoing), (iii) approve, recommend or allow Giants to enter into any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle or
Contract relating to a Takeover Proposal (or publicly propose to do any of the
foregoing) (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement), (iv) fail to
include the Giants Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, or (v) fail to
publicly recommend against any Takeover Proposal, or fail to publicly reaffirm
the Giants Board Recommendation, within ten (10) Business Days after the
written request of the Jaguar Parties following a Takeover Proposal that has
been publicly announced (or such fewer number of days as remains prior to the
Giants Stockholder Meeting) (provided that the Jaguar Parties shall not be
permitted to make any such request on more than one (1) occasion in respect of
(A) each Takeover Proposal and (B) each material amendment or material
modification of each such Takeover Proposal) (any of the foregoing, an "
_Adverse Recommendation Change_ ").

 



 

(e) At any time before the date the Giants Stockholder Approval is obtained,
the Giants Board may (i) make an Adverse Recommendation Change if (x) the
Giants Board has received an unsolicited bona fide Takeover Proposal (that did
not result from a breach of this _Section 5.7_) that the Giants Board has
concluded (in good faith), following consultation with its outside legal
counsel, and after giving effect to all of the adjustments which may be
offered by the Jaguar Parties pursuant to _Section 5.7(f)_, constitutes a
Superior Proposal, and (y) determines, following consultation with its outside
legal counsel, that failure to take such action would reasonably be expected
to be inconsistent with the directors duties under applicable Law, and in
such case Giants may terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(c)(ii)_ and enter into a Contract with respect to such Superior Proposal;
or (ii) make an Adverse Recommendation Change as a result of an Intervening
Event, if the Giants Board determines in good faith, following consultation
with its outside legal counsel, and after giving effect to all of the
adjustments which may be offered by the Jaguar Parties pursuant to _Section
5.7(f)_, that failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the directors duties under applicable Law.

 



 

(f) The Giants Board shall not be entitled to effect an Adverse Recommendation
Change pursuant to _Section 5.7(e)_ or terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ unless (i) Giants has provided a written notice (a "
_Notice of Superior Proposal/Intervening Event_ ") to the Jaguar Parties that
Giants intends to take such action, specifying in reasonable detail the
reasons therefor and, (A) in the case of a Superior Proposal, describing the
material terms and conditions of, and attaching the most recent draft of, the
Superior Proposal that is the basis of such action (it being understood that
such material terms shall include the identity of the third party making such
Superior Proposal), and (B) in the case of an Intervening Event, the material
facts and circumstances (based on information reasonably available) related to
such Intervening Event, (ii) during the five (5) Business Day period following
the Jaguar Parties receipt of the Notice of Superior Proposal/Intervening
Event, Giants shall, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
its Representatives to, negotiate with the Jaguar Parties in good faith (to
the extent the Jaguar Parties desire to negotiate) to make such adjustments in
the terms and conditions of this Agreement (A) so that, in

 



      
 

 



 

the case of a Superior Proposal, the Superior Proposal ceases to be a Superior
Proposal, and (B) in the case of an Intervening Event, as may be proposed by
the Jaguar Parties, and (iii) following the end of the five (5) Business Day
period, the Giants Board shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, taking into account any changes to
this Agreement proposed in writing by the Jaguar Parties in response to the
Notice of Superior Proposal/Intervening Event or otherwise, that (A) in the
case of a Superior Proposal, the Superior Proposal giving rise to the Notice
of Superior Proposal/Intervening Event continues to constitute a Superior
Proposal and the failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to
_Section 5.7(e)_ or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(c)(ii)_ would still reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the
directors duties under applicable Law, or (B) in the case of an Intervening
Event, the failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to
_Section 5.7(e)_ would still reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with
the directors duties under applicable Law. Any material change to the terms
of a Superior Proposal, including any change to the financial terms, shall
require a new Notice of Superior Proposal/Intervening Event and Giants shall
be required to comply again with the requirements of this _Section 5.7(f)_;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in connection with the second and any subsequent
Notice of Superior Proposal/Intervening Event, if any, references to five (5)
Business Days in this _Section 5.7(f)_ shall be deemed to be references to
two (2) Business Days instead.

 



 

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit Giants from complying
with Rules 14a-9, 14d-9, 14e-2 and Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated
under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement
pending disclosure of its position thereunder or making any required
disclosure to Giants stockholders if, in the judgment of the Giants Board,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, the failure to do so would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors duties under
applicable Law or such disclosure is otherwise required under applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any disclosure other than a "stop, look and
listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14a-9,
14d-9, 14e-2 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange
Act, an express rejection of any applicable Takeover Proposal or an express
reaffirmation of the Giants Board Recommendation shall be deemed to be an
Adverse Recommendation Change.

 



 

(h) For purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

(i) " _Intervening Event_ " shall mean any material event, fact, circumstance,
change, development or occurrence that arises or otherwise becomes known from
or after the date of this Agreement that is unknown and not reasonably

understood by the Giants Board as of the date hereof), which material event,
fact, circumstance, change, development, occurrence, magnitude or material
consequence becomes known to or by the Giants Board prior to obtaining the

that the underlying causes of any such decline may be considered in
determining whether an Intervening Event has occurred); and (C) the fact that

revenue or earnings

such event may be considered in determining whether an Intervening Event has
occurred).

in consultation with its legal and financial advisors and taking into account
all financial, legal, regulatory and any other aspects that the Giants Board
deems relevant, (i) is on terms and conditions more favorable from a financial
point of view to the stockholders of Giants than those contemplated by this
Agreement (taking into account, without limitation, any termination fees and
expense reimbursement provisions contemplated by this Agreement or the
Takeover Proposal) and (ii) is reasonably likely to be consummated (if
accepted) on the terms proposed.

Section 6.5. _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) To the fullest extent permitted by Law, from and after the Closing, Giants
shall provide exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses for
each Indemnitee, which is at least as favorable in scope and amount to such
Indemnitee as the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses
provided to such Indemnitee by Giants and the Giants Subsidiaries, as
applicable, immediately prior to the Closing in the Giants Charter and the
Giants Bylaws or each of the Giants Subsidiaries respective articles or
certificates of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational or
governing documents), as in effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_
that such exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses covers
actions and omissions at or prior to the Closing, including all Transactions.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Closing, Giants shall obtain and fully pay the premium for
the non-cancellable extension of the coverage afforded by Giants existing
directors and officers liability insurance policies and Giants existing
fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, the " _D andO
Insurance_"), in each case, for a claims reporting or discovery period of at
least six (6) years from and after the Closing with respect to any claim
related to any period of time at or prior to the Closing from one or more
insurance carriers with the same or better credit rating as Giants current
insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with terms, conditions and
retentions that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the coverage
provided under Giants existing policies and with limits of liability that are
no lower than the limits on Giants existing policies. If Giants for any
reason fails to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Closing,
Giants shall continue to maintain in effect, for a period of at least six (6)
years from and after the Closing, the DandO Insurance in place as of the date
hereof with Giants current insurance carrier or with an insurance carrier
with the same or better credit rating as Giants current insurance carrier
with respect to DandO Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of
liability that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the coverage
provided under the Giants existing policies as of the date hereof; _provided_
, _however_ , that Giants shall not be required to pay an annual premium for
the DandO Insurance in excess of 300% of the annual premium currently paid by
Giants for such insurance; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual
premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Giants shall be
obligated to obtain a

 



      
 

 



 

policy with the greatest coverage available, with respect to matters occurring
prior to the Closing, for a cost not exceeding such amount.

 



 

(c) The Indemnitees to whom this _Section 6.5_ applies are intended to be
third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.5_. The provisions of this
_Section 6.5_ are intended to be for the benefit of each Indemnitee and his
or her successors, heirs, executors, trustees, fiduciaries, administrators or
representatives. Giants shall pay all reasonable expenses, including
attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnitee in successfully
enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this _Section 6.5_.

 



 

(d) The rights of each Indemnitee under this _Section 6.5_ shall be in
addition to, and shall not be deemed to be exclusive of, any rights such
Person or any employee of Giants or any Giants Subsidiary may have under the
Giants Charter, the Giants Bylaws or the certificate of incorporation or
bylaws (or equivalent organizational or governing documents) of any of the
Giants Subsidiaries, or under any applicable Law or under any agreement of any
Indemnitee or any employee with Giants or any Giants Subsidiaries. Nothing in
this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive
or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance claims under any
policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Giants Parties or
their respective Subsidiaries or its or their respective officers, directors
and employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification
provided for in this _Section 6.5_ is not prior to, or in substitution for,
any such claims under any such policies.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, this
_Section 6.5_ shall survive the consummation of the Transactions indefinitely
and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all successors and assigns of
Giants and the Giants Subsidiaries, and shall be enforceable by the
Indemnitees and their successors, heirs or representatives. In the event that
Giants or any of its successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger, or transfers or conveys all or a
majority of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such
case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of
Giants, as applicable, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this
_Section 6.5_.

 



 

Section 6.6. _Further Assurances_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions contained herein, the Parties agree, both prior to and following
the Closing (for a period not to exceed twelve (12) months) (a) to use
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and
to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective the transfer of the Included Interests
contemplated hereunder, (b) to execute any documents, instruments or
conveyances of any kind which may be reasonably necessary or advisable to
carry out the transfer of the Included Interests contemplated hereunder, and

addition, if requested by the Giants Parties, the Jaguar Parties agree prior
to Closing to use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver requests for

(iii) if (w) all of the conditions to the Closing set forth in _Section 7.1_

any Giants Party fails to complete the Closing on the date the Closing should

Section 8.2. _Effect of Termination_. In the event that this Agreement is
terminated and the Closing and the other Transactions are abandoned pursuant
to _Section 8.1_, written notice thereof shall be given to the other party or

the Giants Subsidiaries, Jaguar Parties Subsidiaries or any of Giants
Parties or the Jaguar Parties respective Representatives), and all rights
and obligations of any party hereto shall cease; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary (a) no such
termination shall relieve any party hereto of any liability or damages

breach of this Agreement prior to such termination of this Agreement, in which
case the aggrieved party shall be entitled to all rights and remedies
available at law or in equity; and (b) the Confidentiality Agreement, this

months. For avoidance of doubt, and without limiting the foregoing, any
failure of the Giants Parties or the Jaguar Parties (as applicable) to effect

material breach of this Agreement by such parties. If this Agreement is

made pursuant to this Agreement, to the extent practicable, shall be withdrawn
from the Governmental Entity or other Person to which they were made.

 



       
 

 



 

Section 8.3. _Termination Fee; Expense Reimbursement_.

 



 

(a) If, but only if, the Agreement is terminated:

 



 

(i) by either Giants or the Jaguar Parties pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_,
or by the Jaguar Parties pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(i)_, and, in any such
case, (x) the Giants Board receives or has received a Takeover Proposal after
the date of this Agreement, which proposal has not been subsequently withdrawn
(and with respect to a termination pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_, which
proposal has been publicly announced) and (y) within twelve (12) months of the
termination of this Agreement, Giants or any of the Giants Subsidiaries enters
into a transaction regarding, or executes a definitive agreement with respect
to any Takeover Proposal, then Giants shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the
Jaguar Parties a fee equal to $55,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ "), less,
if previously paid, the Expense Amount, by wire transfer of same day funds to
an account or accounts designated by the Jaguar Parties, not later than two
(2) Business Days following the execution of such definitive agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of this _Section 8.3(a)(i)_, the
references to "20%" in the definition of Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to
be references to "50%"; or

 



 

(ii) by Giants pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ or the Jaguar Parties
pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_, as applicable, then Giants shall pay, or
cause to be paid, to the Jaguar Parties the Termination Fee by wire transfer
of same day funds to an account or accounts designated by the Jaguar Parties,
not later than two (2) Business Days following such termination; or

 



 

(iii) by either Giants or the Jaguar Parties pursuant to _Section
8.1(b)(iii)_, then Giants shall reimburse the Jaguar Parties for its actual
reasonable out-of-pocket Expenses up to a maximum amount of $10,000,000 (the "
_Expense Amount_ ") by wire transfer of same day funds to an account or
accounts designated by the Jaguar Parties within thirty (30) days after
receipt by Giants of written notice of demand for payment and a documented
itemization setting forth in reasonable detail all such Expenses of the Jaguar
Parties; or

 



 

(iv) by Giants pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_, if as of the Outside Date the
conditions set forth in _Section 7.2(h)_ have not been satisfied, then the
Jaguar Parties shall reimburse the Giants Parties for their reasonable out-of-

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Parties agree that:

 



 

(i) under no circumstances shall Giants be required to pay the Termination Fee
or Expense Amount (x) earlier than one (1) full Business Day after

 



      
 

 



 

receipt of appropriate wire transfer instructions from the Jaguar Parties or
(y) on more than one occasion; and

 



 

(ii) under no circumstances shall the Jaguar Parties be required to pay the
Expense Amount (x) earlier than one (1) full Business Day after receipt of

(c) Each of the Parties acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained in this
_Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the Transactions, (ii) the Termination
Fee and Expense Amount payable to the Jaguar Parties and the Expense Amount
payable to the Giants Parties are not penalties, but are liquidated damages,
in a reasonable amount that will compensate the Jaguar Parties or the Giants
Parties, as applicable, in the circumstances in which such amounts are payable
for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the Transactions, which amounts would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision, and (iii) without these
agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if
any Party fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to this _Section 8.3_
and, in order to obtain such payment, the Party entitled to such payment
commences a suit that results in a judgment against the other Party for the
payment of any amount set forth in this _Section 8.3_, the Party against whom
such judgment was rendered shall pay the Party entitled to such payment its
costs and expenses in connection with such suit, together with interest on
such amount at the rate of eight percent (8%) per annum for the period from
the date such payment was required to be made through the date such payment
was actually received, or such lesser rate as is the maximum permitted by
applicable Law.

 



 

(d) Upon termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, in the
event the Jaguar Parties are entitled to receive the Termination Fee or
Expense Amount pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)(i _ _iii)_ , the receipt by the
Jaguar Parties of such Termination Fee or Expense Amount shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Jaguar Parties and their respective Affiliates against
the Giants Parties and their former, current or future stockholders,
directors, officers, Affiliates, agents or other Representatives for any loss
suffered as a result of any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement in this Agreement or the failure of the Closing or the other
Transactions to be consummated, and upon payment of such Termination Fee or
Expense Amount, neither the Giants Parties nor any of their former, current or
future stockholders, directors, officers, Affiliates, agents or other
Representatives shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the Closing or the other Transactions;
_provided_ that, nothing in this _Section 8.3(d)_ shall relieve any Person
from any liabilities or damages resulting from or arising out of any fraud or
willful or intentional material breach of this Agreement prior to or in
connection with such termination in which case the Jaguar Parties shall be
entitled to all the rights and remedies available at Law or in equity.

 



 

(e) (i) If the Jaguar Parties are required to make a payment to the Giants
Parties pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)(iv)_ (the " _Giants Expense
Reimbursement_ ") such Giants Expense Reimbursement shall be paid into escrow
on the date such payment is required to be paid by the Jaguar Parties pursuant
to this Agreement by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an escrow
account designated in accordance with this _Section 8.3(e)_. In the event
that the Jaguar Parties are obligated to pay the Giants Parties the Giants
Expense Reimbursement, the

 



      
 

 



 

amount payable to the Giants Parties in any tax year of Giants shall not
exceed the lesser of (i) the Giants Expense Reimbursement payable to the
Giants Parties, and (ii) the sum of (A) the maximum amount that can be paid to
the Giants Parties without causing Giants to fail to meet the requirements of
Section 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code for the relevant tax year, determined as
if the payment of such amount did not constitute income described in Sections
856(c)(2) or 856(c)(3) of the Code (" _Qualifying Income_ ") and Giants has
$1,000,000 of income from unknown sources during such year which is not
Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or anticipated income which is not
Qualifying Income), in each case, as determined by Giants Parties independent
accountants, plus (B) in the event the Giants Parties receive either (x) a
letter from the Giants Parties counsel indicating that the Giants Parties has
received a ruling from the IRS as described below in this _Section 8.3(e)_ or
(y) an opinion from the Giants Parties outside counsel as described below in
this _Section 8.3(e)_, an amount equal to the excess of the Giants Expense
Reimbursement less the amount payable under clause (A) above.

 



 

(ii) To secure the Jaguar Parties obligation to pay these amounts, the Jaguar
Parties shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash equal to the Giants
Expense Reimbursement with an escrow agent selected by the Jaguar Parties on
such terms (subject to this _Section 8.3(e)_) as shall be mutually agreed
upon by the Jaguar Parties, the Giants Parties and the escrow agent. The
payment or deposit into escrow of the Giants Expense Reimbursement pursuant to
this _Section 8.3(e)_ shall be made at the time the Jaguar Parties are
obligated to pay the Giants Parties such amount pursuant to _Section 8.3_ by
wire transfer. The escrow agreement shall provide that the Giants Expense
Reimbursement in escrow or any portion thereof shall not be released to the
Giants Parties unless the escrow agent receives any one or combination of the
following: (A) a letter from the Giants Parties independent accountants
indicating the maximum amount that can be paid by the escrow agent to the
Giants Parties without causing Giants to fail to meet the requirements of
Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as if the payment of such
amount did not constitute Qualifying Income and Giants has $1,000,000 of
income from unknown sources during such year which is not Qualifying Income
(in addition to any known or anticipated income which is not Qualifying
Income), in which case the escrow agent shall release such amount to the
Giants Parties, or (B) a letter from the Giants Parties counsel indicating
that (x) the Giants Parties received a ruling from the IRS holding that the
receipt by the Giants Parties of the Giants Expense Reimbursement would either
constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income within the
meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code or (y) the Giants Parties
outside counsel has rendered a legal opinion to the effect that the receipt by
the Giants Parties of the Giants Expense Reimbursement should either
constitute Qualifying Income or should be excluded from gross income within
the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, in which case the
escrow agent shall release the remainder of the Giants Expense Reimbursement
to the Giants Parties. The Jaguar Parties agree to amend this _Section
8.3(e)_ at the reasonable request of the Giants Parties in order to (1)
maximize the portion of the Giants Expense Reimbursement that may be
distributed to the Giants Parties hereunder without causing the Giants Parties
to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, or
(2) assist the Giants Parties in obtaining a favorable ruling or legal opinion
from its outside counsel, in each case, as described in this _Section
8.3(e)_. Any amount of the Giants Expense Reimbursement that remains unpaid as
of the end of a taxable year shall be paid as soon

 



      
 

 



 

as possible during the following taxable year, subject to the foregoing
limitations of this _Section 8.3(e)_.

 



 

(f) Upon termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, in the
event the Giants Parties are entitled to receive the Expense Amount pursuant
to _Section 8.3(a)(iv)_, the receipt by the Giants Parties of such Expense
Amount shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Giants Parties and their
respective Affiliates against the Jaguar Parties and their former, current or
future stockholders, directors, officers, Affiliates, agents or other
Representatives for any loss suffered as a result of any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement or the
failure of the Closing or the other Transactions to be consummated, and upon
payment of such Expense Amount, neither the Jaguar Parties nor any of their
former, current or future stockholders, directors, officers, Affiliates,
agents or other Representatives shall have any further liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Closing or the other
Transactions; _provided_ that, nothing in this _Section 8.3(f)_ shall relieve
any Person from any liabilities or damages resulting from or arising out of
any fraud or willful or intentional material breach of this Agreement prior to
or in connection with such termination in which case the Giants Parties shall
be entitled to all the rights and remedies available at Law or in equity.

Section 9.8. _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
Sections, such reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." The table of contents and headings

 



      
 

 



 

set forth in this Agreement are for convenience of reference purposes only and
shall not affect or be deemed to affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement or any term or provision hereof. When
reference is made herein to a Person, such reference shall be deemed to
include all direct and indirect Subsidiaries of such Person unless otherwise
indicated or the context otherwise requires. All references herein to the
Subsidiaries of a Person shall be deemed to include all direct and indirect
Subsidiaries of such Person unless otherwise indicated or the context
otherwise requires. The Parties agree that they have been represented by
counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and, therefore,
waive the application of any Law, regulation, holding or rule of construction
providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be construed
against the party drafting such agreement or document.

 



 

Section 9.9. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile, portable
document format (.pdf) or other electronic means shall be effective as
delivery of a manually executed counterpart to this Agreement.

 



 

Section 9.10. _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement (including the Giants Disclosure Letter and the Jaguar
Disclosure Letter) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire
agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the Parties or any of them with respect to the subject
matter hereof and thereof.

 



 

(b) Neither this Agreement (including the Giants Disclosure Letter and the
Jaguar Disclosure Letter) nor the Confidentiality Agreement are intended to
confer upon any Person, other than the Parties and their successors and
permitted assigns, any rights or remedies hereunder, other than _Section 6.5_
(Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance) and _Section 9.16_
(No Recourse).

 



 

Section 9.11. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner adverse to any
Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the
Transactions are fulfilled to the extent possible.

 



 

Section 9.12. _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement, and all claims or causes of actions (whether at Law, in
contract or in tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or related to this
Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement,
shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State
of Maryland without giving effect to conflicts of laws

 



      
 

 



 

principles (whether of the State of Maryland or any other jurisdiction that
would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the
State of Maryland).

 



 

(b) All Actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard
and determined exclusively in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland,
or if jurisdiction over the matter is vested exclusively in federal courts,
the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, and the
appellate courts to which orders and judgments thereof may be appealed (the "
_Chosen Courts_ "). Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
(a) submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts for the purpose
of any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by any
Party, whether sounding in tort, contract or otherwise, (b) consents to the
assignment of any proceeding in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland
to the Business and Technology Case Management Program pursuant to Maryland
Rule 16-205 (or any successor thereof), (c) agrees not to commence any such
action or proceeding except in such courts, (d) agrees that any claim in
respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in any
Chosen Court, (e) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively
do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue
of any such action or proceeding, and (f) waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of
such action or proceeding. Each of the Parties agrees that a final judgment in
any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.
Each Party irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided
for notices in _Section 9.5_. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right
of any Party to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.

 



 

Section 9.13. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (B) IT
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (C) IT MAKES
SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS _SECTION 9.13_.

 



 

Section 9.14. _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assigned by any of the
Parties (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other Parties. Any assignment referred to in the immediately
preceding sentence shall not relieve any Party of any obligation hereunder,
and following such assignment this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to
the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective
successors and assigns.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 9.15. _Enforcement; Remedies_.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly
conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any
other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such Party, and the
exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any
other remedy.

 



 

(b) The Parties right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the
Transactions and each Party hereby waives any objections to the grant of the
equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches of
this Agreement by any other Party (including any objection on the basis that
there is an adequate remedy at Law or that an award of specific performance is
not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity), and except as set
forth in this _Section 9.15_, each Party shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of, or to
enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of such Party under
this Agreement all in accordance with the terms of this _Section 9.15_. In
the event any Party seeks an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, such Party shall not be required to provide any bond or other
security in connection with such order or injunction all in accordance with
the terms of this _Section 9.15_.

 



 

Section 9.16. _No Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and
any claims or causes of action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate
to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement may only be made against the entities that are expressly identified
as Parties hereto and no former, current or future equity holders, controlling
persons, directors, officers, employees, agents or Affiliates of any Party,
any Financing Source or any former, current or future stockholder, controlling
person, director, officer, employee, general or limited partner, member,
manager, agent or Affiliate of any of the foregoing (each, a " _Non-Recourse
Party_ ") shall have any liability for any obligations or liabilities of the
Parties to this Agreement or for any claim (whether at Law or equity, in
contract, tort or otherwise) based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the
Transactions or in respect of any representations made or alleged to be made
in connection herewith. Without limiting the rights of any Party against the
other Parties hereto, in no event shall any Party or any of its Affiliates
seek to enforce this Agreement against, make any claims for breach of this
Agreement against, or seek to recover monetary damages from, any Non-Recourse
Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section 9.16_ shall in no way be
deemed to limit the liability or obligations of any Party to the extent that
such Party is required to cause its subsidiaries, Affiliates or
Representatives to take any action or refrain from taking any action pursuant
to this Agreement.

 



 

Section 9.17. _Joint and Several_. Unless otherwise specifically indicated
herein, the obligations of the Jaguar Parties hereunder, on the one hand, and
the Giants Parties hereunder, on the other hand, are joint and several.

 **Schedule B**

 



 

Ten Business Days before Closing, the Jaguar Parties shall deliver to Giants a
schedule showing for each Included Asset the shares that would be attributable
to Fund I, Fund II and nonaccredited investors in the other Jaguar Funds (the
" _Cash Recipients_ "), and an estimate of the expected Cash Consideration
based on the recent trading prices of a share of Giants common stock. The
actual Cash Consideration will be determined by multiplying the aggregate
amount of shares attributable to the Cash Recipients by the average of the
high and the low trading price of a share of Giants common stock one Business
Day before Closing.

(the " _Resale Shelf Registration Statement_ ") and permitting registration of
such Registrable Securities for resale by such Holders in accordance with the
methods of distribution elected by the Holders and set forth in the Resale
Shelf Registration Statement and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
such Resale Shelf Registration Statement to become effective by the first
anniversary of the consummation date of the Combination Transactions (the "
_One-Year Anniversary_ "). Subject to _Sections 2.1(c)_ and _2.9_ , the
Company shall keep such Resale Shelf Registration Statement continuously
effective for a period ending when all shares of Common Stock covered by the
Resale Shelf Registration Statement are no longer Registrable Securities.

 



 

(b) The Company may, at its option, satisfy its obligation to prepare and file
a Resale Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ with
respect to shares of Common Stock issuable upon exchange of OP Units by
preparing and filing a registration statement on an appropriate form that
complies in all material respects with applicable Commission rules for an
offering to be made on a delayed or continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415
under the Securities Act (an " _Issuer Shelf Registration Statement_ ")
providing for (i) the issuance by the Company, from time to time, to the
Holders of such OP Units, of shares of Common Stock registered under the
Securities Act (the " _Primary Shares_ ") and (ii) to the extent such Primary
Shares constitute Restricted Shares, the registered resale thereof by their
Holders from time to time in accordance with the methods of distribution
elected by the Holders and set forth therein (but not an underwritten
offering) and using commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Issuer Shelf
Registration Statement to become effective by the One-Year Anniversary.
Subject to _Sections 2.1(c)_ and _2.9_ , the Company shall keep such Issuer
Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective for a period (the "
_Effectiveness Period_ ") expiring on the date all of the OP Units pursuant to
which Registrable Securities may be issued have been redeemed for shares of
Common Stock. If the Company shall exercise its rights under this _Section
2.1(b)_, Holders (other than Holders of Restricted Shares) shall have no right
to have shares of Common Stock issued or issuable upon exchange of OP Units
included in a Resale Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to _Section
2.1(a)_.

 



 

(c) _Subsequent Filing_. The Company shall prepare and file such additional
registration statements as necessary every three (3) years and use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration statements to
become effective so that a Shelf Registration Statement remains continuously
effective, subject to _Section 2.9_, with respect to resales of Registrable
Securities as and for the periods required under _Sections 2.1(a)_ or _(b)_ ,
as applicable (such subsequent registration statements to constitute a Resale
Shelf Registration Statement or an Issuer Shelf Registration Statement, as the
case may be, hereunder).

 



      
 

 



 

(d) _Notice and Questionnaire_. At the request of the Company, each Holder
shall deliver a duly completed and executed written notice (each such notice,
a " _Notice and Questionnaire_ ") to the Company (i) notifying the Company of
such Holders desire to include Registrable Securities held by it in a Resale
Shelf Registration Statement, (ii) containing all information about such
Holder required to be included in such registration statement in accordance
with applicable law, including Item 507 of Regulation S-K promulgated under
the Securities Act, as amended from time to time, or any similar successor
rule thereto, and (iii) pursuant to which such Holder agrees to be bound by
the terms and conditions hereof. At the time a Resale Shelf Registration
Statement becomes effective, each Holder that has delivered a duly completed
and executed Notice and Questionnaire to the Company on or prior to the date
ten (10) Business Days prior to such time of effectiveness shall be named as a
selling securityholder in such Resale Shelf Registration Statement and the
related prospectus in such a manner as to permit such Holder to deliver such
prospectus to purchasers of Registrable Securities in accordance with
applicable law. If required by applicable law, subject to the terms and
conditions hereof, after effectiveness of the Resale Shelf Registration
Statement, the Company shall file a supplement to such prospectus or amendment
to the Resale Shelf Registration Statement not less than once a quarter as
necessary to name as selling securityholders therein any Holders that provide
to the Company a duly completed and executed Notice and Questionnaire and
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any post-effective
amendment to such Resale Shelf Registration Statement filed for such purpose
to be declared effective by the Commission as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the filing thereof. Any Holder that has not delivered a duly
completed and executed Notice and Questionnaire shall not be entitled to be
named as a Selling Holder in, or have the Registrable Securities held by it
covered by, a Resale Shelf Registration Statement.

 



 

Section 2.2. _Registration Procedures; Filings; Information_. Subject to
_Section 2.9_ hereof, in connection with any Resale Shelf Registration
Statement under _Section 2.1(a)_, the Company will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to effect the registration of the Registrable Securities
covered thereby in accordance with the intended method of disposition thereof
as quickly as practicable, and, in connection with any Issuer Shelf
Registration Statement under _Section 2.1(b)_, the Company will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to effect the registration of the Primary
Shares (including for resale, to the extent provided in clause (ii) of
_Section 2.1(b)_) as quickly as reasonably practicable. In connection with
any Shelf Registration Statement:

 



 

(a) At the request of the Selling Holder, the Company will, prior to filing a
Resale Shelf Registration Statement (or an Issuer Shelf Registration Statement
providing for resales pursuant to clause (ii) of _Section 2.1(b)_) or
prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, furnish without charge to
each Selling Holder of the Registrable Securities covered by such registration
statement copies of such registration statement as proposed to be filed, and
thereafter furnish to such Selling Holder such number of conformed copies of
such registration statement, each amendment and supplement thereto (in each
case including all exhibits thereto and documents incorporated by reference
therein, but excluding any documents to be incorporated by reference therein
that are publicly available on the Commissions EDGAR system), the prospectus
included in such registration statement (including each preliminary
prospectus) and such other documents as such Selling Holder may reasonably
request in order to facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities
owned by such Selling Holder.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) After the filing of a Resale Shelf Registration Statement (or an Issuer
Shelf Registration Statement providing for resales pursuant to clause (ii) of
_Section 2.1(b)_), the Company will promptly notify each Selling Holder of
Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement of any stop
order issued or threatened by the Commission and take all reasonable actions
required to prevent the entry of such stop order or to remove it if entered.

 



 

(c) The parties hereto hereby acknowledge that, generally, pursuant to Section
18 of the Securities Act, no state securities laws requiring, or with respect
to, registration or qualification of securities or securities transactions
will apply to a security that is a "covered security" (as defined therein).
"Covered securities," for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Act,
includes securities listed or authorized for listing on the NYSE (or certain
other national securities exchanges) and securities of the same issuer that
are equal in seniority or senior to such securities. In the event that the
Shares cease to constitute covered securities, subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, the Company will use its commercially reasonable
efforts to (i) register or qualify the Registrable Securities under such other
securities or "blue sky" laws of such jurisdictions in the United States
(where an exemption does not apply) as any Selling Holder reasonably (in light
of such Selling Holders intended plan of distribution) requests and (ii)
cause such Registrable Securities to be registered with or approved by such
other governmental agencies or authorities as may be necessary by virtue of
the business and operations of the Company and do any and all other acts and
things that may be reasonably necessary or advisable to enable such Selling
Holder to consummate the disposition of the Registrable Securities owned by
such Selling Holder; _provided that_ the Company will not be required to (A)
qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not
otherwise be required to qualify but for this paragraph (c), (B) subject
itself to general taxation in any such jurisdiction or (C) consent to general
service of process in any such jurisdiction. The Company will promptly notify
each Selling Holder of the receipt by the Company of any notification with
respect to the suspension of the qualification of any Registrable Securities
for sale under the securities or "blue sky" laws of any jurisdiction or the
initiation of any proceeding for such purpose.

 



 

(d) The Company will immediately notify each Selling Holder of such
Registrable Securities, at any time when a prospectus relating thereto is
required to be delivered under the Securities Act, of (i) the Companys
receipt of any notification of the suspension of the qualification of any
Registrable Securities covered by a Resale Shelf Registration Statement (or an
Issuer Shelf Registration Statement providing for resales pursuant to clause
(ii) of _Section 2.1(b)_) for sale in any jurisdiction; or (ii) the
occurrence of an event requiring the preparation of a supplement or amendment
to such prospectus so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of such
Registrable Securities, such prospectus will not contain an untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and promptly make
available to each Selling Holder any such supplement or amendment.

 



 

(e) The Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all
Registrable Securities covered by such Resale Shelf Registration Statement or
Primary Shares covered by such Issuer Shelf Registration Statement to be
listed on each securities exchange on which similar securities issued by the
Company are then listed.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) In addition to the Notice and Questionnaire, the Company may require each
Selling Holder of Registrable Securities to promptly furnish in writing to the
Company such information regarding such selling Holder, the Registrable
Securities held by it and the intended method of distribution of the
Registrable Securities as the Company may from time to time reasonably request
and such other information as may be legally required in connection with such
registration. No Holder may include Registrable Securities in any registration
statement pursuant to this Agreement unless and until such Holder has
furnished to the Company such information. Each Holder further agrees to
furnish as soon as reasonably practicable to the Company all information
required to be disclosed in order to make information previously furnished to
the Company by such Holder not misleading in light of the circumstances in
which they were made.

 



 

(g) Each Selling Holder agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the
Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in _Sections
2.2(b)_ or _(d)_ or upon receipt of a Suspension Notice, such Selling Holder
will forthwith discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to
the registration statement covering such Registrable Securities until such
Selling Holders receipt of written notice from the Company that such
disposition may be made and, in the case of clause (ii) of _Section 2.4(d)_
or, if applicable, _Section 2.9_, copies of any supplemented or amended
prospectus contemplated by clause (ii) of _Section 2.4(d)_ or, if applicable,
prepared under _Section 2.9_, and, if so directed by the Company, such
Selling Holder will deliver to the Company all copies, other than permanent
file copies then in such Selling Holders possession, of the most recent
prospectus covering such Registrable Securities at the time of receipt of such
notice. Each Selling Holder of Registrable Securities agrees that it will
immediately notify the Company at any time when a prospectus relating to the
registration of such Registrable Securities is required to be delivered under
the Securities Act of the happening of an event as a result of which
information previously furnished by such Selling Holder to the Company in
writing for inclusion in such prospectus contains an untrue statement of a
material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of
the circumstances in which they were made.

 



 

Section 2.3. _Registration Expenses_. In connection with any registration
statement required to be filed hereunder, the Company shall pay the following
registration expenses incurred in connection with the registration hereunder
(the " _Registration Expenses_ "), regardless whether such registration
statement is declared effective by the Commission: (i) all registration and
filing fees, (ii) fees and expenses of compliance with securities or "blue
sky" laws (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel in
connection with blue sky qualifications of the Registrable Securities), (iii)
printing expenses, (iv) internal expenses (including, without limitation, all
salaries and expenses of its officers and employees performing legal or
accounting duties), (v) the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the
listing of the Registrable Securities, (vi) reasonable fees and disbursements
of counsel for the Company, (vii) all fees and disbursements of the Companys
auditors, including in connection with the preparation of comfort letters, and
any transfer agent and registrar fees, and (viii) the reasonable fees and
expenses of any special experts retained by the Company in connection with
such registration. Registration Expenses shall not include any brokerage and
sales commission fees and disbursements of any counsel, accountants and other
advisors of any Holder, and any transfer taxes relating to the sale or
disposition of Common Stock by any Holder.

 



       
 

 



 

Section 2.4. _Indemnification by the Company_. The Company agrees to indemnify
and hold harmless each Selling Holder of Registrable Securities, its officers,
directors, agents, partners, members, employees, managers, advisors, sub-
advisors, attorneys, representatives and Affiliates, and each Person, if any,
who controls such Selling Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the
Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act from and against, as
incurred, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, judgments and
expenses (or actions in respect thereof) that arise out of or are based upon
any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained
in any registration statement, preliminary prospectus, prospectus, or free
writing prospectus relating to the Registrable Securities (in each case, as
amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or
supplements thereto), or that arise out of or are based upon any omission or
alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except insofar as
such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, judgments or expenses arise out of
or are based upon any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue
statement or omission included in reliance upon and in conformity with
information furnished in writing to the Company by such Selling Holder or on
such Selling Holders behalf expressly for inclusion therein.

 



 

Section 2.5. _Indemnification by Holders of Registrable Securities_. Each
Selling Holder agrees, severally but not jointly or jointly and severally, to
indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its officers, directors, agents,
employees, attorneys, representatives and Affiliates and each Person, if any,
who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the
Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the
foregoing indemnity from the Company to such Selling Holder, but only with
respect to information relating to such Selling Holder included in reliance
upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing by such Selling
Holder or on such Selling Holders behalf expressly for use in any
registration statement, preliminary prospectus, prospectus or free writing
prospectus relating to the Registrable Securities, or any amendment or
supplement thereto. In case any action or proceeding shall be brought against
the Company or its officers, directors or agents or any such controlling
person, in respect of which indemnity may be sought against such Selling
Holder, such Selling Holder shall have the rights and duties given to the
Company, and the Company or its officers, directors or agents or such
controlling person shall have the rights and duties given to such Selling
Holder, by _Section 2.6_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the total obligations
of such Selling Holder under this Agreement (including, but not limited to,
obligations arising under _Section 2.7_ herein) will be limited to an amount
equal to the net proceeds actually received by such Selling Holder (after
deducting any discounts and commissions) from the disposition of Registrable
Securities pursuant to such registration statement.

 



 

Section 2.6. _Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings_. In case any proceeding
(including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any
person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to _Section 2.4_
or _2.5_ , such person (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall promptly notify the
person against whom such indemnity may be sought (an " _Indemnifying Party_ ")
in writing and the Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense thereof,
including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to such
Indemnified Party, and shall assume the payment of all fees and expenses;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the failure of any Indemnified Party to give
such notice will not relieve such Indemnifying Party of any obligations under
this Section 2, except to the extent such Indemnifying Party is materially
prejudiced by

 



      
 

 



 

such failure. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Party shall have the
right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel
shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Party unless (i) the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of
such counsel or (ii) representation of the Indemnified Party by the counsel
retained by the Indemnifying Party would be inappropriate due to actual or
potential differing interests between the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnified Party. It is understood that the Indemnifying Party shall not, in
connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same
jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one
separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) at any time for
all such Indemnified Parties, and that all such fees and expenses shall be
reimbursed as they are incurred. In the case of any such separate firm for the
Indemnified Parties, such firm shall be designated in writing by (i) in the
case of Persons indemnified pursuant to _Section 2.4_ hereof, the Selling
Holders which owned a majority of the Registrable Securities sold under the
applicable registration statement and (ii) in the case of Persons indemnified
pursuant to _Section 2.5_, the Company. The Indemnifying Party shall not be
liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, but if settled with
such consent, or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the
Indemnifying Party shall indemnify and hold harmless such Indemnified Parties
from and against any loss or liability (to the extent stated above) by reason
of such settlement or judgment. No Indemnifying Party shall, without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened
proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Party is or could have been a
party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified
Party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such
Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such proceeding without
any admission of liability by such Indemnified Party.

 



 

Section 2.7. _Contribution_. If the indemnification provided for in _Section
2.4_ or _2.5_ hereof is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
unavailable to an Indemnified Party or insufficient in respect of any losses,
claims, damages, liabilities, judgments or expenses that otherwise would have
been covered by _Section 2.4_ or _2.5_ hereof, then each such Indemnifying
Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party, shall contribute to the
amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such losses,
claims, damages, liabilities, judgments or expenses in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and
of each Selling Holder, on the other hand, in connection with such statements
or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
judgments or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of each Selling Holder
on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether
the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or
alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by
such party.

 



 

The Company and the Selling Holders agree that it would not be just and
equitable if contribution pursuant to this _Section 2.7_ were determined by
pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take
account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately
preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Party as a
result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities, judgments or expenses
referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include,
subject to the limitations set forth

 



      
 

 



 

above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified
Party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this _Section 2.7_, no Selling Holder shall
be required to contribute any amount which in the aggregate exceeds the amount
by which the net proceeds actually received by such Selling Holder from the
sale of its securities to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which
such Selling Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such
untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person
guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of
the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was
not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Selling Holders
obligations to contribute pursuant to this _Section 2.7_, if any, are several
in proportion to the proceeds of the offering actually received by such
Selling Holder bears to the total proceeds of the offering received by all the
Selling Holders and not joint.

 



 

Section 2.8. _Rule 144_. The Company covenants that it will (a) make and keep
public information regarding the Company available as those terms are defined
in Rule 144, (b) file in a timely manner any reports and documents required to
be filed by it under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, (c) furnish to
any Holder forthwith upon request (i) a written statement by the Company as to
its compliance with the reporting requirements of Rule 144, the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act, and (ii) a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly
report of the Company and such other reports and documents so filed by the
Company, and (d) take such further action as any Holder may reasonably
request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable Holders to
sell Registrable Securities without registration under the Securities Act
within the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rule 144.

 



 

Section 2.9. _Suspension of Use of Registration Statement._

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 2.1(a)_, the Company shall be
permitted to postpone the filing of any Shelf Registration Statement (for
purposes of this _Section 2.9_, the " _Registration Statement_ "), and from
time to time to require Holders not to sell under the Registration Statement
or to suspend the use or effectiveness thereof, for such times as the Company
reasonably may determine is necessary and advisable (but in no event shall the
Company be entitled to exercise such right for more than an aggregate of 180
days in any rolling 12-month period commencing on the date of this Agreement,
except as a result of a refusal by the Commission to declare any post-
effective amendment to the Registration Statement effective after the Company
has used all commercially reasonable efforts to cause the post-effective
amendment to be declared effective by the Commission, in which case, the
Company must terminate the black-out period immediately following the
effective date of the post-effective amendment), if any of the following
events shall occur (each such circumstance a " _Suspension Event_ "): (i) a
majority of the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith
that (A) the offer or sale of any Registrable Securities would materially
impede, delay or interfere with any proposed financing, offer or sale of
securities, acquisition, disposition, corporate reorganization or other
material transaction involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries, (B) the
sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement would
require disclosure of non-public material information not otherwise required
to be disclosed under applicable law, or (C) (x) the Company has a bona fide
business purpose for preserving the confidentiality of a proposed transaction
described in clause (A) above, (y) disclosure of such proposed transaction
would have a material adverse effect on the Company or the Companys ability
to consummate

 



      
 

 



 

such transaction, or (z) such proposed transaction renders the Company unable
to comply with Commission requirements, in each case under circumstances that
would make it impractical or inadvisable to cause the Registration Statement
(or such filings) to become effective or to promptly amend or supplement a
Registration Statement on a post-effective basis, as applicable; or (ii) a
majority of the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith
that it is in the Companys best interest or it is required by law, rule or
regulation to supplement the Registration Statement or file a post-effective
amendment to the Registration Statement in order to ensure that the prospectus
included in the Registration Statement (1) contains the information required
under Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act; (2) discloses any facts or
events arising after the effective date of a Shelf Registration Statement (or
of the most recent post-effective amendment) that, individually or in the
aggregate, represents a fundamental change in the information set forth
therein; or (3) discloses any material information with respect to the plan of
distribution that was not disclosed in the Registration Statement or any
material change to such information. Upon the occurrence of any such
suspension, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the Registration Statement to become effective or to promptly amend or
supplement the Registration Statement on a post-effective basis or to take
such action as is necessary to permit resumed use of the Registration
Statement or filing thereof as soon as possible.

 



 

The Company will provide written notice (a " _Suspension Notice_ ") to the
Holders, if any, of the occurrence of any Suspension Event. If, as a result of
a Suspension Event, the Registration Statement or related prospectus contains
any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made (in the case of the
prospectus) not misleading, each Holder agrees that (i) it will immediately
discontinue offers and sales of the Registrable Securities under the
Registration Statement until the Holder receives copies of a supplemental or
amended prospectus (which the Company agrees to promptly prepare) that
corrects the misstatement(s) or omission(s) referred to above and receives
notice that any post-effective amendment has become effective or unless
otherwise notified by the Company that it may resume such offers and sales,
and (ii) it will maintain the confidentiality of any information included in
the written notice delivered by the Company unless otherwise required by law
or subpoena. If so directed by the Company, each Holder will deliver to the
Company (at the expense of the Company) all copies of the prospectus covering
the Registrable Securities at the time of receipt of the Suspension Notice,
other than permanent file copies in the possession of such Holders counsel.
The Holders may recommence effecting sales of the Registrable Securities
pursuant to the Registration Statement (or such filings) following further
written notice to such effect (an " _End of Suspension Notice_ ") from the
Company, which End of Suspension Notice shall be given by the Company to the
Holders and to the Selling Holders counsel, if any, promptly following the
conclusion of any Suspension Event and its effect.

 



 

(b) In connection with any Registration Statement utilized by the Company to
satisfy its obligations under this Agreement, each Holder agrees to cooperate
with the Company in connection with the preparation of the Registration
Statement, and each Holder agrees that it will (i) respond within ten (10)
Business Days to any written request by the Company to provide or verify
information regarding the Holder or the Holders Registrable Securities
(including the proposed manner of sale) that may be required to be included in
such Registration Statement and related prospectus pursuant to the rules and
regulations of the Commission, and (ii) provide in a

 



      
 

 



 

timely manner information regarding the proposed distribution by the Holder of
the Registrable Securities and such other information as may be requested by
the Company from time to time in connection with the preparation of and for
inclusion in the Registration Statement and related prospectus.

 



 

(c) If all reports required to be filed by the Company pursuant to the
Exchange Act have not been filed by the required date taking into account any
permissible extension, upon written notice thereof by the Company to the
Holders, the rights of the Holders to offer, sell or distribute any
Registrable Securities pursuant to any Registration Statement or to require
the Company take action with respect to the registration or sale of any
Registrable Securities pursuant to any Registration Statement shall be
suspended until the date on which the Company has filed such reports, and the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts, taking into account the
circumstances of the Company at such time, to file the required reports as
promptly as commercially practicable, and shall notify the Holders as promptly
as practicable when such suspension is no longer required.

 



 

Section 2.10. _Additional Shares_. The Company, at its option, may register
under a Shelf Registration Statement and any filings with any state securities
commissions filed pursuant to this Agreement, any number of unissued shares of
Common Stock or any shares of Common Stock owned by any other stockholder or
stockholders of the Company.

 



 

 **ARTICLE III**

 



 

 **MISCELLANEOUS**

 



 

Section 3.1. _Remedies_. In addition to being entitled to exercise all rights
provided herein and granted by law, including recovery of damages, the Holders
shall be entitled to specific performance of the rights under this Agreement.
The Company agrees that monetary damages would not be adequate compensation
for any loss incurred by reason of a breach by it of the provisions of this
Agreement and hereby agrees to waive the defense in any action for specific
performance that a remedy at law would be adequate.

 



 

Section 3.2. _Amendments and Waivers_. The provisions of this Agreement may be
amended or waived at any time only by the written agreement of the Company and
the Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the provisions of this Agreement may not be amended or waived
without the consent of each Holder of Registrable Securities adversely
affected by such amendment or waiver if such amendment or waiver adversely
affects a portion of the Registrable Securities but does not so adversely
affect all of the Registrable Securities; _provided_ , _further_ , that the
provisions of the preceding provision may not be amended or waived except in
accordance with this sentence. Any waiver, permit, consent or approval of any
kind or character on the part of any such Holder of any provision or condition
of this Agreement must be made in writing and shall be effective only to the
extent specifically set forth in writing. Any amendment or waiver effected in
accordance with this paragraph shall be binding upon each Holder of
Registrable Securities and the Company. No failure or delay by any party to
insist upon the strict performance of any covenant, duty, agreement or
condition of this Agreement or to exercise any right or remedy consequent upon
any breach thereof shall constitute waiver of any such breach or any other
covenant, duty, agreement or condition.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 3.3. _Notices_. All notices and other communications in connection
with this Agreement shall be made in writing by hand delivery, registered
first-class mail, telecopier, or air courier guaranteeing overnight delivery:

 



 

(1) if to any Holder, initially to the address indicated in such Holders
Notice and Questionnaire or, if no Notice and Questionnaire has been
delivered, c/o [*], Attention: [*], or to such other address and to such other
Persons as any Holder may hereafter specify in writing; and

 



 

(2) if to the Company, initially at [*], Attention: Chief Executive Officer,
or to such other address as the Company may hereafter specify in writing.

 



 

All such notices and communications shall be deemed to have been duly given:
at the time delivered by hand, if personally delivered; when received if
deposited in the mail, postage prepaid, if mailed; when receipt acknowledged,
if telecopied; and on the next Business Day, if timely delivered to an air
courier guaranteeing overnight delivery.

 



 

Section 3.4. _Successors and Assigns; Assignment of Registration Rights_. This
Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the successors,
assigns and transferees of each of the parties. Any Holder may assign its

 **REGISTRATION RIGHTS**

 



 

Section 5.1. _Shelf Registration._

 



 

(a) Subject to _Section 2.9_, the Company shall prepare and file a "shelf"
registration statement with respect to the resale of the Registrable
Securities by the Holders thereof on an appropriate form that complies in all
material respects with applicable Commission rules for an offering to be made
on a delayed or continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act
(the " _Resale Shelf Registration Statement_ ") and permitting registration of
such Registrable Securities for resale by such Holders in accordance with the
methods of distribution elected by the Holders and set forth in the Resale
Shelf Registration Statement and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
such Resale Shelf Registration Statement to become effective on a date that,
after taking into account any actions that may be required by the Companys
transfer agent or other administrative requirements, would permit Holders to
effect resales on the NYSE on (but not before) the first Business Day that is
sixty (60) days after the consummation date of the Combination Transactions.
Subject to _Sections 2.1(c)_ and _2.9_ , the Company shall keep such Resale
Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective for a period ending when
all shares of Common Stock covered by the Resale Shelf Registration Statement
are no longer Registrable Securities.

 



 

(b) [Intentionally Omitted].

 



 

(c) _Subsequent Filing_. The Company shall prepare and file such additional
registration statements as necessary every three (3) years and use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration statements to
become effective so that a Resale Shelf Registration Statement remains
continuously effective, subject to _Section 2.9_, with respect to

 



      
 

 



 

resales of Registrable Securities as and for the periods required under
_Sections 2.1(a)_ , as applicable (such subsequent registration statements to
constitute a Resale Shelf Registration Statement hereunder).

 



 

(d) _Notice and Questionnaire_. At the request of the Company, each Holder
shall deliver a duly completed and executed written notice (each such notice,
a " _Notice and Questionnaire_ ") to the Company (i) notifying the Company of
such Holders desire to include Registrable Securities held by it in a Resale
Shelf Registration Statement, (ii) containing all information about such
Holder required to be included in such registration statement in accordance
with applicable law, including Item 507 of Regulation S-K promulgated under
the Securities Act, as amended from time to time, or any similar successor
rule thereto, and (iii) pursuant to which such Holder agrees to be bound by
the terms and conditions hereof. At the time a Resale Shelf Registration
Statement becomes effective, each Holder that has delivered a duly completed
and executed Notice and Questionnaire to the Company on or prior to the date
ten (10) Business Days prior to such time of effectiveness shall be named as a
selling securityholder in such Resale Shelf Registration Statement and the
related prospectus in such a manner as to permit such Holder to deliver such
prospectus to purchasers of Registrable Securities in accordance with
applicable law. If required by applicable law, subject to the terms and
conditions hereof, after effectiveness of the Resale Shelf Registration
Statement, the Company shall file a supplement to such prospectus or amendment
to the Resale Shelf Registration Statement not less than once a quarter as
necessary to name as selling securityholders therein any Holders that provide
to the Company a duly completed and executed Notice and Questionnaire and
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any post-effective
amendment to such Resale Shelf Registration Statement filed for such purpose
to be declared effective by the Commission as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the filing thereof. Any Holder that has not delivered a duly
completed and executed Notice and Questionnaire shall not be entitled to be
named as a Selling Holder in, or have the Registrable Securities held by it
covered by, a Resale Shelf Registration Statement.

 



 

Section 5.2. _Registration Procedures; Filings; Information_. Subject to
_Section 2.9_ hereof, in connection with any Resale Shelf Registration
Statement under _Section 2.1(a)_, the Company will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to effect the registration of the Registrable Securities
covered thereby in accordance with the intended method of disposition thereof
as quickly as practicable. In connection with any Resale Shelf Registration
Statement:

 



 

(a) At the request of the Selling Holder, the Company will, prior to filing a
Resale Shelf Registration Statement or prospectus or any amendment or
supplement thereto, furnish without charge to each Selling Holder of the
Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement copies of such
registration statement as proposed to be filed, and thereafter furnish to such
Selling Holder such number of conformed copies of such registration statement,
each amendment and supplement thereto (in each case including all exhibits
thereto and documents incorporated by reference therein, but excluding any
documents to be incorporated by reference therein that are publicly available
on the Commissions EDGAR system) the prospectus included in such registration
statement (including each preliminary prospectus) and such other documents as
such Selling Holder may reasonably request in order to facilitate the
disposition of the Registrable Securities owned by such Selling Holder.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) After the filing of a Resale Shelf Registration Statement, the Company
will promptly notify each Selling Holder of Registrable Securities covered by
such registration statement of any stop order issued or threatened by the
Commission and take all reasonable actions required to prevent the entry of
such stop order or to remove it if entered.

 



 

(c) The parties hereto hereby acknowledge that, generally, pursuant to Section
18 of the Securities Act, no state securities laws requiring, or with respect
to, registration or qualification of securities or securities transactions
will apply to a security that is a "covered security" (as defined therein).
"Covered securities," for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Act,
includes securities listed or authorized for listing on the NYSE (or certain
other national securities exchanges) and securities of the same issuer that
are equal in seniority or senior to such securities. In the event that the
Shares cease to constitute covered securities, subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, the Company will use its commercially reasonable
efforts to (i) register or qualify the Registrable Securities under such other
securities or "blue sky" laws of such jurisdictions in the United States
(where an exemption does not apply) as any Selling Holder reasonably (in light
of such Selling Holders intended plan of distribution) requests and (ii)
cause such Registrable Securities to be registered with or approved by such
other governmental agencies or authorities as may be necessary by virtue of
the business and operations of the Company and do any and all other acts and
things that may be reasonably necessary or advisable to enable such Selling
Holder to consummate the disposition of the Registrable Securities owned by
such Selling Holder; _provided that_ the Company will not be required to (A)
qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not
otherwise be required to qualify but for this paragraph (c), (B) subject
itself to general taxation in any such jurisdiction or (C) consent to general
service of process in any such jurisdiction. The Company will promptly notify
each Selling Holder of the receipt by the Company of any notification with
respect to the suspension of the qualification of any Registrable Securities
for sale under the securities or "blue sky" laws of any jurisdiction or the
initiation of any proceeding for such purpose.

 



 

(d) The Company will immediately notify each Selling Holder of such
Registrable Securities, at any time when a prospectus relating thereto is
required to be delivered under the Securities Act, of (i) the Companys
receipt of any notification of the suspension of the qualification of any
Registrable Securities covered by a Resale Shelf Registration Statement for
sale in any jurisdiction; or (ii) the occurrence of an event requiring the
preparation of a supplement or amendment to such prospectus so that, as
thereafter delivered to the purchasers of such Registrable Securities, such
prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading and promptly make available to each Selling Holder any such
supplement or amendment.

 



 

(e) The Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all
Registrable Securities covered by such Resale Shelf Registration Statement to
be listed on each securities exchange on which similar securities issued by
the Company are then listed.

 



 

(f) In addition to the Notice and Questionnaire, the Company may require each
Selling Holder of Registrable Securities to promptly furnish in writing to the
Company such information regarding such selling Holder, the Registrable
Securities held by it and the intended

 



      
 

 



 

method of distribution of the Registrable Securities as the Company may from
time to time reasonably request and such other information as may be legally
required in connection with such registration. No Holder may include
Registrable Securities in any registration statement pursuant to this
Agreement unless and until such Holder has furnished to the Company such
information. Each Holder further agrees to furnish as soon as reasonably
practicable to the Company all information required to be disclosed in order
to make information previously furnished to the Company by such Holder not
misleading in light of the circumstances in which they were made.

 



 

(g) Each Selling Holder agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the
Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in _Sections
2.2(b)_ or _(d)_ or upon receipt of a Suspension Notice, such Selling Holder
will forthwith discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to
the registration statement covering such Registrable Securities until such
Selling Holders receipt of written notice from the Company that such
disposition may be made and, in the case of clause (ii) of _Section 2.4(d)_
or, if applicable, _Section 2.9_, copies of any supplemented or amended
prospectus contemplated by clause (ii) of _Section 2.4(d)_ or, if applicable,
prepared under _Section 2.9_, and, if so directed by the Company, such
Selling Holder will deliver to the Company all copies, other than permanent
file copies then in such Selling Holders possession, of the most recent
prospectus covering such Registrable Securities at the time of receipt of such
notice. Each Selling Holder of Registrable Securities agrees that it will
immediately notify the Company at any time when a prospectus relating to the
registration of such Registrable Securities is required to be delivered under
the Securities Act of the happening of an event as a result of which
information previously furnished by such Selling Holder to the Company in
writing for inclusion in such prospectus contains an untrue statement of a
material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of
the circumstances in which they were made.

 



 

Section 5.3. _Registration Expenses_. In connection with any registration
statement required to be filed hereunder, the Company shall pay the following
registration expenses incurred in connection with the registration hereunder
(the " _Registration Expenses_ "), regardless whether such registration
statement is declared effective by the Commission: (i) all registration and
filing fees, (ii) fees and expenses of compliance with securities or "blue
sky" laws (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel in
connection with blue sky qualifications of the Registrable Securities), (iii)
printing expenses, (iv) internal expenses (including, without limitation, all
salaries and expenses of its officers and employees performing legal or
accounting duties), (v) the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the
listing of the Registrable Securities, (vi) reasonable fees and disbursements
of counsel for the Company, (vii) all fees and disbursements of the Companys
auditors, including in connection with the preparation of comfort letters, and
any transfer agent and registrar fees, and (viii) the reasonable fees and
expenses of any special experts retained by the Company in connection with
such registration. Registration Expenses shall not include any brokerage and
sales commission fees and disbursements of any counsel, accountants and other
advisors of any Holder, and any transfer taxes relating to the sale or
disposition of Common Stock by any Holder.

 



 

Section 5.4. _Indemnification by the Company_. The Company agrees to indemnify
and hold harmless each Selling Holder of Registrable Securities, its officers,
directors, agents, partners, members, employees, managers, advisors, sub-
advisors, attorneys, representatives and

 



      
 

 



 

Affiliates, and each Person, if any, who controls such Selling Holder within
the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange
Act from and against, as incurred, any and all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, judgments and expenses (or actions in respect thereof) that arise
out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact contained in any registration statement, preliminary prospectus,
prospectus, or free writing prospectus relating to the Registrable Securities
(in each case, as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished
any amendments or supplements thereto), or that arise out of or are based upon
any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except insofar as
such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, judgments or expenses arise out of
or are based upon any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue
statement or omission included in reliance upon and in conformity with
information furnished in writing to the Company by such Selling Holder or on
such Selling Holders behalf expressly for inclusion therein.

 



 

Section 5.5. _Indemnification by Holders of Registrable Securities_. Each
Selling Holder agrees, severally but not jointly or jointly and severally, to
indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its officers, directors, agents,
employees, attorneys, representatives and Affiliates and each Person, if any,
who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the
Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the
foregoing indemnity from the Company to such Selling Holder, but only with
respect to information relating to such Selling Holder included in reliance
upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing by such Selling
Holder or on such Selling Holders behalf expressly for use in any
registration statement, preliminary prospectus, prospectus or free writing
prospectus relating to the Registrable Securities, or any amendment or
supplement thereto. In case any action or proceeding shall be brought against
the Company or its officers, directors or agents or any such controlling
person, in respect of which indemnity may be sought against such Selling
Holder, such Selling Holder shall have the rights and duties given to the
Company, and the Company or its officers, directors or agents or such
controlling person shall have the rights and duties given to such Selling
Holder, by _Section 2.6_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the total obligations
of such Selling Holder under this Agreement (including, but not limited to,
obligations arising under _Section 2.7_ herein) will be limited to an amount
equal to the net proceeds actually received by such Selling Holder (after
deducting any discounts and commissions) from the disposition of Registrable
Securities pursuant to such registration statement.

 



 

Section 5.6. _Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings_. In case any proceeding
(including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any
person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to _Section 2.4_
or _2.5_ , such person (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall promptly notify the
person against whom such indemnity may be sought (an " _Indemnifying Party_ ")
in writing and the Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense thereof,
including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to such
Indemnified Party, and shall assume the payment of all fees and expenses;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the failure of any Indemnified Party to give
such notice will not relieve such Indemnifying Party of any obligations under
this Section 2, except to the extent such Indemnifying Party is materially
prejudiced by such failure. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Party
shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of
such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Party unless (i) the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall have mutually agreed to

 



      
 

 



 

the retention of such counsel or (ii) representation of the Indemnified Party
by the counsel retained by the Indemnifying Party would be inappropriate due
to actual or potential differing interests between the Indemnified Party and
the Indemnified Party. It is understood that the Indemnifying Party shall not,
in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same
jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one
separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) at any time for
all such Indemnified Parties, and that all such fees and expenses shall be
reimbursed as they are incurred. In the case of any such separate firm for the
Indemnified Parties, such firm shall be designated in writing by (i) in the
case of Persons indemnified pursuant to _Section 2.4_ hereof, the Selling
Holders which owned a majority of the Registrable Securities sold under the
applicable registration statement and (ii) in the case of Persons indemnified
pursuant to _Section 2.5_, the Company. The Indemnifying Party shall not be
liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, but if settled with
such consent, or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the
Indemnifying Party shall indemnify and hold harmless such Indemnified Parties
from and against any loss or liability (to the extent stated above) by reason
of such settlement or judgment. No Indemnifying Party shall, without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened
proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Party is or could have been a
party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified
Party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such
Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such proceeding without
any admission of liability by such Indemnified Party.

 



 

Section 5.7. _Contribution_. If the indemnification provided for in _Section
2.4_ or _2.5_ hereof is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
unavailable to an Indemnified Party or insufficient in respect of any losses,
claims, damages, liabilities, judgments or expenses that otherwise would have
been covered by _Section 2.4_ or _2.5_ hereof, then each such Indemnifying
Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party, shall contribute to the
amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such losses,
claims, damages, liabilities, judgments or expenses in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and
of each Selling Holder, on the other hand, in connection with such statements
or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
judgments or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of each Selling Holder
on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether
the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or
alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by
such party.

 



 

The Company and the Selling Holders agree that it would not be just and
equitable if contribution pursuant to this _Section 2.7_ were determined by
pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take
account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately
preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Party as a
result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities, judgments or expenses
referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include,
subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses
reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with investigating
or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this
_Section 2.7_, no Selling Holder shall be required to contribute any amount
which in the aggregate

 



       
 

 



 

exceeds the amount by which the net proceeds actually received by such Selling
Holder from the sale of its securities to the public exceeds the amount of any
damages which such Selling Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason
of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No
person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section
11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person
who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Selling Holders
obligations to contribute pursuant to this _Section 2.7_, if any, are several
in proportion to the proceeds of the offering actually received by such
Selling Holder bears to the total proceeds of the offering received by all the
Selling Holders and not joint.

 



 

Section 5.8. _Rule 144_. The Company covenants that it will (a) make and keep
public information regarding the Company available as those terms are defined
in Rule 144, (b) file in a timely manner any reports and documents required to
be filed by it under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, (c) furnish to
any Holder forthwith upon request (i) a written statement by the Company as to
its compliance with the reporting requirements of Rule 144, the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act, and (ii) a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly
report of the Company and such other reports and documents so filed by the
Company, and (d) take such further action as any Holder may reasonably
request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable Holders to
sell Registrable Securities without registration under the Securities Act
within the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rule 144.

 



 

Section 5.9. _Suspension of Use of Registration Statement._

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 2.1(a)_, the Company shall be
permitted to postpone the filing of any Resale Shelf Registration Statement,
and from time to time to require Holders not to sell under the Resale Shelf
Registration Statement or to suspend the use or effectiveness thereof, for
such times as the Company reasonably may determine is necessary and advisable
(but in no event shall the Company be entitled to exercise such right for more
than an aggregate of 180 days in any rolling 12-month period commencing on the
date of this Agreement, except as a result of a refusal by the Commission to
declare any post-effective amendment to the Resale Shelf Registration
Statement effective after the Company has used all commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the post-effective amendment to be declared effective by the
Commission, in which case, the Company must terminate the black-out period
immediately following the effective date of the post-effective amendment), if
any of the following events shall occur (each such circumstance a "
_Suspension Event_ "): (i) a majority of the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith that (A) the offer or sale of any Registrable
Securities would materially impede, delay or interfere with any proposed
financing, offer or sale of securities, acquisition, disposition, corporate
reorganization or other material transaction involving the Company or any of
its subsidiaries, (B) the sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to the
Resale Shelf Registration Statement would require disclosure of non-public
material information not otherwise required to be disclosed under applicable
law, or (C) (x) the Company has a bona fide business purpose for preserving
the confidentiality of a proposed transaction described in clause (A) above,
(y) disclosure of such proposed transaction would have a material adverse
effect on the Company or the Companys ability to consummate such proposed
transaction, or (z) such proposed transaction renders the Company unable to
comply with Commission requirements, in each case under circumstances that
would make it impractical or inadvisable to cause the Resale Shelf
Registration Statement (or such filings) to

 



      
 

 



 

become effective or to promptly amend or supplement a Resale Shelf
Registration Statement on a post-effective basis, as applicable; or (ii) a
majority of the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith
that it is in the Companys best interest or it is required by law, rule or
regulation to supplement the Resale Shelf Registration Statement or file a
post-effective amendment to the Resale Shelf Registration Statement in order
to ensure that the prospectus included in the Resale Shelf Registration
Statement (1) contains the information required under Section 10(a)(3) of the
Securities Act; (2) discloses any facts or events arising after the effective
date of a Resale Shelf Registration Statement (or of the most recent post-
effective amendment) that, individually or in the aggregate, represents a
fundamental change in the information set forth therein; or (3) discloses any
material information with respect to the plan of distribution that was not
disclosed in the Resale Shelf Registration Statement or any material change to
such information. Upon the occurrence of any such suspension, the Company
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Resale Shelf
Registration Statement to become effective or to promptly amend or supplement
the Resale Shelf Registration Statement on a post-effective basis or to take
such action as is necessary to permit resumed use of the Resale Shelf
Registration Statement or filing thereof as soon as possible.

 



 

The Company will provide written notice (a " _Suspension Notice_ ") to the
Holders, if any, of the occurrence of any Suspension Event. If, as a result of
a Suspension Event, the Resale Shelf Registration Statement or related
prospectus contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made
(in the case of the prospectus) not misleading, each Holder agrees that (i) it
will immediately discontinue offers and sales of the Registrable Securities
under the Resale Shelf Registration Statement until the Holder receives copies
of a supplemental or amended prospectus (which the Company agrees to promptly
prepare) that corrects the misstatement(s) or omission(s) referred to above
and receives notice that any post-effective amendment has become effective or
unless otherwise notified by the Company that it may resume such offers and
sales, and (ii) it will maintain the confidentiality of any information
included in the written notice delivered by the Company unless otherwise
required by law or subpoena. If so directed by the Company, each Holder will
deliver to the Company (at the expense of the Company) all copies of the
prospectus covering the Registrable Securities at the time of receipt of the
Suspension Notice, other than permanent file copies in the possession of such
Holders counsel. The Holders may recommence effecting sales of the
Registrable Securities pursuant to the Resale Shelf Registration Statement (or
such filings) following further written notice to such effect (an " _End of
Suspension Notice_ ") from the Company, which End of Suspension Notice shall
be given by the Company to the Holders and to the Selling Holders counsel, if
any, promptly following the conclusion of any Suspension Event and its effect.

 



 

(b) In connection with any Registration Statement utilized by the Company to
satisfy its obligations under this Agreement, each Holder agrees to cooperate
with the Company in connection with the preparation of the Resale Shelf
Registration Statement, and each Holder agrees that it will (i) respond within
ten (10) Business Days to any written request by the Company to provide or
verify information regarding the Holder or the Holders Registrable Securities
(including the proposed manner of sale) that may be required to be included in
such Resale Shelf Registration Statement and related prospectus pursuant to
the rules and regulations of the Commission, and (ii) provide in a timely
manner information regarding the proposed

 



      
 

 



 

distribution by the Holder of the Registrable Securities and such other
information as may be requested by the Company from time to time in connection
with the preparation of and for inclusion in the Resale Shelf Registration
Statement and related prospectus.

 



 

(c) If all reports required to be filed by the Company pursuant to the
Exchange Act have not been filed by the required date taking into account any
permissible extension, upon written notice thereof by the Company to the
Holders, the rights of the Holders to offer, sell or distribute any
Registrable Securities pursuant to any Registration Statement or to require
the Company take action with respect to the registration or sale of any
Registrable Securities pursuant to any Registration Statement shall be
suspended until the date on which the Company has filed such reports, and the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts, taking into account the
circumstances of the Company at such time, to file the required reports as
promptly as commercially practicable, and shall notify the Holders as promptly
as practicable when such suspension is no longer required.

 



 

Section 5.10. _Additional Shares_. The Company, at its option, may register
under a Shelf Registration Statement and any filings with any state securities
commissions filed pursuant to this Agreement, any number of unissued shares of
Common Stock or any shares of Common Stock owned by any other stockholder or
stockholders of the Company.

extent specifically set forth in writing. Any amendment or waiver effected in
accordance with this paragraph shall be binding upon each Holder of
Registrable Securities and the Company. No failure or delay by any party to
insist upon the strict performance of any covenant, duty, agreement or
condition of this Agreement or to exercise any right or remedy consequent upon
any breach thereof shall constitute waiver of any such breach or any other
covenant, duty, agreement or condition.

the transferee or assignee of such rights assumes in writing the obligations
of such Holder under this Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.5. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of

thereby.

 



 

Section 6.8. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement is intended by the parties as
a final expression of their agreement and intended to be a complete and
exclusive statement of the agreement and understanding of the parties hereto

agreements and understandings between the parties with respect to such subject
matter.

Securities and with respect to the Company when there are no longer
Registrable Securities with respect to a Resale Shelf Registration Statement,
except, in each case, for any obligations under _Sections 2.1(c)_ , _2.3_ ,

A. _General_. The General Partner is hereby authorized to cause the
Partnership from time to time to issue to Partners (including the General
Partner and its Affiliates) or other Persons (including, without limitation,
in connection with the contribution of property to the Partnership or any of

Consent of the Limited Partners, and (v) the consideration, if any, to be
received by the Partnership; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such Partnership

in connection with the grant, award or issuance of Shares or other equity
interests in the General Partner Entity (including a transaction described in
_Section 7.5.F_) having designations, preferences and other rights such that
the economic interests attributable to such Shares or other equity interests
are substantially similar to the designations, preferences and other rights
(except voting rights) of the Partnership Interests issued to the General
Partner Entity in accordance with this _Section 4.2.A_, or (b) the additional
Partnership Interests are issued to all Partners holding Partnership Interests
in the same class in proportion to their respective Percentage Interests in
such class. If the Partnership issues Partnership Interests pursuant to this
_Section 4.2.A_, the General Partner shall make such revisions to this
Agreement (including but not limited to the revisions described in _Section
5.5_, _Section 6.2_ and _Section 8.6_) as it deems necessary to reflect the
issuance of such Partnership Interests.

 



 

B. _Classes of Partnership Units_. From and after the date of the Agreement,
the Partnership shall have three classes of Partnership Units entitled "Class
A Units," "Class B Units" and "LTIP Units," and such additional classes of
Partnership Units as may be created by the General Partner pursuant to
_Section 4.2.A_. Class A Units, Class B Units, LTIP Units or a class of
Partnership Interests created pursuant to _Section 4.2.A_, at the election of
the General Partner, in its sole and absolute discretion, may be issued to
newly admitted Partners in exchange for the contribution by such Partners of
cash, real estate partnership interests, stock, notes or other assets or
consideration; _provided_ , _however_ , that any Partnership Unit that is not
specifically designated by the General Partner as being of a particular class
shall be deemed to be a Class A Unit. Each Class B Unit shall be converted
automatically into a corresponding series of Class A Unit on the day
immediately following the Partnership Record Date for the Distribution Period
in which such Class B Unit was issued, without the requirement for any action
by the General Partner, the Partnership or the Partner holding the Class B

were outstanding prior to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
the Combination Agreement were either earned, vested and converted into OP
Units on a one-to-one basis or were forfeited, and such OP Units were then
redeemed for an equal number of Shares. In order to, among other things,
effectuate the conversion of the LTIP Unit into OP Units, the Gross Asset
Value (as such term is defined in the Agreement in effect prior to the date
hereof) of the Partnerships assets shall have been adjusted in accordance
with Section 6.3(c) of the Combination Agreement immediately prior to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Combination Agreement in
order to "book-up" the then partners Capital Accounts. The OP Units issued
upon conversion of the LTIP Units, and the Shares issued upon redemption of
the OP Units, shall have all of the rights applicable to OP Units, and the
REIT Shares issuable in redemption thereof, that were issued prior to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Combination Agreement,
including registration rights.

Partnership Interests.

 



 

 **Section 4.4** **Other Contribution Provisions**

 



 

A. _General_. If any Partner is admitted to the Partnership and is given a
Capital Account in exchange for services rendered to the Partnership, such
transaction shall be treated by the Partnership and the affected Partner as if
the Partnership had compensated such Partner in cash, and the Partner had made
a Capital Contribution of such cash to the capital of the Partnership.

 



 

B. _Mergers_. To the extent the Partnership acquires any property (or an
indirect interest therein) by the merger of any other Person into the
Partnership or with or into a Subsidiary of the Partnership, Persons who
receive Partnership Interests in exchange for their interest in the Person
merging into the Partnership or with or into a Subsidiary of the Partnership

determined by the General Partner in its sole and absolute discretion) and as
set forth in the Partner Registry.

No Partner shall be entitled to interest on its Capital Contributions or its
Capital Account.

 



 

 **Section 4.6** **LTIP Units**

 



 

A. _Issuance of LTIP Units_. The General Partner may from time to time issue
LTIP Units to Persons who provide services to the Partnership or the General
Partner, for such consideration as the General Partner may determine to be
appropriate, and admit such Persons as Limited Partners. Subject to the
following provisions of this _Section 4.6_ and the special provisions of
_Sections 4.7_ and 6.1.E, LTIP Units shall be treated as Class A Units, with
all of the rights, privileges and obligations attendant thereto (or, if so
designated by the General Partner in connection with the issuance thereof, as
Class B Units for the quarter in which such LTIP Units are issued). For
purposes of computing the Partners Percentage Interests, holders of LTIP
Units shall be treated as Class A Unit holders and LTIP Units shall be treated
as Class A Units. In particular, the Partnership shall maintain at all times a
one-to-one correspondence between LTIP Units and Class A Units for conversion,
distribution and other purposes, including, without limitation, complying with
the following procedures:

 



 

(i) If an Adjustment Event occurs, then the General Partner shall make a
corresponding adjustment to the LTIP Units to maintain a one-for-one
conversion and economic equivalence ratio between Class A Units and LTIP
Units. If more than one Adjustment Event

 



      
 

 



 

occurs, the adjustment to the LTIP Units need be made only once using a single
formula that takes into account each and every Adjustment Event as if all
Adjustment Events occurred simultaneously. If the Partnership takes an action
affecting the Class A Units other than actions specifically defined as
"Adjustment Events" and in the opinion of the General Partner such action
would require an adjustment to the LTIP Units to maintain the one-to-one
correspondence described above, the General Partner shall have the right to
make such adjustment to the LTIP Units, to the extent permitted by law and by
any applicable Equity Incentive Plan, in such manner and at such time as the
General Partner, in its sole discretion, may determine to be appropriate under
the circumstances. If an adjustment is made to the LTIP Units, as herein
provided, the Partnership shall promptly file in the books and records of the
Partnership an officers certificate setting forth such adjustment and a brief
statement of the facts requiring such adjustment, which certificate shall be
conclusive evidence of the correctness of such adjustment absent manifest
error. Promptly after filing of such certificate, the Partnership shall mail a
notice to each LTIP Unitholder setting forth the adjustment to his or her LTIP
Units and the effective date of such adjustment; and

 



 

(ii) Subject to the provisions of Sections 5.1.E, 5.1.F and 5.1.G, the LTIP
Unitholders shall, when, as and if distributions with respect to Class A Units
are authorized and declared by the General Partner out of assets legally
available for that purpose, be entitled to receive distributions in an amount
per LTIP Unit equal to the distributions per Class A Unit paid to holders of
Class A Units on such Partnership Record Date established by the General
Partner with respect to such distribution. So long as any LTIP Units are
outstanding, no distributions (whether in cash or in kind) shall be
authorized, declared or paid on Class A Units or Class B Units, unless equal
distributions have been or contemporaneously are authorized, declared and paid
on the LTIP Units.

 



 

B. _Priority_. Subject to the provisions of this _Section 4.6_ and the
special provisions of _Sections 4.7_ , _5.1.E_ , _5.1.F_ and _5.1.G_ , the
LTIP Units shall rank pari passu with the Class A Units and Class B Units as
to the payment of regular and special periodic or other distributions and
distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up. As to the
payment of distributions and as to distribution of assets upon liquidation,
dissolution or winding up, any class or series of Partnership Units which by
its terms specifies that it shall rank junior to, on a parity with, or senior
to the Class A Units shall also rank junior to, or pari passu with, or senior
to, as the case may be, the LTIP Units. Subject to the terms of any Vesting
Agreement, an LTIP Unitholder shall be entitled to transfer his or her LTIP
Units to the same extent, and subject to the same restrictions as holders of
Class A Units are entitled to transfer their Class A Units pursuant to
_Article XI_.

 



 

C. _Special Provisions_. LTIP Units shall be subject to the following special
provisions:

 



 

(i) Vesting Agreements. LTIP Units may, in the sole discretion of the General
Partner, be issued subject to vesting, forfeiture and additional restrictions
on transfer pursuant to the terms of a Vesting Agreement. The terms of any
Vesting Agreement may be modified by the General Partner from time to time in
its sole discretion, subject to any

 



      
 

 



 

restrictions on amendment imposed by the relevant Vesting Agreement or by any
applicable Equity Incentive Plan. LTIP Units that have vested under the terms
of a Vesting Agreement are referred to as " ** _Vested LTIP Units_** "; all
other LTIP Units shall be treated as " ** _Unvested LTIP Units_**."

 



 

(ii) Forfeiture. Unless otherwise specified in the Vesting Agreement, upon the
occurrence of any event specified in a Vesting Agreement as resulting in
either the right of the Partnership or the General Partner to repurchase LTIP
Units at a specified purchase price or some other forfeiture of any LTIP
Units, then if the Partnership or the General Partner exercises such right to
repurchase or such forfeiture occurs in accordance with the applicable Vesting
Agreement, the relevant LTIP Units shall immediately, and without any further
action, be treated as cancelled and no longer outstanding for any purpose.
Unless otherwise specified in the Vesting Agreement, no consideration or other
payment shall be due with respect to any LTIP Units that have been forfeited,
other than any distributions declared with respect to a Partnership Record
Date prior to the effective date of the forfeiture. In connection with any
repurchase or forfeiture of LTIP Units, the balance of the portion of the
Capital Account of the LTIP Unitholder that is attributable to all of his or
her LTIP Units shall be reduced by the amount, if any, by which it exceeds the
target balance contemplated by _Section 6.1.E_ hereof, calculated with
respect to the LTIP Unitholders remaining LTIP Units, if any.

 



 

(iii) Allocations. LTIP Unitholders shall be entitled to certain special
allocations of gain under _Section 6.1.E_. LTIP Units shall be allocated
Net Income and Net Loss, for any taxable year or portion of a taxable year
occurring after such issuance and prior to the Distribution Participation Date
for such LTIP Units, to the extent that the date of issuance and the
Distribution Participation Date are not the same under the terms of the
applicable Vesting Agreement, in amounts per LTIP Unit equal to the amounts
allocated per Class A Unit for the same period multiplied by the LTIP Unit
Sharing Percentage for such LTIP Units. Commencing with the portion of the
taxable year of the Partnership that begins on the Distribution Participation
Date established for any LTIP Units, such LTIP Units shall be allocated Net
Income and Net Loss in amounts per LTIP Unit equal to the amounts allocated
per Class A Unit. The allocations provided by the preceding sentence shall be
subject to _Section 6.1.A_ and _Section 6.1.B_ of the Agreement. The
General Partner is authorized in its discretion to delay or accelerate the
participation of the LTIP Units in allocations of Net Income and Net Loss, or
to adjust the allocations made after the Distribution Participation Date, so
that the ratio of (i) the total amount of Net Income or Net Loss allocated
with respect to each LTIP Unit in the taxable year in which that LTIP Units
Distribution Participation Date falls, to (ii) the total amount distributed to
that LTIP Unit with respect to such period, is equal to such ratio as computed
for the Class A Units held by the General Partner.

 



 

(iv) Redemption. The Redemption Right provided to the holders of Class A Units
under _Section 8.6_ hereof shall not apply with respect to LTIP Units unless
and until they are converted to Class A Units as provided in clause (v) below
and _Section 4.7_.

 



 

(v) Conversion to Class A Units. Vested LTIP Units are eligible to be
converted into Class A Units in accordance with _Section 4.7_.

 



      
 

 



 

D. _Voting_. LTIP Unitholders shall (a) have the same voting rights as the
Limited Partners, with the LTIP Units voting as a single class with the Class
A Units and having one vote per LTIP Unit; and (b) have the additional voting
rights that are expressly set forth below. So long as any LTIP Units remain
outstanding, the Partnership shall not, without the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the LTIP Units outstanding at the time, given in
person or by proxy, either in writing or at a meeting (voting separately as a
class), amend, alter or repeal, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise,
the provisions of this Agreement applicable to LTIP Units so as to materially
and adversely affect any right, privilege or voting power of the LTIP Units or
the LTIP Unitholders as such, unless such amendment, alteration, or repeal
affects equally, ratably and proportionately the rights, privileges and voting
powers of all of Class A Units (including the Class A Units held by the
General Partner); but subject, in any event, to the following provisions:

 



 

(i) With respect to any Class A Unit Transaction (as defined in _Section
4.7.F_ hereof), so long as the LTIP Units are treated in accordance with
_Section 4.7.F_ hereof, the consummation of such Class A Unit Transaction
shall not be deemed to materially and adversely affect such rights,
preferences, privileges or voting powers of the LTIP Units or the LTIP
Unitholders as such; and

 



 

(ii) Any creation or issuance of any Partnership Units or of any class or
series of Partnership Interest in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
including, without limitation, additional Class A Units or LTIP Units, whether
ranking senior to, junior to, or on a parity with the LTIP Units with respect
to distributions and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution
or winding up, shall not be deemed to materially and adversely affect such
rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the LTIP Units or the LTIP
Unitholders as such.

 



 

The foregoing voting provisions will not apply if, at or prior to the time
when the act with respect to which such vote would otherwise be required will
be effected, all outstanding LTIP Units shall have been converted into Class A
Units.

 



 

 **Section 4.7** **Conversion of LTIP Units.**

 



 

A. _Conversion Right_. An LTIP Unitholder shall have the right (the " **
_Conversion Right_** "), at his or her option, at any time to convert all or a
portion of his or her Vested LTIP Units into fully paid and non-assessable
Class A Units; _provided_ , _however_ , that a holder may not exercise the
Conversion Right for fewer than one thousand (1,000) Vested LTIP Units or, if
such holder holds fewer than one thousand (1,000) Vested LTIP Units, all of
the Vested LTIP Units held by such holder. LTIP Unitholders shall not have the
right to convert Unvested LTIP Units into Class A Units until they become
Vested LTIP Units; _provided_ , _however_ , that when an LTIP Unitholder is
notified of the expected occurrence of an event that will cause his or her
Unvested LTIP Units to become Vested LTIP Units, such LTIP Unitholder may give
the Partnership a Conversion Notice conditioned upon and effective as of the
time of vesting and such Conversion Notice, unless subsequently revoked by the
LTIP Unitholder, shall be accepted by the Partnership subject to such
condition. The General Partner shall have the right at any time to

 



      
 

 



 

cause a conversion of Vested LTIP Units into Class A Units, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any Special LTIP Unit Distribution payable with respect to
such Vested LTIP Units is paid prior to such conversion. In all cases, the
conversion of any LTIP Units into Class A Units shall be subject to the
conditions and procedures set forth in this _Section 4.7_.

 



 

B. _Exercise by an LTIP Unitholder_. A holder of Vested LTIP Units may convert
such LTIP Units into an equal number of fully paid and non-assessable Class A
Units, giving effect to all adjustments (if any) made pursuant to _Section
4.6_ hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event may a holder of Vested
LTIP Units convert a number of Vested LTIP Units that exceeds (x) the Economic
Capital Account Balance of such Limited Partner, to the extent attributable to
its ownership of LTIP Units, divided by (y) the Class A Unit Economic Balance,
in each case as determined as of the effective date of conversion (the " **
_Capital Account Limitation_** "). In order to exercise his or her Conversion
Right, an LTIP Unitholder shall deliver a notice (a " ** _Conversion Notice_**
") in the form attached as **_Exhibit F_** to this Agreement to the
Partnership (with a copy to the General Partner) not less than ten (10) nor
more than sixty (60) days prior to a date (the " ** _Conversion Date_** ")
specified in such Conversion Notice; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the
General Partner has not given to the LTIP Unitholders notice of a proposed or
upcoming Class A Unit Transaction (as defined in _Section 4.7.F_ hereof) at
least thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of such Class A Unit
Transaction, then LTIP Unitholders shall have the right to deliver a
Conversion Notice until the earlier of (x) the tenth day after such notice
from the General Partner of a Class A Unit Transaction or (y) the third
business day immediately preceding the effective date of such Class A Unit
Transaction. A Conversion Notice shall be provided in the manner provided in
_Section 15.1_. Each LTIP Unitholder covenants and agrees with the
Partnership that all Vested LTIP Units to be converted pursuant to this
_Section 4.7.B_ shall be free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, a holder of LTIP Units may
deliver a Notice of Redemption pursuant to _Section 8.6_ relating to those
Class A Units that will be issued to such holder upon conversion of such LTIP
Units into Class A Units in advance of the Conversion Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the redemption of such Class A Units by the Partnership shall
in no event take place until after the Conversion Date. For clarity, it is
noted that the objective of this paragraph is to put an LTIP Unitholder in a
position where, if he or she so wishes, the Class A Units into which his or
her Vested LTIP Units will be converted can be redeemed by the Partnership
simultaneously with such conversion, with the further consequence that, if the
General Partner elects to assume and perform the Partnerships redemption
obligation with respect to such Class A Units under _Section 8.6_ hereof by
delivering to such holder Shares rather than cash, then such holder can have
such Shares issued to him or her simultaneously with the conversion of his or
her Vested LTIP Units into Class A Units. The General Partner and LTIP
Unitholder shall reasonably cooperate with each other to coordinate the timing
of the events described in the foregoing sentence. An LTIP Unitholder may give
a Notice of Conversion with respect to Unvested LTIP Units, provided that such
Unvested LTIP Units become Vested LTIP Units on or prior to the Conversion
Date.

 



 

C. _Forced Conversion_. The Partnership, at any time at the election of the
General Partner, may cause any number of Vested LTIP Units held by an LTIP
Unitholder to be

 



      
 

 



 

converted (a " ** _Forced Conversion_** ") into an equal number of fully paid
and non-assessable Class A Units, giving effect to all adjustments (if any)
made pursuant to _Section 4.6_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Partnership
may not cause Forced Conversion of any LTIP Units that would not at the time
be eligible for conversion at the option of such LTIP Unitholder pursuant to
_Section 4.7.B_ or with respect to which a Special LTIP Unit Distribution is
payable and has not been paid. In order to exercise its right of Forced
Conversion, the Partnership shall deliver a notice (a " ** _Forced Conversion
Notice_** ") in the form attached as **_Exhibit G_** to this Agreement to the
applicable LTIP Unitholder not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60)
days prior to the Conversion Date specified in such Forced Conversion Notice.
A Forced Conversion Notice shall be provided in the manner provided in
_Section 15.1_.

 



 

D. _Completion of Conversion_. A conversion of Vested LTIP Units for which the
holder thereof has given a Conversion Notice or the Partnership has given a
Forced Conversion Notice shall occur automatically after the close of business
on the applicable Conversion Date without any action on the part of such LTIP
Unitholder, as of which time such LTIP Unitholder shall be credited on the
books and records of the Partnership with the issuance as of the opening of
business on the next day of the number of Class A Units issuable upon such
conversion. After the conversion of LTIP Units as aforesaid, the Partnership
shall deliver to such LTIP Unitholder, upon his or her written request, a
certificate of the General Partner certifying the number of Class A Units and
remaining LTIP Units, if any, held by such person immediately after such
conversion. The Assignee of any Limited Partner pursuant to _Article XI_
hereof may exercise the rights of such Limited Partner pursuant to this
_Section 4.7_ and such Limited Partner shall be bound by the exercise of such
rights by the Assignee.

 



 

E. _Impact of Conversions for Purposes of Section 6.1.E_. For purposes of
making future allocations under _Section 6.1.E_ hereof and applying the
Capital Account Limitation, the portion of the Economic Capital Account
Balance of the applicable LTIP Unitholder that is treated as attributable to
his or her LTIP Units shall be reduced, as of the date of conversion, by the
product of the number of LTIP Units converted and the Class A Unit Economic
Balance.

 



 

F. _Class A Unit Transactions_. If the Partnership or the General Partner
Entity shall be a party to any Class A Unit Transaction, then the General
Partner shall, immediately prior to the Class A Unit Transaction, exercise its
right to cause a Forced Conversion with respect to the maximum number of LTIP
Units then eligible for conversion, taking into account any allocations that
occur in connection with the Class A Unit Transaction or that would occur in
connection with the Class A Unit Transaction if the assets of the Partnership
were sold at the Class A Unit Transaction price or, if applicable, at a value
determined by the General Partner in good faith using the value attributed to
the Partnership Units in the context of the Class A Unit Transaction (in which
case the Conversion Date shall be the effective date of the Class A Unit
Transaction). In anticipation of such Forced Conversion and the consummation
of the Class A Unit Transaction, the Partnership shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause each LTIP Unitholder to be afforded the right to
receive in connection with such Class A Unit Transaction in consideration for
the Class A Units into which his or her LTIP Units will be converted the same
kind and amount of cash, securities and other property (or any combination
thereof)

 



       
 

 



 

receivable upon the consummation of such Class A Unit Transaction by a holder
of the same number of Class A Units, assuming such holder of Class A Units is
not a Person with which the Partnership consolidated or into which the
Partnership merged or which merged into the Partnership or to which such sale
or transfer was made, as the case may be (a " ** _Constituent Person_** "), or
an affiliate of a Constituent Person. In the event that holders of Class A
Units have the opportunity to elect the form or type of consideration to be
received upon consummation of the Class A Unit Transaction, prior to such
Class A Unit Transaction the General Partner shall give prompt written notice
to each LTIP Unitholder of such election, and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to afford the LTIP Unitholders the right to elect, by
written notice to the General Partner, the form or type of consideration to be
received upon conversion of each LTIP Unit held by such holder into Class A
Units in connection with such Class A Unit Transaction. If an LTIP Unitholder
fails to make such an election, such holder (and any of its transferees) shall
receive upon conversion of each LTIP Unit held him or her (or by any of his or
her transferees) the same kind and amount of consideration that a holder of a
Class A Unit would receive if such Class A Unit holder failed to make such an
election. Subject to the rights of the Partnership and the General Partner
under any Vesting Agreement and any applicable Equity Incentive Plan, to the
extent any LTIP Units are then outstanding, the Partnership shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the terms of any Class A Unit
Transaction to be consistent with the provisions of this _Section 4.7.F_ and
to enter into an agreement with the successor or purchasing entity, as the
case may be, for the benefit of any LTIP Unitholders whose LTIP Units will not
be converted into Class A Units in connection with the Class A Unit
Transaction that will (i) contain provisions enabling the holders of LTIP
Units that remain outstanding after such Class A Unit Transaction to convert
their LTIP Units into securities as comparable as reasonably possible under
the circumstances to the Class A Units and (ii) preserve as far as reasonably
possible under the circumstances the distribution, special allocation,
conversion, and other rights set forth in this Agreement for the benefit of
the LTIP Unitholders.

 



 

 **ARTICLE V** ** 
DISTRIBUTIONS**

 



 

 **Section 5.1** **Requirement and Characterization of Distributions**

 



 

A. _Distribution of Operating Income_. The General Partner shall distribute at
least quarterly an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the Available
Cash of the Partnership with respect to such quarter or shorter period to the
Partners in accordance with the terms established for the class or classes of
Partnership Interests held by such Partners who are Partners on the respective
Partnership Record Date with respect to such quarter or shorter period as
provided in _Sections 5.1.B_ , _5.1.C_ and _5.1.D_ and in accordance with the
respective terms established for each class of Partnership Interest.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in no event may a
Partner receive a distribution of Available Cash with respect to a Partnership
Unit for a quarter or shorter period if such Partner is entitled to receive a
distribution with respect to a Share for which such Partnership Unit has been
redeemed or exchanged. Unless otherwise expressly provided for herein, or in
the terms established for a new class or series of Partnership Interests
created in accordance with _Article IV_ hereof, no

 



      
 

 



 

Partnership Interest shall be entitled to a distribution in preference to any
other Partnership Interest. If the General Partner Entity has chosen to
attempt to qualify as a REIT, the General Partner shall make such reasonable
efforts, as determined by it in its sole and absolute discretion and
consistent with the qualification of the General Partner Entity as a REIT, to
distribute Available Cash (a) to Limited Partners in a manner that would not
cause any such distribution or portion thereof to be treated as part of a sale
of property to the Partnership by a Limited Partner under Section 707 of the
Code or the Regulations thereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that none of the
General Partner, the General Partner Entity, and the Partnership shall have
liability to a Limited Partner under any circumstances as a result of any
distribution to a Limited Partner being so treated, and (b) to the General
Partner Entity in an amount sufficient to enable the General Partner Entity to
make distributions to its shareholders that will enable the General Partner
Entity to (1) satisfy the requirements for qualification as a REIT under the
Code and the Regulations (the " ** _REIT Requirements_** "), and (2) avoid any
federal income or excise tax liability.

 



 

B. _Method_.

 



 

(i) Each holder of Partnership Interests, if any, that is entitled to any
preference in distribution shall be entitled to a distribution in accordance
with the rights of any such class of Partnership Interests (and, within such
class, pro rata in proportion to the respective Percentage Interests on such
Partnership Record Date); and

 



 

(ii) To the extent there is Available Cash remaining after the payment of any
preference in distribution in accordance with the foregoing clause (i) (if
applicable), with respect to Partnership Interests that are not entitled to
any preference in distribution, such Available Cash shall be distributed pro
rata to each such class in accordance with the terms of such class (and,
within each such class, pro rata in proportion to the respective Percentage
Interests on such Partnership Record Date).

 



 

C. _Distributions When Class B Units Are Outstanding_. If for any quarter or
shorter period with respect to which a distribution is to be made pursuant to
_Section 5.1.A._ (a " ** _Distribution Period_** ") Class B Units are
outstanding on the Partnership Record Date for such Distribution Period, the
General Partner shall allocate the Available Cash with respect to such
Distribution Period available for distribution with respect to the Class A
Units and Class B Units collectively between the Partners who are holders of
Class A Units (" ** _Class A_**") and the Partners who are holders of Class B
Units (" ** _Class B_**") as follows:

 



 

(1) Class A shall receive that portion of the Available Cash (the " ** _Class
A Share_**") determined by multiplying the amount of Available Cash by the
following fraction:

 



    



 |  

A x Y

 |  


 
---|---|--- 
   



 |  

(A x Y) + (B x X)

 |  


 
 



      
 

 



 

(2) Class B shall receive that portion of the Available Cash (the " ** _Class
B Share_**") determined by multiplying the amount of Available Cash by the
following fraction:

 



    



 |  

B x X

 |  


 
---|---|--- 
   



 |  

(A x Y) + (B x X)

 |  


 
 



 

(3) For purposes of the foregoing formulas, (i) "A" equals the number of Class
A Units outstanding on the Partnership Record Date for such Distribution
Period; (ii) "B" equals the number of Class B Units outstanding on the
Partnership Record Date for such Distribution Period; (iii) "Y" equals the
number of days in the Distribution Period; and (iv) "X" equals the number of
days in the Distribution Period for which the Class B Units were issued and
outstanding.

 



 

The Class A Share shall be distributed pro rata among Partners holding Class A
Units on the Partnership Record Date for the Distribution Period in accordance
with the number of Class A Units held by each Partner on such Partnership
Record Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event may a Partner receive a
distribution of Available Cash with respect to a Class A Unit if a Partner is
entitled to receive a distribution with respect to a Share for which such
Class A Unit has been redeemed or exchanged. If Class B Units were issued on
the same date, the Class B Share shall be distributed pro rata among the
Partners holding Class B Units on the Partnership Record Date for the
Distribution Period in accordance with the number of Class B Units held by
each Partner on such Partnership Record Date. In no event shall any Class B
Units be entitled to receive any distribution of Available Cash for any
Distribution Period ending prior to the date on which such Class B Units are
issued. For purposes of the foregoing calculations, LTIP Units with an
associated Distribution Participation Date that falls on or before the date of
the relevant distribution shall be treated as outstanding Class A Units.

 



 

D. _Distributions When Class B Units Have Been Issued on Different Dates_. If
Class B Units which have been issued on different dates are outstanding on the
Partnership Record Date for any Distribution Period, then the Class B Units
issued on each particular date shall be treated as a separate series of
Partnership Units for purposes of making the allocation of Available Cash for
such Distribution Period among the holders of Partnership Units (and the
formula for making such allocation, and the definitions of variables used
therein, shall be modified accordingly). Thus, for example, if two series of
Class B Units are outstanding on the Partnership Record Date for any
Distribution Period, the allocation formula for each series, " ** _Series
B1_**" and " ** _Series B2_**" would be as follows:

 



 

(1) Series B1 shall receive that portion of the Available Cash determined by
multiplying the amount of Available Cash by the following fraction:

 



    



 |  

B1 x X1

 |  


 
---|---|--- 
   



 |  

(A x Y) + (B x X1) + (B2 x X2)

 |  


 
 



      
 

 



 

(2) Series B2 shall receive that portion of the Available Cash determined by
multiplying the amount of Available Cash by the following fraction:

 



    



 |  

B2 x X2

 |  


 
---|---|--- 
   



 |  

(A x Y) + (B1 x X1) + (B2 x X2)

 |  


 
 



 

(3) For purposes of the foregoing formulas the definitions set forth in
_Section 5.1.C(3)_ remain the same except that (i) "B1" equals the number of
Partnership Units in Series B1 outstanding on the Partnership Record Date for
such Distribution Period; (ii) "B2" equals the number of Partnership Units in
Series B2 outstanding on the Partnership Record Date for such Distribution
Period; (iii) "X1" equals the number of days in the Distribution Period for
which the Partnership Units in Series B1 were issued and outstanding; and (iv)
"X2" equals the number of days in the Distribution Period for which the
Partnership Units in Series B2 were issued and outstanding.

 



 

For purposes of the foregoing calculations, LTIP Units with an associated
Distribution Participation Date that falls on or before the date of the
relevant distribution shall be treated as outstanding Class A Units.

 



 

E. _Distributions With Respect to LTIP Units_. Commencing from the
Distribution Participation Date established for any LTIP Units, for any
quarterly or other period holders of such LTIP Units shall be entitled to
receive, if, when and as regular cash distributions are authorized by the
General Partner out of funds legally available for the payment of
distributions, regular cash distributions in an amount per unit equal to the
distribution payable on each Class A Unit for the corresponding quarterly or
other period (the " ** _LTIP Distribution Amount_** "). In addition, from and
after the Distribution Participation Date, LTIP Units shall be entitled to
receive, if, when and as non-liquidating special, extraordinary or other
distributions are authorized by the General Partner out of funds or other
property legally available for the payment of distributions, non-liquidating
special, extraordinary or other distributions in an amount per unit equal to
the amount of any non-liquidating special, extraordinary or other
distributions payable on the Class A Units which may be made from time to
time. LTIP Units shall also be entitled to receive, if, when and as
distributions representing proceeds of a sale or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Partnership are authorized by the
General Partner out of funds or other property legally available for the
payment of distributions, distributions representing proceeds of a sale or
other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Partnership
in an amount per unit equal to the amount of any such distributions payable on
the Class A Units, whether made prior to, on or after the Distribution
Participation Date, provided that the amount of such distributions shall not
exceed the positive balances of the Capital Accounts of the holders of such
LTIP Units to the extent attributable to the ownership of such LTIP Units.
Distributions on the LTIP Units, if authorized, shall be payable on such dates
and in such manner as may be authorized by the General Partner (any such date,
a " ** _Distribution Payment Date_** "); provided that the Distribution
Payment Date and the record date for

 



      
 

 



 

determining which holders of LTIP Units are entitled to receive a distribution
shall be the same as the corresponding dates relating to the corresponding
distribution on the Class A Units.

 



 

F. _Special LTIP_ _Unit Distribution_. As of the Distribution Participation
Date for an LTIP Unit that is not forfeited on or prior to such Distribution
Participation Date, the holder of such LTIP Unit will be entitled to receive a
special distribution (the " ** _Special LTIP Unit Distribution_** ") with
respect to such unit, equal to the Aggregate Special LTIP Unit Distribution
Amount with respect to such LTIP Unit, divided by the total number of such
holders LTIP Units that (A) have the same Distribution Participation Date,
(B) were issued as part of the same award or program for purposes of _Section
4.6_ as specified in the Vesting Agreement or other documentation pursuant to
which such LTIP Units are issued (the " ** _Same Award_** " with respect to
such LTIP Unit), and (C) are not forfeited on or prior to such Distribution
Participation Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that such amount shall not
exceed either (x) the amount of non-liquidating cash distributions per unit
that were paid on the Class A Units on or after the date of the issuance of
such LTIP Unit (or such other date as is specified as the Distribution
Measurement Date in the Vesting Agreement or other documentation pursuant to
which such LTIP Unit is issued) (such date being referred to as the " **
_Distribution Measurement Date_** " with respect to such LTIP Unit) and prior
to such Distribution Participation Date or (y) an amount that, together with
all other Special LTIP Unit Distributions made to such holder on the same date
with respect to such holders other LTIP Units issued as part of the Same
Award as such LTIP Unit, exceeds the positive balance of the Capital Account
of such holder to the extent attributable to such LTIP Units. The " **
_Aggregate Special LTIP Unit Distribution Amount_** " with respect to a
holders LTIP Unit equals the aggregate amount determined by totaling, for
each of such holders LTIP Units that were issued as part of the Same Award,
(x) the amount of non-liquidating cash distributions per unit that were paid
on the Class A Units on or after the Distribution Measurement Date with
respect to such LTIP Unit and prior to the earlier of the Distribution
Participation Date for such LTIP Unit or the Distribution Participation Date
for the LTIP Unit with respect to which the Aggregate Special LTIP Unit
Distribution Amount is being calculated, multiplied by (y) the LTIP Unit
Sharing Percentage for such LTIP Unit, and subtracting from such total
aggregate amount all Special LTIP Unit Distributions previously made with
respect to LTIP Units that were issued as part of the Same Award. The Special
LTIP Unit Distribution for an LTIP Unit will be payable on the first
Distribution Payment Date on or after the Distribution Participation Date for
such LTIP Unit if and when authorized by the General Partner out of funds
legally available for the payment of distributions; _provided_ that, to the
extent not otherwise prohibited by the terms of any class of Partnership
Interests entitled to any preference in distribution and authorized by the
General Partner out of funds legally available for the payment of
distributions, such Special LTIP Unit Distribution may be paid prior to such
Distribution Payment Date. On or after the Distribution Participation Date
with respect to an LTIP Unit, if such LTIP Unit is outstanding, no
distributions (other than in Class A Units, Class B Units, LTIP Units or other
Partnership Interests ranking on par with or junior to such units as to
distributions and upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs
of the Partnership) shall be declared or paid or set apart for payment upon
the Class A Units, the Class B Units, the LTIP Units or any other Partnership
Interests ranking junior to or on a parity with the LTIP Unit as to
distributions for any period (other than Special LTIP Unit Distributions

 



      
 

 



 

with respect to LTIP Units that had an earlier Distribution Participation
Date) unless the full amount of any Special LTIP Unit Distributions due with
respect to such LTIP Unit have been or contemporaneously are declared and
paid.

 



 

G. _LTIP Units Intended to Qualify as Profits Interests_. Distributions made
pursuant to this _Section 5.1_ shall be adjusted as necessary to ensure that
the amount apportioned to each LTIP Unit does not exceed the amount
attributable to items of Partnership income or gain realized after the date
such LTIP Unit was issued by the Partnership. The intent of this _Section
5.1.G_ is to ensure that any LTIP Units issued after the date of this
Agreement qualify as "profits interests" under Revenue Procedure 93-27, 1993-2
C.B. 343 (June 9, 1993) and Revenue Procedure 2001-43, 2001-2 C.B. 191 (August
3, 2001), and this _Section 5.1_ shall be interpreted and applied
consistently therewith. The General Partner at its discretion may amend this
_Section 5.1.G_ to ensure that any LTIP Units granted after the date of this
Agreement will qualify as "profits interests" under Revenue Procedure 93-27,
1993-2 C.B. 343 (June 9, 1993) and Revenue Procedure 2001-43, 2001-2 C.B. 191
(August 3, 2001) (and any other similar rulings or regulations that may be in
effect at such time).

 



 

 **Section 5.2** **Distributions in Kind**

 



 

The General Partner may determine, in its sole and absolute discretion, to
make a distribution in kind of Partnership assets to the holders of
Partnership Interests, and such assets shall be distributed in such a fashion
as to ensure that the fair market value is distributed and allocated in the
same manner as a cash distribution in accordance with Articles V, VI and XIII
hereof

 



 

 **Section 5.3** **Amounts Withheld**

 



 

All amounts withheld pursuant to the Code or any provisions of any state or
local tax law and _Section 10.5_ with respect to any allocation, payment or
distribution to the General Partner, the Limited Partners or Assignees shall
be treated as amounts distributed to the General Partner, Limited Partners or
Assignees, as the case may be, pursuant to _Section 5.1_ for all purposes
under this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 5.4** **Distributions upon Liquidation**

 



 

Proceeds from a Liquidating Event shall be distributed to the Partners in
accordance with _Section 13.2_.

 



 

 **Section 5.5** **Revisions to Reflect Issuance of Partnership Interests**

 



 

If the Partnership issues Partnership Interests to the General Partner or any
Additional Limited Partner pursuant to _Article IV_ hereof, the General
Partner shall make such revisions to this _Article V_ and the Partner
Registry in the books and records of the Partnership as it deems necessary to
reflect the terms of the issuance of such Partnership Interests. Such
revisions shall not require the consent or approval of any other Partner.

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE VI** ** 
ALLOCATIONS**

 



 

 **Section 6.1** **Allocations for Capital Account Purposes**

 



 

For purposes of maintaining the Capital Accounts and in determining the rights
of the Partners among themselves, the Partnerships items of income, gain,
loss and deduction (computed in accordance with **_Exhibit B_**) shall be
allocated among the Partners in each taxable year (or portion thereof) as
provided herein below.

 



 

A. _Net Income_. After giving effect to the special allocations set forth in
_Section 1_ of **_Exhibit C_** of the Partnership Agreement and any special
allocations required to be made pursuant to _Section 6.1.E_, Net Income shall
be allocated:

 



 

(1) first, to the General Partner to the extent that Net Loss previously
allocated to the General Partner pursuant to _Section 6.1.B(6)_ exceed Net
Income previously allocated to the General Partner pursuant to this clause
(1);

 



 

(2) second, to each DRO Partner until the cumulative Net Income allocated to
such DRO Partner under this clause (2) equals the cumulative Net Loss
allocated to such DRO Partner under _Section 6.1.B(5)_ (and among the DRO
Partners, pro rata in proportion to their respective percentages of the
cumulative Net Loss allocated to all DRO Partners pursuant to _Section
6.1.B(5)_ hereof);

 



 

(3) third, to the General Partner until the cumulative Net Income allocated
under this clause (3) equals the cumulative Net Loss allocated the General
Partner under _Section 6.1.B(4)_;

 



 

(4) fourth, to the holders of any Partnership Interests that are entitled to
any preference upon liquidation until the cumulative Net Income allocated
under this clause (4) equals the cumulative Net Loss allocated to such
Partners under _Section 6.1.B(3)_;

 



 

(5) fifth, to the holders of any Partnership Interests that are entitled to
any preference in distribution in accordance with the rights of any other
class of Partnership Interests until each such Partnership Interest has been
allocated, on a cumulative basis pursuant to this clause (5), Net Income equal
to the amount of distributions payable that are attributable to the preference
of such class of Partnership Interests, whether or not paid (and, within such
class, pro rata in proportion to the respective Percentage Interests as of the
last day of the period for which such allocation is being made);

 



 

(6) sixth, to the holders of any Partnership Interests that are not entitled
to any preference upon liquidation until the cumulative Net Income allocated
under this

 



      
 

 



 

clause (6) equals the cumulative Net Loss allocated to such Partners under
_Section 6.1.B(2)_; and

 



 

(7) finally, with respect to Partnership Interests that are not entitled to
any preference in distribution or with respect to which distributions are not
limited to any preference in distribution, pro rata to each such class in
accordance with the terms of such class (and, within such class, pro rata in
proportion to the respective Percentage Interests as of the last day of the
period for which such allocation is being made).

 



 

B. _Net Loss_. After giving effect to the special allocations set forth in
_Section 1_ of **_Exhibit C_** of the Partnership Agreement and any special
allocations required to be made pursuant to _Sections 6.1.E_ , Net Loss shall
be allocated:

 



 

(1) first, to the holders of Partnership Interests that are not entitled to
any preference in distribution or with respect to which distributions are not
limited to any preference in distribution, in proportion to, and to the extent
that, their share of the Net Income previously allocated pursuant to _Section
6.1.A(7)_ exceeds, on a cumulative basis, the sum of (a) distributions with
respect to such Partnership Interests pursuant to clause (ii) of _Section
5.1.B_ and (b) Net Loss allocated under this clause (1);

 



 

(2) second, with respect to classes of Partnership Interests that are not
entitled to any preference in distribution upon liquidation, pro rata to each
such class in accordance with the terms of such class (and, within such class,
pro rata in proportion to the respective Percentage Interests as of the last
day of the period for which such allocation is being made); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Net Loss shall not be allocated to any Partner pursuant to
this _Section 6.1.B(2)_ to the extent that such allocation would cause such
Partner to have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit (or increase any existing
Adjusted Capital Account Deficit) (determined in each case (i) by not
including in the Partners Adjusted Capital Accounts any amount that a Partner
is obligated to contribute to the Partnership with respect to any deficit in
its Capital Account pursuant to _Section 13.3_ and (ii) in the case of a
Partner who also holds classes of Partnership Interests that are entitled to
any preferences in distribution upon liquidation, by subtracting from such
Partners Adjusted Capital Account the amount of such preferred distribution
to be made upon liquidation) at the end of such taxable year (or portion
thereof);

 



 

(3) third, with respect to classes of Partnership Interests that are entitled
to any preference in distribution upon liquidation, in reverse order of the
priorities of each such class (and within each such class, pro rata in
proportion to their respective Percentage Interests as of the last day of the
period for which such allocation is being made); _provided_ , _however_ , that
Net Loss shall not be allocated to any Partner pursuant to this _Section
6.1.B(3)_ to the extent that such allocation would cause such Partner to have
an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit (or

 



      
 

 



 

increase any existing Adjusted Capital Account Deficit) (determined in each
case by not including in the Partners Adjusted Capital Accounts any amount
that a Partner is obligated to contribute to the Partnership with respect to
any deficit in its Capital Account pursuant to _Section 13.3_) at the end of
such taxable year (or portion thereof);

 



 

(4) fourth, to the General Partner in an amount equal to the excess of (a) the
amount of the Partnerships Recourse Liabilities over (b) the Aggregate DRO
Amount;

 



 

(5) fifth, to and among the DRO Partners, in proportion to their respective
DRO Amounts, until such time as the DRO Partners as a group have been
allocated cumulative Net Loss pursuant to this clause (5) equal to the
Aggregate DRO Amount; and

 



 

(6) thereafter, to the General Partner.

 



 

C. _Allocation of Nonrecourse Debt_. For purposes of Regulation Section
1.752-3(a), the Partners agree that Nonrecourse Liabilities of the Partnership
in excess of the sum of (i) the amount of Partnership Minimum Gain and (ii)
the total amount of Nonrecourse Built-in Gain shall be allocated by the
General Partner by taking into account facts and circumstances relating to
each Partners respective interest in the profits of the Partnership unless
and to the extent provided otherwise in an agreement between any Partner and
the Partnership. For this purpose, the General Partner shall have the sole and
absolute discretion in any Fiscal Year to allocate such excess Nonrecourse
Liabilities among the Partners in any manner permitted under Code Section 752
and the Regulations thereunder.

 



 

D. _Recapture Income_. Any gain allocated to the Partners upon the sale or
other taxable disposition of any Partnership asset shall, to the extent
possible after taking into account other required allocations of gain pursuant
to **_Exhibit C_**, be characterized as Recapture Income in the same
proportions and to the same extent as such Partners have been allocated any
deductions directly or indirectly giving rise to the treatment of such gains
as Recapture Income.

 



 

E. _Special Allocations Regarding LTIP Units_. Notwithstanding the provisions
of _Section 6.1.A_, Liquidating Gains shall first be allocated to the LTIP
Unitholders until their Economic Capital Account Balances, to the extent
attributable to their ownership of LTIP Units, are equal to (i) the Class A
Unit Economic Balance, multiplied by (ii) the number of their LTIP Units, plus
the aggregate net amount of Net Income and Net Loss allocated to such LTIP
Units prior to the Distribution Participation Date with respect to such LTIP
Units less the amount of any Special LTIP Unit Distributions with respect to
such LTIP Units (such amount, the " ** _Target Balance_** "); provided,
however, that no such Liquidating Gains will be allocated with respect to any
particular LTIP Unit unless and to the extent that such Liquidating Gains,
when aggregated with other Liquidating Gains realized since the issuance of
such LTIP Unit, exceed Liquidating Losses realized since the issuance of such
LTIP Unit. After giving effect to the special allocations set forth in
_Section 1_ of ** _Exhibit C_** hereto, and notwithstanding the provisions
of _Sections 6.1.A_ and _6.1.B_ above, in the event that, due to
distributions with respect to Class A

 



       
 

 



 

Units in which the LTIP Units do not participate or otherwise, the Economic
Capital Account Balances of any present or former holder of LTIP Units, to the
extent attributable to the holders ownership of LTIP Units, exceed the Target
Balance, then Liquidating Losses shall be allocated to such holder to the
extent necessary to reduce or eliminate the disparity. In the event that
Liquidating Gains or Liquidating Losses are allocated under this _Section
6.1.E_, Net Income allocable under _Section 6.1.A(6)_ and any Net Loss shall
be recomputed without regard to the Liquidating Gains or Liquidating Losses so
allocated. For this purpose, " ** _Liquidating Gains_** " means net gains that
are or would be realized in connection with the actual or hypothetical sale of
all or substantially all of the assets of the Partnership, including but not
limited to net capital gain realized in connection with an adjustment to the
value of Partnership assets under Section 704(b) of the Code made pursuant to
_Section 1.D_ of **_Exhibit B_** of the Partnership Agreement. " **
_Liquidating Losses_** " means any net capital loss realized in connection
with any such event. The " ** _Economic Capital Account Balances_** " of the
LTIP Unitholders will be equal to their Capital Account balances to the extent
attributable to their ownership of LTIP Units, plus the amount of their share
of any Partner Minimum Gain or Partnership Minimum Gain, in either case to the
extent attributable to their ownership of LTIP Units and computed on a
hypothetical basis after taking into account all allocations through the date
on which any allocation is made under this _Section 6.1.E_, but prior to the
realization of any Liquidating Gains. Similarly, the " ** _Class A Unit
Economic Balance_**" shall mean (i) the Capital Account balance of the General
Partner, plus the amount of the General Partners share of any Partner Minimum
Gain or Partnership Minimum Gain, in either case to the extent attributable to
the General Partners ownership of Class A Units and computed on a
hypothetical basis after taking into account all allocations through the date
on which any allocation is made under this _Section 6.1.E_, but prior to the
realization of any Liquidating Gains, divided by (ii) the number of the
General Partners Class A Units. Any such allocations shall be made among the
LTIP Unitholders in proportion to the amounts required to be allocated to each
under this _Section 6.1.E_. The parties agree that the intent of this
_Section 6.1.E_ is to make the Capital Account balance associated with each
LTIP Unit to be economically equivalent to the Capital Account balance
associated with the General Partners Class A Units (on a per-Unit basis,
other than differences resulting from the allocation of Net Income and Net
Loss allocated to such LTIP Units prior to the Distribution Participation Date
with respect to such LTIP Units in excess of the amount of Special LTIP Unit
Distributions paid with respect to such LTIP Units), to the extent that
Liquidating Gains are of a sufficient magnitude to do so upon a sale of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Partnership, or upon an adjustment to
the Partners Capital Accounts pursuant to _Section 1.D_ of **_Exhibit B_**.
To the extent the LTIP Unitholders receive a distribution in excess of their
Capital Accounts, such distribution will be a guaranteed payment under Section
707(c) of the Code.

 



 

 **Section 6.2** **Revisions to Allocations to Reflect Issuance of
Partnership Interests**

 



 

If the Partnership issues Partnership Interests to the General Partner or any
Additional Limited Partner pursuant to _Article IV_ hereof, the General
Partner shall make such revisions to this _Article VI_ and the Partner
Registry in the books and records of the Partnership as it deems necessary to
reflect the terms of the issuance of such Partnership Interests, including
making

 



      
 

 



 

preferential allocations to classes of Partnership Interests that are entitled
thereto. Such revisions shall not require the consent or approval of any other
Partner.

Partner or the Partnership of any agreement authorized or permitted under this
Agreement shall be in the sole and absolute discretion of the General Partner

maintain working capital reserves in such amounts as the General Partner, in
its sole and absolute discretion, deems appropriate and reasonable from time
to time, including upon liquidation of the Partnership under _Article XIII_.

 



 

 **Section 7.2** **Certificate of Limited Partnership**

 



 

The General Partner has previously filed the Certificate of Limited
Partnership with the Secretary of State of Delaware. To the extent that such
action is determined by the General Partner to be reasonable and necessary or
appropriate, the General Partner shall file amendments to and restatements of
the Certificate of Limited Partnership and do all the things to maintain the
Partnership as a limited partnership (or a partnership in which the limited
partners have limited liability) under the laws of the State of Delaware and
each other state, the District of Columbia or other jurisdiction in which the
Partnership may elect to do business or own property. Subject to the terms of
_Section 8.5.A(4)_, the General Partner shall not be required, before or
after filing, to deliver or mail a copy of the Certificate of Limited
Partnership or any amendment thereto to any Limited Partner. The General
Partner shall use all reasonable efforts to cause to be filed such other
certificates or documents as may be reasonable and necessary or appropriate
for the formation, continuation, qualification and operation of a limited
partnership (or a partnership in which the limited partners have limited
liability) in the State of Delaware and any other state, the District of
Columbia or other jurisdiction in which the Partnership may elect to do
business or own property.

 



 

 **Section 7.3** **Title to Partnership Assets**

 



 

Title to Partnership assets, whether real, personal or mixed and whether
tangible or intangible, shall be deemed to be owned by the Partnership as an
entity, and no Partners, individually or collectively, shall have any
ownership interest in such Partnership assets or any portion thereof. Title to
any or all of the Partnership assets may be held in the name of the
Partnership, the General Partner or one or more nominees, as the General
Partner may determine, in its sole and absolute discretion, including
Affiliates of the General Partner. The General Partner hereby declares and
warrants that any Partnership assets for which legal title is held in the name
of the General Partner or any nominee or Affiliate of the General Partner
shall be held by the General Partner for the use and benefit of the
Partnership in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. All
Partnership assets shall be recorded as the property of the Partnership in its
books and records, irrespective of the name in which legal title to such
Partnership assets is held.

 



 

 **Section 7.4** **Reimbursement of the General Partner**

 



 

A. _No Compensation_. Except as provided in this _Section 7.4_ and elsewhere
in this Agreement (including _Section 10.3.C_ and the provisions of _Articles
V_ and _VI_ regarding distributions, payments and allocations to which it may
be entitled), the General Partner shall not be compensated for its services as
the general partner of the Partnership.

 



      
 

 



 

B. _Responsibility for Partnership, General Partner and General Partner Entity
Expenses_. The Partnership shall be responsible for and shall pay all expenses
relating to the Partnerships organization, the ownership of its assets and
its operations. The General Partner shall be reimbursed on a monthly basis, or
such other basis as the General Partner may determine in its sole and absolute
discretion, for all expenses it incurs relating to or resulting from the
ownership and operation of, or for the benefit of, the Partnership (including,
without limitation, (i) expenses relating to the ownership of interests in and
operation of the Partnership, (ii) compensation of the officers and employees
including, without limitation, payments under any stock option or incentive
plan that provides for stock units, or other phantom stock, pursuant to which
employees will receive payments based upon dividends on or the value of
Shares, (iii) auditing expenses, (iv) director fees and expenses of the
General Partner Entity, (v) all costs and expenses of being a public company,
including costs of filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
reports and other distributions to its shareholders, and (vi) all costs and
expenses associated with litigation involving the General Partner and the
General Partner Entity, the Partnership or any Subsidiary); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) the amount of any such reimbursement shall be reduced by
(x) any interest earned by the General Partner with respect to bank accounts
or other instruments or accounts held by it on behalf of the Partnership as
permitted in _Section 7.5.A_ (which interest is considered to belong to the
Partnership and shall be paid over to the Partnership to the extent not
applied to reimburse the General Partner for expenses hereunder); and (y) any
amount derived by the General Partner from any investments permitted in
_Section 7.5.A_; (ii) if the General Partner or General Partner Entity
qualifies as a REIT, the Partnership shall not be responsible for any taxes
that the General Partner Entity would not have been required to pay if that
entity qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes or any taxes
imposed on the General Partner or General Partner Entity by reason of that
entitys failure to distribute to its shareholders an amount equal to its
taxable income; (iii) the Partnership shall not be responsible for expenses or
liabilities incurred by the General Partner in connection with any business or
assets of the General Partner other than its ownership of Partnership
Interests or operation of the business of the Partnership or ownership of
interests in Qualified Assets to the extent permitted in _Section 7.5.A_; and
(iv) the Partnership shall not be responsible for any expenses or liabilities
of the General Partner that are excluded from the scope of the indemnification
provisions of _Section 7.7.A_ by reason of the provisions of clause (i), (ii)
or (iii) thereof. The General Partner shall determine in good faith the amount
of expenses incurred by it or the General Partner Entity related to the
ownership of Partnership Interests or operation of, or for the benefit of, the
Partnership. If certain expenses are incurred that are related both to the
ownership of Partnership Interests or operation of, or for the benefit of, the
Partnership and to the ownership of other assets (other than Qualified Assets
as permitted under _Section 7.5.A_) or the operation of other businesses,
such expenses will be allocated to the Partnership and such other entities
(including the General Partner and General Partner Entity) owning such other
assets or businesses in such a manner as the General Partner in its sole and
absolute discretion deems fair and reasonable. Such reimbursements shall be in
addition to any reimbursement to the General Partner and the General Partner
Entity pursuant to _Section 10.3.C_ and as a result of indemnification
pursuant to _Section 7.7_. All payments and reimbursements hereunder shall be
characterized for U.S. federal income tax purposes as expenses of the
Partnership incurred on its behalf, and not as expenses of the General Partner
or General Partner Entity.

 



       
 

 



 

C. _Partnership Interest Issuance Expenses_. The General Partner shall also be
reimbursed for all expenses it incurs relating to any issuance of Partnership
Interests, Shares, Debt of the Partnership, Funding Debt of the General
Partner or the General Partner Entity or rights, options, warrants or
convertible or exchangeable securities pursuant to _Article IV_ (including,
without limitation, all costs, expenses, damages and other payments resulting
from or arising in connection with litigation related to any of the
foregoing), all of which expenses are considered by the Partners to constitute
expenses of, and for the benefit of, the Partnership.

 



 

D. _Repurchases of Shares_. If the General Partner Entity exercises its rights
under its organizational documents to purchase Shares or otherwise elects or
is required to purchase from its shareholders Shares in connection with a
share repurchase or similar program or otherwise, or for the purpose of
delivering such Shares to satisfy an obligation under any dividend
reinvestment or equity purchase program adopted by the General Partner Entity,
any employee equity purchase plan adopted by the General Partner Entity or any
similar obligation or arrangement undertaken by the General Partner Entity in
the future, the purchase price paid by the General Partner Entity for those
Shares and any other expenses incurred by the General Partner Entity in
connection with such purchase shall be considered expenses of the Partnership
and shall be reimbursable to the General Partner Entity, subject to the
conditions that: (i) if those Shares subsequently are to be sold by the
General Partner Entity, the General Partner Entity shall pay to the
Partnership any proceeds received by the General Partner Entity for those
Shares ( _provided_ , _however_ , that a transfer of Shares for Partnership
Units pursuant to Section 8.6 would not be considered a sale for such
purposes); and (ii) if such Shares are required to be cancelled pursuant to
applicable law or are not retransferred by the General Partner Entity within
thirty (30) days after the purchase thereof, the General Partner shall cause
the Partnership to cancel a number of Partnership Units (rounded to the
nearest whole Partnership Unit) held by the General Partner equal to the
product attained by multiplying the number of those Shares by a fraction, the
numerator of which is one and the denominator of which is the Conversion
Factor.

 



 

E. _Reimbursement not a Distribution_. Except as set forth in the succeeding
sentence, if and to the extent any reimbursement made pursuant to this
_Section 7.4_ is determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes not to
constitute a payment of expenses of the Partnership, the amount so determined
shall constitute a guaranteed payment with respect to capital within the
meaning of Section 707(c) of the Code, shall be treated consistently therewith
by the Partnership and all Partners and shall not be treated as a distribution
for purposes of computing the Partners Capital Accounts. Amounts deemed paid
by the Partnership to the General Partner in connection with redemption of
Partnership Units pursuant to _Section 7.5.B_ shall be treated as a
distribution for purposes of computing the Partners Capital Accounts.

 



 

F. _Funding for Certain Capital Transactions_. In the event that the General
Partner Entity shall undertake to acquire (whether by merger, consolidation,
purchase, or otherwise) the assets or equity interests of another Person and
such acquisition shall require the payment of cash by the General Partner
Entity (whether to such Person or to any other selling party or parties in
such transaction or to one or more creditors, if any, of such Person or such
selling party or parties), (a) the Partnership shall advance to the General
Partner Entity the cash required to

 



      
 

 



 

consummate such acquisition if, and to the extent that, such cash is not to be
obtained by the General Partner Entity through an issuance of Shares described
in _Section 4.2_ or pursuant to a transaction described in _Section 7.5.B_,
(b) the General Partner Entity shall, upon consummation of such acquisition,
transfer to the Partnership (or cause to be transferred to the Partnership),
in full and complete satisfaction of such advance and as required by _Section
7.5_, the assets or equity interests of such Person acquired by the General
Partner Entity in such acquisition (or equity interests in Persons owning all
of such assets or equity interests), and (c) pursuant to and in accordance
with _Section 4.2_ and _Section 7.5.B_, the Partnership shall issue to the
General Partner, Partnership Interests and/or rights, options, warrants or
convertible or exchangeable securities of the Partnership having designations,
preferences and other rights that are substantially the same as those of any
additional Shares, other equity securities, New Securities and/or Convertible
Funding Debt, as the case may be, issued by the General Partner Entity in
connection with such acquisition (whether issued directly to participants in
the acquisition transaction or to third parties in order to obtain cash to
complete the acquisition). In addition to, and without limiting, the
foregoing, in the event that the General Partner Entity engages in a
transaction in which (x) the General Partner Entity (or a wholly owned direct
or indirect Subsidiary of the General Partner Entity) merges with another
entity (referred to as the " ** _Parent Entity_** ") that is organized in the
UPREIT form (i.e., where the Parent Entity holds substantially all of its
assets and conducts substantially all of its operations through a partnership,
limited liability company or other entity (referred to as an " ** _Operating
Entity_** ")) (" ** _UPREIT_** ") and the General Partner Entity survives such
merger, (y) such Operating Entity merges with or is otherwise acquired by the
Partnership in exchange in whole or in part for Partnership Interests, and (z)
the General Partner Entity is required or elects to pay part of the
consideration in connection with such merger involving the Parent Entity in
the form of cash and part of the consideration in the form of Shares, the
Partnership shall distribute to the General Partner with respect to its
existing Partnership Interest an amount of cash sufficient to complete such
transaction and the General Partner shall cause the Partnership to cancel a
number of Partnership Units (rounded to the nearest whole number) held by the
General Partner equal to the product attained by multiplying the number of
additional Shares of the General Partner Entity that the General Partner
Entity would have issued to the Parent Entity or the owners of the Parent
Entity in such transaction if the entire consideration therefor were to have
been paid in Shares by a fraction, the numerator of which is one and the
denominator of which is the Conversion Factor.

 



 

 **Section 7.5** **Outside Activities of the General Partner; Relationship of
Shares to Partnership Units; Funding Debt**

 



 

A. _General_. Except as contemplated by Section 7.3, without the Consent of
the Outside Limited Partners, the General Partner shall not, directly or
indirectly, enter into or conduct any business other than in connection with
the ownership, acquisition and disposition of Partnership Interests as General
Partner or Limited Partner and the management of the business of the
Partnership and such activities as are incidental thereto. Without Consent of
the Outside Limited Partners, the assets of the General Partner shall be
limited to Partnership Interests _,_ permitted debt obligations of the
Partnership (as contemplated by _Section 7.5.F)_ and permitted assets of the
Partnership (as contemplated by Section 7.3); _provided_ , _however_ , that
the General

 



      
 

 



 

Partner shall be permitted to hold such bank accounts or similar instruments
or accounts in its name as it deems necessary to carry out its
responsibilities and purposes as contemplated under this Agreement and its
organizational documents (provided that accounts held on behalf of the
Partnership to permit the General Partner to carry out its responsibilities
under this Agreement shall be considered to belong to the Partnership and the
interest earned thereon shall, subject to _Section 7.4.B_, be applied for the
benefit of the Partnership); and, provided further that, the General Partner
shall be permitted to acquire Qualified Assets.

 



 

B. _Repurchase of Shares and Other Securities_. If the General Partner Entity
exercises its rights under its organizational documents to purchase Shares or
otherwise elects to purchase from the holders thereof Shares, other equity
securities of the General Partner Entity, New Securities or Convertible
Funding Debt, then the General Partner Entity shall cause the Partnership to
purchase from the General Partner Entity (a) in the case of a purchase of
Shares, that number of Partnership Units of the appropriate class equal to the
product obtained by multiplying the number of Shares purchased by the General
Partner Entity times a fraction, the numerator of which is one and the
denominator of which is the Conversion Factor, or (b) in the case of the
purchase of any other securities on the same terms and for the same aggregate
price that the General Partner Entity purchased such securities.

 



 

C. _Equity Incentive Plan_. If, at any time or from time to time, the General
Partner Entity sells or otherwise issues Shares pursuant to any Equity
Incentive Plan, the General Partner Entity shall transfer or cause to be
transferred the proceeds of the sale of such Shares, if any, to the
Partnership as an additional Capital Contribution and the Partnership shall
issue to the General Partner Entity an amount of additional Partnership Units
equal to the number of Shares so sold or issued divided by the Conversion
Factor. If the Partnership or the General Partner Entity acquires Shares as a
result of the forfeiture of such Shares under any Equity Incentive Plan, then
the General Partner shall cause the Partnership to cancel, without payment of
any consideration to the General Partner, that number of Partnership Units of
the appropriate class equal to the number of Shares so acquired, and, if the
Partnership acquired such Shares, it shall transfer such Shares to the General
Partner for cancellation.

 



 

D. _Issuances of Shares and Other Securities_. So long as the common shares of
the General Partner Entity are Publicly Traded, the General Partner Entity
shall not grant, award or issue any additional Shares (other than Shares
issued pursuant to _Section 8.6_ hereof or pursuant to a dividend or
distribution (including any share split) of Shares to all of its shareholders
that results in an adjustment to the Conversion Factor pursuant to clause (i),
(ii) or (iii) of the definition thereof), other equity securities of the
General Partner Entity, New Securities or Convertible Funding Debt unless (i)
the General Partner shall cause, pursuant to _Section 4.2.A_ hereof, the
Partnership to issue to the General Partner, Partnership Interests or rights,
options, warrants or convertible or exchangeable securities of the Partnership
having designations, preferences and other rights, all such that the economic
interests are substantially the same as those of such additional Shares, other
equity securities, New Securities or Convertible Funding Debt, as the case may
be, and (ii) in exchange therefor, the General Partner Entity transfers or
otherwise causes to be transferred to the Partnership, as an additional
Capital Contribution, the

 



      
 

 



 

proceeds from the grant, award, or issuance of such additional Shares, other
equity securities, New Securities or Convertible Funding Debt, as the case may
be, or from the exercise of rights contained in such additional Shares, other
equity securities, New Securities or Convertible Funding Debt, as the case may
be (or, in the case of an acquisition described in _Section 7.4.F_ in which
all or a portion of the cash required to consummate such acquisition is to be
obtained by the General Partner Entity through an issuance of Shares described
in _Section 4.2_, the General Partner Entity complies with such _Section
7.4.F_). Without limiting the foregoing, the General Partner Entity is
expressly authorized to issue additional Shares, other equity securities, New
Securities or Convertible Funding Debt, as the case may be, for less than fair
market value, and the General Partner is expressly authorized, pursuant to
_Section 4.2.A_ hereof, to cause the Partnership to issue to the General
Partner corresponding Partnership Interests (for example, and not by way of
limitation, the issuance of Shares and corresponding Partnership Units
pursuant to a share purchase plan providing for purchases of Shares, either by
employees or shareholders, at a discount from fair market value or pursuant to
employee share options that have an exercise price that is less than the fair
market value of the Shares, either at the time of issuance or at the time of
exercise), as long as (a) the General Partner concludes in good faith that
such issuance is in the interests of the General Partner and the Partnership
and (b) the General Partner Entity transfers all proceeds from any such
issuance or exercise to the Partnership as an additional Capital Contribution.

 



 

E. _Funding Debt_. The General Partner or the General Partner Entity or any
wholly owned Subsidiary of either of them may incur a Funding Debt, including,
without limitation, a Funding Debt that is convertible into Shares or
otherwise constitutes a class of New Securities (" ** _Convertible Funding
Debt_** "), subject to the condition that the General Partner, the General
Partner Entity or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, lend to the Partnership
the net proceeds of such Funding Debt; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Convertible Funding Debt shall be issued in accordance with the provisions of
Section 7.5.D above; and, provided further that, if the General Partner Entity
attempts to qualify as a REIT, the General Partner, the General Partner Entity
or such Subsidiary shall not be obligated to lend the net proceeds of any
Funding Debt to the Partnership in a manner that would be inconsistent with
the General Partners or General Partner Entitys ability to remain qualified
as a REIT. If the General Partner, General Partner Entity or such Subsidiary
enters into any Funding Debt, the loan to the Partnership shall be on
comparable terms and conditions, including interest rate, repayment schedule,
costs and expenses and other financial terms, as are applicable with respect
to or incurred in connection with such Funding Debt.

 



 

F. _Capital Contributions of the General Partner_. The Capital Contributions
by the General Partner pursuant to _Sections 7.5.C_ and _7.5.D_ will be
deemed to equal the cash contributed by the General Partner plus, (i) in the
case of cash contributions funded by an offering of any equity interests in or
other securities of the General Partner Entity, the offering costs
attributable to the cash contributed to the Partnership to the extent not
reimbursed pursuant to _Section 7.4.C_ and (ii) in the case of Partnership
Units issued pursuant to _Section 7.5.C_, an amount equal to the difference
between the Value of the Shares sold pursuant to the Equity Incentive Plan and
the net proceeds of such sale.

 



      
 

 



 

G. _Tax Loans_. The General Partner or the General Partner Entity may in its
sole and absolute discretion, cause the Partnership to make an interest free
loan to the General Partner or the General Partner Entity, as applicable,
_provided_ that the proceeds of such loans are used to satisfy any tax
liabilities of the General Partner or the General Partner Entity, as
applicable.

 



 

 **Section 7.6** **Transactions with Affiliates**

 



 

A. _Transactions with Certain Affiliates_. Except as expressly permitted by
this Agreement with respect to any non-arms length transaction with an
Affiliate, the Partnership shall not, directly or indirectly, sell, transfer
or convey any property to, or purchase any property from, or borrow funds
from, or lend funds to, any Partner or any Affiliate of the Partnership that
is not also a Subsidiary of the Partnership, except pursuant to transactions
that are determined in good faith by the General Partner to be on terms that
are fair and reasonable.

 



 

B. _Conflict Avoidance_. The General Partner is expressly authorized to enter
into, in the name and on behalf of the Partnership, a non-competition
arrangement and other conflict avoidance agreements with various Affiliates of
the Partnership and General Partner on such terms as the General Partner, in
its sole and absolute discretion, believes are advisable.

 



 

C. _Benefit Plans Sponsored by the Partnership_. The General Partner in its
sole and absolute discretion and without the approval of the Limited Partners,
may propose and adopt on behalf of the Partnership employee benefit plans
funded by the Partnership for the benefit of employees of the General Partner,
the Partnership, Subsidiaries of the Partnership or any Affiliate of any of
them.

 



 

 **Section 7.7** **Indemnification**

 



 

A. _General_. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Partnership shall
indemnify each Indemnitee from and against any and all losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, joint or several, expenses (including, without
limitation, attorneys fees and other legal fees and expenses), judgments,
fines, settlements and other amounts, arising from or in connection with any
and all claims, demands, subpoenas, requests for information, formal or
informal investigations, actions, suits or proceedings, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, incurred by the Indemnitee and
relating to the Partnership, the General Partner or the General Partner Entity
or the direct or indirect operation of, or the direct or indirect ownership of
property by, the Indemnitee, Partnership or the General Partner or the General
Partner Entity as set forth in this Agreement in which any such Indemnitee may
be involved, or is threatened to be involved, as a party or otherwise, unless
it is established by a final determination of a court of competent
jurisdiction that: (i) the act or omission of the Indemnitee was material to
the matter giving rise to the proceeding and either was committed in bad faith
or was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty, (ii) the Indemnitee
actually received an improper personal benefit in money, property or services
or (iii) in the case of any criminal proceeding, the Indemnitee had reasonable
cause to believe that the act or omission was unlawful. Without limitation,
the foregoing indemnity shall extend to any liability of any Indemnitee,
pursuant to a loan guarantee, contractual obligation for any indebtedness or
other obligation or otherwise, for

 



      
 

 



 

any indebtedness of the Partnership or any Subsidiary of the Partnership
(including, without limitation, any indebtedness which the Partnership or any
Subsidiary of the Partnership has assumed or taken subject to), and the
General Partner is hereby authorized and empowered, on behalf of the
Partnership, to enter into one or more indemnity agreements consistent with
the provisions of this _Section 7.7_ in favor of any Indemnitee having or
potentially having liability for any such indebtedness. The termination of any
proceeding by judgment, order or settlement does not create a presumption that
the Indemnitee did not meet the requisite standard of conduct set forth in
this _Section 7.7.A_. The termination of any proceeding by conviction or upon
a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, or an entry of an order of
probation prior to judgment, creates a rebuttable presumption that the
Indemnitee acted in a manner contrary to that specified in this _Section
7.7.A_ with respect to the subject matter of such proceeding. Any
indemnification pursuant to this _Section 7.7_ shall be made only out of the
assets of the Partnership, and any insurance proceeds from the liability
policy covering the General Partner and any Indemnitee, and neither the
General Partner nor any Limited Partner shall have any obligation to
contribute to the capital of the Partnership or otherwise provide funds to
enable the Partnership to fund its obligations under this _Section 7.7_.

 



 

B. _Reimbursement of Expenses_. To the fullest extent permitted by law,
reasonable expenses expected to be incurred by an Indemnitee shall be paid or
reimbursed by the Partnership in advance of the final disposition of any and
all claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings, civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative made or threatened against an Indemnitee upon
receipt by the Partnership of (i) a written affirmation by the Indemnitee of
the Indemnitees good faith belief that the standard of conduct necessary for
indemnification by the Partnership as authorized in this _Section 7.7_ has
been met and (ii) a written undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to
repay the amount if it shall ultimately be determined that the standard of
conduct has not been met.

 



 

C. _No Limitation of Rights_. The indemnification provided by this _Section
7.7_ shall be in addition to any other rights to which an Indemnitee or any
other Person may be entitled under any agreement, pursuant to any vote of the
Partners, as a matter of law or otherwise, and shall continue as to an
Indemnitee who has ceased to serve in such capacity unless otherwise provided
in a written agreement pursuant to which such Indemnitee is indemnified.

 



 

D. _Insurance_. The Partnership may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf
of the Indemnitees and such other Persons as the General Partner shall
determine against any liability that may be asserted against or expenses that
may be incurred by such Person in connection with the Partnerships
activities, regardless of whether the Partnership would have the power to
indemnify such Indemnitee or Person against such liability under the
provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

E. _No Personal Liability for Partners_. In no event may an Indemnitee subject
any of the Partners to personal liability by reason of the indemnification
provisions set forth in this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

F. _Interested Transactions_. An Indemnitee shall not be denied
indemnification in whole or in part under this _Section 7.7_ because the
Indemnitee had an interest in the transaction with respect to which the
indemnification applies if the transaction was otherwise permitted by the
terms of this Agreement.

 



 

G. _Benefit_. The provisions of this _Section 7.7_ are also for the benefit
of the Indemnitees, their employees, officers, directors, trustees, heirs,
successors, assigns and administrators and shall not be deemed to create any
rights for the benefit of any other Persons. Any amendment, modification or
repeal of this _Section 7.7_, or any provision hereof, shall be prospective
only and shall not in any way affect the limitation on the Partnerships
liability to any Indemnitee under this _Section 7.7_ as in effect immediately
prior to such amendment, modification or repeal with respect to claims arising
from or related to matters occurring, in whole or in part, prior to such
amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of when such claims may arise or
be asserted.

 



 

H. _Indemnification Payments Not Distributions_. If and to the extent any
payments to the General Partner pursuant to this _Section 7.7_ constitute
gross income to the General Partner (as opposed to the repayment of advances
made on behalf of the Partnership), such amounts shall constitute guaranteed
payments within the meaning of Section 707(c) of the Code, shall be treated
consistently therewith by the Partnership and all Partners, and shall not be
treated as distributions for purposes of computing the Partners Capital
Accounts.

 



 

I. _Exception to Indemnification_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, the General Partner shall not be entitled to indemnification
hereunder for any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense for which the
General Partner is obligated to indemnify the Partnership under any other
agreement between the General Partner and the Partnership.

 



 

 **Section 7.8** **Liability of the General Partner**

 



 

A. _General_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the General Partner (which
for the purposes of this _Section 7.8_ shall include the directors, trustees
and officers of the General Partner) shall not be liable or accountable for
monetary or other damages or otherwise to the Partnership, any Partners or any
Assignees for losses sustained, liabilities incurred or benefits not derived
as a result of errors in judgment or mistakes of fact or law or of any act or
omission unless the General Partner acted in bad faith and the act or omission
was material to the matter giving rise to the loss, liability or benefit not
derived.

 



 

B. _Tax Consequences of General Partner Entity and Limited Partners_. The
Limited Partners expressly acknowledge that the General Partner, in
considering whether to dispose of any of the Partnership assets, shall take
into account the tax consequences to the General Partner Entity of any such
disposition and shall have no liability whatsoever to the Partnership or any
Limited Partner for decisions that are based upon or influenced by such tax
consequences. In addition, in exercising its authority under this Agreement
with respect to other matters, the General Partner may, but shall be under no
obligation to, take into account the tax consequences

 



      
 

 



 

to any Partner (including the General Partner Entity) of any action taken (or
not taken) by the General Partner. No decision or action (or failure to act)
contemplated by the preceding sentence shall constitute a breach of any duty
owed to the Partnership or the Limited Partners by law or equity, fiduciary or
otherwise. The General Partner and the Partnership shall not have liability to
any Limited Partner for monetary or other damages or otherwise for losses
sustained, liabilities incurred or benefits not derived by such Limited
Partner in connection with any taking or omission to take any such actions by
the General Partner unless the General Partner acted in bad faith and the act
or omission was material to the matter giving rise to the loss, liability or
benefit not derived.

 



 

C. _No Obligation to Consider Separate Interests of Limited Partners or
Shareholders_. The Limited Partners expressly acknowledge that the General
Partner is acting on behalf of the Partnership, its equityholders (and, to the
extent separate, the equityholders of the General Partner Entity), and the
equityholders of the Limited Partners, collectively, and that, except as
otherwise set forth herein, the General Partner is under no obligation to
consider or give priority to the separate interests of the Limited Partners
(including, without limitation, the tax consequences to Limited Partners or
Assignees) in deciding whether to cause the Partnership to take (or decline to
take) any actions. Any decisions or actions taken or not taken in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement shall not constitute a breach of any duty
owed to the Partnership or the Limited Partners by law or equity, fiduciary or
otherwise. The General Partner and the Partnership shall not have liability to
any Limited Partner for monetary or other damages or otherwise for losses
sustained, liabilities incurred or benefits not derived by such Limited
Partner in connection with any taking or omission to take any such actions by
the General Partner unless the General Partner acted in bad faith and the act
or omission was material to the matter giving rise to the loss, liability or
benefit not derived.

 



 

D. _Actions of Agents_. Subject to its obligations and duties as General
Partner set forth in _Section 7.1.A_, the General Partner may exercise any of
the powers granted to it by this Agreement and perform any of the duties
imposed upon it hereunder either directly or by or through its agents. The
General Partner shall not be liable to the Partnership or any Partner for any
misconduct or negligence on the part of any such agent appointed by the
General Partner in good faith.

 



 

E. _Effect of Amendment_. Notwithstanding any other provision contained
herein, any amendment, modification or repeal of this _Section 7.9_ or any
provision hereof shall be prospective only and shall not in any way affect the
limitations on the General Partners liability to the Partnership and the
Limited Partners or any other Person bound by this Agreement under this
_Section 7.8_ as in effect immediately prior to such amendment, modification
or repeal with respect to claims arising from or relating to matters
occurring, in whole or in part, prior to such amendment, modification or
repeal, regardless of when such claims may arise or be asserted.

 



 

F. _Limitations of Fiduciary Duty_. _Sections 7.1.B_ , _7.1.E_ and this
_Section 7.8_ and any other Section of this Agreement limiting the liability
of the General Partner and/or its trustees, directors and officers shall
constitute an express limitation of any duties, fiduciary or otherwise,

 



      
 

 



 

that they would owe the Partnership or the Limited Partners if such duty would
be imposed by any law, in equity or otherwise.

 



 

G. _Reliance on this Agreement_. To the extent that, at law or in equity, the
General Partner in its capacity as a Limited Partner, has duties (including
fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating thereto to the Partnership or the
Limited Partners, the General Partner shall not be liable to the Partnership
or to any other Partner for its good faith reliance on the provisions of this
Agreement. The provisions of this Agreement, to the extent that they restrict
or eliminate the duties and liabilities of the General Partner or any other
Person under the Act or otherwise existing at law or in equity, are agreed by
the Partners to replace such other duties and liabilities of the General
Partner.

 



 

 **Section 7.9** **Other Matters Concerning the General Partner**

 



 

A. _Reliance on Documents_. The General Partner may rely and shall be
protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any resolution,
certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent,
order, bond, debenture or other paper or document believed by it in good faith
to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or
parties.

 



 

B. _Reliance on Advisors_. The General Partner may consult with legal counsel,
accountants, appraisers, management consultants, investment bankers and other
consultants and advisers selected by it, and any act taken or omitted to be
taken in reliance upon the opinion of such Persons as to matters which the
General Partner reasonably believes to be within such Persons professional or
expert competence shall be conclusively presumed to have been done or omitted
in good faith and in accordance with such opinion.

 



 

C. _Action Through Agents_. The General Partner shall have the right, in
respect of any of its powers or obligations hereunder, to act through any of
its duly authorized officers and a duly appointed attorney or attorneys-in-
fact. Each such attorney shall, to the extent provided by the General Partner
in the power of attorney, have full power and authority to do and perform all
and every act and duty that is permitted or required to be done by the General
Partner hereunder.

 



 

D. _Actions to Maintain REIT Status or Avoid Taxation of the General Partner
Entity_. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement or the Act, if
the General Partner Entity attempts to qualify as a REIT, any action of the
General Partner on behalf of the Partnership or any decision of the General
Partner to refrain from acting on behalf of the Partnership undertaken in the
good faith belief that such action or omission is necessary or advisable in
order (i) to protect the ability of the General Partner Entity to qualify as a
REIT or (ii) to allow the General Partner Entity to avoid incurring any
liability for taxes under Section 857 or 4981 of the Code, is expressly
authorized under this Agreement and is deemed approved by all of the Limited
Partners.

 



       
 

 



 

 **Section 7.10** **Reliance by Third Parties**

 



 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any Person dealing
with the Partnership shall be entitled to assume that the General Partner has
full power and authority, without consent or approval of any other Partner or
Person, to encumber, sell or otherwise use in any manner any and all assets of
the Partnership, to enter into any contracts on behalf of the Partnership and
to take any and all actions on behalf of the Partnership, and such Person
shall be entitled to deal with the General Partner as if the General Partner
were the Partnerships sole party in interest, both legally and beneficially.
Each Limited Partner hereby waives any and all defenses or other remedies that
may be available against such Person to contest, negate or disaffirm any
action of the General Partner in connection with any such dealing, in each
case except to the extent that such action imposes, or purports to impose,
liability on the Limited Partner. In no event shall any Person dealing with
the General Partner or its representatives be obligated to ascertain that the
terms of this Agreement have been complied with or to inquire into the
necessity or expedience of any act or action of the General Partner or its
representatives. Each and every certificate, document or other instrument
executed on behalf of the Partnership by the General Partner or its
representatives shall be conclusive evidence in favor of any and every Person
relying thereon or claiming thereunder that (i) at the time of the execution
and delivery of such certificate, document or instrument, this Agreement was
in full force and effect, (ii) the Person executing and delivering such
certificate, document or instrument was duly authorized and empowered to do so
for and on behalf of the Partnership, and (iii) such certificate, document or
instrument was duly executed and delivered in accordance with the terms and
provisions of this Agreement and is binding upon the Partnership.

 



 

 **Section 7.11** **Loans by Third Parties**

 



 

The Partnership may incur Debt, or enter into similar credit, guarantee,

limitation, in connection with any acquisition of property and any borrowings

with any Person upon such terms as the General Partner determines appropriate.

transaction of any such business by the General Partner, any of its Affiliates
or any officer, director, employee, partner, agent or trustee of the General
Partner, the Partnership or any of their Affiliates, in their capacity as
such, shall not affect, impair or eliminate the limitations on the liability

Person.

 



 

 **Section 8.4** **Return of Capital**

 



 

Except pursuant to the right of redemption set forth in _Section 8.6_, no
Limited Partner shall be entitled to the withdrawal or return of its Capital
Contribution, except to the extent of distributions made pursuant to this
Agreement or upon termination of the Partnership as provided herein. No
Limited Partner or Assignee shall have priority over any other Limited Partner
or Assignee either as to the return of Capital Contributions (except as
permitted by _Section 4.2.A_) or, except to the extent provided by **_Exhibit
C_** or as permitted by _Sections 4.2.A_ , _5.1.B(i)_ , _6.1.A_ and _6.1.B_ ,

 **Section 8.5** **Rights of Limited Partners Relating to the Partnership**

 



 

A. _General_. In addition to other rights provided by this Agreement or by the
Act, and except as limited by _Section 8.5.D_, each Limited Partner shall
have the right, for a business purpose reasonably related to such Limited
Partners interest as a limited partner in the

 



      
 

 



 

Partnership, upon written demand with a statement of the purpose of such
demand and at such Limited Partners own expense (including such
administrative charges as the General Partner may establish from time to
time):

 



 

(1) to obtain a copy of the Partnerships U.S. federal, state and local income
tax returns for each Fiscal Year;

 



 

(2) to obtain a current list of the name and last known business, residence or
mailing address of each Partner;

 



 

(3) to obtain a copy of this Agreement and the Certificate of Limited
Partnership and all amendments thereto, together with executed copies of all
powers of attorney pursuant to which this Agreement, the Certificate of
Limited Partnership and all amendments thereto have been executed;

 



 

(4) to obtain true and full information regarding the amount of cash and a
description and statement of the Agreed Value of any other property or
services contributed by each Partner and which each Partner has agreed to
contribute in the future, and the date on which each Partner became a Partner;
and

 



 

(5) other information regarding the affairs of the Partnership as is just and
reasonable.

 



 

B. _Notice of Conversion Factor_. The Partnership shall notify each Limited
Partner upon request (i) of the then current Conversion Factor and (ii) of any
changes to the Conversion Factor.

 



 

C. _Notice of Termination Transaction of the General Partner Entity_. Prior to
making any extraordinary distributions of cash or property to its shareholders
or effecting a Termination Transaction, the General Partner Entity shall
provide written notice to the Limited Partners of its intention to effect such
distribution or Termination Transaction at least twenty (20) Business Days (or
such shorter period determined by the General Partner Entity in its sole and
absolute discretion) prior to the record date to determine shareholders
eligible to receive such distribution or to vote upon such Termination
Transaction (or, if no such record date is applicable, at least twenty (20)
Business Days (or such shorter period determined by the General Partner Entity
in its sole and absolute discretion) before consummation of such distribution
or Termination Transaction). This provision for such notice shall not be
deemed (i) to permit any transaction that otherwise is prohibited by this
Agreement or requires a Consent of the Partners or (ii) to require a Consent
on the part of any one or more of the Limited Partners to a transaction that
does not otherwise require Consent under this Agreement. Each Limited Partner
agrees, as a condition to the receipt of the notice pursuant hereto, to keep
confidential the information set forth therein until such time as the General
Partner Entity has made public disclosure thereof, to use such information
during such period of confidentiality solely for purposes of determining
whether to exercise the Redemption Right (if applicable) and to execute a
confidentiality agreement provided by the General Partner Entity; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that a Limited Partner may disclose such information to its
attorney, accountant and/or financial advisor for purposes of

 



      
 

 



 

obtaining advice with respect to such exercise so long as such attorney,
accountant and/or financial advisor agrees to receive and hold such
information subject to this confidentiality requirement.

 



 

D. _Confidentiality_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this _Section
8.5_, the General Partner may keep confidential from the Limited Partners, for
such period of time as the General Partner determines in its sole and absolute
discretion, any information that (i) the General Partner reasonably believes
to be in the nature of trade secrets or other information the disclosure of
which the General Partner in good faith believes is not in the best interests
of the Partnership or could damage the Partnership or its business or (ii) the
Partnership is required by law or by agreements with unaffiliated third
parties to keep confidential, _provided_ , _however_ , that this _Section
8.5.D_ shall not affect the notice requirements set forth in _Section 8.5.C_.

 



 

 **Section 8.6** **Redemption Right**

 



 

A. _General_.

 



 

(i) Subject to _Section 8.6.C_ and _Section 11.6.E_ and except as set forth
in _Section 4,2(C)_, at any time on or after one year following the date of
the initial issuance thereof (which, in the event of the transfer of a Class A
Unit or Class B Unit, shall be deemed to be the date that the Class A Unit or
such Class B Unit, as the case may be, was issued to the original recipient
thereof for purposes of this _Section 8.6_), the holder of a Class A Unit or
a Class B Unit (if other than the General Partner Entity or any Subsidiary of
the General Partner Entity) shall have the right (the " ** _Redemption
Right_** ") to require the Partnership to redeem such Partnership Unit, with
such redemption to occur on the Specified Redemption Date and at a redemption
price equal to and in the form of the Cash Amount to be paid by the
Partnership. Any such Redemption Right shall be exercised pursuant to a Notice
of Redemption delivered to the Partnership (with a copy to the General Partner
Entity) by the holder of the Partnership Units who is exercising the
Redemption Right (the " ** _Redeeming Partner_** "). A Limited Partner may
exercise the Redemption Right from time to time, without limitation as to
frequency, with respect to part or all of the Partnership Units that it owns,
as selected by the Limited Partner, _provided_ , _however_ , that a Limited
Partner may not exercise the Redemption Right for fewer than one thousand
(1,000) Partnership Units of a particular class unless such Redeeming Partner
then holds fewer than one thousand (1,000) Partnership Units in that class, in
which event the Redeeming Partner must exercise the Redemption Right for all
of the Partnership Units held by such Redeeming Partner in that class, and
_provided further_ that, with respect to a Limited Partner which is an entity,
such Limited Partner may exercise the Redemption Right for fewer than one
thousand (1,000) Partnership Units without regard to whether or not such
Limited Partner is exercising the Redemption Right for all of the Partnership
Units held by such Limited Partner as long as such Limited Partner is
exercising the Redemption Right on behalf of one or more of its equity owners
in respect of one hundred percent (100%) of such equity owners interests in
such Limited Partner. For purposes hereof, a Class A Unit issued upon
conversion of a Class B Unit shall be deemed to have been issued when the
Class B Unit was issued.

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) The Redeeming Partner shall have no right with respect to any Partnership
Units so redeemed to receive any distributions paid in respect of a
Partnership Record Date for distributions in respect of Partnership Units
after the Specified Redemption Date with respect to such Partnership Units.

 



 

(iii) The Assignee of any Limited Partner may exercise the rights of such
Limited Partner pursuant to this _Section 8.6_, and such Limited Partner
shall be deemed to have assigned such rights to such Assignee and shall be
bound by the exercise of such rights by such Limited Partners Assignee. In
connection with any exercise of such rights by such Assignee on behalf of such
Limited Partner, the Cash Amount shall be paid by the Partnership directly to
such Assignee and not to such Limited Partner.

 



 

(iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing, and subject to _Section 8.6.B(iv)_, if
the General Partner Entity provides notice to the Limited Partners pursuant to
_Section 8.5.C_ hereof, the Redemption Right shall be exercisable, without
regard to whether the Partnership Units have been outstanding for any
specified period, during the period commencing on the date on which the
General Partner Entity provides such notice and ending on the record date to
determine shareholders eligible to receive such distribution or participate in
such Termination Transaction (or if none, ending on the date of consummation
of such distribution or Termination Transaction). If this subparagraph (iv)
applies, the Specified Redemption Date is the date on which the Partnership
and the General Partner receive notice of exercise of the Redemption Right,
rather than ten (10) Business Days after receipt of the Notice of Redemption.

 



 

B. _General Partner Entity Assumption of Redemption Right_.

 



 

(i) If a Limited Partner has delivered a Notice of Redemption, the General
Partner Entity may, in its sole and absolute discretion (subject to the
limitations on ownership and transfer of Shares set forth in the
organizational documents of the General Partner Entity), elect to assume
directly and satisfy a Redemption Right, with such redemption to occur on the
Specified Redemption Date. If such election is made by the General Partner
Entity, the Partnership shall determine whether the General Partner Entity
shall pay the Redemption Amount in the form of the Cash Amount or the Shares
Amount. The Partnerships decision regarding whether such payment shall be
made in the form of the Cash Amount or the Shares Amount shall be made by the
General Partner, in its capacity as the general partner of the Partnership and
in its sole and absolute discretion. Payment of the Redemption Amount in the
form of Shares shall be in Shares duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable and if applicable, free and clear of any pledge, lien,
encumbrance or restriction, other than those provided in the organizational
documents of the General Partner Entity, the Securities Act, relevant state
securities or blue sky laws and any applicable registration rights agreement
with respect to such Shares entered into by the Redeeming Partner, and shall
bear a legend in form and substance determined by the General Partner Entity.
Upon such payment by the General Partner Entity, the General Partner Entity
shall acquire the Partnership Units offered for redemption by the Redeeming
Partner and shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as the owner
of such Partnership Units. Unless the General Partner Entity, in its sole and
absolute discretion, shall exercise its right to assume directly and satisfy
the Redemption Right, the

 



      
 

 



 

General Partner Entity shall not have any obligation to the Redeeming Partner
or to the Partnership with respect to the Redeeming Partners exercise of the
Redemption Right. If the General Partner Entity shall exercise its right to
assume directly and satisfy the Redemption Right in the manner described in
the first sentence of this _Section 8.6B_ and shall fully perform its
obligations in connection therewith, the Partnership shall have no right or
obligation to pay any amount to the Redeeming Partner with respect to such
Redeeming Partners exercise of the Redemption Right, and each of the
Redeeming Partner, the Partnership and the General Partner Entity shall, for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, treat the transaction between the General
Partner Entity and the Redeeming Partner as a sale of the Redeeming Partners
Partnership Units to the General Partner Entity.

 



 

(ii) If the General Partner determines that the General Partner Entity shall
pay the Redeeming Partner the Redemption Amount in the form of Shares, the
total number of Shares to be paid to the Redeeming Partner in exchange for the
Redeeming Partners Partnership Units shall be the applicable Shares Amount.
If this amount is not a whole number of Shares, the Redeeming Partner shall be
paid (i) that number of Shares which equals the nearest whole number less than
such amount plus (ii) an amount of cash which the General Partner Entity
determines, in its reasonable discretion, to represent the fair value of the
remaining fractional Share which would otherwise be payable to the Redeeming
Partner.

 



 

(iii) Each Redeeming Partner agrees to execute such documents or provide such
information or materials as the General Partner Entity may reasonably require
in connection with the issuance of Shares upon exercise of the Redemption
Right.

 



 

C. _Exceptions to Exercise of Redemption Right_. Notwithstanding the
provisions of _Sections 8.6.A_ and _8.6.B_ , a Partner shall not be entitled
to exercise the Redemption Right pursuant to _Section 8.6.A_ if (but only as
long as) the delivery of Shares to such Partner on the Specified Redemption
Date would (i) be prohibited under the restrictions on the ownership or
transfer of Shares in the organizational documents of the General Partner
Entity, (iii) with respect to any Partnership Units issued on or after the
date hereof, be prohibited under applicable federal or state securities laws
or regulations (in each case regardless of whether the General Partner Entity
would in fact assume and satisfy the Redemption Right), (iii) without limiting
the foregoing, result in the General Partners Entitys Shares being owned by
fewer than 100 persons (determined without reference to rules of attribution),
(iv) without limiting the foregoing, result in the General Partner Entity
being "closely held" within the meaning of Section 856(h) of the Code or cause
the General Partner to own, actually or constructively, ten percent (10%) or
more of the ownership interests in a tenant of the General Partner Entity, the
Partnership or a subsidiary of the Partnership within the meaning of Section
856(d)(2)(B) of the Code, and (v) without limiting the foregoing, cause the
acquisition of the Shares by the Redeeming Partner to be "integrated" with any
other distribution of Shares for purposes of complying with the registration
provision of the Securities Act, as amended. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the General Partner may, in its sole and absolute discretion, waive such
prohibition set forth in this _Section 8.6.C_.

 



      
 

 



 

D. _No Liens on Partnership Units Delivered for Redemption_. Each Limited
Partner covenants and agrees that all Partnership Units delivered for
redemption shall be delivered to the Partnership or the General Partner
Entity, as the case may be, free and clear of all liens; and, notwithstanding
anything contained herein to the contrary, neither the General Partner Entity
nor the Partnership shall be under any obligation to acquire Partnership Units
which are or may be subject to any liens. Each Limited Partner further agrees
that, if any Federal, state or local tax is payable as a result of the
transfer of its Partnership Units to the Partnership or the General Partner
Entity, such Limited Partner shall assume and pay such transfer tax.

 



 

E. _Additional Partnership Interests; Modification of Holding Period_. If the
Partnership issues Partnership Interests to any Additional Limited Partner
pursuant to _Article IV_, the General Partner may make such revisions to this
_Section 8.6_ as it determines are necessary to reflect the issuance of such
Partnership Interests (including setting forth any restrictions on the
exercise of the Redemption Right with respect to such Partnership Interests
which differ from those set forth in this Agreement); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no such revisions shall materially adversely affect the rights of any
other Limited Partner to exercise its Redemption Right without that Limited
Partners prior written consent. In addition, the General Partner may, with
respect to any holder or holders of Partnership Units, at any time and from
time to time, as it shall determine in its sole and absolute discretion, (i)
reduce or waive the length of the period prior to which such holder or holders
may not exercise the Redemption Right or (ii) reduce or waive the length of
the period between the exercise of the Redemption Right and the Specified
Redemption Date.

 



 

F. _Registration Rights_. Limited Partners who receive, or have previously
received, Shares in connection with exercise of the Redemption Right and which
do not have a Separate Registration Rights Agreement (as defined in **Exhibit
H**) shall be entitled to the registration rights set forth on **Exhibit H**
(it being understood that the registration rights of holders of Limited
Partners prior to the date hereof or who received Shares in connection with
the exercise of the Redemption Rights prior to the date hereof under the
Agreement remain in effect).

 



 

 **ARTICLE IX** ** 
BOOKS, RECORDS, ACCOUNTING AND REPORTS**

 



 

 **Section 9.1** **Records and Accounting**

 



 

The General Partner shall keep or cause to be kept at the principal office of
the Partnership appropriate books and records with respect to the
Partnerships business, including, without limitation, all books and records
necessary to provide to the Limited Partners any information, lists and copies
of documents required to be provided pursuant to _Section 9.3_. Any records
maintained by or on behalf of the Partnership in the regular course of its
business may be kept on, or be in the form of, punch cards, magnetic tape,
photographs, micrographics or any other information storage device, _provided_
, _however_ , that the records so maintained are convertible into clearly
legible written form within a reasonable period of time. The books of the

 



      
 

 



 

Partnership shall be maintained, for financial and tax reporting purposes, on
an accrual basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

 



 

 **Section 9.2** **Fiscal Year**

 



 

The Fiscal Year shall be the calendar year.

 



 

 **Section 9.3** **Reports**

 



 

A. _Annual Reports_. If and to the extent that the General Partner Entity
mails its annual report to its shareholders, as soon as practicable, but in no
event later than the date on such reports are mailed, the General Partner
Entity shall cause to be mailed to each Limited Partner an annual report, as
of the close of the most recently ended Fiscal Year, containing financial
statements of the Partnership, or of the General Partner Entity (and, if
different, the General Partner) if such statements are prepared on a
consolidated basis with the Partnership, for such Fiscal Year, presented in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, such statements to
be audited by a nationally recognized "Big Four" firm of independent public
accountants selected by the General Partner Entity.

 



 

B. _Quarterly Reports_. If and to the extent that the General Partner Entity
mails quarterly reports to its shareholders, as soon as practicable, but in no
event later than the date on such reports are mailed, the General Partner
Entity shall cause to be mailed to each Limited Partner a report containing
unaudited financial statements, as of the last day of such fiscal quarter, of
the Partnership, or of the General Partner Entity (and, if different, the
General Partner) if such statements are prepared on a consolidated basis with
the Partnership, and such other information as may be required by applicable
law or regulation, or as the General Partner determines to be appropriate.

 



 

C. The General Partner shall have satisfied its obligations under _Sections
9.3.A_ and _9.3.B_ by (i) to the extent the General Partner Entity or the
Partnership is subject to periodic reporting requirements under the Exchange
Act, filing the quarterly and annual reports required thereunder within the
time periods provided for the filing of such reports, including any permitted
extensions, or (ii) posting or making available the reports required by this
_Section 9.3_ on the website maintained from time to time by the Partnership
or the General Partner Entity, provided that such reports are able to be
printed or downloaded from such website.

 



 

 **ARTICLE X** ** 
TAX MATTERS**

 



 

 **Section 10.1** **Preparation of Tax Returns**

 



 

The General Partner shall arrange for the preparation and timely filing of all
returns of Partnership income, gains, deductions, losses and other items

(90) days of the close of each taxable year, the tax information reasonably
required by Limited Partners for federal and state income tax reporting
purposes.

 



 

 **Section 10.2** **Tax Elections**

 



 

A. Except as otherwise provided herein, the General Partner shall, in its sole
and absolute discretion, determine whether to make any available election

The General Partner shall have the right to seek to revoke any such election
upon the General Partners determination in its sole and absolute discretion
that such revocation is in the best interests of the Partners.

 



 

B. To the extent provided for in Treasury Regulations, revenue rulings,
revenue procedures and/or other IRS guidance issued after the date hereof, the
Partnership is hereby authorized to, and at the direction of the General
Partner shall, elect a safe harbor under which the fair market value of any
Partnership Interests issued in connection with the performance of services
after the effective date of such Treasury Regulations (or other guidance) will
be treated as equal to the liquidation value of such Partnership Interests
(i.e., a value equal to the total amount that would be distributed with
respect to such interests if the Partnership sold all of its assets for their
fair market value immediately after the issuance of such Partnership
Interests, satisfied its liabilities (excluding any non-recourse liabilities
to the extent the balance of such liabilities exceeds the fair market value of
the assets that secure them) and distributed the net proceeds to the Partners
under the terms of this Agreement). In the event that the Partnership makes a
safe harbor election as described in the preceding sentence, each Partner
hereby agrees to comply with all safe harbor requirements with respect to
transfers of such Partnership Interests while the safe harbor election remains
effective.

 



 

 **Section 10.3** **Tax Partner and Partnership Tax Audit Matters**

 



 

A. _General_. The General Partner shall be the "tax partner" of the
Partnership for federal, state and local income tax administrative or judicial
proceedings (such administrative proceedings being referred to as a "tax
audit" and such judicial proceedings being referred to as a "judicial review")
and is treated as the "tax matters partner" pursuant to Section 6231(a)(7) of
the Code as in effect on November 1, 2015 (Subchapter C of Chapter 63 of the
Code as in effect on November 1, 2015 referred to as the " ** _Current
Partnership Audit Rules_** ") and the "partnership representative" pursuant to
Section 6223(a) of the Code as included in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015
(with the changes to Subchapter C of Chapter 63 of the Code as made by the
Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 referred to as the " ** _2015 Budget Act
Partnership Audit Rules_** "). The General Partner is authorized to conduct
all tax audits and judicial reviews for the Partnership. So long as Section
6223(c)(3) of the Current Partnership Audit Rules is in effect, upon receipt
of notice from the IRS of the beginning of an administrative proceeding with
respect to the Partnership, the tax partner shall furnish the IRS with the
name, address, taxpayer identification number and profit interest of each of
the Limited Partners and any Assignees; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
information is provided to the Partnership by the Limited Partners.

judicial review for the adjustment of Partnership items required to be taken
into account by a Partner or the Partnership for income tax purposes, and in
the settlement agreement the tax partner may expressly state that such
agreement shall bind the Partnership and all Partners, except that so long as
the Current Partnership Audit Rules are in effect, such settlement agreement
shall not bind any Partner (i) who (within the time prescribed pursuant to the
Code and Regulations under the Current Partnership Audit Rules) files a
statement with the IRS providing that the tax partner shall not have the
authority to enter into a settlement agreement on behalf of such Partner or
(ii) who is a "notice partner" (as defined in Section 6231(a)(8) of the
Current Partnership Audit Rules) or a member of a "notice group" (as defined
in Section 6223(b)(2) of the Current Partnership Audit Rules);

 



 

(3) to seek judicial review of any adjustment assessed by the IRS or any other
tax authority, including the filing of a petition for readjustment with the
Tax Court or the filing of a complaint for refund with the United States
Claims Court or the District Court of the United States for the district in
which the Partnerships principal place of business is located;

 



 

(4) to intervene in any action brought by any other Partner for judicial
review of a final adjustment;

 



 

(5) to file a request for an administrative adjustment with the IRS or other
tax authority at any time and, if any part of such request is not allowed by
the IRS or other tax authority, to file an appropriate pleading (petition or
complaint) for judicial review with respect to such request;

 



 

(6) to enter into an agreement with the IRS or other tax authority to extend
the period for assessing any tax which is attributable to any item required to
be taken into account by a Partner for tax purposes, or an item affected by
such item;

 



 

(7) to take any other action on behalf of the Partners of the Partnership in
connection with any tax audit or judicial review proceeding, to the extent
permitted by applicable law or regulations, including, without limitation, the
following actions to the extent that the 2015 Budget Act Partnership Audit
Rules apply to the Partnership and its current or former Partners:

 



 

a. electing to have the alternative method for the underpayment of taxes set
forth in Section 6226 of the Code, as included in the 2015 Budget Act

 



      
 

 



 

Partnership Audit Rules, apply to the Partnership and its current or former
Partners; and

 



 

b. for Partnership level assessments under Section 6225 of the Code, as
included in the 2015 Budget Act Partnership Audit Rules, determining
apportionment of responsibility for payment among the current or former
Partners, setting aside reserves from Available Cash of the Partnership,
withholding of distributions of Available Cash to the Partners, and requiring
current or former Partners to make cash payments to the Partnership for their
share of the Partnership level assessments; and

 



 

(8) to take any other action required or permitted by the Code and Regulations
in connection with its role as tax partner.

 



 

The taking of any action and the incurring of any expense by the tax partner
in connection with any such audit or proceeding referred to in clause (7)
above, except to the extent required by law, is a matter in the sole and
absolute discretion of the tax partner and the provisions relating to
indemnification of the General Partner set forth in _Section 7.7_ shall be
fully applicable to the tax partner in its capacity as such. In addition, the
General Partner shall be entitled to indemnification set forth in _Section
7.7_ for any liability for tax imposed on the Partnership under the 2015
Budget Act Partnership Audit Rules that is collected from the General Partner.

 



 

The current and former Partners agree to provide the following information and
documentation to the Partnership and the tax partner to the extent that the
2015 Budget Act Partnership Audit Rules apply to the Partnership and its
current or former Partners:

 



 

(1) information and documentation to determine and prove eligibility of the
Partnership to elect out of the 2015 Budget Act Partnership Audit Rules;

 



 

(2) information and documentation to reduce the Partnership level assessment
consistent with Section 6225(c) of the Code, as included in the 2015 Budget
Act Partnership Audit Rules; and

 



 

(3) information and documentation to prove payment of the attributable
liability under Section 6226 of the Code, as included in the 2015 Budget Act
Partnership Audit Rules.

 



 

In addition to the foregoing, and notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, including, without limitation, Section 14.1 of this Agreement, the
General Partner is authorized (without any requirement of the consent or
approval of any other Partners) to make all such amendments to this Section
10.3 as it shall determine, in its sole judgment, to be necessary, desirable
or appropriate to implement the 2015 Budget Act Partnership Audit Rules and
any regulations, procedures, rulings, notices, or other administrative
interpretations thereof promulgated by the U.S. Treasury Department.

 



      
 

 



 

C. _Reimbursement_. The tax partner shall receive no compensation for its
services. All third party costs and expenses incurred by the tax partner in
performing its duties as such (including legal and accounting fees and
expenses) shall be borne by the Partnership. Nothing herein shall be construed
to restrict the Partnership from engaging an accounting firm and/or law firm
to assist the tax partner in discharging its duties hereunder, so long as the
compensation paid by the Partnership for such services is reasonable.

 



 

D. _Survival_. The obligations of each Partner under this _Section 10.3_
shall survive such Partners withdrawal from the Partnership, and each Partner
agrees to execute such documentation requested by the Partnership at the time
of such Partners withdrawal from the Partnership to acknowledge and confirm
such Partners continuing obligations under this _Section 10.3_.

 



 

 **Section 10.4** **Organizational Expenses**

 



 

The Partnership shall elect to deduct expenses as provided in Section 709 of
the Code.

 



 

 **Section 10.5** **Withholding**

 



 

Each Limited Partner hereby authorizes the Partnership to withhold from or pay
on behalf of or with respect to such Limited Partner any amount of U.S.
federal, state, local, or foreign taxes that the General Partner determines
that the Partnership is required to withhold or pay with respect to any cash
or property distributable, allocable or otherwise transferred to such Limited
Partner pursuant to this Agreement, including, without limitation, any taxes
required to be withheld or paid by the Partnership pursuant to Section 1441,
1442, 1445, or 1446 of the Code. Any amount withheld with respect to a
Limited Partner pursuant to this _Section 10.5_ shall be treated as paid or
distributed, as applicable, to such Limited Partner for all purposes under
this Agreement to the extent that the Partnership is contemporaneously making
distributions against which such amount can be offset. Any amount paid on
behalf of or with respect to a Limited Partner, in excess of any such amount
of contemporaneous distributions against which such amount paid can be offset,
shall constitute a loan by the Partnership to such Limited Partner, which loan
shall be repaid by such Limited Partner within fifteen (15) days after notice
from the General Partner that such payment must be made unless (i) the
Partnership withholds such payment from a distribution which would otherwise
be made to the Limited Partner or (ii) the General Partner determines, in its
sole and absolute discretion, that such payment may be satisfied out of the
available funds of the Partnership which would, but for such payment, be
distributed to the Limited Partner. Any amounts withheld pursuant to the
foregoing clauses (i) or (ii) shall be treated as having been distributed or
otherwise paid to such Limited Partner. Each Limited Partner hereby
unconditionally and irrevocably grants to the Partnership a security interest
in such Limited Partners Partnership Interest to secure such Limited
Partners obligation to pay to the Partnership any amounts required to be paid
pursuant to this _Section 10.5_. Any amounts payable by a Limited Partner
hereunder shall bear interest at the base rate on corporate loans at large
United States money center commercial banks, as published from time to time in

 



      
 

 



 

The Wall Street Journal, plus four (4) percentage points (but not higher than
the maximum rate that may be charged under applicable law) from the date such
amount is due (i.e., fifteen (15) days after demand) until such amount is paid
in full. Each Limited Partner shall take such actions as the Partnership or
the General Partner shall request to perfect or enforce the security interest
created hereunder.

 



 

 **ARTICLE XI** ** 
TRANSFERS AND WITHDRAWALS**

 



 

 **Section 11.1** **Transfer**

 



 

A. _Definition_. The term "transfer," when used in this _Article XI_ with
respect to a Partnership Interest or a Partnership Unit, shall be deemed to
refer to a transaction by which the General Partner purports to assign all or
any part of its General Partner Interest to another Person or by which a
Limited Partner purports to assign all or any part of its Limited Partner
Interest to another Person, and includes a transfer, sale, merger,
consolidation, combination, assignment, bequest, conveyance, devise, gift,
pledge, encumbrance, hypothecation, mortgage, exchange or any other
disposition, whether voluntary or involuntary, by operation of law or
otherwise. The term "transfer" when used in this _Article XI_ does not
include any redemption or repurchase of Partnership Units by the Partnership
from a Partner or acquisition of Partnership Units from a Limited Partner by
the General Partner Entity pursuant to _Section 8.6_ or otherwise. When used
in this Article XI, the verb "transfer" shall have correlative meaning. No
Partnership Interest shall be subject to the claims of any creditor, any
spouse (for alimony, support or otherwise), or to legal process, and may not
be voluntarily or involuntarily alienated or encumbered except as may be
specifically provided for in this Agreement or consented to in writing by the
General Partner, in its sole and absolute discretion.

 



 

B. _General_. No Partnership Interest shall be transferred, in whole or in
part, except in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this
_Article XI_. Any transfer or purported transfer of a Partnership Interest
not made in accordance with this _Article XI_ shall be null and void _ab
initio_.

 



 

 **Section 11.2** **Transfers and Withdrawals by General Partner and General
Partner Entity**

 



 

A. _General_. Neither the General Partner nor the General Partner Entity shall
transfer any of its Partnership Interests, and, if the General Partner Entity
is not the General Partner, the General Partner Entity may not transfer any of
its direct or indirect interests in the General Partner, or withdraw from the
Partnership, except (i) in connection with a transaction permitted under
_Section 11.2.B_, (ii) in connection with any merger (including a triangular
merger), consolidation or other combination with or into another Person
following the consummation of which the equity holders of the surviving entity
are substantially identical to the shareholders of the General Partner Entity,
(iii) with the Consent of the Outside Limited Partners; or (iv) to any Person
that is, at the time of such transfer, an Affiliate of the General Partner
Entity that is controlled by the General Partner Entity, including any
Qualified REIT Subsidiary.

 



      
 

 



 

B. _Termination Transactions_. Notwithstanding the restrictions set forth in
_Section 11.2.A_ or any other provision of this Agreement, the General
Partner Entity shall not engage in any merger (including, without limitation,
a triangular merger), consolidation or other combination with or into another
Person, sale of all or substantially all of its assets or any
reclassification, recapitalization or other change in outstanding Shares
(other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or as a
result of a subdivision or combination as described in the definition of
Conversion Factor) (each, a " ** _Termination Transaction_** "), unless, in
connection with such Termination Transaction:

 



 

(1) the General Partner shall have obtained Partnership Approval of the
Termination Transaction, as set forth below, if (x) the Termination
Transaction would result in the Partners receiving consideration for their
Partnership Units pursuant to clause (2) below and the General Partner Entity
is required to seek the approval of its common shareholders of the Termination
Transaction (" ** _Shareholder Approval_** ") in a shareholder vote (a " **
_Shareholder Vote_** "), or (y) the General Partner Entity would be required
to obtain Shareholder Approval of the Termination Transaction but for the fact
that a Tender Offer shall have been accepted with respect to a sufficient
number of Shares to permit consummation of the Termination Transaction without
Shareholder Approval, and

 



 

(2) all Partners either will receive, or will have the right to receive, for
each Partnership Unit cash, securities or other property in the same form as,
and equal in amount to the product of the Conversion Factor and the greatest
amount of, the cash, securities or other property paid to a holder of Shares,
if any, corresponding to such Partnership Unit in consideration of one such
Share at any time during the period from and after the date on which the
Termination Transaction is consummated; _provided_ , _however_ , that if in
connection with the Termination Transaction, a purchase, tender or exchange
offer (a " ** _Tender Offer_** ") shall have been made to and accepted by the
holders of the percentage required for the approval of mergers under the
organizational documents of the General Partner Entity, each holder of
Partnership Units shall receive, or shall have the right to receive, the
greatest amount of cash, securities, or other property which such holder would
have received had it exercised the Redemption Right and received Shares in
exchange for its Partnership Units immediately prior to the expiration of such
purchase, tender or exchange offer and had thereupon accepted such purchase,
tender or exchange offer.

 



 

C. _Partnership Approval_. As used above, " ** _Partnership Approval_** "
means Consent of the Limited Partners holding Class A Units and LTIP Units
representing a Percentage Interest of Class A Units and LTIP Units that equals
or exceeds the percentage of (x) the Shares outstanding or (y) the Shares
cast, as applicable, in the Shareholder Vote ((x) or (y), as applicable, the "
** _Required Denominator Shares_** ") required to be voted in favor of the
Termination Transaction in the Shareholder Vote, provided that, for purposes
of determining whether Partnership Approval has been obtained, the Percentage
Interest of Limited Partners consenting to the Termination Transaction shall
be calculated as follows: Such Percentage

 



      
 

 



 

Interest shall be equal to the sum of (i) the Percentage Interest of Class A
Units and LTIP Units held by Limited Partners consenting to the Termination
Transaction (excluding for this purpose any Class A Units held by (1) the
General Partner or the General Partner Entity, (2) any Person of which the
General Partner or the General Partner Entity directly or indirectly owns or
controls more than fifty percent (50%) of either the voting interests or
economic interests and (3) any Person directly or indirectly owning or
controlling more than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding voting interests
of the General Partner or the General Partner Entity (collectively, the " **
_Excluded Units_** ")), _plus_ (ii) the product of (1) the Percentage Interest
attributable to the Excluded Units, _multiplied by_ (2) either (x) the
percentage of the Required Denominator Shares voted in favor of the
Termination Transaction by the General Partner Entitys shareholders in the
Shareholder Vote to obtain Shareholder Approval, or (y) in the event a Tender
Offer shall have been accepted with respect to a sufficient number of Shares
to permit consummation of the Termination Transaction without Shareholder
Approval, the percentage of outstanding Shares with respect to which such
Tender Offer shall have been accepted.

 



 

D. _Creation of New General Partner_. The General Partner shall not enter
into an agreement or other arrangement providing for or facilitating the
creation of a general partner of the Partnership other than the General
Partner, unless the successor general partner (i) is a direct or indirect
controlled Affiliate of the General Partner, and (ii) executes and delivers a
counterpart to this Agreement in which such successor general partner agrees
to be fully bound by all of the terms and conditions contained herein that are
applicable to the General Partner.

 



 

 **Section 11.3** **Transfers by Limited Partners**

 



 

A. _General_. Except to the extent expressly permitted in _Sections 11.3.B_
and _11.3.C_ or in connection with the exercise of a Redemption Right pursuant
to _Section 8.6,_ a Limited Partner (other than the General Partner and the
General Partner Entity, in their capacities as Limited Partners) may not
transfer any portion of its Partnership Interest, or any of such Limited
Partners rights as a Limited Partner, without the prior written consent of
the General Partner, which consent may be withheld in the General Partners
sole and absolute discretion. Any transfer otherwise permitted under _Sections
11.3.B_ and _11.3.C_ shall be subject to the conditions set forth in _Section
11.3.D_ and _11.3.E_ , and all permitted transfers shall be subject to
_Sections 11.4_, _11.5_ and _11.6_.

 



 

B. _Incapacitated Limited Partner_. If a Limited Partner is subject to
Incapacity, the executor, administrator, trustee, committee, guardian,
conservator or receiver of such Limited Partners estate shall have all the
rights of a Limited Partner, but not more rights than those enjoyed by other
Limited Partners, for the purpose of settling or managing the estate and such
power as the Incapacitated Limited Partner possessed to transfer all or any
part of his, her or its interest in the Partnership. The Incapacity of a
Limited Partner, in and of itself, shall not dissolve or terminate the
Partnership.

 



 

C. _Permitted Transfers_. Subject to _Sections 11.3.D_ , _11.3.E_ , _11.4_ ,
_11.5_ and _11.6_ , a Limited Partner may transfer, with or without the
consent of the General Partner, all or a portion

 



      
 

 



 

of its Partnership Interest (i) in the case of a Limited Partner who is an
individual, to a member of his Immediate Family, any trust formed for the
benefit of himself and/or members of his Immediate Family, or any partnership,
limited liability company, joint venture, corporation or other business entity
comprised only of himself and/or members of his Immediate Family and entities
the ownership interests in which are owned by or for the benefit of himself
and/or members of his Immediate Family, (ii) in the case of a Limited Partner
which is a trust, to the beneficiaries of such trust, (iii) in the case of a
Limited Partner which is a partnership, limited liability company, joint
venture, corporation or other business entity to which Partnership Units were
transferred pursuant to clause (i) above, to its partners, owners or
shareholders, as the case may be, who are members of the Immediate Family of
or are actually the Person(s) who transferred Partnership Units to it pursuant
to clause (i) above, (iv) in the case of a Limited Partner which acquired
Partnership Units as of the date hereof and which is a partnership, limited
liability company, joint venture, corporation or other business entity, to its
partners, owners, shareholders or Affiliates thereof, as the case may be, or
the Persons owning the beneficial interests in any of its partners, owners or
shareholders or Affiliates thereof (it being understood that this clause (iv)
will apply to all of each Persons Partnership Interests whether the
Partnership Units relating thereto were acquired on the date hereof or
hereafter), (v) in the case of a Limited Partner which is a partnership,
limited liability company, joint venture, corporation or other business entity
other than any of the foregoing described in clause (iii) or (iv), in
accordance with the terms of any agreement between such Limited Partner and
the Partnership pursuant to which such Partnership Interest was issued, (vi)
pursuant to a gift or other transfer without consideration, (vii) pursuant to
applicable laws of descent or distribution, (viii) to another Limited Partner,
and (ix) pursuant to a grant of security interest or other encumbrance thereof
effectuated in a bona fide pledge transaction with a bona fide financial
institution as a result of the exercise of remedies related thereto, subject
to the provisions of _Section 11.3.F_ hereof. A trust or other entity will be
considered formed "for the benefit" of a Partners Immediate Family even
though some other Person has a remainder interest under or with respect to
such trust or other entity.

 



 

D. _No Transfers Violating Securities Laws_. The General Partner may prohibit
any transfer of Partnership Units by a Limited Partner unless it receives a
written opinion of legal counsel (which opinion and counsel shall be
reasonably satisfactory to the Partnership) to such Limited Partner to the
effect that such transfer would not require filing of a registration statement
under the Securities Act or would not otherwise violate any federal or state
securities laws or regulations applicable to the Partnership or the
Partnership Unit or, at the option of the Partnership, an opinion of legal
counsel to the Partnership to the same effect.

 



 

E. _No Transfers to Holders of Nonrecourse Liabilities_. No pledge or transfer
of any Partnership Units may be made to a lender to the Partnership or any
Person who is related (within the meaning of Section 1.752-4(b) of the
Regulations) to any lender to the Partnership whose loan otherwise constitutes
a Nonrecourse Liability unless (i) the General Partner is provided prior
written notice thereof and (ii) the lender enters into an arrangement with the
Partnership and the General Partner to exchange or redeem for the Redemption
Amount any Partnership Units in which a security interest is held
simultaneously with the time at which such

 



      
 

 



 

lender would be deemed to be a partner in the Partnership for purposes of
allocating liabilities to such lender under Section 752 of the Code.

 



 

 **Section 11.4** **Substituted Limited Partners**

 



 

A. _Consent of General Partner_. No Limited Partners shall have the right to
substitute a transferee as a Limited Partner in its place (including any
transferees permitted by _Section 11.3_). The General Partner shall, however,
have the right to consent to the admission of a transferee of the interest of
a Limited Partner pursuant to this _Section 11.4_ as a Substituted Limited
Partner, which consent may be given or withheld by the General Partner in its
sole and absolute discretion. The General Partners failure or refusal to
permit a transferee of any such interests to become a Substituted Limited
Partner shall not give rise to any cause of action against the Partnership,
the General Partner or any Partner. The General Partner hereby grants its
consent to the admission as a Substituted Limited Partner to any bona fide
financial institution that loans money or otherwise extends credit to a holder
of Partnership Units and thereafter becomes the owner of such Partnership
Units pursuant to the exercise by such financial institution of its rights
under a pledge of such Partnership Units granted in connection with such loan
or extension of credit.

 



 

B. _Rights of Substituted Partner_. A transferee who has been admitted as a
Substituted Limited Partner in accordance with this _Article XI_ shall have
all the rights and powers and be subject to all the restrictions and
liabilities of a Limited Partner under this Agreement. The admission of any
transferee as a Substituted Limited Partner shall be conditioned upon the
transferee executing and delivering to the Partnership an acceptance of all
the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including, without limitation, the
provisions of _Section 15.11_) and such other documents or instruments as may
be required or advisable, in the sole and absolute discretion of the General
Partner, to effect the admission, each in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the General Partner.

 



 

C. _Partner Registry_. Upon the admission of a Substituted Limited Partner,
the General Partner shall update the Partner Registry in the books and records
of the Partnership as it deems necessary to reflect such admission in the
Partner Registry.

 



 

 **Section 11.5** **Assignees**

 



 

If the General Partner, in its sole and absolute discretion, does not consent
to the admission of any permitted transferee under _Section 11.3_ as a
Substituted Limited Partner, as described in _Section 11.4_, such transferee
shall be considered an Assignee for purposes of this Agreement. An Assignee
shall be entitled to all the rights of an assignee of a limited partnership
interest under the Act, including the right to receive distributions from the
Partnership and the share of Net Income, Net Loss, gain, loss and Recapture
Income attributable to the Partnership Units assigned to such transferee, and
shall have the rights granted to the Limited Partners under _Section 8.6_,
but shall not be deemed to be a holder of Partnership Units for any other
purpose under this Agreement, and shall not be entitled to vote such
Partnership Units in any matter presented to the Limited Partners for a vote
(such Partnership Units being deemed to have been

 



      
 

 



 

voted on such matter in the same proportion as all other Partnership Units
held by Limited Partners are voted). If any such transferee desires to make a
further assignment of any such Partnership Units, such transferee shall be
subject to all the provisions of this _Article XI_ to the same extent and in
the same manner as any Limited Partner desiring to make an assignment of
Partnership Units.

 



 

 **Section 11.6** **General Provisions**

 



 

A. _Withdrawal of Limited Partner_. No Limited Partner may withdraw from the
Partnership other than as a result of a permitted transfer of all of such
Limited Partners Partnership Units in accordance with this _Article XI_ and
the transferee of such Partnership Units being admitted to the Partnership as
a Substituted Limited Partner, or pursuant to redemption of all of its
Partnership Units under _Section 8.6_.

 



 

B. _Termination of Status as Limited Partner_. Any Limited Partner who shall
transfer all of its Partnership Units in a transfer permitted pursuant to this
_Article XI_ where such transferee was admitted as a Substituted Limited
Partner or pursuant to redemption of all of its Partnership Units under
_Section 8.6_ shall cease to be a Limited Partner.

 



 

C. _Timing of Transfers_. Transfers pursuant to this _Article XI_ may only be
made upon ten (10) Business Days prior notice to the General Partner, unless
the General Partner otherwise agrees.

 



 

D. _Allocations_. If any Partnership Interest is transferred during any the
Fiscal Year in compliance with the provisions of this _Article XI_ or
redeemed or transferred pursuant to _Section 8.6_, Net Income, Net Loss, each
item thereof and all other items attributable to such interest for such Fiscal
Year shall be divided and allocated between the transferor Partner and the
transferee Partner by taking into account their varying interests during the
Fiscal Year in accordance with Section 706(d) of the Code and corresponding
Regulations, using the interim closing of the books method (unless the General
Partner, in its sole and absolute discretion, elects to adopt a daily, weekly,
or a monthly proration period, in which event Net Income, Net Loss, each item
thereof and all other items attributable to such interest for such Fiscal Year
shall be prorated based upon the applicable method selected by the General
Partner). Solely for purposes of making such allocations, at the discretion of
the General Partner, each of such items for the calendar month in which the
transfer or redemption occurs shall be allocated to the Person who is a
Partner as of midnight on the last day of said month. All distributions of
Available Cash attributable to any Partnership Unit with respect to which the
Partnership Record Date is before the date of such transfer, assignment or
redemption shall be made to the transferor Partner or the Redeeming Partner,
as the case may be, and, in the case of a transfer or assignment other than a
redemption, all distributions of Available Cash thereafter attributable to
such Partnership Unit shall be made to the transferee Partner.

 



 

E. _Additional Restrictions_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
and in addition to any other restrictions on transfer contained herein or in
any Equity Incentive Plan, including, without limitation, the provisions of
_Article VII_ and this _Article XI_, in no event may

 



       
 

 



 

any transfer or assignment of a Partnership Interest by any Partner (including
pursuant to _Section 8.6_) be made without the express consent of the General
Partner, in its sole and absolute discretion, (i) to any person or entity who
lacks the legal right, power or capacity to own a Partnership Interest; (ii)
in violation of applicable law; (iii) of any component portion of a
Partnership Interest, such as the Capital Account, or rights to distributions,
separate and apart from all other components of a Partnership Interest; (iv)
if in the opinion of legal counsel to the Partnership there is a significant
risk that such transfer would cause a termination of the Partnership for U.S.
federal or state income tax purposes (except as a result of the redemption or
exchange for Shares of all Partnership Units held by all Limited Partners
other than the General Partner, or any Subsidiary of either, or pursuant to a
transaction expressly permitted under _Section 11.2_); (v) if in the opinion
of counsel to the Partnership, there is a significant risk that such transfer
would cause the Partnership to cease to be classified as a partnership for
U.S. federal income tax purposes (except as a result of the redemption or
exchange for Shares of all Units held by all Limited Partners other than the
General Partner, or any Subsidiary of either, or pursuant to a transaction
expressly permitted under _Section 11.2_); (vi) if such transfer requires the
registration of such Partnership Interest pursuant to any applicable federal
or state securities laws; (vii) if such transfer is effectuated through an
"established securities market" or a "secondary market (or the substantial
equivalent thereof)" within the meaning of Section 7704 of the Code or such
transfer causes the Partnership to become a "publicly traded partnership," as
such term is defined in Section 469(k)(2) or Section 7704(b) of the Code (
_provided_ , _however_ , that, this clause (vii) shall not be the basis for
limiting or restricting in any manner the exercise of the Redemption Right
under _Section 8.6_ unless, and only to the extent that, outside tax counsel
provides to the General Partner an opinion to the effect that, in the absence
of such limitation or restriction, there is a significant risk that the
Partnership will be treated as a "publicly traded partnership" and, by reason
thereof, taxable as a corporation); (viii) if such transfer subjects the
Partnership or the activities of the Partnership to regulation under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, the Investment Advisors Act of 1940 or ERISA,
each as amended; (ix) if the General Partner Entity attempts to qualify as a
REIT and, in the opinion of legal counsel for the Partnership, there is a risk
that such transfer would adversely affect the ability of the General Partner
Entity to continue to qualify as a REIT or subject the General Partner Entity
to any additional taxes under Section 857 and Section 4981 of the Code.

 



 

F. _Avoidance of "Publicly Traded Partnership" Status_. The General Partner
shall monitor the transfers of interests in the Partnership to determine (i)
if such interests are being traded on an "established securities market" or a
"secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof)" within the meaning
of Section 7704 of the Code and (ii) whether additional transfers of interests
would result in the Partnership being unable to qualify for at least one of
the "safe harbors" set forth in Regulations Section 1.7704-1 (or such other
guidance subsequently published by the IRS setting forth safe harbors under
which interests will not be treated as "readily tradable on a secondary market
(or the substantial equivalent thereof)" within the meaning of Section 7704 of
the Code) (the " ** _Safe Harbors_** "). The General Partner shall take all
steps reasonably necessary or appropriate to prevent any trading of interests
or any recognition by the Partnership of transfers made on such markets and,
except as otherwise provided herein, to ensure that at least one of the Safe
Harbors is met; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall

 



      
 

 



 

not authorize the General Partner to limit or restrict in any manner the right
of any holder of a Partnership Unit to exercise the Redemption Right in
accordance with the terms of _Section 8.6_ unless, and only to the extent
that, outside tax counsel provides to the General Partner an opinion to the
effect that, in the absence of such limitation or restriction, there is a
significant risk that the Partnership will be treated as a "publicly traded
partnership" and, by reason thereof, taxable as a corporation.

 



 

 **ARTICLE XII** ** 
ADMISSION OF PARTNERS**

 



 

 **Section 12.1** **Admission of a Successor General Partner**

 



 

A successor to all of the General Partners General Partner Interest pursuant
to _Section 11.2_ who is proposed to be admitted as a successor General
Partner shall be admitted to the Partnership as the General Partner, effective
upon such transfer. Any such successor shall carry on the business of the
Partnership without dissolution. In such case, the admission shall be subject
to such successor General Partner executing and delivering to the Partnership
an acceptance of all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement and such
other documents or instruments as may be required to effect the admission.

 



 

 **Section 12.2** **Admission of Additional Limited Partners**

 



 

A. _General_. No Person shall be admitted as an Additional Limited Partner
without the consent of the General Partner, which consent shall be given or
withheld in the General Partners sole and absolute discretion. A Person who
makes a Capital Contribution to the Partnership in accordance with this
Agreement shall be admitted to the Partnership as an Additional Limited
Partner only with the consent of the General Partner and only upon furnishing
to the General Partner (i) evidence of acceptance in form satisfactory to the
General Partner of all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
including, without limitation, the power of attorney granted in _Section
15.11_ and (ii) such other documents or instruments as may be required in the
discretion of the General Partner to effect such Persons admission as an
Additional Limited Partner. The admission of any Person as an Additional
Limited Partner shall become effective on the date upon which the name of such
Person is recorded on the books and records of the Partnership, following the
consent of the General Partner to such admission.

 



 

B. _Allocations to Additional Limited Partners_. If any Additional Limited
Partner is admitted to the Partnership on any day other than the first day of
a Fiscal Year, then Net Income, Net Loss, each item thereof and all other
items allocable among Partners and Assignees for such Fiscal Year shall be
allocated among such Additional Limited Partner and all other Partners and
Assignees by taking into account their varying interests during the Fiscal
Year in accordance with Section 706(d) of the Code and corresponding
Regulations, using the interim closing of the books method (unless the General
Partner, in its sole and absolute discretion, elects to adopt a daily, weekly
or monthly proration method, in which event Net Income, Net Loss, and each
item thereof would be prorated based upon the applicable period selected by
the General Partner). Solely for purposes of making such allocations, at the
discretion of the General Partner, each of

 



      
 

 



 

such items for the calendar month in which an admission of any Additional
Limited Partner occurs shall be allocated among all the Partners and Assignees
including such Additional Limited Partner. All distributions of Available Cash
with respect to which the Partnership Record Date is before the date of such
admission shall be made solely to Partners and Assignees other than the
Additional Limited Partner, and all distributions of Available Cash thereafter
shall be made to all the Partners and Assignees including such Additional
Limited Partner.

 



 

 **Section 12.3** **Amendment of Agreement and Certificate of Limited
Partnership**

 



 

For the admission to the Partnership of any Partner, the General Partner shall
take all steps necessary and appropriate under the Act to amend the records of
the Partnership and, if necessary, to prepare as soon as practical an
amendment of this Agreement (including an amendment to the Partner Registry)
and, if required by law, shall prepare and file an amendment to the
Certificate of Limited Partnership and may for this purpose exercise the power
of attorney granted pursuant to _Section 15.11_ hereof.

 



 

 **ARTICLE XIII** ** 
****DISSOLUTION AND LIQUIDATION**

 



 

 **Section 13.1** **Dissolution**

 



 

The Partnership shall not be dissolved by the admission of Substituted Limited
Partners or Additional Limited Partners or by the admission of a successor
General Partner in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon the
withdrawal of the General Partner, any successor General Partner shall
continue the business of the Partnership. The Partnership shall dissolve, and
its affairs shall be wound up, upon the first to occur of any of the following
(" ** _Liquidating Events_** "):

 



 

(i) an event of withdrawal of the General Partner (other than an event of
bankruptcy), unless within ninety (90) days after the withdrawal, the Consent
of the Outside Limited Partners to continue the business of the Partnership
and to the appointment, effective as of the date of withdrawal, of a
substitute General Partner is obtained;

 



 

(ii) an election to dissolve the Partnership made by the General Partner in
its sole and absolute discretion;

 



 

(iii) entry of a decree of judicial dissolution of the Partnership pursuant to
the provisions of the Act;

 



 

(iv) ninety (90) days after the sale of all or substantially all of the assets
and properties of the Partnership for cash or for marketable securities; or

 



 

(v) a final and non-appealable judgment is entered by a court of competent
jurisdiction ruling that the General Partner is bankrupt or insolvent, or a
final and non-appealable order for relief is entered by a court with
appropriate jurisdiction against the General Partner, in

 



      
 

 



 

each case under any federal or state bankruptcy or insolvency laws as now or
hereafter in effect, unless prior to or at the time of the entry of such order
or judgment, the Consent of the Partners holding more than 50% of the
Percentage Interests represented by the Class A Units is obtained to continue
the business of the Partnership and to the appointment, effective as of a date
prior to the date of such order or judgment, of a substitute General Partner.

 



 

 **Section 13.2** **Winding Up**

 



 

A. _General_. Upon the occurrence of a Liquidating Event, the Partnership
shall continue solely for the purposes of winding up its affairs in an orderly
manner, liquidating its assets, and satisfying the claims of its creditors and
Partners. No Partner shall take any action that is inconsistent with, or not
necessary to or appropriate for, the winding up of the Partnerships business
and affairs. The General Partner (or, if there is no remaining General
Partner, any Person elected by a majority in interest of the Limited Partners
(the " ** _Liquidator_** ")) shall be responsible for overseeing the winding
up and dissolution of the Partnership and shall take full account of the
Partnerships liabilities and property and the Partnership property shall be
liquidated as promptly as is consistent with obtaining the fair value thereof,
and the proceeds therefrom (which may, to the extent determined by the General
Partner, include equity or other securities of the General Partner or any
other entity) shall be applied and distributed in the following order:

 



 

(1) First, to the payment and discharge of all of the Partnerships debts and
liabilities to creditors other than the Partners;

 



 

(2) Second, to the payment and discharge of all of the Partnerships debts and
liabilities to the General Partner;

 



 

(3) Third, to the payment and discharge of all of the Partnerships debts and
liabilities to the Limited Partners;

 



 

(4) Fourth, to the holders of Partnership Interests that are entitled to any
preference in distribution upon liquidation in accordance with the rights of
any such class or series of Partnership Interests (and, within each such class
or series, to each holder thereof pro rata based on its Percentage Interest in
such class); and

 



 

(5) Fifth, the balance, if any, to the Partners, including, without
limitation, the holders of the Vested LTIP Units, in proportion to their
respective positive Capital Account balances, determined after giving effect
to all contributions, distributions, and allocations for all periods.

 



 

The General Partner shall not receive any additional compensation for any
services performed pursuant to this _Article XIII_, other than reimbursement
of its expenses as provided in _Section 7.4_.

 



      
 

 



 

B. _Deferred Liquidation_. Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 13.2.A_
which require liquidation of the assets of the Partnership, but subject to the
order of priorities set forth therein, if prior to or upon dissolution of the
Partnership the Liquidator determines that an immediate sale of part or all of
the Partnerships assets would be impractical or would cause undue loss to the
Partners, the Liquidator may, in its sole and absolute discretion, defer for a
reasonable time the liquidation of any assets except those necessary to
satisfy liabilities of the Partnership (including to those Partners as
creditors) or distribute to the Partners, in lieu of cash, in accordance with
the provisions of _Section 13.2.A_, undivided interests in such Partnership
assets as the Liquidator deems not suitable for liquidation. Any such
distributions in kind shall be made only if, in the good faith judgment of the
Liquidator, such distributions in kind are in the best interest of the
Partners, and shall be subject to such conditions relating to the disposition
and management of such properties as the Liquidator deems reasonable and
equitable and to any agreements governing the operation of such properties at
such time. The Liquidator shall determine the fair market value of any
property distributed in kind using such reasonable method of valuation as it
may adopt.

 



 

 **Section 13.3** **Compliance with Timing Requirements of Regulations;
Restoration of Deficit Capital Accounts**

 



 

A. _Timing of Distributions_. If the Partnership is "liquidated" within the
meaning of Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(g), distributions shall be
made under this _Article XIII_ to the General Partner and Limited Partners
who have positive Capital Accounts in compliance with Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(b)(2). In the discretion of the General Partner a pro rata
portion of the distributions that would otherwise be made to the General
Partner and Limited Partners pursuant to this _Article XIII_ may be: (A)
distributed to a trust established for the benefit of the General Partner and
Limited Partners for the purposes of liquidating Partnership assets,
collecting amounts owed to the Partnership and paying any contingent or
unforeseen liabilities or obligations of the Partnership or of the General
Partner arising out of or in connection with the Partnership (in which case
the assets of any such trust shall be distributed to the General Partner and
Limited Partners from time to time, in the reasonable discretion of the
General Partner, in the same proportions as the amount distributed to such
trust by the Partnership would otherwise have been distributed to the General
Partner and Limited Partners pursuant to this Agreement); or (B) withheld to
provide a reasonable reserve for Partnership liabilities (contingent or
otherwise) and to reflect the unrealized portion of any installment
obligations owed to the Partnership; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
withheld amounts shall be distributed to the General Partner and Limited
Partners as soon as practicable.

 



 

B. _Restoration of Deficit Capital Accounts Upon Liquidation of the
Partnership_. If any Partner has a deficit balance in its Capital Account
(after giving effect to all contributions, distributions and allocations for
all taxable years, including the year during which such liquidation occurs),
such Partner shall have no obligation to make any contribution to the capital
of the Partnership with respect to such deficit, and such deficit shall not be
considered a debt owed to the Partnership or to any other Person for any
purpose whatsoever, except as otherwise set forth in this _Section 13.3.B_,
or as otherwise expressly agreed in writing by the affected

 



      
 

 



 

Partner and the Partnership after the date hereof. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (i) if the General Partner has a deficit balance in its Capital
Account (after giving effect to all contributions, distributions, and
allocations for all Fiscal Years or portions thereof, including the year
during which such liquidation occurs), the General Partner shall contribute to
the capital of the Partnership the amount necessary to restore such deficit
balance to zero in compliance with Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(b)(3); (ii) if a DRO Partner has a deficit balance in its
Capital Account (after giving effect to all contributions, distributions, and
allocations for all Fiscal Years or portions thereof, including the year
during which such liquidation occurs), such DRO Partner shall be obligated to
make a contribution to the Partnership with respect to any such deficit
balance in such DRO Partners Capital Account upon a liquidation of the
Partnership in an amount equal to the lesser of such deficit balance or such
DRO Partners DRO Amount; and (iii) the first sentence of this _Section
13.3.B_ shall not apply with respect to any other Partner to the extent, but
only to such extent, that such Partner previously has agreed in writing, with
the consent of the General Partner, to undertake an express obligation to
restore all or any portion of a deficit that may exist in its Capital Account
upon a liquidation of the Partnership. No Limited Partner shall have any
right to become a DRO Partner, to increase its DRO Amount, or otherwise agree
to restore any portion of any deficit that may exist in its Capital Account
without the express written consent of the General Partner, in its sole and
absolute discretion. Any contribution required of a Partner under this
_Section 13.3.B_. shall be made on or before the later of (i) the end of the
Fiscal Year in which the interest is liquidated or (ii) the ninetieth (90th)
day following the date of such liquidation. The proceeds of any contribution
to the Partnership made by a DRO Partner with respect to a deficit in such DRO
Partners Capital Account balance shall be treated as a Capital Contribution
by such DRO Partner and the proceeds thereof shall be treated as assets of the
Partnership to be applied as set forth in _Section 13.2.A_.

 



 

C. _Restoration of Deficit Capital Accounts Upon a Liquidation of a Partner s
Interest by Transfer_. If a DRO Partners interest in the Partnership is
"liquidated" within the meaning of Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(g)
(other than in connection with a liquidation of the Partnership) which term
shall include a redemption by the Partnership of such DRO Partners interest
upon exercise of the Redemption Right, and such DRO Partner is designated on
**_Exhibit E_** as Part II DRO Partner, such DRO Partner shall be required to
contribute cash to the Partnership equal to the lesser of (i) the amount
required to increase its Capital Account balance as of such date to zero, or
(ii) such DRO Partners DRO Amount. For this purpose, (i) the DRO Partners
deficit Capital Account balance shall be determined by taking into account all
contributions, distributions, and allocations for the portion of the Fiscal
Year ending on the date of the liquidation or redemption, and (ii) solely for
purposes of determining such DRO Partners Capital Account balance, the
General Partner shall re-determine the Carrying Value of the Partnerships
assets on such date based upon the principles set forth in _Sections 1.D.(3)
and (4)_ of **_Exhibit B_** hereto, and shall take into account the DRO
Partners allocable share of any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss resulting
from such redetermination in determining the balance of its Capital Account.
The amount of any payment required hereunder shall be due and payable within
the time period specified in the second to last sentence of _Section 13.3.B_.

 



      
 

 



 

D. _Effect of the Death of a DRO Partner_. After the death of a DRO Partner
who is an individual, the executor of the estate of such DRO Partner may elect
to reduce (or eliminate) the DRO Amount of such DRO Partner. Such elections
may be made by such executor by delivering to the General Partner within two
hundred and seventy (270) days of the death of such Limited Partner, a written
notice setting forth the maximum deficit balance in its Capital Account that
such executor agrees to restore under this _Section 13.3_, if any. If such
executor does not make a timely election pursuant to this _Section 13.3_
(whether or not the balance in the applicable Capital Account is negative at
such time), then the DRO Partners estate (and the beneficiaries thereof who
receive distributions of Partnership Interests therefrom) shall be deemed a
DRO Partner with a DRO Amount in the same amount as the deceased DRO Partner.
Any DRO Partner which itself is a partnership for U.S. federal income tax
purposes may likewise elect, after the date of its partners death to reduce
(or eliminate) its DRO Amount by delivering a similar notice to the General
Partner within the time period specified above, and in the absence of any such
notice the DRO Amount of such DRO Partner shall not be reduced to reflect the
death of any of its partners.

 



 

 **Section 13.4** **Rights of Limited Partners**

 



 

Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each Limited Partner shall
look solely to the assets of the Partnership for the return of its Capital
Contributions and shall have no right or power to demand or receive property
other than cash from the Partnership. Except as otherwise expressly provided
in this Agreement, no Limited Partner shall have priority over any other
Limited Partner as to the return of its Capital Contributions, distributions,
or allocations.

 



 

 **Section 13.5** **Notice of Dissolution**

 



 

If a Liquidating Event occurs or an event occurs that would, but for
provisions of an election or objection by one or more Partners pursuant to
_Section 13.1_, result in a dissolution of the Partnership, the General
Partner shall, within thirty (30) days thereafter, provide written notice
thereof to each of the Partners and to all other parties with whom the
Partnership regularly conducts business (as determined in the discretion of
the General Partner).

 



 

 **Section 13.6** **Cancellation of Certificate of Limited Partnership**

 



 

Upon the completion of the liquidation of the Partnership cash and property as
provided in _Section 13.2_, the Partnership shall be terminated and the
Certificate of Limited Partnership and all qualifications of the Partnership
as a foreign limited partnership in jurisdictions other than the State of
Delaware shall be canceled and such other actions as may be necessary to
terminate the Partnership shall be taken.

 



 

 **Section 13.7** **Reasonable Time for Winding Up**

 



 

A reasonable time shall be allowed for the orderly winding up of the business
and affairs of the Partnership and the liquidation of its assets pursuant to
_Section 13.2_, to minimize any

 



      
 

 



 

losses otherwise attendant upon such winding-up, and the provisions of this
Agreement shall remain in effect among the Partners during the period of
liquidation.

 



 

 **Section 13.8** **Waiver of Partition**

 



 

Each Partner hereby waives any right to partition of the Partnership property.

 



 

 **Section 13.9** **Liability of Liquidator**

 



 

The Liquidator shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Partnership in
the same manner and to the same degree as an Indemnitee may be indemnified
pursuant to _Section 7.8_.

 



 

 **ARTICLE XIV** ** 
AMENDMENT OF PARTNERSHIP 
AGREEMENT; MEETINGS**

 



 

 **Section 14.1** **Amendments**

 



 

A. _General_. The General Partners prior written consent shall be required to
amend or waive any provisions of this Agreement. The General Partner, without
consent of the Limited Partners, may amend this Agreement in any respect;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the following amendments shall require Consent
of the Outside Limited Partners:

 



 

(i) any amendment to _Section 8.6_, its related defined terms or otherwise
affecting the operation of the Conversion Factor or the Redemption Right,
except as permitted pursuant to _Section 8.6.E_, in each case in a manner
that adversely affects the Limited Partners in any material respects;

 



 

(ii) any amendment to _Article V_, its related defined terms or otherwise
affecting the rights of the Limited Partners to receive the distributions
payable to them hereunder, other than in connection with the creation or
issuance of new or additional Partnership Interests pursuant to _Section 4.2_
and except as permitted pursuant to _Section 4.2_ and _Section 5.5_, in each
case in a manner that adversely affects the Limited Partners in any material
respects;

 



 

(iii) any amendment to _Article VI_, its related defined terms or otherwise
that would materially alter the Partnerships allocation of Profit and Loss to
the Limited Partners, other than in connection with the creation or issuance
of new or additional Partnership Interests pursuant to _Section 4.2_ and
except as permitted pursuant to _Section 6.2_;

 



 

(iv) any amendment that would (x) convert a Limited Partners interest in the
Partnership into a general partners interest, (y) modify the limited
liability of a Limited Partner, or (z) impose on the Limited Partners any
obligation to make additional Capital Contributions to the Partnership, or

 



       
 

 



 

(v) any amendment to _Section 4.2.A_ (proviso only), _Section 7.5_, _Section
11.2_, _Section 11.3_ and this _Section 14.1.A_, in each case together with
their related defined terms.

 



 

B. The General Partner shall notify the Limited Partners in writing of any
amendment or waiver not requiring the Consent of the Outside Limited Partners
made pursuant to _Section 14.1.A_ in the next regular communication to the
Limited Partners or within ninety (90) days of such amendment, whichever is
earlier. For any amendment or waiver requiring the Consent of the Outside
Limited Partners pursuant to _Section 14.1.A_, the General Partner shall seek
the written Consent of the Partners as set forth in _Section 14.2_ on such
proposed amendments or waivers or shall call a meeting to vote thereon and to
transact any other business that it may deem appropriate. For purposes of
obtaining a written Consent, the General Partner may require a response within
a reasonable specified time, but not less than seven (7) days, and failure to
respond in such time period shall constitute a vote in favor of the
recommendation of the General Partner. Any such proposed amendment or waiver
shall be adopted and be effective as an amendment or waiver hereto if it is
approved by the General Partner and receives the Consent of the Outside
Limited Partners, as applicable, in accordance with _Sections 14.1.A_.

 



 

C. _Amendment and Restatement of Partner Registry Not an Amendment_.
Notwithstanding anything in this _Article XIV_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
to the contrary, any amendment and restatement of the Partner Registry by the
General Partner to reflect events or changes otherwise authorized or permitted
by this Agreement shall not be deemed an amendment of this Agreement and may
be done at any time and from time to time, as determined by the General
Partner without the Consent of the Outside Limited Partners and without any
notice requirement.

 



 

 **Section 14.2** **Meetings of the Partners**

 



 

A. _General_. Meetings of the Partners may be called by the General Partner.
The call shall state the nature of the business to be transacted. Notice of
any such meeting shall be given to all Partners not less than seven (7) days
nor more than thirty (30) days prior to the date of such meeting. Partners may
vote in person or by proxy at such meeting. Whenever the vote or Consent of
Partners is permitted or required under this Agreement, such vote or Consent
may be given at a meeting of Partners or may be given in accordance with the
procedure prescribed in _Section 14.1.B_. Except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Agreement, the Consent of holders of Partnership Interests
representing a majority of the Percentage Interests of the Class A Units shall
control (including Class A Units held by the General Partner).

 



 

B. _Actions Without a Meeting_. Except as otherwise expressly provided by this
Agreement, any action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the
Partners may be taken without a meeting if a written consent setting forth the
action so taken is signed by Partners holding Partnership Interests
representing more than fifty percent (50%) (or such other percentage as is
expressly required by this Agreement) of the Percentage Interest of the Class
A Units (including Class A Units held by the General Partner). Such consent
may be in one instrument or in several instruments, and shall have the same
force and effect as a vote of Partners. Such consent shall be filed with the
General Partner. An action so taken shall be

 



      
 

 



 

deemed to have been taken at a meeting held on the date on which written
consents from the Partners holding the required Percentage Interest of the
Class A Units have been filed with the General Partner.

 



 

C. _Proxy_. Each Limited Partner may authorize any Person or Persons to act
for him by proxy on all matters in which a Limited Partner is entitled to
participate, including waiving notice of any meeting, or voting or
participating at a meeting. Every proxy must be signed by the Limited Partner
or its attorney-in-fact. No proxy shall be valid after the expiration of
eleven (11) months from the date thereof unless otherwise provided in the
proxy. Every proxy shall be revocable at the pleasure of the Limited Partner
executing it, such revocation to be effective upon the Partnerships receipt
of written notice thereof.

 



 

D. _Votes_. On matters on which Limited Partners are entitled to vote, each
Limited Partner shall have the number of votes equal to the number of Class A
Units held.

 



 

E. _Conduct of Meeting_. Each meeting of Partners shall be conducted by the
General Partner or such other Person as the General Partner may appoint
pursuant to such rules for the conduct of the meeting as the General Partner
or such other Person deem appropriate.

 



 

F. _Record Date_. The General Partner may set, in advance, the Partnership
Record Date for the purpose of determining the Partners (i) entitled to
Consent to any action, (ii) entitled to receive notice of or vote at any
meeting of the Partners or (iii) in order to make a determination of Partners
for any other proper purpose. Such date, in any case, (x) shall not be prior
to the close of business on the day the Partnership Record Date is fixed and
shall be not more than ninety (90) days and, in the case of a meeting of the
Partners, not less than ten (10) days, before the date on which the meeting is
to be held or Consent is to be given and (y) shall be, with respect to the
determination of the existence of Partnership Approval, the record date
established by the General Partner for the approval of its shareholders for
the event constituting a Termination Transaction. If no record date is fixed,
the record date for the determination of Partners entitled to notice of or to
vote at a meeting of the Partners shall be at the close of business on the day
on which the notice of the meeting is sent, and the record date for any other
determination of Partners shall be the effective date of such Partner action,
distribution or other event. When a determination of the Partners entitled to
vote at any meeting of the Partners has been made as provided in this section,
such determination shall apply to any adjournment thereof.

A. _General_. Each Limited Partner and each Assignee who accepts Partnership
Units (or any rights, benefits or privileges associated therewith) is deemed
to irrevocably constitute and appoint the General Partner, any Liquidator and
authorized officers and attorneys-in-fact of each, and each of those acting
singly, in each case with full power of substitution, as its true and lawful
agent and attorney-in-fact, with full power and authority in its name, place
and stead to:

 



 

(1) execute, swear to, acknowledge, deliver, file and record in the
appropriate public offices (a) all certificates, documents and other
instruments (including, without limitation, this Agreement and the Certificate
of Limited Partnership and all amendments or restatements thereof) that the
General Partner or any Liquidator deems appropriate or necessary to form,
qualify or continue the existence or qualification of the Partnership as a
limited partnership (or a partnership in which the limited partners have
limited liability) in the State of Delaware and in all other jurisdictions in
which the Partnership may conduct business or own property, (b) all
instruments that the General Partner or any Liquidator deem appropriate or
necessary to reflect any amendment, change, modification or restatement of
this Agreement in accordance with its terms, (c) all conveyances and other
instruments or documents that the General Partner or any Liquidator deems
appropriate or necessary to reflect the dissolution and liquidation of the
Partnership pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, including, without
limitation, a certificate of cancellation, (d) all instruments relating to the

absolute discretion of the General Partner or any Liquidator, to make,

other action which is made or given by the Partners hereunder or is consistent
with the terms of this Agreement or appropriate or necessary, in the sole and
absolute discretion of the General Partner or any Liquidator, to effectuate
the terms or intent of this Agreement.

 



 

Nothing contained in this _Section 15.11_ shall be construed as authorizing
the General Partner or any Liquidator to amend this Agreement except in
accordance with _Article XIV_ hereof or as may be otherwise expressly
provided for in this Agreement.

 



 

B. _Irrevocable Nature_. The foregoing power of attorney is hereby declared to
be irrevocable and a power coupled with an interest, in recognition of the
fact that each of the Partners will be relying upon the power of the General
Partner or any Liquidator to act as contemplated by this Agreement in any
filing or other action by it on behalf of the Partnership, and it shall
survive and not be affected by the subsequent Incapacity of any Limited
Partner or Assignee and the transfer of all or any portion of such Limited
Partners or Assignees Partnership Units and shall extend to such Limited
Partners or Assignees heirs, successors, assigns and personal
representatives. Each such Limited Partner or Assignee hereby agrees to be
bound by any representation made by the General Partner or any Liquidator,
acting in good faith pursuant to such power of attorney; and each such Limited
Partner or Assignee hereby waives any and all defenses which may be available
to contest, negate or disaffirm the action of the General Partner or any
Liquidator, taken in good faith under such power of attorney. Each Limited
Partner or Assignee shall execute and deliver to the General Partner or the
Liquidator, within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the General Partners or
Liquidators request therefor, such further designation, powers of attorney
and other instruments as the General Partner or the Liquidator, as the case
may be, deems necessary to effectuate this Agreement and the purposes of the
Partnership.

 



 

 **Section 15.12** **Entire Agreement**

 



 

This Agreement contains the entire understanding and agreement among the
Partners with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior
written oral understandings or agreements among them with respect thereto.

 



 

 **Section 15.13** **No Rights as Shareholders**

 



 

Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as conferring upon the
holders of the Partnership Units any rights whatsoever as shareholders of the
General Partner Entity, including, without limitation, any right to receive
dividends or other distributions made to shareholders of the General Partner
Entity, or to vote or to consent or receive notice as shareholders in respect
to any meeting of shareholders for the election of trustees (or directors, if
applicable) of the General Partner Entity or any other matter.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 15.14** **Limitation to Preserve REIT Status**

 



 

If the General Partner Entity attempts to qualify as a REIT, to the extent
that any amount paid or credited to the General Partner Entity or any of its
officers, trustees, employees or agents pursuant to _Section 7.4_ or _Section
7.7_ would constitute gross income to the General Partner for purposes of
Section 856(c)(2) or 856(c)(3) of the Code (a " ** _General Partner Payment_**
") then, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the amount of
such General Partner Payment for any Fiscal Year shall not exceed the lesser
of:

 



 

(i) an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (a) 4% of the General Partner
Entitys total gross income (within the meaning of Section 856(c)(3) of the
Code but not including the amount of any General Partner Payments) for the
Fiscal Year which is described in subsections (A) though (I) of Section
856(c)(2) of the Code over (b) the amount of gross income (within the meaning
of Section 856(c)(2) of the Code) derived by the General Partner Entity from
sources other than those described in subsections (A) through (H) of Section
856(c)(2) of the Code (but not including the amount of any General Partner
Payments); or

 



 

(ii) an amount equal to the excess, if any of (a) 24% of the General Partner
Entitys total gross income (but not including the amount of any General
Partner Payments) for the Fiscal Year which is described in subsections (A)
through (I) of Section 856(c)(3) of the Code over (b) the amount of gross
income (within the meaning of Section 856(c)(3) of the Code but not including
the amount of any General Partner Payments) derived by the General Partner
Entity from sources other than those described in subsections (A) through (I)
of Section 856(c)(3) of the Code;

 



 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that General Partner Payments in excess of the
amounts set forth in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) above may be made if the
General Partner Entity, as a condition precedent, obtains an opinion of tax
counsel that the receipt of such excess amounts would not adversely affect the
General Partner Entitys ability to qualify as a REIT. To the extent General
Partner Payments may not be made in a given Fiscal Year due to the foregoing
limitations, such General Partner Payments shall carry over and be treated as
arising in the following year; _provided_ , _however_ , that such amounts
shall not carry over for more than five Fiscal Years, and if not paid within
such five Fiscal Year period, shall expire; and provided further that (i) as
General Partner Payments are made, such payments shall be applied first to
carry over amounts outstanding, if any, and (ii) with respect to carry over
amounts for more than one Fiscal Year, such payments shall be applied to the
earliest Fiscal Year first.

 **EXHIBIT B**

 



 

 **CAPITAL ACCOUNT MAINTENANCE**

 



 

 **1.** **Capital Accounts of the Partners**

 



 

A. The Partnership shall maintain for each Partner a separate Capital Account
in accordance with the rules of Regulations Section l.704-l(b)(2)(iv). Such
Capital Account shall be increased by (i) the amount of all Capital
Contributions and any other deemed contributions made by such Partner to the
Partnership pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) all items of Partnership
income and gain (including income and gain exempt from tax) computed in
accordance with _Section 1.B_ hereof and allocated to such Partner pursuant
to _Section 6.1_ of the Agreement and this **_Exhibit B_**, and decreased by
(x) the amount of cash or Agreed Value of property actually distributed or
deemed to be distributed to such Partner pursuant to this Agreement and (y)
all items of Partnership deduction and loss computed in accordance with
_Section 1.B_ hereof and allocated to such Partner pursuant to _Section 6.1_
of the Agreement and this **_Exhibit B_**.

 



 

B. For purposes of computing Net Income, Net Loss or the amount of any item of
income, gain, loss and deduction to be reflected in the Partners Capital
Accounts, unless otherwise specified in this Agreement, the determination,
recognition and classification of any such item shall be the same as its
determination, recognition and classification for federal income tax purposes
determined in accordance with Section 703(a) of the Code (for this purpose all
items of income, gain, loss or deduction required to be stated separately
pursuant to Section 703(a)(1) of the Code shall be included in taxable income
or loss), with the following adjustments:

 



 

(1) Except as otherwise provided in Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m),
the computation of Net Income, Net Loss and all items of income, gain, loss
and deduction shall be made without regard to any adjustments to the adjusted
bases of the assets of the Partnership pursuant to Sections 754 of the Code,
_provided_ , _however_ , that the amounts of any adjustments to the adjusted
bases of the assets of the Partnership made pursuant to Section 734 of the
Code as a result of the distribution of property by the Partnership to a
Partner (to the extent that such adjustments have not previously been
reflected in the Partners Capital Accounts) shall be reflected in the Capital
Accounts of the Partners in the manner and subject to the limitations
prescribed in Regulations Section l.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(4).

 



 

(2) The computation of Net Income, Net Loss and all items of income, gain,
loss and deduction shall be made without regard to the fact that items
described in Sections 705(a)(l)(B) or 705(a)(2)(B) of the Code are not
includible in gross income or are neither currently deductible nor capitalized
for federal income tax purposes.

 



 

(3) Any income, gain or loss attributable to the taxable disposition of any
Partnership property shall be determined as if the adjusted basis of such
property as of such date of disposition were equal in amount to the
Partnerships Carrying Value with respect to such property as of such date.

 



 

Exhibit B-1     
 

 



 

(4) In lieu of the depreciation, amortization, and other cost recovery
deductions taken into account in computing such taxable income or loss, there
shall be taken into account Depreciation for such Fiscal Year or shorter
period.

 



 

(5) In the event the Carrying Value of any Partnership asset is adjusted
pursuant to _Section 1.D_ hereof, the amount of any such adjustment shall be
taken into account as gain or loss from the disposition of such asset.

 



 

(6) Any items specially allocated under _Section 1_ of **_Exhibit C_** to
the Agreement hereof shall not be taken into account.

 



 

C. A transferee (including any Assignee) of a Partnership Unit shall succeed
to a pro rata portion of the Capital Account of the transferor in accordance
with Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(l).

 



 

D. (1) Consistent with the provisions of Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f), and as provided in _Section 1.D(2)_, the Carrying
Values of all Partnership assets shall be adjusted upward or downward to
reflect any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss attributable to such
Partnership property, as of the times of the adjustments provided in _Section
1.D(2)_ hereof, as if such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss had been
recognized on an actual sale of each such property and allocated pursuant to
_Section 6.1_ of the Agreement.

 



 

(2) Such adjustments shall be made as of the following times: (a) immediately
prior to the acquisition of an additional interest in the Partnership by any
new or existing Partner in exchange for more than a de minimis Capital
Contribution; (b) immediately prior to the distribution by the Partnership to
a Partner of more than a de minimis amount of property as consideration for an
interest in the Partnership; (c) immediately prior to the liquidation of the
Partnership within the meaning of Regulations Section 1.704-l(b)(2)(ii)(g);
(d) immediately prior to the grant of an interest in the Partnership (other
than a de minimis interest) as consideration for the provision of services to
or for the benefit of the Partnership by an existing Partner acting in a
Partner capacity or by a new partner acting in a Partner capacity or in
anticipation of becoming a Partner (including the issuance of any LTIP Units);
and (e) at such other times as permitted or required under Regulations;
_provided_ , _however_ , that adjustments pursuant to clauses (a), (b), (d)
and (e) (to the extent not required by Regulations) above shall be made only
if the General Partner determines that such adjustments are necessary or
appropriate to reflect the relative economic interests of the Partners in the
Partnership.

 



 

(3) In accordance with Regulations Section 1.704- l(b)(2)(iv)(e), the Carrying
Value of Partnership assets distributed in kind shall be adjusted upward or
downward to reflect any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss attributable to
such Partnership property, as of the time any such asset is distributed.

 



 

(4) In determining Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss for purposes of this
**_Exhibit B_**, the aggregate cash amount and fair market value of all
Partnership assets (including cash or cash equivalents) shall be determined by
the General Partner using such reasonable method of valuation as it may adopt,
or in the case of a liquidating distribution pursuant to

 



 

Exhibit B-2     
 

 



 

 _Article XIII_ of the Agreement, shall be determined and allocated by the
Liquidator using such reasonable methods of valuation as it may adopt. The
General Partner, or the Liquidator, as the case may be, shall allocate such
aggregate fair market value among the assets of the Partnership in such manner
as it determines in its sole and absolute discretion to arrive at a fair
market value for individual properties.

 



 

E. The provisions of the Agreement (including this **_Exhibit B_** and the
other Exhibits to the Agreement) relating to the maintenance of Capital
Accounts are intended to comply with Regulations Section 1.704-1(b), and shall
be interpreted and applied in a manner consistent with such Regulations. In
the event the General Partner shall determine that it is prudent to modify the
manner in which the Capital Accounts, or any debits or credits thereto
(including, without limitation, debits or credits relating to liabilities
which are secured by contributed or distributed property or which are assumed
by the Partnership, the General Partner, or the Limited Partners) are computed
in order to comply with such Regulations, the General Partner may make such
modification without regard to _Article XIV_ of the Agreement, provided that
it is not likely to have a material effect on the amounts distributable to any
Person pursuant to _Article XIII_ of the Agreement upon the dissolution of
the Partnership. The General Partner also shall (i) make any adjustments that
are necessary or appropriate to maintain equality between the Capital Accounts
of the Partners and the amount of Partnership capital reflected on the
Partnerships balance sheet, as computed for book purposes, in accordance with
Regulations Section l.704-l(b)(2)(iv)(q), and (ii) make any appropriate
modifications in the event unanticipated events might otherwise cause this
Agreement not to comply with Regulations Section l.704-1(b).

 



 

 **2.** **No Interest**

 



 

No interest shall be paid by the Partnership on Capital Contributions or on
balances in Partners Capital Accounts.

 



 

 **3.** **No Withdrawal**

 



 

No Partner shall be entitled to withdraw any part of its Capital Contribution
or Capital Account or to receive any distribution from the Partnership, except
as provided in _Articles IV, V, VII_ and _XIII_ of the Agreement.

 



 

Exhibit B-3     
 

 



 

 **EXHIBIT C**

 



 

 **SPECIAL ALLOCATION RULES**

 



 

 **1.** **Special Allocation Rules.**

 



 

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement or this **_Exhibit C_**,
the following special allocations shall be made in the following order:

 



 

A. _Minimum Gain Chargeback_. Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 6.1_
of the Agreement or any other provisions of this **_Exhibit C_**, if there is
a net decrease in Partnership Minimum Gain during any Fiscal Year, each
Partner shall be specially allocated items of Partnership income and gain for
such year (and, if necessary, subsequent years) in an amount equal to such
Partners share of the net decrease in Partnership Minimum Gain, as determined
under Regulations Section 1.704-2(g). Allocations pursuant to the previous
sentence shall be made in proportion to the respective amounts required to be
allocated to each Partner pursuant thereto. The items to be so allocated shall
be determined in accordance with Regulations Section 1.704-2(f)(6). This
_Section 1.A_ is intended to comply with the minimum gain chargeback
requirements in Regulations Section 1.704-2(f) and for purposes of this
_Section 1.A_ only, each Partners Adjusted Capital Account Deficit shall be
determined prior to any other allocations pursuant to _Section 6.1_ of the
Agreement or this **_Exhibit C_** with respect to such Fiscal Year and
without regard to any decrease in Partner Minimum Gain during such Fiscal
Year.

 



 

B. _Partner Minimum Gain Chargeback_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
_Section 6.1_ of this Agreement or any other provisions of this **_Exhibit
C_** (except _Section 1.A_ hereof), if there is a net decrease in Partner
Minimum Gain attributable to Partner Nonrecourse Debt during any Fiscal Year,
each Partner who has a share of the Partner Minimum Gain attributable to such
Partner Nonrecourse Debt, determined in accordance with Regulations Section
1.704-2(i)(5), shall be specially allocated items of Partnership income and
gain for such year (and, if necessary, subsequent years) in an amount equal to
such Partners share of the net decrease in Partner Minimum Gain attributable
to such Partner Nonrecourse Debt, determined in accordance with Regulations
Section 1.704-2(i)(4). Allocations pursuant to the previous sentence shall be
made in proportion to the respective amounts required to be allocated to each
General Partner and Limited Partner pursuant thereto. The items to be so
allocated shall be determined in accordance with Regulations Section
1.704-2(i)(4). This _Section 1.B_ is intended to comply with the minimum gain
chargeback requirement in such Section of the Regulations and shall be
interpreted consistently therewith. Solely for purposes of this _Section
1.B_, each Partners Adjusted Capital Account Deficit shall be determined
prior to any other allocations pursuant to _Section 6.1_ of the Agreement or
this **_Exhibit C_** with respect to such Fiscal Year, other than allocations
pursuant to _Section 1.A_ hereof.

 



 

C. _Qualified Income Offset_. In the event any Partner unexpectedly receives
any adjustments, allocations or distributions described in Regulations
Sections 1.704-l(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), l.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(5), or
1.704-l(b)(2)(ii)(d)(6), and after giving effect to the allocations required
under _Sections 1.A_ and _1.B_ hereof with respect to such Fiscal Year, such
Partner has an

 



 

Exhibit C-1     
 

 



 

Adjusted Capital Account Deficit, items of Partnership income and gain
(consisting of a pro rata portion of each item of Partnership income,
including gross income and gain for the Fiscal Year) shall be specifically
allocated to such Partner in an amount and manner sufficient to eliminate, to
the extent required by the Regulations, its Adjusted Capital Account Deficit
created by such adjustments, allocations or distributions as quickly as
possible. This _Section 1.C_ is intended to constitute a "qualified income
offset" under Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d) and shall be
interpreted consistently therewith.

 



 

D. _Gross Income Allocation_. In the event that any Partner has an Adjusted
Capital Account Deficit at the end of any Fiscal Year (after taking into
account allocations to be made under the preceding paragraphs hereof with
respect to such Fiscal Year), each such Partner shall be specially allocated
items of Partnership income and gain (consisting of a pro rata portion of each
item of Partnership income, including gross income and gain for the Fiscal
Year) in an amount and manner sufficient to eliminate, to the extent required
by the Regulations, its Adjusted Capital Account Deficit.

 



 

E. _Nonrecourse Deductions_. Except as may otherwise be expressly provided by
the General Partner pursuant to _Section 4.2_ of the Agreement with respect
to other classes of Partnership Units, Nonrecourse Deductions for any Fiscal
Year shall be allocated only to the Partners holding Class A Units and Class B
Units in accordance with their respective Percentage Interests. If the General
Partner determines in its good faith discretion that the Partnerships
Nonrecourse Deductions must be allocated in a different ratio to satisfy the
safe harbor requirements of the Regulations promulgated under Section 704(b)
of the Code, the General Partner is authorized, upon notice to the Limited
Partners, to revise the prescribed ratio for such Fiscal Year to the
numerically closest ratio which would satisfy such requirements.

 



 

F. _Partner Nonrecourse Deductions_. Any Partner Nonrecourse Deductions for
any Fiscal Year shall be specially allocated to the Partner who bears the
economic risk of loss with respect to the Partner Nonrecourse Debt to which
such Partner Nonrecourse Deductions are attributable in accordance with
Regulations Sections 1.704-2(b)(4) and 1.704-2(i).

 



 

G. _Adjustments Pursuant to Code Section 734 and Section 743_. To the extent
an adjustment to the adjusted tax basis of any Partnership asset pursuant to
Section 734(b) or 743(b) of the Code is required, pursuant to Regulations
Section 1.704-l(b)(2)(iv)(m), to be taken into account in determining Capital
Accounts, the amount of such adjustment to the Capital Accounts shall be
treated as an item of gain (if the adjustment increases the basis of the
asset) or loss (if the adjustment decreases such basis), and such item of gain
or loss shall be specially allocated to the Partners in a manner consistent
with the manner in which their Capital Accounts are required to be adjusted
pursuant to such Section of the Regulations.

 



 

H. _Forfeiture Allocations_. Upon a forfeiture of any unvested Partnership
Interest by any Partner, gross items of income, gain, loss or deduction shall
be allocated to such Partner if and to the extent required by final Treasury
Regulations promulgated after the date hereof (or, if final Treasury
Regulations have not yet been promulgated, to the extent determined by the
General Partner, in its sole discretion, as necessary) to ensure that
allocations made with respect to all unvested Partnership Interests are
recognized under Code Section 704(b).

 



 

Exhibit C-2     
 

 



 

I. The allocations set forth in clauses (A) through (F) of this Section 1 ("
** _Regulatory Allocations_** ") are intended to comply with certain
regulatory requirements, including the requirements of Regulations Section
1.704-1(b) and 1.704-2. Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 6.1_ of
the Agreement, the Regulatory Allocations shall be taken into account in
allocating other items of income, gain, loss and deduction among the Partners
so that, to the extent possible without violating the requirements giving rise
to the Regulatory Allocations, the net amount of such allocations of other
items and the Regulatory Allocations to each Partner shall be equal to the net
amount that would have been allocated to each such Partner if the Regulatory
Allocations had not been made.

 



 

 **2.** **Allocations for Tax Purposes**

 



 

A. Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 2_, for federal income tax
purposes, each item of income, gain, loss and deduction shall be allocated
among the Partners in the same manner as its correlative item of "book"
income, gain, loss or deduction is allocated pursuant to _Section 6.1_ of the
Agreement and _Section 1_ of this **_Exhibit C_**.

 



 

B. In an attempt to eliminate Book-Tax Disparities attributable to a
Contributed Property or Adjusted Property, items of income, gain, loss and
deduction shall be allocated for federal income tax purposes among the
Partners as follows:

 



 

(1) (a) In the case of a Contributed Property, such items attributable thereto
shall be allocated among the Partners consistent with the principles of
Section 704(c) of the Code to take into account the variation between the
Section 704(c) Value of such property and its adjusted basis at the time of
contribution (taking into account _Section 2.C_ of this **_Exhibit C_**);
and

 



 

(b) any item of Residual Gain or Residual Loss attributable to a Contributed
Property shall be allocated among the Partners in the same manner as its
correlative item of "book" gain or loss is allocated pursuant to _Section
6.1_ of the Agreement and _Section 1_ of this **_Exhibit C_**.

 



 

(2) (a) In the case of an Adjusted Property, such items shall

 



 

(i) first, be allocated among the Partners in a manner consistent with the
principles of Section 704(c) of the Code to take into account the Unrealized
Gain or Unrealized Loss attributable to such property and the allocations
thereof pursuant to **_Exhibit B_**;

 



 

(ii) second, in the event such property was originally a Contributed Property,
be allocated among the Partners in a manner consistent with _Section 2.B(1)_
of this **_Exhibit C_**; and

 



 

(b) any item of Residual Gain or Residual Loss attributable to an Adjusted
Property shall be allocated among the Partners in the same manner its
correlative item of "book" gain or loss is allocated pursuant to _Section
6.1_ of the Agreement and _Section 1_ of this **_Exhibit C_**.

 



 

Exhibit C-3     
 

 



 

(3) all other items of income, gain, loss and deduction shall be allocated
among the Partners the same manner as their correlative item of "book" gain or
loss is allocated pursuant to _Section 6.1_ of the Agreement and _Section 1_
of this **_Exhibit C_**.

 



 

C. To the extent Regulations promulgated pursuant to Section 704(c) of the
Code permit a Partnership to utilize alternative methods to eliminate the
disparities between the Carrying Value of property and its adjusted basis, the
General Partner shall, subject to any agreements between the Partnership and a
Partner, have the authority to elect the method to be used by the Partnership
and such election shall be binding on all Partners.

 



 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2 of Exhibit C, the
General Partner shall elect to apply the "traditional" method, as defined in
Regulations Section 1.704-3(b), to eliminate the disparities between the
Carrying Values and the adjusted tax bases of (i) the properties contributed
to the Partnership in consideration for OP Units pursuant to the transactions
contemplated by the Combination Agreement (the "Combination"), and (ii) the
assets owned by the Partnership immediately prior to the transactions
contemplated by the Combination Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
General Partner and the JBG Parties may agree to apply a different method to
one or more properties contributed to the Partnership pursuant to the
Combination, if (x) such method is permitted by Section 1.704-3 of the
Regulations, and (y) the parties to the Combination Agreement agree, prior to
the closing of the Combination, that electing a method other than the
"traditional" method is mutually beneficial.

 **EXHIBIT H**

 



 

 **REGISTRATION RIGHTS**

 



 

Subject to the terms of any agreement between the General Partner and a
Limited Partner with respect to OP Units held by such Limited Partner that
includes provisions relating to registration rights (each a " ** _Separate
Registration Rights Agreement_** "):

 



 

(a) Shelf Registration of REIT Shares. Following the date on which the General
Partner becomes eligible to use a registration statement on Form S-3 for the
registration of securities under the Securities Act (the " ** _S-3 Eligible
Date_** ") and within the time period that may be agreed by the General
Partner and a Limited Partner, the General Partner shall file with the
Commission a shelf registration statement under Rule 415 of the Securities Act
(a " ** _Registration Statement_** "), or any similar rule that may be adopted
by the Commission, covering (i) the issuance of Shares issuable upon
redemption of the Class A Units held by such Limited Partner (" ** _Redemption
Shares_** ") and/or (ii) the resale by the holder of the Redemption Shares,
with respect to Class A Units issued prior to the S-3 Eligible Date; provided,
however, that the General Partner shall be required to file only two such
registrations in any 12-month period. In connection therewith, the General
Partner will:

 



 

(1) use its reasonable best efforts to have such Registration Statement
declared effective;

 



 

(2) furnish to each holder of Redemption Shares such number of copies of
prospectuses, and supplements or amendments thereto, and such other documents
as such holder reasonably requests;

 



 

(3) register or qualify the Redemption Shares covered by the Registration
Statement under the securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions within
the United States as any holder of Redemption Shares shall reasonably request,
and do such other reasonable acts and things as may be required of it to
enable such holders to consummate the sale or other disposition in such
jurisdictions of the Redemption Shares; provided, however, that the General
Partner shall not be required to (i) qualify as a foreign corporation or
consent to a general or unlimited service or process in any jurisdictions in
which it would not otherwise be required to be qualified or so consent or (ii)
qualify as a dealer in securities; and

 



 

(4) otherwise use its reasonable best efforts to comply with all applicable
rules and regulations of the Commission.

 



 

The General Partner further agrees to supplement or make amendments to each
Registration Statement, if required by the rules, regulations or instructions
applicable to the registration form utilized by the General Partner or by the
Securities Act or rules and regulations thereunder for such Registration
Statement. Each Limited Partner agrees to furnish to the

 



 

Exhibit H-1     
 

 



 

General Partner, upon request, such information with respect to the Limited
Partner as may be required to complete and file the Registration Statement.

 



 

In connection with and as a condition to the General Partners obligations
with respect to the filing of a Registration Statement pursuant to this
Exhibit H, each Limited Partner agrees with the General Partner that:

 



 

(x) it will not offer or sell its Redemption Shares until (A) such Redemption
Shares have been included in a Registration Statement and (B) it has received
copies of a prospectus, and any supplement or amendment thereto, as
contemplated by this Exhibit H, and receives notice that the Registration
Statement covering such Redemption Shares, or any post-effective amendment
thereto, has been declared effective by the Commission;

 



 

(y) if the General Partner determines in its good faith judgment, after
consultation with counsel, that the use of the Registration Statement,
including any post-effective amendment thereto, or the use of any prospectus
contained in such Registration Statement would require the disclosure of
important information that the General Partner has a _bona fide_ business
purpose for preserving as confidential or the disclosure of which would impede
the General Partners ability to consummate a significant transaction, upon
written notice of such determination by the General Partner, the rights of
each Limited Partner to offer, sell or distribute its Redemption Shares
pursuant to such Registration Statement or prospectus or to require the
General Partner to take action with respect to the registration or sale of any
Redemption Shares pursuant to a Registration Statement (including any action
contemplated by this Exhibit H) will be suspended until the date upon which
the General Partner notifies such Limited Partner in writing (which notice
shall be deemed sufficient if given through the issuance of a press release)
that suspension of such rights for the grounds set forth in this paragraph is
no longer necessary; provided, however, that the General Partner may not
suspend such rights for an aggregate period of more than 90 days in any
12-month period; and

 



 

(z) in the case of the registration of any underwritten equity offering
proposed by the General Partner (other than any registration by the General
Partner on Form S-8, or a successor or substantially similar form, of (A) an
employee share option, share purchase or compensation plan or of securities
issued or issuable pursuant to any such plan or (B) a dividend reinvestment
plan), each Limited Partner will agree, if requested in writing by the
managing underwriter or underwriters administering such offering, not to
effect any offer, sale or distribution of any Shares or Redemption Shares (or
any option or right to acquire Shares or Redemption Shares) during the period
commencing on the tenth day prior to the expected effective date (which date
shall be stated in such notice) of the registration statement covering such
underwritten primary equity offering or, if such offering shall be a "take-
down" from an effective shelf registration statement, the tenth day prior to
the expected commencement date (which date shall be stated in such notice) of
such offering, and ending on the date specified by such managing underwriter
in such written request to the Limited Partners; provided, however, that no
Limited Partner shall be required to agree not to effect any offer, sale or
distribution of its Redemption Shares for a period of time that is longer than
the greater of 90 days or the period of time for which any senior executive of
the General Partner is required so to agree in connection

 



 

Exhibit H-2     
 

 



 

with such offering. Nothing in this paragraph shall be read to limit the
ability of any Limited Partner to redeem its Class A Units in accordance with
the terms of the Agreement.

 



 

(b) Listing on Securities Exchange. If the General Partner lists or maintains
the listing of Shares on any securities exchange or national market system, it
shall, at its expense and as necessary to permit the registration and sale of
the Redemption Shares hereunder, list thereon, maintain and, when necessary,
increase such listing to include such Redemption Shares.

 



 

(c) Registration Not Required. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the General
Partner shall not be required to file or maintain the effectiveness of a
registration statement relating to Redemption Shares after the first date upon
which, in the opinion of counsel to the General Partner, all of the Redemption
Shares covered thereby could be sold by the holders thereof pursuant to Rule
144 under the Securities Act, or any successor rule thereto.

 



 

(d) Allocation of Expenses. The Partnership shall pay all expenses in
connection with the Registration Statement, including without limitation (i)
all expenses incident to filing with the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority, Inc., (ii) registration fees, (iii) printing expenses, (iv)
accounting and legal fees and expenses, except to the extent holders of
Redemption Shares elect to engage accountants or attorneys in addition to the
accountants and attorneys engaged by the General Partner or the Partnership,
which fees and expenses for such accountants or attorneys shall be for the
account of the holders of the Redemption Shares, (v) accounting expenses
incident to or required by any such registration or qualification and (vi)
expenses of complying with the securities or blue sky laws of any
jurisdictions in connection with such registration or qualification; provided,
however, neither the Partnership nor the General Partner shall be liable for
(A) any discounts or commissions to any underwriter or broker attributable to
the sale of Redemption Shares, or (B) any fees or expenses incurred by holders
of Redemption Shares in connection with such registration that, according to
the written instructions of any regulatory authority, the Partnership or the
General Partner is not permitted to pay.

 



 

(e) Indemnification.

 



 

(i) In connection with the Registration Statement, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, the General Partner and the Partnership agree to indemnify
holders of Redemption Shares within the meaning of Section 15 of the
Securities Act, against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses
(including reasonable costs of investigation) caused by any untrue, or alleged
untrue, statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement,
preliminary prospectus or prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the
General Partner shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) or
caused by any omission or alleged omission, to state therein a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or
expenses are caused by any untrue statement, alleged untrue statement,
omission, or alleged omission based upon information furnished to the General
Partner by the Limited Partner or the holder of Redemption Shares for use
therein. The General Partner and each officer,

 



 

Exhibit H-3     
 

 



 

director and controlling Person of the General Partner and the Partnership
shall be indemnified by each Limited Partner or holder of Redemption Shares
covered by the Registration Statement for all such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and expenses (including reasonable costs of investigation) caused
by any untrue, or alleged untrue, statement or any omission, or alleged
omission, based upon information furnished to the General Partner or the
Partnership by the Limited Partner or the holder for use therein.

 



 

(ii) Promptly upon receipt by a party indemnified under this subsection of
notice of the commencement of any action against such indemnified party in
respect of which indemnity or reimbursement may be sought against any
indemnifying party under this subsection, such indemnified party shall notify
the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement of such action, but the
failure to so notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it of any
liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this
subsection unless such failure shall materially adversely affect the defense
of such action. In case notice of commencement of any such action shall be
given to the indemnifying party as above provided, the indemnifying party
shall be entitled to participate in and, to the extent it may wish, jointly
with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense of
such action at its own expense, with counsel chosen by it and reasonably
satisfactory to such indemnified party. The indemnified party shall have the
right to employ separate counsel in any such action and participate in the
defense thereof, but the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel (other
than reasonable costs of investigation) shall be paid by the indemnified party
unless (i) the indemnifying party agrees to pay the same, (ii) the
indemnifying party fails to assume the defense of such action with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party or (iii) the named parties to
any such action (including any impleaded parties) have been advised by such
counsel that representation of such indemnified party and the indemnifying
party by the same counsel would be inappropriate under applicable standards of
professional conduct (in which case the indemnified party shall have the right
to separate counsel and the indemnifying party shall pay the reasonable fees
and expenses of such separate counsel, provided, that the indemnifying party
shall not be liable for more than one separate counsel). No indemnifying party
shall be liable to any indemnified party for any settlement entered into
without its consent.

 



 

(f) Contribution.

 



 

(i) If for any reason the indemnification provisions contemplated by
subsection (e) hereof are either unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless
an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities
referred to therein, then the party that would otherwise be required to
provide indemnification or the indemnifying party (in either case, for
purposes of this subsection, the " **Indemnifying Party** ") in respect of
such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, shall contribute to the amount
paid or payable by the party that would otherwise be entitled to
indemnification or the indemnified party (in either

 



 

Exhibit H-4     
 

 



 

case, for purposes of this subsection, the " ** _Indemnified Party_** ") as a
result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expense, in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party, as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations. The relative fault of the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified
Party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the
untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged
omission to state a material fact related to information supplied by the
Indemnifying Party or Indemnified Party, and the parties relative intent,
knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such
statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of
the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall
be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred
by such party.

 



 

(ii) The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contribution pursuant to this subsection were determined by pro rata
allocation (even if the holders were treated as one entity for such purpose)
or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the
equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph.
No Person determined to have committed a fraudulent misrepresentation (within
the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation.

 



 

(iii) The contribution provided for in this Section 8.05(f) shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect
regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Indemnified Party.

 



 

(g) Conflict. With respect to any Limited Partner, in the event of a conflict
between the provisions of this Exhibit H and any Separate Registration Rights
Agreement, the provisions of the Separate Registration Rights Agreement shall
control.

 ** _FIRPTA CERTIFICATE_**

 



 

Section 1445 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_
"), provides that a transferee of a "U.S. real property interest" (as that
term is defined in Section 897(c)(1) of the Code and Section 1.897-1(c) of the
Treasury Regulations) must withhold tax if the transferor is a foreign person.
For U.S. federal income tax purposes (including Section 1445 of the Code), the
owner of a disregarded entity (which has legal title to a U.S. real property
interest under local law) will be the transferor of the property and not the
disregarded entity. To confirm that withholding of tax is not required upon
the disposition of a U.S. real property interest by Transferor, the
undersigned hereby certifies the following on behalf of Transferor or, if
Transferor is an individual, on behalf of himself/herself:

 



 

1. Transferor is not a foreign corporation, foreign partnership, foreign trust, foreign estate, or a nonresident alien individual (as those terms are defined in the Code and Treasury Regulations);

 



 

2. Transferor is not a disregarded entity as defined in Section 1.1445-2(b)(2)(iii) of the Treasury Regulations;

 



 

3. Transferors U.S. employer identification number or, if Transferor is an individual, Transferors social security number is ; and

 



 

4. Transferors office address or, if Transferor is an individual, Transferors home address is .

 



 

Transferor understands that this certification may be disclosed to the
Internal Revenue Service and that any false statement contained herein could
be punished by fine, imprisonment, or both.

 



 

[ _Signature page follows._]

      
 

 



 

Under penalties of perjury I declare that I have examined this certification
and to the best of my knowledge and belief it is true, correct, and complete,
and, if Transferor is not an individual, I further declare that I have
authority to sign this document on behalf of Transferor.

1. It is the ground lessor under that certain ground lease dated , (together with all amendments, modifications and supplements thereto, collectively, the " _Lease_ "), between the undersigned (or its predecessor-in-interest), as lessor (" _Lessor_ ") and Lessee (or its predecessor-in-interest), as ground lessee covering property located at , (the " _Premises_ ").

8. Lessor is the record and beneficial owner of the Premises, and the Lease is not subordinate, and has not been subordinated by Lessor, to any mortgage, lien or other encumbrance. Lessor has not assigned, conveyed, transferred, sold, encumbered or mortgaged its interest in the Lease or the Premises, and there are no mortgages, deeds of trust or other security interests encumbering the Lessors fee interest in the Premises.

 



 

9. No third party has any option or preferential right to purchase all or any part of the Premises from Lessor.

 



 

10. Lessor has not received written notice of any pending eminent domain proceedings or other governmental actions or any judicial actions of any kind against Lessors interest in the Premises.

FINAL FORM

 

 ** **

 

 **OWNERSHIP LIMIT WAIVER AGREEMENT**

 



 

THIS OWNERSHIP LIMIT WAIVER AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of [
], 2016, is between New York REIT, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the "
_Company_ "), and [ ] (the " _Investor_ "). Capitalized terms
used but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the
Articles of Amendment and Restatement for the Company, as filed with the
Maryland State Department of Assessments and Taxation, as amended and restated
through the date hereof and as presently in effect (the " _Charter_ ").

 



 

 ** _RECITALS_**

 



 

WHEREAS, Section 5.7 of the Companys Articles of Amendment and Restatement,
as amended (the " _Charter_ ") contains restrictions regarding an Aggregate
Share Ownership Limit, which prohibits any Person from Beneficially Owning or
Constructively Owning more than 9.8% in value of the aggregate of the
outstanding Shares and not more than 9.8% (in value or in number of shares,
whichever is more restrictive) of any class or series of Shares, except as
otherwise waived by the Company. These restrictions are designed to ensure the
Companys continued qualification as a real estate investment trust under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ").

 



 

WHEREAS, Investor has acquired Beneficial Ownership or Constructive Ownership
of Shares in excess of the Aggregate Share Ownership Limit (the first such
date such Beneficial Ownership or Constructive Ownership exceeded the
Aggregate Share Ownership Limit, the " _Acquisition Date_ ") and has requested
a waiver of the Aggregate Share Ownership Limit to be effective as of the
Acquisition Date.

 



 

WHEREAS, Pursuant to Section 5.7(ii)(g)(I) of the Charter, the Company has
adopted resolutions approving the Investors exemption from the Aggregate
Share Ownership Limit on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties, intending to be legally bound, in reliance on the
representations set forth in the Certificate (as defined below), hereby agree
as follow:

 



 

 ** _AGREEMENT_**

 



 

1\. WAIVER OF OWNERSHIP LIMITS

 



 

1.1 The Company hereby waives the application of the Aggregate Share Ownership
Limit contained in Section 5.7(ii)(a)(I)(A) of the Charter to Investor and
permits Investor to Beneficially Own and Constructively Own up to an aggregate
of [ ]% of the Shares of the Company (collectively, the " _Exempt Stock_ "
and the " _Exempted Holder Limit_ ") from and after the Acquisition Date.

 



 

1.2 The waiver and Exempted Holder Limit granted by this _Section 1_ is
granted solely to the Investor and relates solely to the Exempt Stock
Beneficially Owned and Constructively Owned by Investor. Any Transfer of the
Exempt Stock held by the Investor shall

 



      
 

 



 

cause any such Shares to no longer be subject to this Limited Waiver and any
such Shares shall be subject to the Aggregate Share Ownership Limit as of the
date of such Transfer.

 



 

1.3 The waiver and Exempted Holder Limit granted by this _Section 1_ ("
_Ownership Limit Waiver_ ") only grants Investor the right to Beneficially Own
and Constructively Own Shares up to the Exempted Holder Limit. The Investor
shall not directly or indirectly acquire Shares in excess of the Exempted
Holder Limit.

 



 

1.4 The Shares Beneficially Owned or Constructively Owned by the Investor
remain subject to the restrictions and limitations set forth in Sections
5.7(ii)(a)(I)(B) and 5.7(ii)(a)(I)(C) of the Charter.

 



 

1.5 The Ownership Limit Waiver, with the exception of the waiver discussed in
_Section 1.1_, does not waive any of the other restrictions or limitations
set forth in Section 5.7 of the Charter as they apply to the Shares
Beneficially Owned and Constructively Owned by Investor.

 



 

2\. LIMITATIONS AND OTHER MATTERS

 



 

2.1 In no event shall the Ownership Limit Waiver permit any Individuals
Beneficial Ownership of the Shares of the Company to exceed, at any time, the
Aggregate Share Ownership Limit of Section 5.7 of the Charter, determined
without regard to the Ownership Limit Waiver. For the purpose of this
Agreement, "Individual" has the meaning provided in Section 542(a)(2) of the
Code, as modified by Section 856(h)(3) of the Code.

 



 

2.2 For the Ownership Limit Waiver to be effective, Investor must execute a
counterpart signature page to this Agreement and complete and make the
representations and covenants set forth in the Certificate of Representations
and Covenants, the form of which is attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the "
_Certificate_ "), and must deliver such Certificate to the Company. Except as
otherwise determined by the Company, the Ownership Limit Waiver shall cease to
be effective upon any breach of the representations or covenants set forth
herein or in the Certificate. In addition, if the Ownership Limit Waiver
ceases to be effective as a result of the operation of the preceding sentence,
the Shares of the Company that would otherwise be in excess of the Aggregate
Share Ownership Limit shall be deemed to have been transferred to a Trust in
accordance with 5.7(ii)(a)(II) of the Charter.

 



 

2.3 Investor shall deliver to the Company, at such times as may reasonably be
requested by the Company (it being acknowledged that the Company may
reasonably make such request on at least a calendar quarterly basis), a
certificate signed by an authorized officer of Investor to the effect that
Investor has complied and expects to continue to comply with its
representations and covenants set forth in this Agreement and the Certificate.
If so requested by the Company, Investor will cooperate with the Company in
investigating any direct or indirect relationship that Investor and any Person
whose ownership of Shares of the Company would be attributed to Investor under
Section 318(a) of the Code (as modified by Section 856(d)(5) of the Code), may
have with the Companys tenants or "independent contractors" (within the
meaning of Section 856(d)(3) of the Code) for purposes of determining
compliance with the provisions of this Agreement and in updating the
Certificate accordingly.

 



 

2.4 This Ownership Limit Waiver shall automatically be deemed to have been
revoked (prospectively or, as necessary in order to protect the Companys
qualification as a real estate investment trust under the Code, retroactively)
without any further action if (a) any

 



      
 

 



 

representation or warranty contained in the Certificate is or becomes

Qualified Guarantees of Qualified Guarantee Indebtedness.

 



 

2.2 _Qualified Guarantee Indebtedness and Qualified Guarantee; Treatment of
Qualified Guarantee Indebtedness as Guaranteed Debt_. In order for an
opportunity to guarantee indebtedness made available by the Partnership of to
satisfy the requirements of this Article II, (1) the indebtedness to be
guaranteed must satisfy all of the conditions set forth in this Section 2.2
(indebtedness satisfying all such conditions is referred to as " _Qualified
Guarantee Indebtedness_ "); (2) the guarantee by the Partner Guarantors must
be pursuant to a Guarantee Agreement substantially in the form attached hereto
as _Schedule 2.7_ or containing substantially similar terms and conditions if
the lender of the indebtedness to be guaranteed requires use of its form
guarantee agreement that satisfies the conditions set forth in Sections 2.2(i)
and (iii) (a " _Qualified Guarantee_ "); (3) the amount of indebtedness made
available to be guaranteed by the Partner Guarantor, if pursuant to Section
2.4, must not exceed the portion of the Guaranteed Amount for which a
replacement guarantee is made available; and (4) the indebtedness to be
guaranteed must be considered indebtedness of the Partnership for purposes of
determining the adjusted tax basis of the partners in the Partnership in their
Units. If, and to the extent that, a Partner Guarantor elects to guarantee
Qualified Guarantee Indebtedness made available by the Partnership in
accordance with this Article II, such indebtedness thereafter shall be
considered a Guaranteed Debt and shall be subject to all of this Article II.
The conditions that must be satisfied at all times with respect to any
Guaranteed Debt made available pursuant to this Article II hereof and the
guarantees with respect thereto are as follows:

 



 

(i) each such guarantee by a Partner Guarantor shall be a "bottom dollar
guarantee" in that the lender for the Guaranteed Debt is required to pursue
all other collateral and security for the Guaranteed Debt (other than any
"bottom dollar guarantees" permitted pursuant to this clause (i) and/or
Section 2.3 below) prior to seeking to

 



      
 

 



 

collect on such a guarantee, and the lender shall have recourse against the
guarantee only if, and solely to the extent that, the total amount recovered
by the lender with respect to the Guaranteed Debt after the lender has
exhausted its remedies as set forth above is less than the aggregate of the
Guaranteed Amounts with respect to such Guaranteed Debt (plus the aggregate
amounts of any other guarantees (x) that are in effect with respect to such
Guaranteed Debt at the time the guarantees pursuant to this Article II are
entered into, or (y) that are entered into after the date the guarantees
pursuant to this Article II are entered into with respect to such Guaranteed
Debt and that comply with Section 2.5 below, but only to the extent that, in
either case, such guarantees are "bottom dollar guarantees" with respect to
the Guaranteed Debt), and the maximum aggregate liability of each Partner
Guarantor for all Guaranteed Debt shall be limited to the amount actually
guaranteed by such Partner Guarantor;

 



 

(ii) the fair market value of the collateral against which the lender has
recourse pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Guaranteed Debt,
determined as of the time the guarantee is entered into by the Partner
Guarantor (an independent appraisal relied upon by the lender in making the
loan shall be conclusive evidence of such fair market value when the guarantee
is being entered into in connection with the closing of such loan), shall not
be less than 150% of the sum of (x) the aggregate of the Guaranteed Amounts
with respect to such Guaranteed Debt, plus (y) the dollar amount of any other
indebtedness that is senior to or pari passu with the Guaranteed Debt and as
to which the lender thereunder has recourse against property that is
collateral of the Guaranteed Debt, plus (z) the aggregate amounts of any other
guarantees that are in effect with respect to such Guaranteed Debt at the time
the guarantees pursuant to this Article II are entered into with respect to
such Guaranteed Debt and that comply with Section 2.2(v) below, but only to
the extent that such guarantees are "bottom dollar guarantees" with respect to
the Guaranteed Debt);

 



 

(iii) (A) the executed guarantee must be delivered to the lender; (B) the
execution of the guarantee by the Partner Guarantors must be acknowledged by
the lender; and (C) the guarantee otherwise must be enforceable under the laws
of the state governing the loan and in which the property securing the loan is
located or in which the lender has a significant place of business (with any
bona fide branch or office of the lender through which the loan is made,
negotiated, or administered being deemed a "significant place of business" for
the purposes hereof);

 



 

(iv) as to each Partner Guarantor that is executing a guarantee pursuant to
this Agreement, there must be no other Person that would be considered to
"bear the economic risk of loss," within the meaning of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.752-2, or would be considered to be "at risk" for purposes of
Section 465(b) of the Code with respect to that portion of such debt for which
such Partner Guarantor is being made liable for purposes of satisfying the
Partnerships obligations to such Partner Guarantor under this Article II;

 



      
 

 



 

(v) the aggregate Guaranteed Amounts with respect to the Guaranteed Debt will
not exceed 50% of the amount of the Guaranteed Debt outstanding at the time
the guarantee is executed. Except for guarantees already in place at the time
a guarantee opportunity is presented to the Protected Partners, if any, at no
time can there be guarantees with respect to the Guaranteed Debt that are
provided by other persons that are "pari passu" with or at a lower level of
risk than the guarantees provided by the Protected Partners. If there are
guarantees already in place at the time a guarantee opportunity is presented
to the Protected Partners that are "pari passu" with or at a lower level of
risk than the guarantees provided by the Protected Partners, then the amount
of Guaranteed Debt subject to such existing guarantees shall be added to the
Guaranteed Amount for purposes of calculating the 50% limitation set forth in
this Section 2.2(v); and

 



 

(vi) the obligor with respect to the Guaranteed Debt is the Partnership or a
non-corporate entity (A) which is and will continue to be under the legal
control of the Partnership (which shall include a partnership or limited
liability company in which the Partnership or a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Partnership is the sole managing general partner or sole managing member, as
applicable), and (B) in which the equity interest of the Partnership in both
capital and profits is not less than 50%.

 



 

The Partnership shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of Sections
2.2(i), (ii) and (v) above if, in lieu of making available the opportunity to
enter into a "bottom dollar guarantee" of indebtedness secured by specific
properties, it makes available to the Protected Partner an opportunity to
enter into a "bottom dollar guarantee" (or an indemnity on comparable terms of
an existing guarantor) of a general senior unsecured obligation of the
Partnership which (A) is recourse, without limitation, to all of the assets of
the Partnership, (B) is made by a third party institutional lender with
financial covenants that are standard for such a loan, (C) is not in default
and (D) either (i) qualifies as a Nonrecourse Liability of the Partnership, or
(ii) is a liability that is treated as a "recourse" liability under the
applicable Treasury Regulations solely because the general partner of the
Partnership has liability therefor, either by reason of its status as "general
partner" or due to an express guarantee entered into by the general partner;
_provided, however, that_ the "bottom guarantee" shall include an
indemnification of the general partner with respect thereto sufficient to
cause the Protected Partner to be considered to "bear the economic risk of
loss," within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.752-2, with respect
to the amount provided for in such "bottom guarantee" without increasing the
financial exposure of the Protected Partner above the level that would have
resulted had such liability been a Nonrecourse Liability.

 



 

2.3 _Covenant With Respect to Guaranteed Debt Collateral_. The Partnership
covenants with the Partner Guarantors with respect to the Guaranteed Debt that
(A) it will comply with the requirements set forth in clause (ii) of this
Section 2.3 upon any disposition of any collateral for a Guaranteed Debt,
whether during or following the Tax Protection Period, and (B) it will not at
any time, whether during or following the Tax Protection Period, pledge the
collateral with respect to a Guaranteed Debt to secure any other indebtedness
(unless such other indebtedness is, by its terms, subordinate in all respects
to the Guaranteed Debt for which such collateral is security) or otherwise
voluntarily dispose of or reduce the amount of such collateral

 



      
 

 



 

unless either (i) after giving effect thereto the conditions in Section 2.2
would continue to be satisfied with respect to the Guaranteed Debt and the
Guaranteed Debt otherwise would continue to be Qualified Guarantee
Indebtedness, or (ii) the Partnership (A) obtains from the lender with respect
to the original Guaranteed Debt a full and complete release of any Partner
Guarantor unless the Partner Guarantor expressly requests that it not be
released, and (B) if the Tax Protection Period has not expired, makes
available to each Partner Guarantor with respect to such original Guaranteed
Debt, not less than 30 days prior to such pledge or disposition, the
opportunity to enter into a Qualified Guarantee of other Partnership
indebtedness that constitutes Qualified Guarantee Indebtedness (with such
replacement indebtedness thereafter being considered a Guaranteed Debt and
subject to this Article II) in an amount equal to the amount of such original
Guaranteed Debt that was guaranteed by such Partner Guarantor.

 



 

2.4 _Repayment or Refinancing of Guaranteed Debt_. The Partnership shall not,
at any time during the Tax Protection Period, repay or refinance all or any
portion of any Guaranteed Debt unless (i) after taking into account such
repayment, each Partner Guarantor would be entitled, pursuant to Section 752
of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, to include in its tax
basis for its Units an amount of Partnership liabilities at least equal to its
Minimum Liability Amount, or (ii) alternatively, the Partnership, not less
than 30 days prior to such repayment or refinancing, makes available to the
applicable Partner Guarantors the opportunity to enter into a Qualified
Guarantee with respect to other Qualified Guarantee Indebtedness in an amount
sufficient so that, taking into account such guarantees of such other
Qualified Guarantee Indebtedness, each Partner Guarantor who guarantees such
other Qualified Guarantee Indebtedness in the amount specified by the
Partnership would be entitled to include in its adjusted tax basis for its
Units an amount of Partnership liabilities at least equal to the Minimum
Liability Amount for such Partner Guarantor.

 



 

2.5 _Limitation on Additional Guarantees With Respect to Debt Secured by
Collateral for Guaranteed Debt_. The Partnership shall not make available to
any person or entity other than a Protected Partner the opportunity to
guarantee any Guaranteed Debt or other debt that is secured, directly or
indirectly, by any collateral for Guaranteed Debt unless (i) such debt by its
terms is subordinate in all respects to the Guaranteed Debt or, if such other
guarantees are of the Guaranteed Debt itself, such guarantees by their terms
must be paid in full before the lender can have recourse to the Partner
Guarantors (i.e., the first dollar amount of recovery by the applicable
lenders must be applied to the Guaranteed Amount); _provided that_ the
foregoing shall not apply with respect to additional guarantees of Guaranteed
Debt so long as the conditions set forth in Sections 2.2(ii) and (v) would be
satisfied immediately after the implementation of such additional guarantee
(determined in the case of Section 2.2(ii), based upon the fair market value
of the collateral for such Guaranteed Debt at the time the additional
guarantee is entered into and adding the amount of such additional
guarantee(s) to the sum of the applicable Guaranteed Amounts plus any other
preexisting "bottom dollar guarantee" previously permitted pursuant to this
Section 2.5 or Sections 2.2(i) and (ii) above, for purposes of making the
computation provided for in Section 2.2(ii)), and (ii) such other guarantees
do not have the effect of reducing the amount of the Guaranteed Debt that is
includible by any Partner Guarantor in its adjusted tax basis for its Units
pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.752-2.

 



 

2.6 _Process_. Whenever the Partnership is required under this Article II to
make available to one or more of the Partner Guarantors an opportunity to
guarantee Qualified

 



      
 

 



 

Guarantee Indebtedness, the Partnership shall be considered to have satisfied
its obligation under this Article II if the other conditions in this Article
II are satisfied and, not less than thirty (30) days prior to the date that
such guarantee would be required to be executed in order to satisfy this
Article II, the Partnership sends by first class mail, return receipt
requested, to the last known address of each such Partner Guarantor (as
reflected in the records of the Partnership) (i) the Qualified Guarantee to be
executed (which shall be substantially in the form of _Schedule 2.7_ hereto,
with such changes thereto as are necessary to reflect the relevant facts) and
(ii) a brief letter setting forth the relevant circumstances (including, as
applicable, that the availability is being made pursuant to this Article II,
the circumstances giving rise to making the guarantee opportunity available, a
brief summary of the terms of the Qualified Guarantee Indebtedness to be
guaranteed), a brief description of the collateral for the Qualified Guarantee
Indebtedness, a statement of the amount to be guaranteed, the address to which
the executed Qualified Guarantee must be sent and the date by which it must be
received, and a statement to the effect that, if the Protected Partner fails
to execute and return such Qualified Guarantee within the time period
specified, the Partner Guarantor thereafter would lose its rights under this
Article II with respect to the amount of debt that the Partnership is required
to make available to be guaranteed, and depending upon the Partner Guarantors
circumstances and other circumstances related to the Partnership, the Partner
Guarantor could be required to recognize taxable gain as a result thereof,
either currently or prior to the expiration of the Tax Protection Period, that
otherwise could have been deferred. If a notice is properly sent in accordance
with this Section 2.6, the Partnership shall have no responsibility as a
result of the failure of a Partner Guarantor either to receive such notice or
to respond thereto within the specified time period.

 



 

2.7 _Presumption as to Schedule 2.7_. A guarantee in the form of the
Guarantee Agreement attached hereto as _Schedule 2.7_ that is (A) properly
executed by the Partner Guarantor and the lender and (B) delivered to the
lender shall be conclusively presumed to satisfy the conditions set forth in
Section 2.2(i) and Section 2.2(iii) and to have caused the Guaranteed Debt to
be considered allocable to the Guarantor Partner who enters into such
Guarantee Agreement pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.752-2 and
Section 465 of the Code so long as all of the following conditions are met
with respect such Guaranteed Debt:

 



 

(i) there are no other guarantees in effect with respect to such Guaranteed
Debt (other than the guarantees contemporaneously being entered into by the
Partner Guarantors pursuant to this Article II or that are otherwise permitted
pursuant to Section 2.2(i) and (v));

 



 

(ii) the collateral securing such Guaranteed Debt is not, and shall not
thereafter become, collateral for any other indebtedness that is senior to or
pari passu with such Guaranteed Debt;

 



 

(iii) no additional guarantees with respect to such Guaranteed Debt will be
entered into during the applicable Tax Protection Period pursuant to the
_proviso_ set forth in Section 2.5;

 



 

(iv) the lender with respect to such Guaranteed Debt is not the Partnership,
any Subsidiary or other entity in which the Partnership owns a direct or
indirect interest, the REIT, any other partner in the Partnership, or any
person related to

 



      
 

 



 

any partner in the Partnership as determined for purposes of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.752-2 or any person that would be considered a "related
party" as determined for purposes of Section 465 of the Code; and

 



 

(v) none of the REIT, nor any other partner in the Partnership, nor any person
related to any partner in the Partnership as determined for purposes of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.752-2 shall have provided, or shall thereafter
provide, collateral for, or otherwise shall have entered into, or shall
thereafter enter into, a relationship that would cause such person or entity
to be considered to bear the "economic risk of loss" with respect to such
Guaranteed Debt, as determined for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section
1.752-2, or that would cause such person or entity to be considered "at risk"
with respect to such Guaranteed Debt, as determined for purposes of Section
465 of the Code.

 



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to Section 7.2, if, due to a change
in tax law after the date hereof, either the Partnership determines or a
Protected Partner is advised by counsel, that there is a material risk that
such Protected Partner may no longer continue to be allocated such Protected
Partners Guaranteed Amount of a Guaranteed Debt, such Protected Partner may
request a modification of such Guarantee Agreement and the Partnership will
use its commercially reasonable efforts to work with the lender with respect
to such Guaranteed Debt to have the Guarantee Agreement amended in a manner
that will permit such Protected Partner to be allocated such Protected
Partners Guaranteed Amount with respect to the Guaranteed Debt so that the
amount of Partnership liabilities allocated to such Protected Partner shall
not decrease as a result of the change in law; _provided that_ no amendment of
such Guarantee Agreement shall be permitted if at the time of such amendment
request the Protected Partner would be required to make a payment under such
Guarantee Agreement pursuant to the terms of such Guarantee Agreement if the
Protected Partners obligations under such Guarantee Agreement were enforced.
For the avoidance of doubt, each Protected Partner hereby acknowledges and
agrees that the Partnership shall not be treated as violating this Article II
to the extent that, after such a change of tax law, the allocation of
Partnership indebtedness for tax purposes to the Protected Partner cannot be
achieved due to the unwillingness of such Protected Partner to provide a
guarantee or similar instrument that complies with the new tax law rules
(where both such guarantee or similar instrument and the indebtedness being
guaranteed is otherwise consistent to the maximum extent permitted by such new
tax rules with the provisions of this Article II). Any cost and expenses
incurred as a result of such a change in tax law shall be borne equally by the
Partnership on the one hand and the relevant Protected Partner on the other
hand.

 



 

2.8 _Additional Guarantee Opportunities_. Without limiting any of the other
obligations of the Partnership under this Agreement, from and after the
expiration of the Tax Protection Period, the Partnership shall, upon a request
from a Protected Partner, use commercially reasonable efforts to permit such
Protected Partner to bear financial liability under a Guarantee Agreement
substantially in the form of _Schedule 2.7_ hereto for indebtedness that
would be considered Qualifying Guarantee Indebtedness under Section 2.2
hereof, if such Protected Partner shall provide information from its
professional tax advisor satisfactory to the Partnership showing that, in the
absence of such agreement, such Protected Partner likely would not be
allocated from the Partnership sufficient indebtedness under Section 752 of
the Code and the at-risk provisions under Section 465 of the Code to avoid the
recognition of gain (other than

 



      
 

 



 

gain required to be recognized by reason of actual cash distributions from the
Partnership). The Partnership and its professional tax advisors shall
cooperate in good faith with such Protected Partner and its professional tax
advisors to provide such information regarding the allocation of the
Partnership liabilities and the nature of such liabilities as is reasonably
necessary in order to determine the Protected Partners adjusted tax basis in
its Units and at-risk amount. If the Partnership permits a Protected Partner
to enter into an agreement under this Section 2.8, the Partnership shall be
under no further obligation with respect thereto, and the Partnership shall
not be required to indemnify such Protected Partner for any damage incurred,
in connection with or as a result of such agreement or the indebtedness,
including without limitation a refinancing or prepayment thereof or taking any
of the other actions required by Article II hereof with respect to Qualified
Indebtedness. This Section 2.8 shall not obligate the Partnership to incur
additional indebtedness.

 



 

 **ARTICLE III**

 

 **REMEDIES**

 



 

3.1 _Remedies_. In the event that the Partnership breaches its obligations set
forth in Article II with respect to a Protected Partner resulting in such
Protected Partner recognizing all or any portion of the Protected Amount for
federal income tax purposes, the Protected Partners sole right shall be to
receive from the Partnership, and the Partnership shall pay, without
duplication, to such Protected Partner as damages, an amount equal to the
aggregate federal, state and local income taxes (including any applicable
federal unearned income Medicare contribution under Section 1411 of the Code)
incurred by the Protected Partner as a result of the Protected Amount
allocated to, or otherwise recognized by, such Protected Partner by reason of
such breach, _plus_ an additional amount equal to the aggregate federal,
state, and local income taxes (including any applicable federal unearned
income Medicare contribution under Section 1411 of the Code) payable by the
Protected Partner as a result of the receipt of any payment required under
this Section 3.1 (including any tax liability incurred as a result of such
Protected Partners receipt of such indemnity payment).

 



 

For purposes of computing the amount of federal, state, and local income taxes
required to be paid by a Protected Partner, (i) any deduction for state income
taxes payable as a result thereof actually allowed in computing federal income
taxes shall be taken into account, and (ii) a Protected Partners tax
liability shall be computed using the highest federal, state and local
marginal income tax rates that would be applicable to such Protected Partners
taxable income [assuming such Protected Partner were a resident of [ ]]
(taking into account the character and type of such income or gain) for the
year with respect to which the taxes must be paid, without regard to any
deductions, losses or credits that may be available to such Protected Partner
that would reduce or offset its actual taxable income or actual tax liability
if such deductions, losses or credits could be utilized by the Protected
Partner to offset other income, gain or taxes of the Protected Partner, either
in the current year, in earlier years, or in later years.

 



 

For the avoidance of doubt, if, prior to the expiration of the Tax Protection
Period, a Protected Partner were to die, then for purposes of calculating any
amounts payable pursuant to this Article III, any tax basis step-up that
occurs due to such Protected Partners death shall be taken into account.

 



       
 

 



 

3.2 _Process for Determining Payments Required Under this Article III_. If
the Partnership or a Subsidiary breached or violated any of the covenants set
forth in Article II (or a Protected Partner asserts that the Partnership or a
Subsidiary breached or violated any of the covenants set forth in Article II),
the Partnership and the Protected Partner agree to negotiate in good faith to
resolve any disagreements regarding any such transaction, breach or violation
and the amount of payments or damages, if any, payable to such Protected
Partner under Section 3.1 (and to the extent applicable, Section 3.4). If any
such disagreement cannot be resolved by the Partnership and such Protected
Partner within, as applicable, sixty (60) days after the receipt of notice
from the Partnership of such transaction or breach pursuant to Section 3.3 and
the amount of income to be recognized by reason thereof, (ii) 60 days after
the receipt of a notice from the Protected Partner that the Partnership or a
Subsidiary breached its obligations under this Agreement, which notice shall
set forth the amount of income asserted to be recognized by the Protected
Partner and the payment required to be made to such Protected Partner under
Section 3.1 as a result of the transaction or breach, (iii) 10 days following
the date that the Partnership notifies the Protected Partner of its intention
to settle, compromise and/or concede any Tax Claim or Proceeding pursuant to
Section 6.2, or (iv) 10 days following any final determination of any Tax
Claim or Proceeding, the Partnership and the Protected Partner shall jointly
retain a nationally recognized independent "Big Four" public accounting firm
or such other accounting firm as agreed to by the Partnership and the
Protected Partner (an "Accounting Firm") to act as an arbitrator to resolve as
expeditiously as possible all points of any such disagreement (including,
without limitation, whether a breach of any of the covenants set forth Article
II has occurred and, if so, the amount of payment or damages to which the
Protected Partner is entitled as a result thereof, determined as set forth in
Section 3.1 (and to the extent applicable, Section 3.4). All determinations
made by the Accounting Firm with respect to any resolution of any breach or
violation of any of the covenants set forth in Article II and the amount of
payments or damages payable to the Protected Partner under Section 3.1 (and to
the extent applicable, Section 3.4) shall be final, conclusive and binding on
the Partnership and the Protected Partner. The fees and expenses of any
Accounting Firm incurred in connection with any such determination shall be
shared equally by the Partnership and the Protected Partner, _provided that_
if the amount determined by the Accounting Firm to be owed by the Partnership
to the Protected Partner is more than five percent (5%) higher than the amount
proposed by the Partnership to be owed to such Protected Partner prior to the
submission of the matter to the Accounting Firm, then all of the fees and
expenses of any Accounting Firm incurred in connection with any such
determination shall be paid by the Partnership and if the amount determined by
the Accounting Firm to be owed by the Partnership to the Protected Partner is
less than 95% of the amount than the amount proposed by the Partnership to be
owed to such Protected Partner prior to the submission of the matter to the
Accounting Firm, then all of the fees and expenses of any Accounting Firm
incurred in connection with any such determination shall be paid by the
Protected Partner.

 



 

In the case of any Tax Claim or Tax Proceeding that is resolved pursuant to a
final determination or that is settled, compromised and/or conceded pursuant
to Section 6.2, the amount of taxes due to the Internal Revenue Service (the "
_IRS_ ") or any other taxing authority shall, to the extent that such taxes
relate to matters covered in this Agreement, be presumed to be an amount
payable pursuant to this Agreement, and the amount payable pursuant to this
Agreement shall be increased by any interest and penalties required to be paid
by the Protected

 



      
 

 



 

Partner with respect to such taxes (other than interest and penalties
resulting from a failure of the Protected Partner to timely and properly file
any tax return or to timely pay any tax, unless such failure resulted solely
from the Protected Partner reporting and paying its taxes in a manner
consistent with the Partnership) so that the amount of the payment under
Section 3.1 shall not be less than the amount required to be paid to the IRS
or any other taxing authority with respect to matters covered in this
Agreement.

 



 

3.3 _Required Notices; Time for Payment_. In the event that there has been a
breach of Article II, the Partnership shall provide to the Protected Partner
notice of the transaction or event giving rise to such breach not later than
at such time as the Partnership provides to the Protected Partners the
Schedules K-1 to the Partnerships federal income tax return as required in
accordance with Section 6.4 below. All payments required under this Article
III to any Protected Partner shall be made to such Protected Partner on or
before April 15 of the year following the year in which the gain recognition
event giving rise to such payment took place; _provided that_ , if the
Protected Partner is required to make estimated tax payments that would
include such gain, the Partnership shall make a payment to the Protected
Partner on or before the due date for such estimated tax payment and such
payment from the partnership shall be in an amount that corresponds to the
amount of the estimated tax being paid by such Protected Partner at such time.
In the event of a payment required after the date required pursuant to this
Section 3.3, interest shall accrue on the aggregate amount required to be paid
from such date to the date of actual payment at a rate equal to the "prime
rate" of interest, as published in the Wall Street Journal (or if no longer
published there, as announced by Citibank) effective as of the date the
payment is required to be made.

 



 

3.4 _Additional Damages for Breaches of Section 2.2 and/or Section 2.3(i) or
(ii)._ Notwithstanding any of the foregoing in this Article III, in the event
that the Partnership should breach any of its covenants set forth in Section
2.2 and/or Sections 2.3(i) and/or (ii) and a Protected Partner is required to
make a payment in respect of such indebtedness that it would not have had to
make if such breach had not occurred (an " _Excess Payment_ "), then, in
addition to the damages provided for in the other Sections of this Article
III, the Partnership shall pay to such Protected Partner an amount equal to
the sum of (i) the Excess Payment plus (ii) the aggregate federal, state and
local income taxes, if any, computed as set forth in Section 3.1, required to
be paid by such Protected Partner by reason of this Section 3.4 becoming
operative (for example, because the breach by the Partnership and this Section
3.4 caused all or any portion of the indebtedness in question no longer to be
considered debt includible in tax basis by the affected Protected Partner
pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.752-2(a)), plus (iii) an amount
equal to the aggregate federal, state and local income taxes required to be
paid by the Protected Partner (computed as set forth in Section 3.1) as a
result of any payment required under this Section 3.4.

 



 

 **ARTICLE IV**

 

 **INTENTIONALLY OMITTED**

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE V**

 

 **ALLOCATIONS OF LIABILITIES PURSUANT TO TREASURY REGULATIONS UNDER SECTION
752**

 



 

5.1 _Allocation Methods to be Followed_. Subject to Section 5.2, all tax
returns prepared by the Partnership with respect to the Tax Protection Period
that allocate liabilities of the Partnership for purposes of Section 752 and
the Treasury Regulations thereunder shall treat each Partner Guarantor as
being allocated for federal income tax purposes an amount of recourse debt (in
addition to any nonrecourse debt otherwise allocable to such Partner Guarantor
in accordance with the Partnership Agreement and Treasury Regulation Section
1.752-3 and any other recourse liabilities allocable to such Partner Guarantor
by reason of guarantees of indebtedness pursuant to other agreements with the
Partnership) pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.752-2 equal to such
Partner Guarantors Minimum Liability Amount, as set forth on _Schedule 2.1_
hereto and as may be reduced pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and the
Partnership and the REIT shall not, during or with respect to the Tax
Protection Period, take any contrary or inconsistent position in any federal
or state income tax returns (including, without limitation, information
returns, such as Schedules K-1 to IRS Form 1065, provided to partners in the
Partnership and returns of Subsidiaries of the Partnership) or any dealings
involving the IRS (including, without limitation, any audit, administrative
appeal or any judicial proceeding involving the income tax returns of the
Partnership or the tax treatment of any holder of partnership interests the
Partnership).

 



 

5.2 _Exception to Required Allocation Method_. Notwithstanding the provisions
of this Agreement, the Partnership shall not be required to make allocations
of Guaranteed Debt or other recourse debt of the Partnership to the Protected
Partners as set forth in this Agreement if and to the extent that the
Partnership determines in good faith, based upon the advice of counsel
recognized as expert in such matters or a nationally recognized public
accounting firm, that there is not "substantial authority" (within the meaning
of Section 6662(d)(2)(B)(i) of the Code) for such allocations or that there
has been a judicial determination in a proceeding to which the Partnership is
a party and as to which the Protected Partners have been allowed to
participate as and to the extent contemplated in Article VI to the effect that
such allocations are not correct. In no event shall this Section 5.2 be
construed to relieve the Partnership from any liability arising from a failure
by the Partnership to comply with one or more of the provisions of Article II
of this Agreement.

 



 

5.3 _Cooperation in the Event of a Required Change_. If a change in the
Partnerships allocations of Guaranteed Debt or other recourse debt of the
Partnership to the Protected Partners is required by reason of circumstances
described in Section 5.2, the Partnership and its professional tax advisors
shall cooperate in good faith with each Protected Partner (or in the event of
his or her death or disability, his or her executor, guardian or custodian, as
applicable) and his or her professional tax advisors to attempt to develop
alternative allocation arrangements and/or other mechanisms that protect the
federal income tax positions of the Protected Partners in the manner
contemplated by the allocations of Guaranteed Debt or other recourse debt of
the Partnership to the Protected Partners as set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

5.4 _No Representation with Regard to Tax Treatment_. The REIT and the
Partnership (a) make no representation to any Protected Partner or Partner
Guarantor regarding, and (b) provided, that the REIT and the Partnership
comply with their obligations under this Agreement, have no liability to any
Protected Partner or Partner Guarantor for or in respect of, the tax
consequences to such partners of the Transaction or any other transactions
contemplated

 



      
 

 



 

herein, including whether becoming a Partner Guarantor of Guaranteed Debt
shall be respected for federal income tax purposes as causing such partner to
be considered to "bear the economic risk of loss" with respect to indebtedness
for purposes of Section 752 or Section 465 of the Code.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VI**

 

 **TAX PROCEEDINGS**

 



 

6.1 _Notice of Tax Audits_. If any claim, demand, assessment (including a
notice of proposed assessment) or other assertion is made with respect to
taxes against the Protected Partners or the Partnership the calculation of
which involves a matter covered in this Agreement that could result in tax
liability to a Protected Partner ("Tax Claim") or if the REIT or the
Partnership receives any notice from any jurisdiction with respect to any
current or future audit, examination, investigation or other proceeding ("Tax
Proceeding") involving the Protected Partners or the Partnership or that
otherwise could involve a matter covered in this Agreement and could directly
or indirectly affect the Protected Partners (adversely or otherwise), then the
REIT or the Partnership, as applicable shall promptly (but in no event later
than 20 business days after receipt of such notice) notify the Protected
Partners of such Tax Claim or Tax Proceeding. In the case of a notification of
a Tax Claim or Tax Proceeding received by any Protected Partner, or any notice
of any current or future audit, examination, investigation or other proceeding
received by a Protected Partner that involves or could involve a matter
covered in this Agreement or the income tax treatment of the Transaction, the
Protected Partner shall promptly notify the Partnership of such Tax Claim, Tax
Proceeding, or other notice, but in no event later than 20 business days after
receipt of such notice.

 



 

6.2 _Control of Tax Proceedings_. The REIT, as the general partner of the
Partnership and the Partnerships "tax partner," shall have the right to
control the defense, settlement or compromise of any Tax Proceeding or Tax
Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that, except to the extent otherwise required
by law, the REIT shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into
any settlement with respect to such Tax Claim or Tax Proceeding that could
result in tax liability to a Protected Partner without the prior written
consent of the Protected Partner, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed (unless, and only to the extent, that any taxes
required to be paid by the Protected Partner as a result thereof would be
required to be reimbursed by the Partnership and the REIT under Article III
and the Partnership and the REIT agree in connection with such settlement or
consent, to make such required payments); _provided further_ that the
Partnership shall keep the Protected Partners duly informed of the progress
thereof to the extent that such Tax Proceeding or Tax Claim could, directly or
indirectly, affect (adversely or otherwise) the Protected Partners and that
the Protected Partners shall have the right to review and comment on any and
all submissions made to the IRS, a court, or other governmental body with
respect to such Tax Claim or Tax Proceeding and that the Partnership will
consider such comments in good faith. Nothing in this agreement shall prohibit
a Protected Partner from participating in any such Tax Proceeding or Tax Claim
at his or her own expense.

 



 

6.3 _Periodic Tax Information_. The Partnership agrees to provide to the
Protected Partners, upon request, an estimate of the taxable income expected
to be allocable for a specified taxable year from the Partnership to each
Protected Partner, _provided that_ such estimates shall not be required to be
provided more frequently than once each calendar quarter.

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE VII**

 

 **LIMITATION ON LIABILITY OF THE PARTNERSHIP**

 



 

7.1 _Acknowledgement_. The Protected Partners acknowledge that (A) the ability
to execute a Qualified Guarantee hereunder shall only be available to the
Protected Partners and, by providing such ability to execute a guarantee
hereunder, the Partnership makes no representations, warranties or covenants
regarding its current or expected financial condition or the current or
expected financial position of any property securing any Guaranteed Debt, nor
shall the Partnership have any obligation to keep any Protected Partner
informed of any changes in any of the foregoing occurring after the date the
Qualified Guarantee is delivered, and each such Protected Partner fully
assumes the risk of providing such Qualified Guarantee and keeping itself
informed of any such changes, or other developments and occurrences which
might impact the risk to such holder of providing or maintaining any such
Qualified Guarantee, (B) the ability to execute Qualified Guarantees shall
cease in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, (C) each Protected
Partner shall have reviewed with its financial and legal advisors the
potential consequences and liabilities that may be associated with any
Qualified Guarantee provided pursuant to this Agreement, and (D) neither the
Partnership, the REIT nor its advisors have prepared or undertaken a legal
review (and make no representations or warranties) as to the effectiveness of
any Qualified Guarantee for federal income tax purposes, or any legal
implications ( _e.g._ , order of payment, priority) that such Qualified
Guarantees or any obligations of the guarantor and rights of the creditor
thereunder may involve under federal or state law.

 



 

7.2 _Changes in Law_. Each Protected Partner acknowledges that the U.S.
Department of Treasury has issued proposed Treasury Regulations (79 F.R. 4826
(Jan. 30, 2014)) addressing the allocation of partnership liabilities under
Section 752 of the Code (the " _Proposed Regulations_ "). If the Proposed
Regulations are finalized in their current form, a Protected Partner might not
be allocated Partnership liabilities solely as a result of entering into a
Qualified Guarantee. For the avoidance of doubt and without limiting the
acknowledgement set forth in Section 7.1(D), if the Proposed Regulations are
finalized in their current form, or there is any other change in law or the
Treasury Regulations, the Partnership shall have no liability to a Protected
Partner hereunder by virtue of the Qualified Guarantee failing, in itself and
as a result of such finalization or other change, to provide the Protected
Partner an allocation of Partnership liabilities. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if, due to finalization of the Proposed Regulations, either the
Partnership determines, or a Protected Partner is advised by counsel
recognized as expert in such matters or a nationally recognized public
accounting firm, that there is a material risk that such Protected Partner may
no longer continue to be allocated such Protected Partners Minimum Liability
Amount, such Protected Partner may request a modification of such Qualified
Guarantee, and the Partnership will use its commercially reasonable efforts to
have such Qualified Guarantee amended in a manner that will permit such
Protected Partner to continue to be allocated indebtedness equal to such
Protected Partners Minimum Liability Amount _provided_ such efforts and
amendment do not result in a material increased cost to the Partnership and
_provided further that_ no amendment of such Qualified Guarantee shall be
permitted if at the time of such amendment request the Protected Partner would
be required to make a payment under such Qualified Guarantee pursuant to the
terms of such Qualified Guarantee if the Protected Partners obligations under
such Qualified Guarantee were enforced.

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE VIII**

 

 **AMENDMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT; WAIVER OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS; APPROVAL OF
CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS**

 



 

8.1 _Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended, directly or indirectly

agrees to take or cause to be taken such further actions, to execute, deliver,
and file or cause to be executed, delivered and filed such further documents,
and will obtain such consents, as may be necessary or as may be reasonably
requested in order to fully effectuate the purposes, terms and conditions of
this Agreement.

 



 

9.2 _Assignment_. No party hereto shall assign its or his rights or
obligations under this Agreement, in whole or in part, except by operation of

indirect successor, whether by merger, transfer, spin-off or otherwise, to all
or substantially all of the assets of either the REIT or the Partnership (or
any prior successor thereto as set forth in the preceding portion of this
sentence), _provided that_ none of the foregoing shall result in the release
of liability of the REIT and the Partnership hereunder. The REIT and the
Partnership covenant with and for the benefit of the Protected Partners not to
undertake any transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of either
entity (whether by merger, transfer, spin-off or otherwise) unless the
transferee has acknowledged in writing and agreed in writing to be bound by
this Agreement, _provided that_ the foregoing shall not be deemed to permit
any transaction otherwise prohibited by this Agreement.

 



 

9.4 _Modification; Waiver_. No failure or delay on the part of any party
hereto in exercising any power or right hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power,
or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or
power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right or power. The rights and remedies of the parties hereunder are
cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies which they would
otherwise have. No modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement,
nor consent to any departure by any party therefrom, shall in any

 



      
 

 



 

event be effective unless the same shall be in writing, and then such waiver
or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the
purpose for which given. No notice to or demand on any party in any case shall
entitle such party to any other or further notice or demand in similar or
other circumstances.

 **GUARANTEE**

 



 

This Guarantee is made and entered into as of [ ], 2016, by the
persons listed on **_Exhibit A_** annexed hereto who have executed this
Guarantee (the " ** _Guarantors_** ") for the benefit of [ ],
and with their respective successors and assigns, collectively, the " **
_Lender_** "), JBG Realty Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation (" ** _JBG_**
"), and JBG Realty, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the " **
_Partnership_** " or the " ** _Borrower_** ").

 



 

 **RECITALS**

 



 

WHEREAS, the Lender has loaned to the Borrower the amount set forth opposite
such Lenders name on **_Exhibit B_**, which loan (i) is evidenced by the
loan documents described on **_Exhibit C_** hereto (the " ** _Note_** "), and
(ii) has the current outstanding balance in the amount set forth on **_Exhibit
B_** annexed hereto;

 



 

WHEREAS, the Guarantors are, directly or indirectly, limited partners in the
Partnership; and

 



 

WHEREAS, the Guarantors are executing and delivering this Guarantee to
guarantee a portion of the Borrowers payments with respect to the Note,
subject to and otherwise in accordance with the terms and conditions
hereinafter set forth, and in consideration for the indebtedness described in
the Notes.

 



 

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing recitals and facts and other
good and valuable consideration, the receipt and legal sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, each of the Guarantors hereby agree as follows:

 



 

1. _Guarantee and Performance of Payment._

 



 

(a) The Guarantors hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantee the
collection by the Lender of, and hereby agree to pay to the Lender upon demand
(following the exhaustion of the exercise of any and all remedies, whether at
law or in equity, available to the Lender against the Borrower and any
collateral securing the Note, including, without limitation, realizing upon
the assets of the Borrower against which the Lender may have recourse, whether
or not such assets secure the Note (but excluding JBG and the assets of JBG,
whether in its capacity as general partner of the Borrower or pursuant to an
express guarantee by JBG of the Note)), an amount equal to the excess, if any,
of the Guaranteed Amount set forth on **_Exhibit B_** over the Lender
Proceeds (as hereinafter defined) (which excess is referred to as the " **
_Aggregate Guarantee Liability_** "). The amounts payable by each Guarantor in
respect of the guarantee obligations hereunder shall be in the dollar amounts
listed next to such Guarantors name on **_Exhibit A_** (as adjusted as
provided on **_Exhibit A_**) and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Guarantee, each Guarantors aggregate obligation under this
Guarantee shall be limited to the total dollar amount set forth on **_Exhibit
A_** (as adjusted as provided on **_Exhibit A_**) attached hereto next to
such Guarantors name. The Guarantors obligations as set forth in this
paragraph 1(a) are hereinafter referred to as the " ** _Guaranteed
Obligations_**."

 



 

(b) For the purposes of this Guarantee, the term " ** _Lender Proceeds_** "
shall mean the aggregate of all amounts collected by the Lender from the
Borrower (other than payments of

      
 

 



 

principal, interest or other amounts required to be paid by the Borrower to
Lender under the terms of the Note that are paid by the Borrower to the Lender
at a time when no default has occurred under the Note and is continuing) or
realized by the Lender from the sale of assets of the Borrower, whether or not
collateral for the Note (" ** _Asset Sale Proceeds_** ").

 



 

(c) For the purposes of this Guarantee, the term " ** _Asset Sale Proceeds_**
" shall have the applicable meaning set forth below with respect to the assets
of the Borrower:

 



 

1. If at least one bona fide third party unrelated to the Lender (and including, without limitation, any of the Guarantors) bids for such assets at a public sale thereof called in accordance with the terms of a Note and pursuant to applicable law, Asset Sale Proceeds shall mean the highest amount bid for such assets by the party that acquires title thereto (directly or through a nominee) at or pursuant to such sale. For the purposes of determining such highest bid, amounts bid for the assets of the Borrower by the Lender shall be taken into account notwithstanding the fact that such bids may constitute credit bids which offset against the amount due to the Lender under the Note.

 



 

2. If there is no such unrelated third-party at such sale of the assets of the Borrower so that the only bidder at such sale is the Lender or its designee, the Asset Sale Proceeds shall be deemed to be fair market value (the " ** _Fair Market Value_** ") of the assets sold as of the date of the sale, as such Fair Market Value shall be mutually agreed upon by the Lender and the Guarantor or determined pursuant to subparagraph 1(d).

 



 

3. If the Lender receives and accepts a deed or other conveyance of assets of the Borrow in in partial satisfaction of the Borrowers obligations under a Note, the Asset Sale Proceeds shall be deemed to be the Fair Market Value of such assets as of the date of delivery of the deed or other conveyance instrument, as such Fair Market Value shall be mutually agreed upon by the Lender and the Guarantor or determined pursuant to subparagraph 1(d).

 



 

(d) Fair Market Value of the assets of the Borrower (or any item thereof)
shall be the price at which a willing seller not compelled to sell would sell
such assets, and a willing buyer not compelled to buy would purchase such
assets, free and clear of all mortgages but subject to all leases and
reciprocal easements and operating agreements. If the Lender and the Guarantor
are unable to agree upon the Fair Market Value of any assets in accordance
with subparagraphs 1(c)( 2), or 1(c)(3), above, as applicable, within twenty
(20) days after the date of the asset sale or the delivery of the deed or
other conveyance instrument, as applicable, relating to such assets, either
party may have the Fair Market Value of such assets determined by appraisal by
appointing an appraiser having the qualifications set forth below to determine
the same and by notifying the other party of such appointment within twenty
(20) days after the expiration of such twenty (20) day period. If the other
party shall fail to notify the first party, within twenty (20) days after its
receipt of notice of the appointment by the first party, of the appointment by
the other party of an appraiser having the qualifications set forth below, the
appraiser appointed by

      
 

 



 

the first party shall alone make the determination of such Fair Market Value.
Appraisers appointed by the parties shall be members of the Appraisal
Institute (MAI) and shall have at least ten years experience in the valuation
of properties similar to the assets being valued in the greater metropolitan
area in which such assets are located. If each party shall appoint an
appraiser having the aforesaid qualifications and if such appraisers cannot,
within thirty (30) days after the appointment of the second appraiser, agree
upon the determination hereinabove required, then they shall select a third
appraiser which third appraiser shall have the aforesaid qualifications, and
if they fail so to do within forty (40) days after the appointment of the
second appraiser they shall notify the parties hereto, and either party shall
thereafter have the right, on notice to the other, to apply for the
appointment of a third appraiser to the chapter of the American Arbitration
Association or its successor organization located in the metropolitan area in
which such assets are located or to which such assets are proximate or if no
such chapter is located in such metropolitan area, in the metropolitan area
closest to such assets in which such a chapter is located. Each appraiser
shall render its decision as to the Fair Market Value of the assets in
question within thirty (30) days after the appointment of the third appraiser
and shall furnish a copy thereof to the Lender and the Guarantor. The Fair
Market Value of the assets shall then be calculated as the average of (i) the
Fair Market Value determined by the third appraiser and (ii) whichever of the
Fair Market Values determined by the first two appraisers is closer to the
Fair Market Value determined by the third appraiser; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if the Fair Market Value determined by the third appraiser is higher or
lower than both Fair Market Values determined by the first two appraisers,
such Fair Market Value determined by the third appraiser shall be disregarded
and the Fair Market Value of assets shall then be calculated as the average of
the Fair Market Value determined by the first two appraisers. The Fair Market
Value of an asset, as so determined, shall be binding and conclusive upon the
Lender and the Guarantors. Guarantors shall bear the cost of its own appraiser
and, subject to subparagraph 1(e), shall bear all reasonable costs of
appointing, and the expenses of, any other appraiser appointed pursuant to
this subparagraph (1)(d).

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in the preceding subparagraphs of this paragraph
1, (i) in no event shall the aggregate amount required to be paid pursuant to
this Guarantee by the Guarantors as a group with respect to all defaults under
the Note exceed the Guaranteed Amount set forth on **_Exhibit B_** hereto,
and (ii) the aggregate obligation of each Guarantor hereunder with respect to
the Guaranteed Obligation shall be limited to the lesser of (I) the product of
(w) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Guaranteed Obligation of such
Guarantor and the denominator of which is the sum of the Guaranteed
Obligations for all Guarantors that have executed this Guarantee (the " **
_Individual Guarantee Percentage_** ") multiplied by (x) the Guaranteed
Amount, or (II) the product of (y) such Guarantors Individual Guarantee
Percentage multiplied by (z) the Aggregate Guarantee Liability.

 



 

(f) In confirmation of the foregoing, and without limitation, the Lender must
first exhaust all of its rights and remedies against all assets of the
Borrower as to which the Lender has (or may have) a right of recourse before
exercising any right or remedy or making any claim, under this Guarantee.

 



 

(g) The obligations under this Guarantee shall be personal to each Guarantor
and shall not be affected by any transfer of all or any part of a Guarantors
interests in the Partnership; provided, however, that if a Guarantor has
disposed of all of its equity interests in

      
 

 



 

the Partnership, the obligations of such Guarantor under this Guarantee shall
terminate 12 months after the date of such disposition (the " ** _Termination
Date_** ") provided (i) the Guarantor notifies the Agent that it is
terminating its obligations under this Guarantee as of the Termination Date
and (ii) the fair market value of assets of the Borrower (reduced by the
amount of all liabilities of the Borrower other than the Note), exceeds the
outstanding balance of the Note, including accrued and unpaid interest, as of
the Termination Date. Further, no Guarantor shall have the right to recover
from the Borrower any amounts such Guarantor pays pursuant to this Guarantee
(except and only to the extent that the amount paid to the Lender by such
Guarantor exceeds the amount required to be paid by such Guarantor under the
terms of this Guarantee).

 



 

(h) The obligations of any Guarantor who is an individual as a Guarantor
hereunder shall terminate with respect to such Guarantor one week after the
death of such Guarantor if, as a result of the death of such Guarantor, all
property held by the Guarantor on the date of death would have a basis for
federal income tax purposes equal to the fair market value of such property on
such date (unless a later date were to be elected by the executor of the
Guarantors estate in accordance with the applicable provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code).

 



 

2. _Intent to Benefit Lender_. This Guarantee is expressly for the benefit of the Lender in consideration for the indebtedness described in the Note. The Guarantors intend that the Lender shall have the right to enforce the obligations of the Guarantors hereunder separately and independently of the Borrower, subject to the provisions of paragraph 1, without any requirement whatsoever of resort by the Lender to any other party. The Lenders rights to enforce the obligations of the Guarantors hereunder are material elements of this Guarantee. This Guarantee shall not be modified, amended or terminated (other than as specifically provided herein) without the written consent of the Lender. The Borrower shall furnish a copy of this Guarantee to the Lender contemporaneously with its execution.

 



 

3. _Waivers_. Each Guarantor intends to bear the ultimate economic responsibility for the payment hereof of the Guaranteed Obligations to the extent set forth in paragraph 1. Pursuant to such intent:

 



 

(a) Except as expressly set forth in paragraph 1, each Guarantor expressly
waives any right (pursuant to any law, rule, arrangement or relationship) to
compel the Lender, or any subsequent holder of any Note to sue or enforce
payment thereof or pursue any other remedy in the power of the Borrower, the
Lender or any subsequent holder of any Note whatsoever, and failure of the
Borrower or the Lender or any subsequent holder of any Note to do so shall not
exonerate, release or discharge a Guarantor from its absolute unconditional
obligations under this Guarantee. Each Guarantor hereby binds and obligates
itself, and its permitted successors and assignees, for performance of the
Guaranteed Obligations according to the terms hereof, whether or not the
Guaranteed Obligations or any portion thereof are valid now or hereafter
enforceable against the Borrower or shall have been incurred in compliance
with any of the conditions applicable thereto, subject, however, in all
respects to the Guarantee Limit and the other limitations set forth in
paragraph 1.

 



 

(b) Each Guarantor expressly waives any right (pursuant to any law, rule,
arrangement, or relationship) to compel any other person (including, but not
limited to, the Borrower, any subsidiary of the Borrower, or any other partner
or affiliate of the Borrower) to

      
 

 



 

reimburse or indemnify such Guarantor for all or any portion of amounts paid
by such Guarantor pursuant to this Guarantee to the extent such amounts do not
exceed the amounts required to be paid by such Guarantor pursuant to paragraph
1 (taking into account the limitations set forth therein).

 



 

(c) Except as expressly set forth in paragraph 1, if and only to the extent
that the Borrower has made similar waivers under the Note, or the other Loan
Documents that it is a party to, each Guarantor expressly waives: (i) the
defense of the statute of limitations in any action hereunder or for the
collection or performance of the Note; (ii) any defense that may arise by
reason of: the incapacity, or lack of authority of the Borrower, the
revocation or repudiation hereof by such Guarantor, the revocation or
repudiation of the Note by the Borrower, the failure of the Lender to file or
enforce a claim against the estate (either in administration, bankruptcy or
any other proceeding) of the Borrower; the unenforceability in whole or in
part of the Note or any other document or instrument related thereto; the
Lenders election, in any proceeding by or against the Borrower under the
federal Bankruptcy Code, of the application of Section 1111(b)(2) of the
federal Bankruptcy Code; or any borrowing or grant of a security interest
under Section 364 of the federal Bankruptcy Code; (iii) presentment, demand
for payment, protest, notice of discharge, notice of acceptance of this
Guarantee or occurrence of, or any default in connection with, the Note, and
indulgences and notices of any other kind whatsoever, including, without
limitation, notice of the disposition of any collateral for the Note; (iv) any
defense based upon an election of remedies (including, if available, an
election to proceed by non-judicial foreclosure) or other action or omission
by the Lender or any other person or entity which destroys or otherwise
impairs any indemnification, contribution or subrogation rights of such
Guarantor or the right of such Guarantor, if any, to proceed against the
Borrower for reimbursement, or any combination thereof; (v) subject to
paragraph 4, any defense based upon any taking, modification or release of any
collateral or guarantees for the Note, or any failure to create or perfect any
security interest in, or the taking of or failure to take any other action
with respect to any collateral securing payment or performance of the Note;
(vi) any rights or defenses based upon any right to offset or claimed offset
by such Guarantor against any indebtedness or obligation now or hereafter owed
to such Guarantor by the Borrower; or (vii) any rights or defenses based upon
any rights or defenses of the Borrower to the Note (including, without
limitation, the failure or value of consideration, any statute of limitations,
accord and satisfaction, and the insolvency of the Borrower); it being
intended, except as expressly set forth in paragraph 1, that such Guarantor
shall remain liable hereunder, to the extent set forth herein, notwithstanding
any act, omission or thing which might otherwise operate as a legal or
equitable discharge of any of such Guarantor or of the Borrower.

 



 

4. _Amendment of Note_. Without in any manner limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Lender or any subsequent holder of the Note may, from time to time, without notice to or consent of the Guarantors, agree to any amendment, waiver, modification or alteration of the Note or the other Loan Documents relating to the Borrower and its rights and obligations thereunder (including, without limitation, renewal, waiver or variation of the maturity of the indebtedness evidenced by the Note, increase or reduction of the rate of interest payable under the Note, release, substitution or addition of any Guarantor or endorser and acceptance or release of any security for the Note), it being understood and agreed by the Lender, however, that the Guarantors obligations hereunder are subject, in all events, to the limitations set forth in paragraph 1; _provided that_ upon any material change to a Note, including, without limitation,

      
 

 



 

the maturity date or the interest rate of a Note, within thirty (30) days of
any Guarantors receipt of actual notice of such event from the Agent or the
Borrower, subject to the following sentence, such Guarantor may elect to
terminate such Guarantors obligations under this Guarantee by written notice
to the Lender. Such termination shall take effect on the 31st day following
such actual notice, _provided that_ no default under the Guaranteed Obligation
has occurred and is then continuing.

 



 

5. _Termination of Guarantee_. Subject to paragraph 4, this Guarantee is irrevocable as to any and all of the Guaranteed Obligations.

 



 

6. _Independent Obligations_. Except as expressly set forth in paragraph 1, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder are independent of the obligations of the Borrower, and a separate action or actions may be brought by a Lender against the Guarantors, whether or not actions are brought against the Borrower. Each Guarantor expressly waives any and all rights of subrogation, reimbursement, indemnity, exoneration, contribution or any other claim which such Guarantor may now or hereafter have against the Borrower, or any other person (including without limitation any other Guarantor) directly or contingently liable for the payment or performance of a Note arising from the existence or performance of this Guarantee (including, but not limited to, the Partnership, JBG, or any other partner of the Partnership) (except and only to the extent that a Guarantor makes a payment to the Lender in excess of the amount required to be paid under paragraph 1 and the limitations set forth therein). Any indebtedness of Borrower to a Guarantor now or hereafter existing is hereby subordinated to the payment and performance of the obligations of Borrower under the Note and the other Loan Documents. Each Guarantor agrees that, for so long as any obligations of Borrower under the Note and the other Loan Documents remain outstanding (other than contingent indemnification obligations that have not yet been asserted) or subject to any bankruptcy preference period or any other possibility of disgorgement, such Guarantor will not seek, accept, or retain for its own account, any payment from Borrower on account of such subordinated debt. Any payments to any Guarantor on account of such subordinated debt which are not otherwise permitted herein shall be collected and received by such Guarantor in trust for the Lender and shall be paid over to the Lender on account of the obligations of Borrower under the Note and the other Loan Documents without impairing or releasing the obligations of any Guarantor hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, and for the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto agree that the foregoing shall not operate to subordinate or otherwise affect any claim against, or indebtedness of, either JBG or the Partnership that may be held by a Guarantor.

 



 

7. _Understanding With Respect to Waivers_. Each Guarantor warrants and represents that each of the waivers set forth above are made with full knowledge of their significance and consequences, and that under the circumstances, the waivers are reasonable and not contrary to public policy or law. If any of said waivers are determined to be contrary to any applicable law or public policy, such waiver shall be effective only to the maximum extent permitted by law.

 



 

8. _No Assignment_. No Guarantor shall be entitled to assign his or her rights or obligations under this Guarantee to any other person without the written consent of the Lender.

 



 

9. _Entire Agreement_. The parties agree that this Guarantee contains the entire understanding and agreement between them with respect to the subject matter hereof and cannot be amended, modified or superseded, except by an agreement in writing signed by the parties.

       
 

 



 

10. _Notices_. Any notice given pursuant to this Guarantee shall be in writing and shall be deemed given when delivered personally, or sent by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, as follows:

11. _Applicable Law_. This Guarantee shall be governed by, interpreted under and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of [ ](1) without reference to its choice of law provisions.

 



 

12. _Consent to Jurisdiction; Enforceability_

 



 

(a) This Guarantee and the duties and obligations of the parties hereto shall
be enforceable against each Guarantor in the courts of the [State of ].
For such purpose, each Guarantor hereby irrevocably submits to the
nonexclusive jurisdiction of such courts and agrees that all claims in respect
of this Guarantee may be heard and determined in any of such courts.

  (1) The guarantees shall be governed by the same state law by which the
relevant loan document is governed.

      
 

 



 

(b) Each Guarantor hereby irrevocably agrees that a final judgment of any of
the courts specified above in any action or proceeding relating to this
Guarantee shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.

 



 

13. _Condition of Borrower_. Each Guarantor is fully aware of the financial condition of the Borrower and is executing and delivering this Guarantee based solely upon its own independent investigation of all matters pertinent hereto and is not relying in any manner upon any representation or statement of the Lender or the Borrower. Each Guarantor represents and warrants that it is in a position to obtain, and hereby assumes full responsibility for obtaining, any additional information concerning the Borrowers financial conditions and any other matter pertinent hereto as it may desire, and it is not relying upon or expecting the Lender to furnish to it any information now or hereafter in the Lenders possession concerning the same. By executing this Guarantee, each Guarantor knowingly accepts the full range of risks encompassed within a contract of this type, which risks it acknowledges.

 



 

14. _Expenses_. Each Guarantor agrees that, promptly after receiving Lenders notice therefor, such Guarantor shall reimburse Lender, subject to the limitation set forth in subparagraph 1(e) and to the extent that such reimbursement is not made by Borrower, for all reasonable expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements) incurred by Lender in connection with the collection of the Guaranteed Obligations or any portion thereof or with the enforcement of this Guarantee.

 



 

15. _Indemnification of and/or Reimbursement to JBG_. To the extent that JBG makes a payment to the Lender following an event of default under a Note, whether in its capacity as the general partner of the Borrower, pursuant to its guarantee of the Note or otherwise, and, as a result of such payment, the outstanding and unpaid obligations of a Guarantor hereunder are reduced (the amount of any such reduction, a " ** _Reduced Payment Amount_** "), then such Guarantor shall, upon demand by JBG, reimburse JBG in an amount equal its Reduced Payment Amount. The obligations under this Section 15 are for the benefit of JBG and may be enforced at any time by JBG. This Section 15 may not be directly or indirectly amended, terminated or otherwise modified without the prior written approval of JBG.

      
 

 



 

 **IN WITNESS WHEREOF** , the undersigned Guarantors hereto have executed this
Guarantee as of the date first set forth above.
