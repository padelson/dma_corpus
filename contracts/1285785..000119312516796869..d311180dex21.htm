(b) 42,286,874 validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Buyer

(c) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Closing, the outstanding
shares of Buyer Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number
of shares or a different class of shares by reason of any stock dividend,
subdivision, reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split,
reverse stock split, combination or exchange of shares, or any similar event
shall have occurred, then the number of Buyer Shares shall be equitably
adjusted, without duplication, to proportionally reflect such change;  _p_
_r_ _ovid_ _e_ _d_ , that nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 2.04(c)_ shall be
construed to permit Buyer to take any action with respect to its securities
that is otherwise prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 



26 (d) Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, each adjustment pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 2.04(a)_ shall be calculated in accordance with the
Accounting Principles and using the currency exchange rate applicable to
obligations payable in foreign currency determined by reference to the
arithmetic average of the closing quotations of the PTAX dollar sale rate (
_taxa de venda_ ) and the PTAX dollar buy rate ( _taxa de compra_ ) as of any
Reporting Day, in each case, offered in the commercial rate exchange market (
_mercado de c_ _a_ _mbio_ ), as such rate is published by the Central Bank of
Brazil ( _Banco Central do Brasil_ ) and available (for download or otherwise)
on its website at
http://www4.bcb.gov.br/pec/taxas/ingl/ptaxnpesq.asp?id=quotations (or, if
such site or source is unavailable, its equivalent successor source or any
other authoritative source as may be mutually agreed between Buyer and Parent)
on the Business Day immediately prior to the Closing Date ( _provided_ , 
_however_ , that the calculation of the Estimated Cash Purchase Price shall be
determined by reference to such closing quotation on the Business Day
immediately prior to the date of the delivery of the Closing Estimates
Statement pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.07(a)_). For the avoidance of doubt,
Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Transaction Expenses and Closing
Forfaiting Amount do not, and shall not be deemed to, include any items to the
extent such items are included in Closing Net Working Capital of Miski Mayo
or Closing Net Working Capital of the Company.

(e) Unless otherwise indicated herein or required by applicable Law or a
Governmental Authority, all payments made pursuant to this Agreement shall be
made directly to Buyer or the Sellers (or the relevant Selling Entity), as
applicable, and any such payments shall be treated as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price. The Parties shall use reasonable efforts to ensure that any
requirement that may apply in order for a payment to be treated as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price under applicable Law is satisfied. 

2.05 _Closing Payment_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, at the Closing, Buyer shall:

 

(a) pay and deliver to each Selling Entity the portion of the Estimated Cash
Purchase Price allocated to such Selling Entity in the Closing Estimates
Statement, in each case, in cash in U.S. dollars, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, to an account or accounts designated by Parent in
writing at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date; and 

(b) issue and deliver to each Seller the number of Buyer Shares allocated to
such Seller by Parent pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 6.09_.

2.06 _Withholding_.

 

(a) Not later than sixty (60) days prior to the expected Closing Date, Parent
shall deliver to Buyer a statement (the " _Withholding Tax Statement_ ")
which shall include

 



27  (i) the information necessary to determine whether or not any amounts
payable by Buyer to any Selling Entity hereunder would be subject to
Brazilian, Peruvian, Argentinian, Canadian, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Austrian
or Switzerland (each a " _Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction_ ") withholding Taxes
under applicable Law and (ii) for each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, either
(x) Parents good faith calculation, based on the information described in
clause (i), of the amount (if any) of the withholding Taxes required to be
deducted or withheld from such payments by such Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction,
or (y) an affirmative statement confirming that Parent has determined, in its
sole discretion, that no withholding Taxes will be imposed on such payments by
such Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction. Buyer shall notify Parent no later than
forty-five (45) days prior to such expected Closing Date if Buyer disagrees
with either the calculation of withholding Taxes or with Parents
determination that no withholding Taxes will be imposed by a Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction as set forth on the Withholding Tax Statement, and Buyer and
Parent shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such disagreement and Parent
shall update the Withholding Tax Statement to reflect any resolution thereof.
If Buyer and Parent are unable to resolve the disagreement within fifteen (15)
days, the matter shall be resolved in accordance with the procedures
described in _Section_ __ _ 6.04_. If at any time prior to the Closing Date
Parent determines that the information provided in the Withholding Tax
Statement has become incomplete or incorrect and as a result the amount of
required withholding Tax has changed, Parent shall promptly send an updated
Withholding Tax Statement to Buyer with the applicable information and
calculations described in clauses (i) and (ii) above for the applicable
Relevant Taxing Jurisdictions. Buyer agrees that it shall not withhold or
deduct amounts in excess of the amounts shown on the Withholding Tax
Statement. If Parent fails to provide an accurate and complete Withholding Tax
Statement to Buyer, Buyer shall be entitled to compute the amounts (if any)
to be deducted or withheld under applicable Law. To the extent that any
amounts in respect of withholding Tax are deducted and withheld in accordance
with the Withholding Tax Statement (or because Parent failed to provide a
complete and accurate Withholding Tax Statement), such deducted and withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Selling Entity in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made.

(b) To the extent Buyer designates an Affiliate to make a payment pursuant to
this Agreement and amounts are required to be deducted and withheld from such
payment, the amount payable by such Affiliate shall be increased to the extent
necessary to ensure that, after making such deduction or withholding, the
relevant Selling Entity receives and retains a net amount equal to the amount
it would have received had the payment been made by Buyer.

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, any Transaction Taxes shall be governed
exclusively by _Section 6.01(a)_ and not this _Section_ __ _ 2.06_.

 

2.07 _Estimated Cash Purchase Price_.

 

(a) At least four (4) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall
deliver to Buyer a statement with its good faith estimate (as certified by
Parents and the Companys respective chief financial officers) of the Cash
Purchase Price (the

 



28  " _Estimated Cash Purchase Price_ "), which statement shall include, in
reasonable detail, (i) Parents calculation of the amounts for each of the
adjustments set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 2.04(a)_, (ii) the portion of the
Estimated Cash Purchase Price allocable to each Selling Entity and (iii) the
number of Buyer Shares allocable to each Seller (the " _Closing
Estimates Statement_ "). The portion of the Estimated Cash Purchase Price
allocable to each Selling Entity and the number of Buyer Shares allocable to
each Seller shall be determined in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 6.09_.

 

(b) Parent shall provide a reasonable level of supporting documentation for
the Closing Estimates Statement and the Estimated Cash Purchase Price and the
calculation thereof and any additional information reasonably requested by
Buyer and related thereto. If Buyer objects to the Closing Estimates Statement
or the calculation thereof, Buyer shall deliver notice of such objection to
Parent no later than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, and
Buyer and Parent shall cooperate in good faith to resolve any of Buyers
objections set forth in such objection notice, and Parent shall revise
the Closing Estimates Statement and the calculation thereof to reflect any
revisions mutually agreed upon by Buyer and Parent at least one (1) Business
Day prior to the Closing Date. If Buyer and Parent fail to resolve any of
Buyers objections, the Closing Estimates Statement and the calculation
thereof as originally delivered by Parent shall be conclusive and binding upon
Buyer for the purposes of determining the amount of the Estimated Cash
Purchase Price payable by Buyer at the Closing.

2.08 _Post_ _-Closing Adjustment_ _Procedures_.

 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than sixty (60)
days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and cause to be delivered to
Parent a statement with its good faith determination (as certified by Buyers
chief financial officer) of the Cash Purchase Price, which statement shall
include, in reasonable detail, (i) Buyers calculation of the amounts for
each of the adjustments set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.04(a)_, (ii) the
portion of the Cash Purchase Price allocable to each Selling Entity and (iii)
the number of Buyer Shares allocable to each Seller (the " _Closing
Statement_ "). The portion of the Cash Purchase Price allocable to each
Selling Entity and the number of Buyer Shares allocable to each Seller shall
be determined in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 6.09_. Buyer shall provide
a reasonable level of supporting documentation for the Closing Statement and
the Cash Purchase Price therein and the calculation thereof and any additional
information reasonably requested by Parent and related thereto.

(b) Upon receipt of the Closing Statement, Parent and its representatives
shall be permitted during the succeeding sixty (60) day period (the " _Review
Period_ ") reasonable access, upon reasonable notice, to (i) the Books and
Records in the possession of Buyer or any member of the Company Group which
would reasonably be expected to be necessary for the preparation of the
Closing Statement and (ii) the personnel of Buyer and the Company Group
involved in the preparation of the Closing Statement and/or who would
reasonably be expected to be necessary for the preparation thereof;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the independent accountants of Buyer shall not
be obligated to make any working papers available to Parent, unless and until
Parent has signed a customary confidentiality and hold harmless agreement
relating to such access to working papers in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to such independent accountants.

 



29 (c) If Parent disagrees with the Closing Statement or the calculation of the
Cash Purchase Price in the Closing Statement, on or prior to the last day of
the Review Period, Parent shall notify Buyer in writing of such disagreement
with the Closing Statement, which notice shall set forth any such disagreement
in reasonable detail, the specific item of the Closing Statement and the
calculation thereof to which such disagreement relates and the specific basis
for each such disagreement (the " _Objection Notice_ "). If Parent fails to
deliver the Objection Notice within the Review Period, the Closing Statement
and Buyers calculation thereof shall be deemed to have been accepted by the
Sellers and shall be final and binding and used in computing the Post-
Closing Adjustment Amounts. If Parent delivers the Objection Notice within
the Review Period, subject to _Section_ __ _ 2.08(d)_, Buyer and Parent shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve any such disagreement, and any resolution
agreed to in writing by Buyer and Parent shall be final and binding upon the
Parties.

(d) If Buyer and Parent are unable to resolve any disagreement as
contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 2.08(c)_ within thirty (30) days after
delivery of the Objection Notice (the " _Resolution Period_ "), then Buyer and
Parent shall submit the matter for resolution to Ernst and Young LLP (or, if
Ernst and Young LLP is unwilling or unavailable to accept such engagement, a
mutually agreeable independent international accounting firm with substantial
expertise in BR GAAP), who shall, acting as an expert (and not as an
arbitrator), resolve the dispute set forth in the Objection Notice. In the
event Ernst and Young LLP is unwilling or unavailable to accept such engagement
and Buyer and Parent are unable to agree on an accounting firm within fifteen
(15) days after being notified by Ernst and Young LLP that it is unwilling or
unavailable to accept such engagement, at the request of either party, Buyer
and Parent shall jointly request that the ICC International Centre for
Expertise appoint an independent international accounting firm with
substantial expertise in BR GAAP to resolve, as an expert (and not as an
arbitrator), the dispute set forth in the Objection Notice (Ernst and Young LLP
or the accounting firm appointed pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.08(d)_,
the " _Independent Auditor_ "). The fees, costs and expenses of the
Independent Auditor (and, if applicable, the ICC International Centre for
Expertise) shall be allocated between the Sellers and Buyer in proportion to
the extent either Parent or Buyer did not prevail on the disputed items
submitted for the Independent Auditors review. For the avoidance of doubt and
solely as an illustration of the methodology set forth in the immediately
preceding sentence, if (i) the Objection Notice delivered by Parent assigns
values to the disputed items such that the Cash Purchase Price would be
increased by $1,000,000, (ii) Buyer maintains that the Cash Purchase Price as
calculated pursuant to the Closing Statement is correct and (iii) the
Independent Auditors final resolution of the disputed items in accordance
with  _Section_ __ _ 2.04_ is that the Cash Purchase Price as calculated by
Buyer in the Closing Statement is increased by $600,000 ( _i.e._ , sixty
percent (60%) of the amount in dispute is resolved in favor of the
Sellers), then forty percent (40%) of such fees and expenses of the
Independent Auditor shall be paid by the Sellers and Buyer shall be
responsible for sixty percent (60%) of such fees and expenses of the
Independent Auditor. All other costs and expenses incurred by the Parties in
connection with resolving any dispute hereunder before the Independent Auditor
shall be borne by the Party incurring such cost and expense.

 



30 (e) Parent and Buyer shall instruct the Independent Auditor to consider
only those items and amounts which are identified in the Objection Notice as
being items which Buyer and Parent are unable to resolve and to make a
determination as to whether such items and amounts were calculated in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Further, the Independent
Auditors determination shall be based solely on the relevant Books and
Records and the other written information provided by Buyer and Parent (
_i.e._ , not on the basis of an independent review), and the Independent
Auditor shall not conduct additional discovery in any form.

(f) Parent and Buyer shall jointly instruct the Independent Auditor to make a
determination as soon as practicable (but in any case within thirty (30) days
(or such other time as the Parties shall agree in writing) after its
engagement) with respect to the disputed items submitted to the Independent
Auditor and to what extent (if any) the Final Cash Purchase Price requires
adjustment; _provided_ that the failure to adhere to such thirty (30) day time
limit shall not be a basis for challenging the Independent
Auditors determination. The Independent Auditor shall provide the Parties
with a written explanation in reasonable detail of each such required
adjustment, including the basis therefor. All negotiations pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 2.08_ through the end of the Resolution Period shall be
treated as compromise and settlement negotiations for purposes of Rule 408 of
the Federal Rules of Evidence and comparable state rules of evidence. Except
as may be required by applicable Law or court order, the Parties agree to
maintain confidentiality as to all aspects of any proceeding before the
Independent Auditor, including its existence and results, except that nothing
herein shall prevent any Party from disclosing information regarding such
proceeding to a court of competent jurisdiction for purposes of enforcing this
_Section_ __ _ 2.08_ or the Independent Auditors final determination. The
Independent Auditor shall be bound by a mutually agreeable confidentiality
agreement, which shall preserve the confidentiality of any proceeding before
the Independent Auditor. The procedures of this _Section_ __ _ 2.08_ are
exclusive and, except as set forth below, the determination of the
Independent Auditor shall be final and binding on the Parties. The decision
rendered pursuant to this _Section 2.08(f)_ may be entered as a judgment in
any court of competent jurisdiction. Either Parent or Buyer may seek specific
enforcement or take other necessary legal action to enforce any decision under
this _Section_ __ _ 2.08(f)_, including pursuant to Article 76 of the New
York Civil Practice Law and Rules. The only defense of either Parent or Buyer
to such a request for specific enforcement or other legal action shall be
fraud by or upon the Independent Auditor or manifest error. Absent such fraud
or manifest error, Parent or Buyer, as applicable, shall reimburse the
Party seeking enforcement for its expenses related to such enforcement.

2.09 _Payment of Post_ _-Closing Adjustment_.

(a) If (i) the portion of the Estimated Cash Purchase Price allocated to any
Selling Entity in the Closing Estimates Statement exceeds the portion of the
Cash Purchase Price as finally determined pursuant to, and in accordance with,
_Section_ __ _ 2.08_ 

 



31  (the " _Final Cash Purchase Price_ ") allocated to such Selling Entity, the
Sellers shall pay, or shall cause the applicable Selling Entity to pay, Buyer
the amount of such excess, and (ii) the portion of the Final Cash Purchase
Price allocated to any Selling Entity exceeds the portion of the Estimated
Cash Purchase Price allocated to such Selling Entity in the Closing Estimates
Statement, Buyer shall pay to the applicable Selling Entity the amount of
such excess (the excess amounts referred to in each of clauses (i) and (ii),
the " _Post_ _-Closing Adjustment Amounts_").

 

(b) Any Post-Closing Adjustment Amounts shall be paid in cash in U.S. dollars
by wire transfer of immediately available funds within three (3) Business
Days after the final determination of the Post-Closing Adjustment Amounts in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.09_ to an account or accounts
designated by the Party receiving payment.

2.10 _Earn_ _-Out  Payments_.

(a) In addition to the Purchase Price and as additional consideration in
respect of the HoldCo Shares, the Shares and the Subsidiary Shares, subject
to Buyers right of setoff in _Section 2.10(e)_ , Buyer shall, in respect of
each Earn-Out Period, pay the Selling Entities the applicable Earn-Out Amount
(if any), as finally determined pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.10_, in
cash in U.S. dollars by wire transfer of immediately available funds within
three (3) Business Days after such final determination to an account
designated by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) if the Earn-Out Amount
is a negative number, no Earn-Out Amount shall be payable in respect of such
Earn-Out Period; and (ii) in no event shall the Earn-Out Amount in respect of
any Earn-Out Period exceed $130,000,000. The Selling Entities shall not be
entitled to any interest on the Earn-Out Amount under this Agreement. For
the avoidance of doubt, in the event that the First FX Earn-Out _plus_ the
First MAP Earn-Out would equal an amount that is in excess of $130,000,000,
such excess shall not be payable to the Selling Entities for any reason
(including by applying such excess to the calculation of any Earn-Out Amount
payable to the Selling Entities in the Second Earn-Out Period). Any payments
made pursuant to this _Section 2.10(a)_ shall be allocated among the Selling
Entities in manner that is consistent with the allocation of the Purchase
Price among the Selling Entities in the Closing Statement and the principles
of _Section_ __ _ 6.09_.

(b) No later than ten (10) Business Days following the expiration of each
Earn-Out Period, Buyer shall prepare and cause to be delivered to Parent a
statement setting forth its good faith determination of the Earn-Out Amount in
respect of such Earn-Out Period (such statement, an " _Earn_ _-Out
Statement_") and the amount, if any, payable to the Selling Entities in
respect of such Earn-Out Period pursuant to _Section_ _2.10(a)_. Buyer shall
provide a reasonable level of supporting documentation for the Earn-Out
Statement and the Earn-Out Amount therein and the calculation thereof. If
Parent disagrees with the Earn-Out Statement or the calculation of the Earn-
Out Amount, Parent shall, on or prior to the tenth (10th) Business Day after
receipt of the Earn-Out Statement, notify Buyer in writing of such
disagreement with the Earn-Out Statement, which notice shall set forth any
such disagreement in reasonable detail, the specific item of the Earn-Out
Statement and the calculation thereof to which such disagreement relates and
the specific basis for each such disagreement (the " _Earn_ _-Out Objection
Notice_"). If

 



32  Parent fails to deliver the Earn-Out Objection Notice on or prior to the
tenth (10th) Business Day after receipt of the Earn-Out Statement, the Earn-
Out Statement and Buyers calculation of the Earn-Out Amount shall be deemed
to have been accepted by the Sellers and shall be final and binding on the
Sellers. If Parent delivers the Earn-Out Objection Notice on or prior to such
tenth (10th) Business Day, subject to _Section 2.10(c)_ , Buyer and Parent
shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any such disagreement, and any
resolution agreed to in writing by Buyer and Parent shall be final and
binding upon the Parties.

(c) If Buyer and Parent are unable to resolve any disagreements as
contemplated by  _Section 2.10(b)_ within ten (10) Business Days after
delivery of the Earn-Out Objection Notice (the " _Earn-Out Resolution
Period_"), then Buyer and Parent shall submit the matter for resolution to
the Independent Auditor. Parent and Buyer shall instruct the Independent
Auditor to consider only those items and amounts which are identified in
the Earn-Out Objection Notice as being items which Buyer and Parent are
unable to resolve and to make a determination as to whether such items and
amounts were calculated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The
fees, costs and expenses of the Independent Auditor (and, if applicable, the
ICC International Centre for Expertise) shall be allocated between the Sellers
and Buyer in the manner set forth in _Section 2.08(d)_. Parent and
Buyer shall jointly instruct the Independent Auditor to make a determination
as soon as practicable (but in any case within fifteen (15) days (or such
other time as the Parties shall agree in writing) after its engagement) with
respect to the disputed items submitted to the Independent Auditor and to
what extent (if any) the Earn-Out Amount as proposed by Buyer requires
adjustment; _provided_ that the failure to adhere to such fifteen (15) day
time limit shall not be a basis for challenging the Independent Auditors
determination. The Independent Auditor shall provide the Parties with a
written explanation in reasonable detail of each such required adjustment,
including the basis therefor. All negotiations pursuant to this _Section_ __
_ 2.10_ through the end of the Earn-Out Resolution Period shall be treated as
compromise and settlement negotiations for purposes of Rule 408 of the
Federal Rules of Evidence and comparable state rules of evidence. Except as
may be required by applicable Law or court order, the Parties agree to
maintain confidentiality as to all aspects of any proceeding before
the Independent Auditor, including its existence and results, except that
nothing herein shall prevent any Party from disclosing information regarding
such proceeding to a court of competent jurisdiction for purposes of enforcing
this _Section 2.10(c)_ or the Independent Auditors final determination. The
Independent Auditor shall be bound by a mutually agreeable confidentiality
agreement, which shall preserve the confidentiality of any proceeding before
the Independent Auditor. The procedures of this _Section_ __ _ 2.10_ are
exclusive and, except as set forth below, the determination of the Independent
Auditor shall be final and binding on the Parties. The decision rendered
pursuant to this  _Section _ _2.10(c)_ may be entered as a judgment in any
court of competent jurisdiction. Either Parent or Buyer may seek specific
enforcement or take other necessary legal action to enforce any decision under
this _Section _ _2.10(c)_. The only defense of either Parent or Buyer to such
a request for specific enforcement or other legal action shall be fraud by or
upon the Independent Auditor or manifest error. Absent such fraud or manifest
error, Parent or Buyer, as applicable, shall reimburse the Party seeking
enforcement for its expenses related to such enforcement.

 



33 (d) The rights of the Selling Entities under this  _Section_ __ _ 2.10_ are
personal to the Selling Entities and notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, including the assignment provisions set forth in _Section_
__ _ 12.06_ ( _Successors and Assignment_ ), unless consented to in writing
by Buyer with reference to this _Section 2.10(d)_, no rights or interest of
the Selling Entities under this _Section_ __ _ 2.10_, including any rights to
receive any Earn-Out Amount pursuant to this Agreement, may be sold, assigned,
transferred, pledged, encumbered, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of, in
whole or in part by the Selling Entities (other than by operation of law) to
any Person and any attempted assignment, transfer or disposition shall be null
and void.

(e) The Parties acknowledge that the Earn-Out Amounts have been negotiated by
the Parties based on their inability to agree as to the valuation of the
Business as of the Closing Date. Unless otherwise required by applicable Law
or a Governmental Authority, all payments made pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
2.10_ shall be made directly to the applicable Selling Entity and any such
payments received by a Selling Entity from Buyer pursuant to this  _Section_
__ _ 2.10_ shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price. The
Parties shall use reasonable efforts to ensure that any requirement that may
apply in order for any such payment to be treated as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price under applicable Law be satisfied.

(f) Upon written notice to Parent specifying in reasonable detail the basis
therefor, Buyer shall have the right to withhold and set off against any Earn-
Out Amount due and payable pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.10_ any amount

__ _ XI_ ( _Indemnification_ ) as determined by a final judicial
determination in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 12.13_ (or other dispute
resolution mechanism agreed to in writing by Buyer and the Sellers). Neither
the exercise of, nor the failure to exercise, such right of setoff will
constitute an election of remedies or limit Buyer in any manner in the
enforcement of any other remedies that may be available to it under this
Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements.

and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) utilized by Buyer are reasonably designed
to ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to
be disclosed by Buyer in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that all such
information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to the
management of Buyer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure
and to enable the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of
Buyer to make the certifications required under the Exchange Act with respect
to such reports.

 

(h) Neither Buyer nor any of the Subsidiaries of Buyer is a party to, or has
any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among Buyer and any of
its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate,

"significant deficiency" and "material weakness" will have the meanings
assigned to them in Auditing Standard No. 5 of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board, as in effect on the date of this Agreement. As of the date
hereof, there is no reason to believe that Buyers outside auditors, chief
executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give the

deposited, used or processed from or by Buyer or its Subsidiaries, which
Release or presence has resulted in, or would reasonably be expected to
result in, any Liability to or other obligations of, or interfere with any
operations of, Buyer or its Subsidiaries.

 

4.12 _Financing_. Buyer will, on the Closing Date, have available sufficient
funds, directly or through one or more Affiliates, to pay the full Cash

all related fees and expenses of Buyer associated with the
transactions contemplated hereby.

4.13 _No Buyer Material Adverse Effect_. Except for the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and as set forth on _Section_ __ _ 4.13 of

Shares, the Subsidiary Shares or any interest therein. Buyer has
sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and business matters to be
capable of evaluating the merits and risks of their investment in the HoldCo
Shares, the Shares and the Subsidiary Shares, and Buyer is capable of bearing
the economic risks of such investment, including a complete loss of its
investment in the HoldCo Shares, the Shares and the Subsidiary Shares. Buyer

(iv) The Sellers shall be responsible for arranging the payment or
satisfaction of any Shared Transaction Taxes, Brazil Rural Property
Restructuring Transaction Taxes and Argentina Rural Property Restructuring
Transaction Taxes to the relevant Tax Authority. Parent shall provide written
notice of such payment or satisfaction to Buyer, which shall include the
amount of Shared Transaction Taxes, Brazil Rural Property Restructuring
Transaction Taxes and Argentina Rural Property Restructuring Transaction Taxes
paid or otherwise satisfied. Within ten (10) days after receiving such notice,
Buyer shall pay and deliver to the applicable Selling Entity an amount equal
to fifty percent (50%) of the Shared Transaction Taxes, Brazil Rural Property
Restructuring Transaction Taxes and Argentina Rural Property Restructuring
Transaction Taxes shown on such notice in cash in U.S. dollars, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated
by Parent in such notice.

 

(v) For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent any Transaction Taxes are
satisfied or reduced by the use of any Tax or accounting credit, refund or
loss or similar Tax or accounting attribute (including any assets for
Brazilian CFC purposes) to which either (i) in the case of any Transaction
Taxes other than Argentina Rural Property Restructuring Transaction Taxes,
the Sellers or any of their Affiliates (other than the Company Group) are
entitled, or (ii) in the case of any Argentina Rural Property Restructuring
Transaction Taxes, the Sellers or any of their Affiliates (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, PRC, but excluding any other member of the Company Group)
are entitled, as of the date that such Transaction Taxes are incurred
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Transaction Taxes that would have
been imposed but are not in fact imposed due to the use of such an
attribute), such Transaction Taxes shall be deemed to have been paid by the
Sellers in satisfaction of their obligations under this _Section 6.01(a)_.

 



103 (vi) Buyer and the Sellers agree to cooperate and assist in any efforts
to minimize, or secure any available exemptions from, any such Taxes referred
to in this _Section 6.01(a)_.

(vii) For the avoidance of doubt, upon the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 10.01_ (other than upon the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with _Section 10.01(e)_ or _Section 10.01(f)_ )
Buyer shall promptly upon request by the Sellers, reimburse the Sellers for
all Transaction Taxes for which Buyer is liable pursuant to this _Section
6.01(a)_.

 

(b) The Sellers shall be responsible for any Taxes of the Company Group
arising with respect to any taxable periods or portions thereof ending on or
before the Closing Date (the " _Pre_ _-Closing Tax Period_") except for any
Tax liabilities (other than deferred Tax liabilities) to the extent such Tax
liabilities were reserved for or reflected in the Financial Statements or the
Carve-Out Financial Statements. Buyer shall be responsible for any Taxes
arising with respect to any taxable periods or portions thereof beginning on
or after the day immediately after the Closing Date (the " _Post_ _-Closing
Tax Period_"). With respect to any taxable period beginning on or before the
Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date (such period, the " _Straddle
Period_ "), (i) for Taxes imposed on a periodic basis (such as property
taxes), the portion of the Tax allocated to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall
be the amount of such Taxes for the entire period (or, in the case of such
Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the
immediately preceding period) _multiplied by_ a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of calendar days in the Straddle Period ending on and
including the Closing Date (such period, the " _Pre_ _-Closing_ ___Straddle
Period_ "), and the denominator of which is the total number of calendar days
in the Straddle Period, and the balance shall be allocated to the Post-Closing
Tax Period, and (ii) for income or similar Taxes and other Taxes not described
in (i) above, the portion of the Tax allocated to the Pre-Closing Tax Period
shall be determined by assuming that the Straddle Period consisted of two
taxable years or periods, one of which ended at the close of business on
the last day of the Pre-Closing Straddle Period and the other one of which
began at the beginning of the day immediately after the Closing Date and ended
at the close of business on the last day of the Straddle Period (such period,
the " _Post_ _-Closing Straddle Period_"), and items of income, gain,
deduction, loss or credit of the Company Group for the Straddle Period shall
be allocated between such two taxable years or periods on a "closing of the
books basis" by assuming that the books of the Company Group were closed at
the close of business on the Closing Date, _provided_ , _however_ , that any
activities or operations of the Company Group outside the Ordinary Course on
the Closing Date but following the Closing shall be allocated to the Post-
Closing Straddle Period. For purposes of clause (ii) of the preceding
sentence, any exemption, deduction, credit or other item that is calculated on
an annual basis shall be allocated between the Pre-Closing Straddle Period and
the Post-Closing Straddle Period on a _pro rata_ basis determined by
allocating to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period a portion of such amount equal
to the product of such amount and a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of calendar days in the Pre-Closing Straddle Period, and the
denominator of which is the total number of calendar days in the Straddle
Period, and allocating the balance of such amount to the Post-Closing
Straddle Period. In the case of any Tax based upon or measured by capital
(including net worth or long-term debt) or

 



104  intangibles, any amount thereof required to be allocated to a Pre-Closing
Straddle Period under this _Section_ __ _ 6.01(b)_ shall be computed by
reference to the level of such items on the Closing Date.

6.02 _Preparation of Tax Returns and Payment of Taxes_.

 

(a) _Pre_ _-Closing Returns_. In the case of Tax Returns that are required
to be filed with any Tax Authority on or before the Closing Date, the Sellers
shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) such Tax Returns in a manner
consistent with past practice, except as otherwise required by applicable Law.
In the case of Tax Returns that are required to be filed with any Tax
Authority after the Closing Date with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period
(other than a Straddle Period), the Company Group shall prepare (or cause to
be prepared) such Tax Returns under the direction and supervision of the
Sellers, in a manner consistent with past practice, except as otherwise
required by applicable Law. The Sellers shall deliver any such Tax Return to
Buyer for its review (i) in the case of annual income Tax Returns, at least
forty-five (45) days prior to the date such Tax Return is required to be
filed, (ii) in the case of Tax Returns required to be filed on a monthly basis
or more frequently, at least ten (10) days prior to the date such Tax Return
is required to be filed and (iii) in the case of other Tax Returns, at least
thirty (30) days prior to the date such Tax Return is required to be filed and
consider Buyers comments to such Tax Returns in good faith. In the case of
any such Tax Returns referred to in this _Section 6.02(a)_ , all Taxes
indicated as due and payable on such returns shall be the responsibility of
the Sellers and shall be paid or will be paid by the Sellers as and when
required by applicable Law. Such Tax Returns shall be true, correct and
complete in all material respects and accurately set forth all items to the
extent required to be reflected or included in such Tax Returns by
applicable Law.

(b) _P_ _ost-Closing Returns_. Subject to _Section 6.02(c)_ , Buyer shall
prepare or shall cause to be prepared all Tax Returns for Post-Closing Tax
Periods required by applicable Law to be filed by the Company Group after the
Closing Date and shall be responsible for the timely filing (taking into
account any extensions received from the relevant tax authorities) of all
such Tax Returns, it being understood that all Taxes indicated as due and
payable on such returns shall be the responsibility of Buyer and shall be paid
or will be paid by Buyer as when required by Law.

(c) In the case of Tax Returns of any member of the Company Group filed with
respect to a Straddle Period or in respect of Transaction Taxes, Buyer shall
prepare (or cause to be prepared) such Tax Returns in a manner consistent with
past practice, except as otherwise required by applicable Law, and shall
deliver any such Tax Return and any reasonably requested supporting Tax
records or information related to the preparation of such Tax Returns to the
Sellers for their review (i) in the case of annual income Tax Returns, at
least forty-five (45) days prior to the date such Tax Return is required to
be filed, (ii) in the case of Tax Returns required to be filed on a monthly
basis or more frequently, at least ten (10) days prior to the date such Tax
Return is required to be filed and (iii) in the case of other Tax Returns, at
least thirty (30) days prior to the date such Tax Return is required to be
filed. Buyer shall consider the Sellers comments to such Tax Returns in good
faith. If the Sellers dispute any item on such Tax Return, 

 



105  Parent shall notify Buyer of such disputed item (or items) and the basis for
their objection. Buyer shall incorporate any reasonable comments made by the
Sellers in the Tax Return actually filed;  _provided_ , _however_ , that if
Buyer and the Sellers cannot reach an agreement with respect to a position in
a Tax Return for a Straddle Period or Transaction Taxes, the matter shall be
resolved in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 6.04_.

6.03 _Cooperation_. After the Closing Date, each of Buyer and the Sellers
shall make available to the other Party and its representatives such records
and information as such Party may reasonably request for the preparation of
any Tax Returns or other similar governmental reports that are required to be
filed by such Party or for future Tax planning analysis, as well as such
additional records as such Party may reasonably require for the defense of any
audit, examination, administrative appeal or litigation concerning any such
Tax Return or other similar governmental report or form, including executing
and delivering such powers of attorney and other documents as are necessary to
carry out the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.03_. Any information
obtained under this  _Section_ __ _ 6.03_ shall be kept confidential except
(i) as may be otherwise necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns
or claims for refund or in conducting an audit or other proceeding or
defending any Tax claim or (ii) with the consent of the Sellers or Buyer, as
the case may be. Buyer shall make available to the Sellers such Tax Returns
and information as reasonably required by the Sellers to comply with its
obligations under this Agreement. 

6.04 _Tax Matter Dispute_. If, after negotiating in good faith, Buyer and the
Sellers are unable to reach an agreement relating to any Tax matter under
_Article_ __ _ VI_, the dispute shall be submitted to an internationally
recognized accounting firm or law firm (the " _Independent Tax Professional_
"). The Independent Tax Professional shall be bound by a mutually agreeable
confidentiality agreement. The procedures of this _Section_ __ _ 6.04_ are
exclusive and, except as set forth below, the determination of the Independent
Tax Professional shall be final and binding on the Parties. The decision
rendered pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.04_ may be entered as a judgment
in any court of competent jurisdiction. Either Party may seek specific
enforcement or take other necessary legal action to enforce any decision
under this _Section_ __ _ 6.04_. The other Partys only defense to such a
request for specific enforcement or other legal action shall be fraud by or
upon the Independent Tax Professional or manifest error. Absent such fraud or
manifest error, such other Party shall reimburse the Party seeking enforcement
for its expenses related to such enforcement.

 

6.05 _Contests_.

 

(a) Buyer shall give written notice to the Sellers of the existence of any Tax
audit, court proceeding or other dispute with respect to any Tax matter that
affects the Company Group (each such Tax audit, court proceeding or other
dispute, a " _Contest_ ") relating to Taxes that are or may be the Sellers
responsibility under this Agreement (including any Pre-Closing Taxes and any
Transaction Taxes) within ten (10) days from the receipt by Buyer of any
written notice of such Contest ( _provided_ , _however_ , that if Buyer has a
period of fewer than thirty (30) days under applicable Law to respond to such
notice, Buyer shall provide written notice to the Sellers within the first one
third (1/3rd) of such period having elapsed), but no failure to give such
notice shall relieve the Sellers of any liability hereunder unless and to the
extent (if any) that, in the Sellers reasonable

 



106  judgment, such failure actually prejudices the economic, financial or legal
rights of the Sellers with respect to such claim. Buyer shall attach with such
notice all information and documentation reasonably necessary to evaluate
such claim.

(b) _Control of Contest_.

 

(i) The Sellers shall, at their election, have the right to represent a
Company Group members interests in any Contest relating to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period, employ counsel of its choice at its expense and control the conduct of
such Contest. The Sellers shall have the right to settle or dispose of any
such Contest. The Sellers shall provide notice to Buyer of any such Contest
to the extent reasonably practicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the
extent any Contest relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period relates to Taxes
which pursuant to this Agreement are the responsibility of Buyer, Buyer and
the Sellers shall jointly represent their interests in such Contest, shall
employ counsel of their mutual choice and shall cooperate with the other and
the others representatives in a prompt and timely manner in connection with
any such Contest. The Parties shall mutually agree on any settlement or other
disposition of the Contest.

 

(ii) In the case of any Contest with respect to a Transaction Tax for which
both Buyer and Sellers are equally liable pursuant to _Section_ _6.01(a)_ ,
or a Straddle Period, Buyer and the Sellers shall jointly represent their
interests in any Contest, shall employ counsel of their mutual choice and
shall cooperate with the other and the others representatives in a prompt
and timely manner in connection with any such Contest. The Parties shall
mutually agree on any settlement or other disposition of the Contest. In the
event Buyer and the Sellers are unable to agree regarding any aspect of the
conduct of any such Contest, the decision shall be made by the counsel
employed to pursue such Contest on the basis of counsels good faith judgment
regarding the course of action that would produce the overall lowest present
value of Tax and litigation cost to the Parties. Any such Contest expenses
shall be borne by Buyer and the Sellers in the same proportion as such related
Taxes are borne by Buyer and the Sellers in accordance with _Section_ __ _
6.01_ and  _Section_ __ _ 6.02_.

(iii) Buyer shall have the right to control the conduct of any other Contest
in its sole discretion with respect to any other Tax matter not covered in
clause (i) or clause (ii) above.

6.06 _Tax Refunds_.

(a) Any Tax refunds that are received by any Company Group member and any
amounts credited against Tax to which a Company Group member becomes entitled
that relate to any Taxes for which the Sellers are liable pursuant to _Section
6.01(a)_ , shall be for the account of the Sellers.

 

(b) Subject to _Section 6.06(d)_ , any other Tax refunds and any other amount
credited against Tax to which Buyer or the Sellers or any of their respective
Affiliates become entitled or that relates to Taxes for which Buyer is liable
pursuant to _Section 6.01(a)_ shall be for the account of Buyer and the
Company Group.

 



107 (c) Subject to _Section 6.06(d)_ , each Party shall pay over to the
other Party any cash refund required to be paid pursuant to this _Section_ __
_ 6.06_ within ten (10) days after the receipt thereof or, in the case of Tax
savings realized by a Party pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 6.06_, at the
time the Tax Return to which such credit relates is filed by the Party
responsible for the filing of such Tax Return.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section_ __ _
6.06_, the amount of any cash Tax refunds that are actually received by Buyer
or any member of the Company Group (net of any costs, including Taxes,
incurred by Buyer or such member of the Company Group in connection with the
receipt thereof) that directly result from a final resolution of the items
set forth on _Section_ _6.06(d) of the Sellers Disclosure Schedules_ (which
may be amended after the date hereof and until the Closing Date by the Sellers
to add additional items, but only to the extent that such items are the
subject of an administrative or judicial proceeding initiated prior to the
Closing Date) shall be for the account of the Sellers, but only to the extent
that such amount of cash Tax refunds were not reserved for or reflected in
the Financial Statements. Buyer shall pay to the Sellers any such amounts
within ten (10) days after receipt thereof. The Sellers, at their sole cost
and expense, shall have the right to represent the interests of the members of
the Company Group with respect to such items, and the Sellers shall control
any proceedings related to such items, in each case, consistent with and
subject to the obligations and limitations set forth in _Sections 6.02(a)_ and
_Section 6.05(b)_ herein. Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
deliver to the Sellers any information or communication relating to such items
received by Buyer from the relevant Brazilian Tax Authorities.

 

6.07 _Treatment of Payments_. Unless otherwise required by applicable Law or a
Governmental Authority, all payments made pursuant to this  _Article_ __ _
VI_ shall be made directly to Buyer or the Sellers (or the relevant Selling
Entity), as applicable, and any such payments shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price. The Parties shall use reasonable efforts to
ensure that any requirement that may apply in order for a payment to be
treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price under applicable Law is
satisfied.

 

6.08 _FIRPTA_. For so long as either Seller or any of its Affiliates owns any
Buyer Shares, if and when requested in writing by Parent, Buyer will provide
a statement to Parent (or, upon the direction of Parent, another Person) and
notice to the IRS to the extent required by Section 1.897-2(h) of the Treasury
Regulations, informing the Sellers whether Buyer is a "United States real
property holding corporation" within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the
Code.

6.09  _Purchase Price Allocation_. The portion of the Estimated Cash Purchase
Price allocable to each Subsidiary Seller shall be mutually agreed upon by
Parent and Buyer no later than seventy (70) days prior to the expected Closing
Date. The remainder of the Estimated Cash Purchase Price and the Buyer Shares
shall be allocated to each Seller in proportion to its respective interest in
the Company which in the case of (a) Parent, will be the percentage of the 

 



108  total issued and outstanding capital stock of the Company represented by the
Shares and (b) HoldCo Seller, will be the percentage of the total issued and
outstanding stock of the Company owned by HoldCo (in each case excluding the
capital stock of the Company held in treasury by the Company, if any, such
that the aggregate percentage represented by the foregoing clauses (a) and (b)
shall be 100%), it being understood that the above proportion shall determine
only the aggregate value to be allocated to each Seller and that Parent shall
determine in its sole discretion (but subject to the above proportion) the
number of Buyer Shares allocable to each Seller. Unless otherwise required by
applicable Law, the Purchase Price shall be allocated among the Selling
Entities in the Closing Statement in a manner that is consistent with the
allocation in the Closing Estimates Statement.

 

6.10 _Judicial Deposits_. For the avoidance of doubt, refunds for any matters
concerning judicial deposits (including judicial deposits related to Taxes)
shall be governed exclusively by _Section_ __ _ 11.11_ and not by this
_Article_ __ _ VI_.

 

ARTICLE VII __

 

 _EMPLOYEES AND BENEFIT PLANS_

 

7.01 _Transfer of Employment_. Prior to the Closing and subject to _Sections

and the terms of any collective bargaining agreement, compensation and
employee benefits that are in the aggregate, substantially comparable to the
compensation and benefits being provided to either, in Buyers sole
discretion, Business Employees as of the date of this Agreement or similarly
situated employees of Buyer (in each case, without regard to any stock or
equity-based compensation plans or programs or any change in control,
retention or severance benefits that are being provided to Business Employees
as of the date of this Agreement); _provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to
applicable Law or the terms of any collective bargaining agreement, Buyer, in
its sole discretion, may provide such compensation and employee benefits to
Continuing Employees under any of the Company Groups Employee Plans or
Buyers or any of its Affiliates employee benefit plans.

shall enter into, or cause a member of the Company Group to enter into, or
permit Buyer to enter into, retention agreements provided by Buyer with such
Business Employees prior to the Closing (the " _Retention Program_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that such Retention Program shall provide that in the
event the Closing does not occur, such retention

 



109  agreements shall be null and void and no payments or benefits will be due
under the Retention Program. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall be solely
responsible for all costs, expenses and other Liabilities or Losses resulting
from or arising in connection with the Retention Program.

7.04 _Pension Plans_.

 

(a) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Sellers shall cause the
Company to continue the sponsorship removal process with respect to the
Petros Pension Plan (the " _Sponsorship Removal_ ") and to use reasonable best
efforts to complete the Sponsorship Removal. In the event the Sponsorship
Removal is not completed prior to the Closing, Buyer shall take all actions
necessary to permit the Sellers to continue to act as the attorney-in-fact for
the Company with respect to such Sponsorship Removal continuing after
the Closing Date and the Sellers shall continue to act as the attorney-in-
fact for the Company with respect to the Sponsorship Removal. The Sellers
shall keep Buyer informed on a reasonably timely basis as to all material
actions relating to the Sponsorship Removal of which the Sellers are aware,
including the contents of any material substantive communications regarding
the Sponsorship Removal between the Sellers and any Third Parties related to
the Sponsorship Removal; _provided_ , that notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the Sellers shall not be required to inform Buyer
of any matter (including the contents of any communications) if doing so
would, in the Sellers reasonable judgment, (i) jeopardize any attorney client
or other legal privilege or immunity or protection from disclosure, (ii)
violate any Contract or contravene any applicable Law or fiduciary
duty (provided, however, that upon Buyers request, the Sellers shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Buyer to put in place
arrangements to permit such disclosure without violating such Contracts or
contravening such Laws or fiduciary duties) or (iii) result in the disclosure
of competitively sensitive information.

(b) The Parties agree that the participation of all the Cubatao Employees in
the Company Pension Plans shall be deemed terminated effective as of the
transfer of their employment pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.06_.

cause a member of the Company Group and/or Valia to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) approve and initiate (or cause to be approved and
initiated), to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (A) the demerger of the
Vale Mais Pension Plan and the funds (assets and liabilities) of the Company
(the " _Demerged Pension Plan_ ") to a new pension plan managed by Valia,
which will be created to receive the Demerged Pension Plan and (B) the
transfer of the management of the Demerged Pension Plan from Valia to Itau
Fundo Multipatrocinado, ( _provided_ that the Parties agree that the Sellers
shall not be deemed to have breached this covenant solely because of the
failure to obtain the consent of Itau Fundo Multipatrocinado to
such transfer, and _provided_ , _further_ , that if such transfer has not
been completed as of the Closing, Buyer shall be responsible for its
completion and the Sellers shall have no further obligation with respect
thereto other than to transfer the appropriate assets and liabilities to
Buyer) and (ii) obtain approval from the Governmental Authorities, including
PREVIC, required to facilitate the actions set forth

 



110  in clause (i). The Parties acknowledge that any actions taken pursuant to
this _Section 7.04(c)_ that impact the rights of participants in the Vale Mais
Pension Plan shall only be fully effective upon PREVICs authorization and
that the Sellers shall not be deemed to have breached this covenant solely
because of the failure to obtain such authorization. Buyer shall (i) promptly
upon request by the Sellers, reimburse the Sellers for all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses of the Sellers and their respective
Affiliates (including, prior to the Closing, the Company Group) and all
reasonable and documented fees and expenses of their outside representatives
incurred in connection with this _Section 7.04(c)_ , and (ii) indemnify and
hold harmless the Sellers and their respective Affiliates (including, prior

Liability, judgment, award, penalty, fine, Tax, cost (including cost of
investigation), expense (including reasonable fees and expenses of outside

(including costs of investigation) or settlement payments incurred by the
Sellers or their respective Affiliates (including, prior to the Closing, the
Company Group) pursuant to this last sentence of _Section 7.04(c)_ shall
constitute Transaction Expenses for any purpose hereunder).

 

(d) Following the date hereof, the Sellers shall, or shall cause each member
of the Company Group to, use reasonable best efforts to cause each new hire
who is a Business Employee and entitled to participate in a Company Pension
Plan to enter into the Vale Mais Pension Plan. After the approval of the
Demerged Pension Plan and the management transfer processes by PREVIC, such
new employees will be entitled to enter the Demerged Pension Plan managed by
Itau Fundo Multipatrocinado.

their respective Subsidiaries;

 

(f) any Liabilities of the Company Group resulting from (i) the employment and

of the following, without duplication:

satisfied.

 

(b) Except in the case of a breach or inaccuracy of any Anti-Bribery Rep, Tax

aggregate Losses incurred by all Buyer Indemnified Persons or Seller
Indemnified

 



125  Persons, as applicable, thereunder exceed $25,000,000 (the " _Deductible_
"), in which case, any Indemnified Person will be entitled to make a claim
against the Indemnifying Person for any Losses in excess of the Deductible

made by the Sellers), _Section 11.02(g)_ and _Section 11.02(h)_ and (ii) Buyer
to any Seller Indemnified Person under  _Section_ __ _ 11.03(a)_ (other than

inaccuracies of the Tax Reps and the Fundamental Reps made by Buyer) shall be

(g) The maximum aggregate liability (i) of the Sellers to any Buyer

(h) For the avoidance of doubt, there shall be no limit on the amount of
liability of the Sellers or Buyer, as applicable, under this _Article_ __ _
XI_:

(i) of the Sellers to any Buyer Indemnified Person under (A)
_Section 11.02(a)_ for any breaches or inaccuracies of the Fundamental Reps
made by the Sellers, (B) _Section 11.02(b)_, (C) _Section 11.02(c)(iv)_ ,
(D) _Section_ __ _ 11.02(d)_, (E)  _Section_ __ _ 11.02(e)_, (F) _Section
11.02(f)_ and (G) _Section 11.02(i)_ ; and

(ii) of Buyer to any Seller Indemnified Person under (A) _ Section_ __ _
11.03(a)_ for any breaches or inaccuracies of the Fundamental Reps made by
Buyer, (B) _Section 11.03(b)_, (C) _Section 11.03(d)_ , (D)  _Section
11.03(e)_ and (E) _Section 11.03(f)_.

 



126 (i) For purposes of applying the post-Closing indemnification remedies
provided in this _Article_ __ _ XI_, when (i) determining whether any breach
or inaccuracy of a representation or warranty in this Agreement made by the
Sellers or Buyer, as applicable, in this Agreement has occurred and (ii)
calculating the amount of any Losses relating thereto, in each case, the
representations and warranties made by the Indemnifying Person in this
Agreement shall be considered and applied without regard to any reference as
to materiality, Company Material Adverse Effect, Buyer Material Adverse Effect
or similar materiality qualifications set forth therein; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the foregoing shall not apply to (A) the terms "Material
Contract," "Material Customer," "Material Supplier" or "material weakness" or
(B) any representation or warranty set forth in (1) the last sentence of 
_Section 3.06(a)_ , (2) the last sentence of _Section 3.06(b)_ , (3) the last
sentence of _Section 3.06(c)_ , (4) _Section 3.10(b)_ , (5) _Section 3.12(l)_
, (6) _Section 3.15(a)_ , (7) the first sentence of _Section 3.15(b)_ (8)
_Section 3.17(a)_ , (9) _Section_ __ _ 3.20_, (10) the first sentence of
_Section_ __ _ 3.24_, (11) _Section 4.08(b)(ii)_ , (12) Section 4.08(b) _(z)_
or (13) _Section 4.13_; _provided_ , _further_ , that this _Section_ __ _
11.04(i)_ shall in no respect modify the other provisions of this Agreement
for purposes of determining whether any conditions set forth in _Article_ __
_ VIII_ have been satisfied.

(j) The amount for which the Indemnifying Person shall be liable with respect
to any Loss incurred by any Indemnified Person shall be reduced (i) to the
extent that such Indemnified Person shall theretofore have actually realized
any proceeds (net of any costs or expenses expended by such
Indemnified Person in seeking such proceeds, including the present value of
any increases in insurance premiums) recovered from Third Parties (including
insurers) with respect to such Loss or any of the events, conditions, facts or
circumstances resulting in such Loss and (ii) by the amount of any net Tax
Benefit realized by such Indemnified Person ( _provided_ , _however_ , that
such Tax Benefit is actually recognized in the tax year prior to or in which
the Loss is incurred). If an Indemnified Person shall have received or shall
have had paid on its behalf an indemnity payment with respect to a Loss
pursuant to this _Article_ __ _ XI_ and shall subsequently receive, directly
or indirectly, such proceeds, then such Indemnified Person shall promptly
(and in any event within five (5) Business Days after receipt of such
proceeds) pay to the Indemnifying Person the net amount of such proceeds or,
if less, the amount of the indemnity payment that such Indemnified Person has
received or has had paid on its behalf pursuant to this _Article_ __ _ XI_.
The Indemnified Person shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
recover under insurance policies or indemnity, contribution or other similar
agreements other than this Agreement for any Losses to the same extent such
Party would if such Losses were not subject to indemnification, compensation
or reimbursement hereunder. No Buyer Indemnified Person shall be entitled to
be indemnified, defended or held harmless pursuant to _Section 11.02(g)_ or

 



127   _Section 11.02(h)_ from or against any Losses that would otherwise be
indemnifiable pursuant to _Section 11.02(g)_ or _Section 11.02(h)_ to the
extent such Losses arise out of Buyers or any of its Affiliates (including,
following the Closing, the Company Groups) (i) failure to perform and comply
in all respects with their respective covenants, obligations and agreements
contained in, or (ii) negligence or willful misconduct with respect to the
matters contemplated by, _Section_ __ _ 5.36_.

 

(k) An Indemnified Person shall be deemed to recognize a " _Tax Benefit_ "
with respect to a taxable year only if, and to the extent that, such
Indemnified Persons liability for income Taxes in such taxable year,
calculated by excluding any Tax deductions or Tax credits attributable to the
Loss with respect to which it has been indemnified, exceeds the Indemnified
Persons actual liability for income Taxes in such taxable year. In addition
to, but without duplication of, the foregoing, if (A) an Indemnified Person
actually receives a payment hereunder from an Indemnifying Person
with respect to any Loss incurred by such Indemnified Person related to the
imposition of Brazilian VAT, PIS and COFINS and/or ICMS Taxes, (B) such Tax
gives rise to a Brazilian Tax credit that is actually received by such
Indemnified Person and (C) such Brazilian Tax credit is actually utilized by
such Indemnified Person no later than twelve (12) months after such credit is
received by such Indemnified Person, then such Indemnified Person shall pay to
such Indemnifying Person an amount equal to the amount of such credit that is
so utilized. Such Indemnified Person hereby agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts to actually use any such Brazilian Tax credits within such
twelve (12) month period. With respect to such Brazilian Tax credits, no
later than thirty (30) days after the expiration of the applicable twelve (12)
month period, such Indemnified Person shall deliver to such Indemnifying
Person a certificate (each such certificate a " _Tax Benefit Certificate_ ")
stating the amount of such Brazilian Tax credits that were not used along with
supporting evidence to that effect in a form reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnifying Party. Any dispute regarding a Tax Benefit Certificate shall be
resolved in accordance with the procedures described in _Section_ __ _ 6.04_.

 

(l) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in no event shall any
Indemnifying Person be required to indemnify, defend, hold harmless, pay or
reimburse any Indemnified Person for Losses under this _Article_ __ _ XI_ to
the extent that such Losses were taken into account to calculate the
adjustments to the Purchase Price pursuant to  _Section 2.04(a)_.

(m) Other than as expressly set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.10_, no
Indemnifying Person (nor its Affiliates) shall have any right to set off any
payment due under this Agreement or any other agreement by or among Buyer and
the Sellers (or their respective Affiliates) against any other payments to be
made pursuant to this Agreement, any such other agreement or otherwise.

(n) Any Losses subject to indemnification hereunder shall be
determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts
giving rise to such Losses.

11.05 _Third Party Claims_. Except with respect to Tax matters (which are
subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.05_), as soon as is reasonably practicable after
becoming aware of a Third Party Claim

 



128  with respect to which indemnity may be claimed pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, the Indemnified Person shall promptly give notice to the
Indemnifying Person of such claim or the commencement of any such Third Party
Claim (such notice, the " _Claim Notice_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the
failure of such Indemnified Person to give prompt Claim Notice shall not
relieve any Indemnifying Person of its obligations under this _Article_ __ _
XI_, unless and to the extent (if any) that such failure actually prejudices
the Indemnifying Person.

 

11.06 _Assumption of Defense_. Except with respect to Tax matters (which for
all purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 11.06_ are subject to _Section_ __ _
6.05_), the Petros Pension Plan Litigation (which for all purposes of this
_Section_ __ _ 11.06_ is subject to _Section_ __ _ 11.13_) and any
Cubatao Litigation relating primarily to the Cubatao Business (which for all
purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 11.06_ is subject to _Section_ __ _ 11.14_),
the Indemnifying Person may, at its own expense, (i) participate in the
defense of any Third Party Claim or (ii) by giving written notice to the
Indemnified Person as promptly as reasonably practicable after receipt of the
Claim Notice (and in any event within fifteen (15) Business Days of receipt
of such Claim Notice), assume the defense thereof if, in the case of this
clause (ii), (A) the Indemnifying Persons counsel is reasonably satisfactory
to the Indemnified Person; (B) the Indemnifying Person shall
thereafter consult with and update the Indemnified Person and make all
pertinent information under its control related to such Third Party Claim
available to the Indemnified Person on a reasonably prompt basis; and (C) the
Third Party Claim involves only monetary damages and is not a criminal or
quasi-criminal Action and does not seek any material injunction or other
material equitable relief against any Indemnified Person. Except with respect
to the Petros Pension Plan Litigation which is subject to _Section_ __ _
11.13_, if the Indemnifying Person assumes such defense, the Indemnified
Person shall have the right (but not the obligation) to participate in the
defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the
counsel employed by the Indemnifying Person (other than any fees and expenses
of such separate counsel that are incurred between the date the Indemnified
Person provides the Indemnifying Person with the Claim Notice and the date
the Indemnifying Person effectively assumes control of such defense, which
fees and expenses, shall, notwithstanding the foregoing but subject to the
limitations set forth in this  _Article_ __ _ XI_, be borne by the
Indemnifying Person to the extent the underlying matter is determined to be
subject to indemnification pursuant to this _Article_ __ _ XI_); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Indemnified Person may hire separate counsel, and the
reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel shall be borne by the
Indemnifying Person if (x) the Indemnifying Person fails to actively and
diligently conduct the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified
Person has notified the Indemnifying Person of such failure and the
Indemnifying Person does not cure such failure within twenty (20) Business
Days following receipt of such notice, (y) upon reasonable advice of counsel
to the Indemnified Person that a conflict or potential conflict exists between
the Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying Person that would make such
separate representation advisable or (z) one or more defenses are
available to the Indemnified Person that are not available to the
Indemnifying Person. Whether or not the Indemnifying Person chooses to defend
or prosecute any such Third Party Claim, all of the Parties shall reasonably
cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof.

11.07 _Settlement or Compromise_. Except with respect to Tax matters (which
for all purposes of this  _Section_ __ _ 11.07_ are subject to _Section_ __
_ 6.05_), the Petros Pension Plan Litigation (which for all purposes of this
_Section_ __ _ 11.07_ is subject to  _Section_ __ _ 11.13_) and any Cubatao
Litigation relating primarily to the Cubatao Business (which for all purposes
of this _Section 11.07_

 



129  is subject to _Section_ __ _ 11.14_), if the Indemnifying Person assumes
the defense of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Person shall not settle
such Third Party Claim unless the Indemnifying Person consents in writing. If
the Indemnified Person is conducting the defense of any Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Person shall not settle such Third Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnifying Person (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Indemnifying Person may
not enter into any settlement or compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment with respect to such Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Person, except if the proposed settlement,
compromise or judgment (i) includes an express, complete and unconditional
general release by the Third Party asserting the Third Party Claim of all
Indemnified Persons from all Liabilities in respect of such Third Party Claim
with prejudice, (ii) does not require any admission or finding of wrongdoing
on behalf of any Indemnified Person and (iii) does not impose any injunctive
or other equitable remedies or other obligation on any Indemnified Person
other than the payment of money damages for which each Indemnified Person will
be indemnified to the extent provided for hereunder (subject to the
limitations set forth in this  _Article_ __ _ XI_).

11.08 _Failure of Indemnifying Person to Act_. In the event that the
Indemnifying Person does not elect to assume the defense of any Third Party
Claim, then (a) any Indemnified Person shall (upon further notice to the
Indemnifying Person) have the right to undertake the defense of such Third
Party Claim (at the Indemnifying Persons expense); and (b) any failure of
the Indemnified Person to defend or to participate in the defense of any such
Third Party Claim shall not relieve the Indemnifying Person of its obligations
hereunder.

 

11.09 _Direct Claims_. As soon as is reasonably practicable after becoming
aware of a claim or Loss with respect to which indemnity may be claimed
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement that does not result from a Third
Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ "), the Indemnified Person shall promptly give
notice to the Indemnifying Person of such Direct Claim, which notice shall
include a description in reasonable detail of (a) the basis for and nature of
such Direct Claim (including the facts constituting the basis therefor and the
provisions of this Agreement implicated by such Direct Claim) and (b) a good-
faith estimate of the amount the Indemnified Person estimates that it is
entitled to receive hereunder with respect to such Direct Claim from the
Indemnifying Person; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure of the
Indemnified Person to give prompt notice shall not relieve any Indemnifying
Person of its obligations under this _Article_ __ _ XI_, unless and to the
extent (if any) such failure actually prejudices the Indemnifying Person. The
Indemnifying Person will have a period of forty-five (45) calendar days within
which to evaluate and respond in writing to any Direct Claim. If the
Indemnifying Person does not notify the Indemnified Person of its objection
to such Direct Claim within such forty-five (45) calendar-day period, the
Indemnifying Person shall be deemed to have accepted and agreed with such
Direct Claim. If the Indemnifying Person notifies the Indemnified Person of
its objection to such Direct Claim within such forty-five (45) calendar days,
the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall, during the sixty
(60) calendar days following receipt by the Indemnified Person of the
Indemnifying Persons objection notice, attempt to resolve their dispute with
respect to such Direct Claim. If the Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying
Person are unable to resolve their dispute with respect to such Direct Claim
within such sixty (60) calendar-day period, the Indemnified Person shall be
entitled to pursue such remedies as may be available to it under this
Agreement.

 



130 11.10 _Tax Treatment of Payment under Article_ __ _ XI_. Unless
otherwise required by applicable Law or a Governmental Authority, all
payments made pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 11.02_ shall be made directly to
Buyer and any such payments received by Buyer from any of the Sellers pursuant
to this  _Article_ __ _ XI_ shall be treated as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price. The Parties shall use reasonable efforts to ensure that any
requirement that may apply in order for a payment to be treated as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price under applicable Law is satisfied.

11.11 _Treatment of Judicial Deposits_.

 

(a) In the event that all or any portion of any judicial deposit deposited by
any member of the Company Group prior to the Closing to secure its
obligations and liabilities under any given Action (including any Action
related to Taxes or the Cubatao Business) where such Action may result in
Losses for which a Buyer Indemnified Person would be indemnified by
the Sellers pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 11.02_ is returned or refunded to any
member of the Company Group following the Closing, Buyer shall cause the
applicable member of the Company Group to promptly (and in any event within
ten (10) Business Days) remit the amount so returned or refunded (including
any interest thereon) to Parent or its designee.

 

(b) In the event that (i) a judicial deposit is deposited by any member of the
Company Group following the Closing, (ii) such judicial deposit constitutes a
Loss for which a Buyer Indemnified Person is indemnified by the Sellers
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 11.02_ and (iii) all or any portion of such
judicial deposit is subsequently returned or refunded to any member of the
Company Group, Buyer shall cause the applicable member of the Company Group to
promptly (and in any event within ten (10) Business Days) remit the amount so
returned or refunded (including any interest thereon) to Parent or its
designee; _provided_ , _however_ , that the aggregate amount of such
remittance shall not in any event exceed the aggregate indemnification payment
received by such Buyer Indemnified Person from the Sellers pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 11.02_.

(c) In the event that any Action resulting in Losses for which a
Buyer Indemnified Person has been indemnified by the Sellers pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 11.02_ shall be resolved in a manner that results in all or
any portion of any judicial deposit deposited by any member of the Company
Group being forfeited to any Governmental Authority or Third Party, such
forfeiture shall not be deemed to constitute a Loss for any purpose hereunder.

 

11.12 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except in the case of a Willful Breach and pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 2.08_ or  _Section_ __ _ 2.10_, Buyer and the Sellers
acknowledge and agree that, (i) following the Closing, the indemnification
provisions of this _Article_ __ _ XI_ shall be the sole and exclusive
remedies of the Indemnified Persons with respect to any and all Losses
arising from this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii)
except as set forth in, and without limiting the provisions of, this _Article_
__ _ XI_ and  _Section_ __ _ 12.15_ ( _Specific Performance_ ), following
the Closing neither the Sellers nor Buyer shall be liable or responsible in
any manner whatsoever (whether for indemnification or otherwise) to any
Indemnified Person for any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or
warranty of the Sellers or Buyer made in this Agreement or any breach,
nonfulfillment or default in the performance of any covenant or agreement of
the

 



131  Sellers or Buyer in this Agreement and (iii) anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, no breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of
the Sellers or Buyer made in this Agreement, or breach, nonfulfillment or
default in the performance of any covenant or agreement of the Sellers or
Buyer in this Agreement shall give rise to any right on the part of any
Indemnified Person, after the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, to rescind this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or to any further indemnification rights or monetary
claims of any nature whatsoever in respect thereof (whether by contract,
common law, Law or otherwise), all of which the Parties hereby waive. Nothing
in this _Section_ __ _ 11.12_ shall limit any Persons right to seek and
obtain any equitable relief to which such Person may be entitled pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 12.15_.

11.13 _Control of Petros Pension Plan Litigation_

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent shall,
at its own expense and with counsel selected by Parent in its sole
discretion, undertake to direct, prosecute and defend all Petros Pension Plan
Litigation on behalf of Buyer and the Company Group. After the Closing, the
Company Group and Buyer and its Subsidiaries shall provide Parent
such assistance as may reasonably be requested by Parent for the prosecution
or defense by Parent of all Petros Pension Plan Litigation, including by (i)
retaining and providing access to documents, personnel and records and (ii)
executing and delivering to Parent and its representatives powers of attorney
granting Parent and its representatives the power and authority through any
counsel selected by Parent to file claims and other court papers and to
actively initiate any Action against the Petros Pension Plan or its
administrator, in each case, on behalf of the Company Group in order to defend
Parents and the Company Groups interests and otherwise to allow Parent to
ensure the proper and adequate prosecution or defense of all Petros Pension
Plan Litigation; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Agreement shall
require Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Company Group) to file
any claims or other court papers or actively initiate any Action against the
Petros Pension Plan, its administrator or any other Person. After the Closing,
Parent shall keep the Company and Buyer reasonably apprised as to the status
of the litigation or any settlement negotiations with respect
thereto, including by providing notification to the Company and Buyer
regarding the receipt of any material notice or other substantive
communication with respect to any Petros Pension Plan Litigation and by
providing copies of court paper filings by any party, court orders, and
correspondence to or from any counterparty in such proceedings; _provided_ ,
that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Sellers
shall not be required to inform Buyer of any matter (including the receipt of
any communications) if doing so would, in the Sellers reasonable judgment,
(i) jeopardize any attorney client or other legal privilege or immunity or
protection from disclosure, (ii) violate any Contract or contravene
any applicable Law or fiduciary duty (provided, however, that upon Buyers
request, the Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate
with Buyer to put in place arrangements to permit such disclosure without
violating such Contracts or contravening such Laws or fiduciary duties) or
(iii) result in the disclosure of competitively sensitive information. After
the Closing, Buyer shall have the right (but not the obligation) to assist
Parent in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense,
separate from the counsel employed by the Parent; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that after the Closing, Buyer may hire separate counsel, and the reasonable
fees and expenses 

 



132  of such counsel shall be borne by Parent in addition to any other amounts
that the Buyer Indemnified Persons are entitled to receive from the Sellers
pursuant to _Section 11.02(d)_ if (x) Parent fails to actively and diligently
conduct the defense of any Petros Pension Plan Litigation, (y) Buyer has
notified Parent of such failure and (z) Parent does not cure such failure
within twenty (20) Business Days following receipt of such notice (at which
time Buyer may assume the defense of all Petros Pension Plan Litigation with
respect to itself and its Subsidiaries (including the Company Group) and
exercise all of its rights with respect thereto). In case of any disagreement
between Parent and Buyer in the assessment of, and regarding the strategy with
respect to, any Petros Pension Plan Litigation, Parent shall discuss such
disagreement with Buyer and consider Buyers views, assessments and comments
in good faith; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parents assessment and
determination regarding strategy with respect to such Petros Pension Plan
Litigation shall prevail.

 

(b) Parent shall have the right to settle or compromise or consent to the
entry of any judgment with respect to any Petros Pension Plan Litigation, on
behalf of Buyer and the Company Group and thereafter Buyer and the Company
Group shall cooperate with Parent to effect such actions; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, Parent may not enter into any settlement or compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment with respect thereto without the prior
written consent of Buyer, if the proposed settlement, compromise or judgment
(i) would result in restrictions on the operations of Buyer or the
Company Group (other than requirements that such Persons operate in
accordance with applicable Laws and de minimis procedural requirements), (ii)
would not expressly, unconditionally and completely release Buyer and the
Company Group (and their respective officers, directors, employees,
controlled Affiliates, agents or other representatives) from all Liabilities
with respect to such Petros Pension Plan Litigation (except for ongoing
obligations that would not violate clause (i) of this  _Section 11.13(b)_ and
requirements to make payments that Parent confirms in writing that Parent
shall promptly reimburse to Buyer), or (iii) would reasonably be expected to
materially and adversely affect the reputation of Buyer, or the Company Group
through an admission of wrongdoing by any such Person (such a settlement or
disposition that Parent shall have the right to effect without the consent of
Buyer, the " _Petros Settlement_ ").

 

11.14 _Cubat_ _a_ _o Litigation_ _._

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent shall,
at its own expense and with counsel selected by Parent in its sole
discretion, undertake to direct, prosecute and conduct all Cubatao Litigation
relating primarily to the Cubatao Business on behalf of Buyer and the Company
Group. After the Closing, the Company Group and Buyer and its Subsidiaries
shall provide Parent such assistance as may reasonably be requested by Parent
for the prosecution and conduct by Parent of all such Cubatao Litigation,
including by executing and delivering to Parent and its
representatives powers of attorney granting Parent and its representatives
the power and authority through any counsel selected by Parent to represent
the applicable member of the Company Group in any such Cubatao Litigation,
including negotiating and entering into any settlement related therewith, in
order to defend Parents and Vale Cubataos interests and otherwise to allow
Parent to ensure the proper and adequate prosecution and 

 



133  conduct of all such Cubatao Litigation; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i)
nothing in this Agreement shall require Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including, following the Closing, the Company Group) to file any claims or
other court papers or actively initiate any Action in connection with such
Cubatao Litigation or against any Person and (ii) neither Buyer nor any of its
Affiliates (including, following the Closing, the Company Group) shall
challenge the legitimacy of the filing of any claims or other court papers or
the initiation of any Action in connection with such Cubatao Litigation. After
the Closing, Parent shall keep the Company and Buyer reasonably apprised as
to the status of the litigation or any settlement negotiations with respect
thereto, including by providing notification to the Company and Buyer
regarding the receipt of any material notice or other
substantive communication with respect to any such Cubatao Litigation and by
providing copies of court paper filings by any party, court orders, and
correspondence to or from any counterparty in such proceedings; _provided_ ,
that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Sellers
shall not be required to inform Buyer of any matter (including the receipt of
any communications) if doing so would, in the Sellers reasonable judgment,
(i) jeopardize any attorney client or other legal privilege or immunity or
protection from disclosure or (ii) violate any Contract or contravene any
applicable Law or fiduciary duty (provided, however, that upon Buyers
request, the Sellers shall use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with
Buyer to put in place arrangements to permit such disclosure without violating
such Contracts or contravening such Laws or fiduciary duties).

 

(b) Parent shall have the right to settle or compromise or consent to the
entry of any judgment with respect to any Cubatao Litigation relating
primarily to the Cubatao Business, on behalf of Buyer and the Company Group
and thereafter Buyer and the Company Group shall cooperate with Parent to
effect such actions.

 

(c) In the event that Buyer or any member of the Company Group receives any
credits or proceeds resulting from the resolution of any Cubatao Litigation
(including under any judgment, consent decree, settlement or compromise),
Buyer shall cause the applicable member of the Company Group to promptly (and
in any event within ten (10) Business Days) (i) assign such credits to Parent
or its designee as promptly as reasonably practicable after such credits
become readily assignable without undue burden on Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (including the Company Group), provided that such assignment is
not inconsistent with any other provision of this Agreement (including
_Article_ __ _ VI_) or the Ancillary Agreements or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby and (ii) remit such proceeds to Parent or its
designee, in each case of clauses (i) and (ii), to the extent such credits or
proceeds relate to the Cubatao Business.

Expenses for any purpose hereunder).

 



134 12.02 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented
only by a writing signed by Buyer and each of the Sellers.

12.03 _Interpretation_.

 

(a) The table of contents and headings preceding the text of articles and
sections included in this Agreement and the headings to schedules and
exhibits attached to this Agreement are for convenience only and shall not be
deemed part of this Agreement or be given any effect in interpreting this
Agreement. All exhibits and schedules annexed hereto or referred to herein
are hereby incorporated in and made a part of this Agreement as if set forth
in full herein and any capitalized terms used in any exhibit or schedule to
this Agreement but not otherwise defined therein shall have the meaning as
defined in this Agreement. The use of the masculine, feminine or neuter
gender or the singular or plural form of words herein shall not limit any
provision of this Agreement. The terms as set forth in this Agreement have
been arrived at after mutual negotiation with the advice of counsel and,
therefore, it is the intention of the Parties that its terms may not be
construed against any of the Parties by reason of the fact that it was
prepared by one of the Parties. Reference to any Person includes
such Persons successors and assigns to the extent such successors and
assigns are permitted by the terms of any applicable agreement, and reference
to a Person in a particular capacity excludes such Person in any other
capacity or individually. Reference to any agreement (including this
Agreement), document or instrument means such agreement, document or
instrument as amended or modified and in effect from time to time in
accordance with the terms thereof and, if applicable, the terms hereof. The
words "hereof," "herein", "hereby", "hereto" and "hereunder" shall refer to
this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement. All references to documents or other materials that were
delivered, provided or made available to Buyer shall include any such document
or material posted to the Data Room prior to the date hereof or otherwise made
available to Buyer or any of its representatives (electronically or
otherwise) prior to the date hereof. All references to "dollars" or "$" shall
be to U.S. dollars. All references to "Section", "Sections", "Article",
"Articles", "Exhibit" or "Exhibits" refer to the corresponding Section,
Sections, Article, Articles, Exhibit or Exhibits of this Agreement. The word
"including" shall mean "including without limitation". "Extent" in the
phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree to which a subject or other item
extends and shall not simply mean "if". The word "or" is used in the inclusive
sense of "and/or". All words used in this Agreement will be construed to be
of such gender or number as the circumstances require. All reference to any
Law means such Law as amended from time to time and shall include any
successor legislation thereto and any rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder. 

(b) Neither the specification of any dollar amount in any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific fact
or item in the Sellers Disclosure Schedules or the Buyer Disclosure Schedules
is intended or will be deemed to imply that such amount, or higher or lower
amounts, or the fact or item so 

 



135  included or other facts or items, are or are not material. Unless this
Agreement specifically provides otherwise, neither the specification of any
fact, item or matter in any representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific fact, item or matter in the
Sellers Disclosure Schedules or the Buyer Disclosure Schedules is intended or
will be deemed to imply that such fact, item or matter, or other facts, items
or matters, are or are not in the Ordinary Course. The inclusion of any fact
or item in the Sellers Disclosure Schedules or the Buyer Disclosure Schedules
shall not constitute, or be deemed to be, an admission by any Party to any
third party of any fact, item or matter whatsoever (including any violation,
noncompliance with, or Liability or obligation under, applicable Law, other
requirement or breach of Contract). Certain facts, items and matters disclosed
in the Sellers Disclosure Schedules and the Buyer Disclosure Schedules have
been disclosed for informational purposes only. No general disclosure in any
particular Section in the Sellers Disclosure Schedules or the Buyer Disclosure
Schedules shall be limited by any more specific disclosure in either that
particular Section or any other Section of the Sellers Disclosure Schedules or
the Buyer Disclosure Schedules, respectively, unless a contrary intention is
expressly stated.

 

12.04 _Notices_. Unless otherwise provided herein, all notices and other
communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given and
received (i) if delivered in person, on the date delivered, (ii) if
transmitted by facsimile (with written confirmation of completed transmission)
or by electronic mail (with confirmation of receipt by the recipient,
which confirmation shall be promptly delivered by the recipient if so

12.05 _Waivers_. The failure of a Party at any time or times to require
performance of any provision hereof shall in no manner affect its right at a
later time to enforce the same. No waiver by a Party of any condition or of
any breach of any term, covenant, representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement shall be effective unless in writing, and no waiver in any one or
more instances shall be deemed to be a further or continuing waiver of any
such condition or breach in other instances or a waiver of any other condition
or breach of any other term, covenant, representation or warranty.

 

12.06 _Successors and Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
shall inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective permitted
successors and assigns. Neither this Agreement nor any right or obligation

in (a) _ Article_ __ _ XI_ with respect to the Indemnified Persons (which
shall be express third party beneficiaries with respect to _Article_ __ _

the last sentence of _Section 7.04(c)_ ) and (f) _ Article_ __ _ II_ with
respect to the Selling Entities other than the Sellers (which shall be express
third party beneficiaries with respect to _Article_ __ _ II_), this Agreement
is solely for the benefit of the Parties and no provision of this Agreement
shall be deemed to confer upon any other Person any remedy, claim, Liability,
reimbursement, cause of action or other right, including rights of any
Business Employee in respect of any right of any Party hereunder or any right
to contract or any right to employment or continued employment with Buyer.

12.08 _Publicity_. Any initial press releases made by, or caused to be made
by, any Party with respect to the execution of this Agreement shall be
reasonably agreed upon by Buyer and the Sellers. After such initial press
releases, neither Party shall make, or cause to be made, any additional press
release or public announcement in respect of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written consent
of the other Parties unless otherwise required by applicable Law
or applicable stock exchange regulation (in which case the Party seeking to
make such release, announcement or communication shall promptly notify the
other Party thereof and the Parties shall, to the extent practicable without
violating applicable Law or applicable stock exchange regulation, use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause a mutually agreeable release,
announcement or communication to be made), and the Parties shall cooperate as
to the timing and contents of any such press release, public announcement or
communication; _provided_ , _however_ , that (x) the Parties may make any
press release or other public announcement (including to analysts, investors
or those attending industry conferences or analyst or investor conference
calls) to the extent that such release or announcement contains no information
in respect of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement other than information previously publicly disclosed in accordance
with this  _Section_ __ _ 12.08_ and is otherwise consistent in all material
respects with previous statements made jointly by Buyer and the Sellers and
(y) Buyer and its Affiliates may make customary disclosures in connection with
the Financing.

12.09 _Further Assurances_. The Sellers and Buyer agree to execute and deliver
such other documents, certificates, agreements and other writings and to take
such other actions as may be reasonable, necessary or desirable in order to
consummate or implement expeditiously the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and any agreement, document or instrument
contemplated herein or therein, including, for the avoidance of doubt and
without limitation, making all necessary entries in the share transfer and
share registry books of Brazil Landco and Argentina Landco and making
all filings required under applicable law (including Brazilian Law and
Argentine Law) to effect the transfer of the Brazil Landco Shares and the
Argentina Landco Shares, as applicable.

 



138 12.10 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality or enforceability
of the other provisions hereof shall not be affected thereby, and there shall
be deemed substituted for the provision at issue a valid, legal and
enforceable provision as similar as possible to the provision at issue.

12.11 _Entire Understanding_. This Agreement (including the Sellers Disclosure
Schedules and the Buyer Disclosure Schedules), the Confidentiality Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements set forth the sole and entire agreement and
understanding of the Parties with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby and supersede any and all prior representations,
warranties, agreements, arrangements and understandings, both written and
oral, among the Parties relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

 

12.12 _Applicable Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed and
enforced in accordance with, the internal Laws of the State of New York
without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law thereof.

12.13 _Submission to Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 2.08_ and _Section_ __ _ 2.10_, Buyer and the
Sellers each irrevocably agree that the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York and, if such court does not have jurisdiction
over such dispute, the Supreme Court of the State of New York located in the
Borough of Manhattan (including the applicable appellate courts thereof,
collectively, the " _New York Courts_ ") shall have exclusive jurisdiction to
settle any claims, differences or disputes which may arise out of or in
connection with this Agreement.

 

(b) Buyer and the Sellers each irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the
jurisdiction of the New York Courts for such purpose and waives any objection
it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any proceedings in
any New York Court and any claim that any proceedings brought in any such
court have been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each of Buyer and the
Sellers further irrevocably agrees that a final judgment in any proceedings
brought in an applicable New York Court shall be conclusive and binding upon
the Parties and may be enforced in the courts of any other jurisdiction.

 

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ANCILLARY AGREEMENTS IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES AND, THEREFORE, EACH SUCH PARTY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT
OF ANY LEGAL ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT,
THE ANCILLARY AGREEMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY.
EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO
REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER IN THE
EVENT OF A LEGAL ACTION,

 



139  (B) SUCH PARTY HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) SUCH
PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (D) SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 12.13(c)_.

12.14 _Counterparts_. Each of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements may
be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but
all of which together shall constitute one and the same original instrument.

 

12.15 _Specific Performance_. The Parties recognize, acknowledge and agree
that the breach or violation of this Agreement by a Party would cause
irreparable damage to the other Party and that none of the Parties has an
adequate remedy at law. Each Party shall therefore be entitled, in addition to
any other remedies that may be available, to obtain specific performance of
the terms of this Agreement, and appropriate injunctive relief may be applied
for and granted in connection therewith. A Party seeking an order or
injunction to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions hereof shall not be required to provide, furnish or
post any bond or other security in connection with or as a condition to
obtaining any such order or injunction, and each Party hereby irrevocably
waives any right it may have to require the provision, furnishing or posting
of any such bond or other security. If any action is brought by any Party to
enforce this Agreement, the other Parties shall waive the defense that there
is an adequate remedy at law.

 

12.16 _Provision Regarding Legal Representation_.

 

(a) Recognizing that Cleary Gottlieb Steen and Hamilton LLP (" _Cleary Gottlieb_
") and Souza, Cescon, Barrieu and Flesch Advogados (together with Cleary
Gottlieb, the " _Seller Legal Advisors_ ") have acted as legal counsel to the
Sellers, the Company Group and their respective Affiliates prior to the
Closing, and that the Seller Legal Advisors intend to act as legal counsel to
the Sellers and their respective Affiliates (which will no longer include the
Company Group) after the Closing, to the extent provided below, Buyer hereby
waives (on its own behalf), and agrees to cause its Affiliates (including,
after the Closing, the Company Group) to waive, any conflicts arising under
such representation that may prevent any Seller Legal Advisor from
representing the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates after
the Closing as such representation may relate to Buyer and the Company Group
or the transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
all communications involving attorney-client confidences between the Sellers,
the Company Group and their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and any
Seller Legal Advisor, on the other hand, in the course of the negotiation,
documentation and consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be deemed to be attorney-client confidences that belong solely to the Sellers
and their respective Affiliates (and not to any member of the Company Group).
Accordingly, Buyer shall cause the members of the Company Group to use
commercially reasonable efforts to not access any such communications or the
files of the Seller Legal Advisors relating to such

 



140  engagement from and after the Closing. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, from and after the Closing, (a) the Sellers and their
respective Affiliates (and not the members of the Company Group) shall be the
sole holders of the attorney-client privilege with respect to such engagement,
and no member of the Company Group shall be a holder thereof, (b) to the
extent that files of any Seller Legal Advisor in respect of such engagement
constitute property of the client, only the Sellers and their respective
Affiliates (and not any member of the Company Group) shall hold such property
rights and (c) the Seller Legal Advisors shall have no duty whatsoever to
reveal or disclose any such attorney-client communications or files to any of
the members of the Company Group by reason of any attorney-client
relationship between any Seller Legal Advisor and any member of the Company
Group or otherwise; _provided_ , _however_ , that any attorney-
client privilege, attorney work-product protection and client confidence
shall also belong to and be controlled by the members of the Company Group
(and not heretofore waived by Buyer or any member of the Company Group) to
the extent any such attorney-client privilege, attorney work-product
protection or client confidence is required to be waived or otherwise required
to be similarly released by any Governmental Authority or Third Party under
applicable Laws or pursuant to any order, stipulations, determinations or
awards entered by or with any Governmental Authority or any arbitration panel,
tribunal or arbitrator;  _provided_ , _further_ , that Buyer shall notify the
Sellers of any such requirement in advance of any such waiver or release and,
upon the Sellers request, shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate with the Sellers to put in place arrangements that comply with such
Laws, orders, stipulations, determinations and awards in a manner that would
not waive or release any such attorney-client privilege, attorney work-product
protection or client confidence.
