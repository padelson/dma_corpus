 STOCK PURCHASE 

   

 2.1 _Deposit_

Within one Business Day after execution of this Agreement, Alon shall deposit with the Escrow Agent $10,000,000 by wire transfer of immediately available funds.

The Escrow Agent shall deposit the Deposit into an interest bearing account as set forth in the Deposit Escrow Agreement. If this Agreement is terminated for any reason, except as set forth in  _Section 2.1(b)_, Alon shall be entitled to receive and retain the Deposit. 

   

 (b) The Sellers shall be entitled to receive and retain the Deposit if: 

    

 (i) the Sellers terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.3(a)(i)_ or  _(ii)_ , or Alon terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.4(a)(i)_ or  _(ii)_ , and in each case the condition to Closing set forth in _Section 9.1(a)_ shall not have been satisfied; or 

   

 (ii) the Sellers terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.3(b)_ 

  

 (any termination described in clause (i) or (ii) above being a " _Qualified Termination_ "). 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) If the Closing does not occur for any reason, all interest or other returns earned on the Deposit shall be paid to Alon. If the Closing does not occur as a result of a Qualified Termination, the Sellers and Alon agree that it would be impractical and extremely difficult to estimate the damages that the Sellers may suffer; however the Sellers and Alon agree that the Deposit is a reasonable estimate of the minimum total damages that the Sellers would suffer in the event the Closing does not occur, _provided however_ , that the amount of the Deposit shall not limit the Sellers recovery in the event the Closing does not occur as a result of a Qualified Termination, and, in addition to retaining the Deposit, in the event that the Closing does not occur as a result of a Qualified Termination, the Sellers shall be entitled to seek any other available remedy, whether at law or in equity. The payment of the Deposit as set forth herein is not intended as a forfeiture or penalty within the meaning of applicable law. 

   

 2.2 _Sale and Delivery_. At the Closing, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, the Sellers shall sell and deliver to Alon the Shares, free and clear of all Liens, and Alon shall purchase and accept the Shares from the Sellers. 

  

 2.3 _Purchase Price_. 

  

 (a) At the Closing, Alon shall: 

    

 (i) pay to the Sellers by wire transfer of immediately available funds $307,000,000  _less_ (A) the Deposit, _plus_ (B) Sellers good faith estimate of the value of the current assets (with the inventory component thereof being an estimate of actual inventory calculated at fair market value as of the Closing Date, as provided in  _Schedule 2.4(b)_) less current liabilities (including current portions of long-term debt and borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement), long-term indebtedness and minority interest of the Acquired Companies on the Closing Date (the " _Estimated Closing Date Adjusted Book Value_ "), _less_ (C) the value of the current assets (with inventory calculated at fair market value as of December 31, 2005, as provided in _Schedule 2.4(b)_ ) less current liabilities (including current portions of long-term debt and borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement), long-term indebtedness and minority interest of the Acquired Companies on December 31, 2005, as set forth on _Schedule 2.3(a)_ (the " _December Adjusted Book Value_ "), _less_ (D) the Holdback Amount,  _less_ (E) the amount, if any, by which $7,400,000 exceeds the amount of cash actually received by the Acquired Companies prior to the Closing in respect of the income and property insurance claim for damage to Heater H 805 (the " _Heater H805 Claim_ "), _less_  (F) the amount, if any, by which $27,500,000 exceeds the amount of cash actually received by the Acquired Companies prior to Closing as a result of the sale of the Acquired Companies 75% interest in Tidelands Oil Production Corporation, and _less_ (G) all Prepayment Penalties; 

   

 (ii) direct the Escrow Agent (A) to pay the Sellers the Deposit and (B) to pay all interest and returns thereon to Alon; and 

   

 (iii) deposit the Holdback Amount with the Escrow Agent by wire transfer of immediately available funds 

   

 (the amounts in clause (i), the " _Cash Payment"_ , and with the amounts in (ii) and (iii), 

   ##### 

  

    

collectively, the " _Closing Payment_ "). If the Purchase Price (and the Cash
Payment) is reduced pursuant to subclause (E) of _Section 2.3(a)(i)_, the
parties shall cause the Acquired Companies to assign to the Sellers at the
Closing, in their Pro Rata Portion, without warranty or recourse of any kind
or character, all right, title and interest of the Acquired Companies in and
to the Heater H805 Claim. 

   

 The adjustment to the Cash Payment shall be calculated consistent with the hypothetical calculation of the Closing Date Cash Payment set forth in _Schedule 2.3(b)_ and its supporting schedules (the " _Hypothetical Calculation_ "). The Hypothetical Calculation has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to be a forecast or otherwise indicative of the actual anticipated Cash Payment. 

   

 For the avoidance of doubt, the parties intend that the Sellers shall bear the cost of the Employee Cash Bonuses and the Company Transaction Expenses, and that such expenses shall be paid on or before the Closing Date so that deductions therefor will be allocated to the pre-Closing Straddle Period for purposes of _Section 8.1(c)_. The parties further agree that the Purchase Price shall not be affected in any manner, either directly or indirectly, or through the adjustment to the Purchase Price contemplated by _Section 2.4_ as a result of the transactions contemplated by _Section 2.3(d)_. 

  

 (b) Concurrent with the Closing, Lovejoy and Milano will assign to the Trusts the Option Agreements, and the Trusts shall immediately thereafter cancel the Option Agreements and the Options. The Sellers agree that a portion of the Pro Rata Portion of the Purchase Price to be paid to Lovejoy and Milano is a payment on behalf of the Trusts for the Option Purchase. 

   

 (c) At the Closing, each Sellers Pro Rata Portion of the Cash Payment, as set forth on  _Schedule 2.3(c)_, shall be delivered to such Seller by wire transfer. Each Seller shall designate in writing to Alon and the Escrow Agent at least three days prior to the Closing the account to which such wire transfer payment shall be made. 

    

 (d) (i) The provisions of _Sections 2.3(d)(ii)_ though _(v)_ below shall not be effective unless and until (i) any consent required for the relevant Acquired Company to enter into an agreement for the sale of the 1031 Assets and to consummate such a sale, as contemplated by this Agreement, that is required in order to avoid a breach of or default or event of default under the Term Loan Agreement has been obtained in accordance with the terms of the Term Loan Agreement, and (ii) any consent required for the relevant Acquired Company to enter into an agreement for the sale of the 1031 Assets and to consummate such a sale, as contemplated by this Agreement, that is required in order to avoid a breach of or default or event of default under the Revolving Credit Agreement has been obtained in accordance with the terms of the Revolving Credit Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that the Sellers are not creating any duty or obligation of any sort whatsoever to cause any Acquired Company to enter into any agreement to sell the 1031 Assets to Alon, unless and until all consents described in the preceding sentence have been obtained at which time the provisions set forth in _Sections 2.3(d)(ii)_ though  _(v)_ shall be effective, but not otherwise. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (ii) Provided that the consents described in _Section 2.3(d)_ shall have been obtained, at least two Business Days prior to the Closing Date, at least one Business Day prior to the Closing Date, Alon shall direct its qualified intermediary to purchase from the Acquired Companies the 1031 Assets at the purchase prices specified in _Schedule 2.3(d)_. On the date the purchase of the 1031 Assets is consummated (the " _Asset Purchase Date_ "), (A) Alon shall direct its qualified intermediary to pay to the Acquired Company set forth in such schedule as the owner of the 1031 Asset to be purchased, the purchase price specified in _Schedule 2.3(d)_ for such asset by wire transfer of immediately available funds (and in the event that its qualified intermediary shall have insufficient funds for such purposes, Alon shall itself concurrently pay the deficiency), and (B) the applicable Acquired Company shall transfer all of its right, title and interest in, to and under the 1031 Asset being purchased to Alons qualified intermediary. The selling Acquired Company shall bear all Taxes attributed to the sale of the 1031 Asset under this _Section 2.3(d_ ) and Alon shall bear all filing fees and recording costs and other expenses attributable to or arising from the purchase and sale of the 1031 Assets. The Sellers and the Acquired Companies shall comply with all reasonable requests of Alon to assist Alon in its efforts to qualify the purchase of the 1031 Assets as an exchange under Section 1031 of the Code. 

   

 (iii) If the Closing Date does not occur within three Business Days following the Asset Purchase Date, the purchase and sale of the 1031 Assets under this _Section 2.3(d)_ shall be rescinded and (A) title to the purchased 1031 Assets shall revert to the Acquired Companies, and (B) the purchase price for the 1031 Assets shall be refunded to Alon. Alon shall bear all costs, liabilities and expenses attributable to rescinding the 1031 Asset sale, and the Acquired Companies shall be entitled to recover any such costs, liabilities and expenses by offset against the purchase price refunded to Alon. 

   

 (iv) The consummation of the transactions described above in this _Section 2.3(d)_ and the effect thereof on the assets and conditions of the Acquired Companies shall in no event be deemed to violate any representation, warranty, covenant or other obligation of the Sellers under this Agreement. 

   

 (v) The Sellers shall cause the relevant Acquired Company to take all necessary corporate or limited liability company action on the part of such Acquired Company to approve the execution, delivery and performance by the relevant Acquired Company under any agreement conveying the 1031 Asset to Alon and to duly execute and deliver such agreement and to perform all obligations thereunder.

 For purposes of calculating the Estimated Closing Date Adjusted Book Value and the Closing Date Adjusted Book Value, such calculation shall not take into account (i) the impact of any purchase accounting adjustments relating to Alons acquisition of the Acquired Companies, including any write-up or write-down of assets or liabilities resulting from such purchase accounting, (ii) any reduction in indebtedness of the Acquired Companies that results from the retirement thereof with funds provided by Alon pursuant to _Section 6.19_ and (iii) the impact of the transactions contemplated by _Section 2.3(d)_, ( _e.g._ , the current assets of the Acquired Companies shall not be increased by the purchase price received by any Acquired Company or decreased by any Taxes paid by any Acquired Company and the current liabilities of the Acquired Companies will not be increased for any accrual for Taxes payable by any Acquired Company, in each case as a result of the transactions contemplated by _Section 2.3(d)_). 

  

 (c) Within 45 days following Alons delivery to the Sellers Representative of its calculation of the Closing Date Financial Statements and the Closing Date Adjusted Book Value, the Sellers Representative shall deliver to Alon a notice of objection signed by the Sellers Representative (an " _Adjusted Book Value Objection Notice_ ") or a notice of acceptance signed by the Sellers Representative (an " _Adjusted Book Value Acceptance Notice_ ") with respect to Alons calculation of the Closing Date Adjusted Book Value.

 (d) Alons calculation of the Closing Date Adjusted Book Value shall be final and binding on the parties if an Adjusted Book Value Acceptance Notice is delivered to Alon or if no Adjusted Book Value Objection Notice is delivered to Alon within the 45-day period required by _Section 2.4(c)_. Any Adjusted Book Value Objection Notice shall specify the items disputed, shall describe the reasons for the objection thereof, shall state the amount in dispute and shall state the Sellers calculation of the Closing Date Adjusted Book Value. If an Adjusted Book Value Objection Notice is delivered, the potential dispute shall be resolved as set forth in _Section 2.5_. 

   

 (e) If the Sellers Representative delivers to Alon an Adjusted Book Value Acceptance Notice or the Sellers Representative fails to deliver an Adjusted Book Value Objection Notice within the 45-day period required by _Section 2.4(c)_, (i) an amount equal to the Closing Date Adjusted Book Value minus the Estimated Closing Date Adjusted Book Value shall be paid (A) by Alon to the Sellers, in their Pro Rata Portion, if such amount is positive, and (B) by the Sellers to Alon, if such amount is negative, within five Business Days after the delivery of such Adjusted Book Value Acceptance Notice or the expiration of such 45-day period, as the case may be. Alternatively, if the Sellers Representative delivers to Alon an Adjusted Book Value Objection Notice, within five Business Days after such delivery, the owing parties shall pay the undisputed portion, if any, of the amount owed and, within five Business Days after the resolution of any dispute by the parties or the Unrelated Accounting Firm relating to the Adjusted Book Value Objection Notice, the owing parties shall pay the remainder owed, if any. Any payment pursuant to this _Section 2.4_ shall be made in immediately available funds. 

   

 2.5 _Dispute Resolution of Calculation of Purchase Price_. If an Adjusted Book Value Objection Notice is given, the Sellers Representative and Alon shall consult with each other with respect to the objection. If Alon and the Sellers Representative are unable to reach agreement within 15 days after an Objection Notice has been given, any unresolved disputed items shall be promptly referred to the Los Angeles office of Deloitte and Touche USA LLP, _provided however_ , if such firm is unavailable or if either of the parties has used the services of Deloitte and Touche USA LLP (or its Affiliates) at any time in the twelve month period prior to the date the Adjusted Book Value Objection Notice is given, then the unresolved items shall be promptly referred to such other nationally recognized independent accounting firm mutually agreed to by Alon and the Sellers Representative (Deloitte and Touche USA LLP, or such other firm, the " _Unrelated Accounting Firm_ "). The Unrelated Accounting Firm shall be directed to render a written report on the unresolved disputed issues as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than 45 days following submission of the matter to the Unrelated Accounting Firm) and to resolve only those issues of dispute set forth in the Adjusted Book Value Objection Notice. The resolution of the dispute by the Unrelated Accounting Firm shall be final and binding on the parties for purposes of determining the amounts owed by the parties hereunder with respect to such dispute. The percentage of the expenses of the Unrelated Accounting Firm that shall be borne by the Sellers on the one hand (in their Pro Rata Portion), and Alon on the other hand, shall be the same as the percentage of the amount in dispute that the Unrelated Accounting Firm shall determine the other party is entitled to receive.

 (d) Neither the Sellers nor, prior to the Closing, any of the Acquired Companies shall, without the prior written consent of Alon, terminate, amend, modify or waive any provision of any confidentiality or similar agreement pertaining to proprietary or confidential documents or information of or concerning the Acquired Companies or their respective businesses to which any of the Sellers or any Acquired Company is a party. Each of the Sellers and, prior to the Closing, the Acquired Companies shall enforce, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, the provisions of any such agreements, including using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain injunctions to prevent any breaches of such agreements and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof in any court having jurisdiction over the matter.

respective legal obligations (including requirements of stock exchanges and
similar Governmental Entities), consult with each other, and use reasonable
efforts to agree upon the text of any press release or other public
communication, before issuing any such press release or public communication
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and in making any filings
with any Governmental Entity or with any national securities exchange with
respect thereto. 

  

 6.5 _Expenses; Law Firms_. 

  

 (a) Except as set forth herein, all costs and expenses (including fees of attorneys, accountants and brokers or finders) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses; _provided however_ , Alon, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, shall each be responsible for one half of (i) all filing fees in connection with the filings required by the HSR Act, (ii) all fees of the entity providing the inventory measurement as set forth in _Schedule 2.4(b)_, and (iii) the premium for the Tail Policy.

 (b) Alon acknowledges that the law firms representing the Sellers and the Company in connection with the Stock Purchase listed on _Schedule 6.5_ have long-standing relationships with the Sellers, and notwithstanding any payment by the Company of any legal fees of the Sellers or the Acquired Companies pursuant to _Section 6.5(a)_, in the event of any dispute or potential dispute between the parties hereto, the Sellers may desire to engage one or more of such law firms to advise the Sellers in connection with such dispute or potential dispute or any other matter. Accordingly, Alon hereby agrees that it shall not, and shall not permit any of the Acquired Companies to, assert any claim that such representation of the Sellers by such law firms in any such matter creates an impermissible conflict of interest with the interests of the Acquired Companies (or any one of them) under the applicable rules of professional conduct. If the Closing occurs, to the extent of any such potential conflict of interest, Alon hereby waives, on behalf of itself, and the Acquired Companies, any such conflict, and with a full understanding of the implications of such potential conflicts of interest, provides its informed consent to the representation of the Sellers by any or all of such law firms in any such matters that may be adverse to Alon or the Acquired Companies. 

   

 6.6 _Employee Matters_.

benefit plans or policies, or a combination of the foregoing, as determined by
Alon in its discretion. Following the Closing, Alon shall recognize the years
of service of each continuing employee of the Acquired Companies with the
Acquired Companies prior to the Closing Date for all purposes (other than
benefit accrual under a defined benefit pension plan) under the
employee benefit plans and policies of Alon; provided, that such service
shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a
duplication of benefits for the same period of service or to the extent that
such service was not recognized under the corresponding Company Benefit Plan.
To the extent that the continuing employees of the Acquired Companies become
covered by any Alon group health plan, Alon shall cause any and all pre-
existing condition (or actively at work or similar) limitations, eligibility
waiting periods and evidence of insurability requirements under such plans to
be waived with respect to such continuing employees of the Acquired
Companies and their eligible dependents, to the extent satisfied under a
corresponding Company Benefit Plan, and shall provide them with credit for
any co-payments, deductibles, and offsets (or similar payments) made during
the plan year including the date such employees become eligible
to participate in such Alon group health plan for the purposes of satisfying
any applicable deductible, out-of-pocket, or similar requirements under any
such plan. For purposes of this  _Section 6.6_, "continuing employee of the
Acquired Companies" means an employee of the Acquired Companies as of the
Closing Date. 

   

 (b) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.6_ shall confer upon any employee of the Acquired Companies any right to continued employment or participation in any Company Benefit Plan at any time after the Closing Date. 

   

 (c) If within one year after the Closing Date, the employment of any continuing employee of the Acquired Companies is terminated by the Acquired Company employer of such continuing employee (excluding any termination which is concurrent with the hiring of such continuing employee by another Acquired Company or an Affiliate of such Acquired Company), for other than cause (as defined under applicable law), the Acquired Companies shall pay such employee a lump sum, promptly after such termination, equal to the product of (i) two weeks of such employees base salary immediately prior to such termination (excluding any overtime or bonus payments) and (ii) the number of years of continuous service of such continuing employee with the Acquired Companies. The foregoing payments shall not apply to any continuing employee of the Acquired Companies who is party to a Contract with one of the Acquired Companies that provides for severance benefits upon termination of the employment of such employee or any continuing employee subject to a collective bargaining agreement or other labor contract. 

   

 (d) Alon shall be solely responsible for any required notice and payments under the Worker Adjustment Retraining and Notification Act of 1988 (the " _WARN Act_ ") and any similar state statutes, and otherwise to comply with any such statute with respect to any "plant closing" or "mass layoff" (as defined in the WARN Act) or group termination or similar event affecting any continuing employees of the Acquired Companies occurring on or after the Closing Date. The Sellers shall be solely responsible for causing the Acquired Companies to provide any required notice and payments under the WARN Act, and any similar state statutes, and otherwise to comply with any such statute with respect to any "plant closing" or "mass layoff" (as defined in the WARN Act) or group termination or similar event affecting any employees of the Acquired Companies before the Closing Date. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (e) Prior to the Closing, the Sellers shall take all actions necessary to terminate the participation in the Company Benefit Plans, effective as of the Closing Date, of each Person that is not an Acquired Company, including, without limitation, Signal Hill Petroleum Inc.

 (a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Closing or termination of this Agreement, each of the Sellers, and their Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) and their respective officers, directors, trustees, employees, representatives (including, without limitation, any investment banker, attorney or accountant) and agents shall immediately cease any discussions or negotiations with any Persons with respect to any Third Party Acquisition, and none of the Sellers, their Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) nor any of their respective officers, directors, trustees, employees, representatives (including, without limitation, any investment banker, attorney or accountant) or agents shall, directly or indirectly, encourage, solicit, participate in or initiate any inquiries, discussions or negotiations with or, except as expressly required to comply with the provisions of the Agreement listed on _Schedule 6.7_, provide any information or access to any Person concerning any potential Third Party Acquisition or otherwise facilitate any effort to make a Third Party Acquisition. The Sellers shall promptly communicate to Alon the existence or occurrence and the terms of any potential Third Party Acquisition or contact related to any potential Third Party Acquisition that the Sellers, their Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) or any of their respective officers, directors, trustees, employees, representatives or agents, receive in respect of such a proposed transaction, and the identity of the Person from whom such proposal or contact was received. 

   

 (b) " _Third Party Acquisition_ " means the acquisition by a Person or group, other than Alon or any Affiliate of Alon, in a single transaction or series of transactions, of any of the Capital Stock or the operating or other tangible assets of any of the Acquired Companies (other than inventory in the ordinary course of business), or any interest therein, whether by sale or other disposition of Capital Stock, sale, lease or other disposition of assets, merger or otherwise, or any other transaction that would interfere with the Stock Purchase; _provided however_ , a Third Party Acquisition shall not include the Option Purchase or the distribution of the Excluded Company to the Sellers. 

   

 6.8 _Restrictive Covenants_. 

  

 (a) For a period of two years from the Closing Date, each of the Sellers shall not, and each Seller shall cause each of its Affiliates under its control not to, directly or indirectly:

   ##### 

  

   

 (ii) solicit or encourage any contractor or other supplier of the Acquired Companies to terminate or adversely alter in any material respect any relationship such supplier may have with any of the Acquired Companies. 

  

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prohibit general solicitations by the Sellers or their Affiliates not directed at any specific employees of the Acquired Companies, including any newspaper advertisements or internet job postings. 

   

 (b) The Sellers acknowledge that if they violate any of the covenants contained in _Section 6.8(a)_ (collectively, the " _Restrictive Covenants_ "), it will be difficult to determine the resulting damages to Alon and, in addition to any other remedies Alon may have, Alon shall be entitled to temporary or permanent injunctive relief without the necessity of proving actual damages. Each Seller shall be solely liable for a breach by such Seller of the covenants contained in this _Section 6.8_, and such liability shall not be joint. The non-prevailing party or parties shall be severally liable to pay all costs, including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses, that the prevailing party or parties may incur in enforcing or defending, to any extent, any of the Restrictive Covenants. 

   

 6.9 _Directors; Indemnification_. 

  

 (a) Effective as of the Closing Date, the Sellers shall cause all directors of the Acquired Companies to resign. 

   

 (b) From and after the Closing, Alon shall cause the Acquired Companies to continue to honor, with respect to all persons who served as directors and/or officers of the Acquired Companies prior to the Closing, the provisions of their respective organizational documents relating to the exculpation and indemnification of their respective directors and officers as such provisions are in effect on the date hereof. 

   

 (c) Prior to the Closing, the Sellers may, or may cause the Company to, obtain a "tail" policy providing for coverage comparable to that provided under the Companys director and officer liability and employment practices insurance as in effect on the date hereof in respect of claims made during a period ending six years after the Closing Date with respect to the current and former directors and officers of the Company (the " _Tail Policy_ ").

 (i) giving and receiving notices and communications to or from Alon (on behalf of itself or any other Alon Indemnified Party) and/or the Escrow Agent relating to this Agreement, the Holdback Escrow Agreement or any of the transactions and other matters contemplated hereby or thereby (except to the extent that this Agreement or the Holdback Escrow Agreement expressly contemplates that any such notice or communication shall be given or received by a Seller individually); 

   

 (ii) authorizing deliveries to Alon of cash out of the Holdback Amount in satisfaction of claims asserted by Alon (on behalf of itself or any other Alon Indemnified Party, including by not objecting to such claims) for which the Sellers are jointly liable; 

   

 (iii) objecting to such claims pursuant to _Article VII_; 

   

 (iv) consenting or agreeing to, negotiating, entering into settlements and compromises of, and prosecuting and defending litigation, arbitration or other proceedings with respect to, such claims; 

   

 (v) asserting, negotiating, entering into settlements and compromises of, and prosecuting and defending litigation, arbitration or other proceedings with respect to, any other claim by any Alon Indemnified Party against the Sellers for which they are jointly liable, in each case relating to this Agreement, the Holdback Escrow Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby; and 

   

 (vi) taking all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Sellers Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing. 

  

 No Seller will have any right to receive any such notice or communication or take any of the foregoing actions individually. 

   

 (b) Within 10 Business Days after the date hereof the Sellers shall appoint the initial Sellers Representative, and notify Alon in writing as to the identity of such person. The Sellers (or their successors), may elect replacements to the Sellers Representative by the affirmative vote of at least three of the four Sellers, provided that Alon is notified in writing thereof (including written agreement by such replacement to serve as the Sellers Representative as set forth herein). Each of the Sellers acknowledge that actions taken, consents given and representations made by the Sellers Representative on behalf of the Sellers pursuant hereto shall be binding upon the Sellers. This appointment and grant of power and authority by each Seller is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable and shall not be terminated by any act of the Seller or by operation of law, whether by the death or incapacity of the Seller or by the occurrence of any other event. The Sellers Representative is authorized by the Sellers to take any action on behalf of the Sellers to facilitate or administer the transactions contemplated hereby, including without limitation, amending this Agreement, and executing such other documents or instruments as the Sellers Representative deems necessary or appropriate. 

    ##### 

  

     

 6.13 _Release_. In consideration of the payments of the Purchase Price by Alon to the Sellers, but subject to _Section 6.9_, each Seller hereby gives the following general release effective as of the Closing Date. 

  

 (a) Each Seller on behalf of himself or itself and his or its agents (including its trustees, if applicable), successors and assigns, hereby irrevocably and unconditionally releases, acquits and forever discharges each of Alon, the Acquired Companies, and their respective partners, stockholders, members, directors, officers and agents, and respective successors and assigns (collectively, the " _Released Parties_ "), to the extent not prohibited by applicable law, from any and all charges, complaints, claims, obligations, promises, agreements, controversies, damages, causes of action, suits, demands, remedies, costs, losses, debts, expenses and fees, of every type, kind, nature, description or character, whether known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, liquidated or unliquidated, including those arising out of or in connection with (i) the Sellers employment with any of the Acquired Companies, if any, (ii) any equity or other interests the Seller may have or claim to have in the Acquired Companies, and (iii) the assets, properties, business, operations and Liabilities of the Excluded Company, whether before, on or after the Closing Date, or the existence of Hazardous Materials in or on soils, sediments, surface water or groundwater at, on, under or from such assets and properties, in each case arising from events, occurrences or circumstance prior to the Closing (the " _Claims_ "). Each Seller represents that he or it has not heretofore assigned or transferred or purported to have assigned or transferred to any Person any Claims released, acquitted and forever discharged herein. This general release shall not affect any rights that the Sellers may have which arise solely under this Agreement, including payment of the Purchase Price, or that arise after the Closing Date. 

   

 (b) Each Seller acknowledges and agrees that the releases made herein constitute final and complete releases of the Released Parties with respect to all Claims. Each Seller expressly acknowledges and agrees that this general release is intended to include in its effect, without limitation, all Claims which Seller does not know or suspect to exist in his or its favor at the time hereof, and this general release contemplates the extinguishment of any and all such Claims. In this regard, each Seller expressly waives the provisions of Section 1542 of the California Civil Code, which states: 

   

 A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR. 

  

Furthermore, each Seller hereby expressly waives and relinquishes any rights
and benefits he or it may have under other statutes or common law principles
of similar effect. Each Seller understands that the facts under which he or
it gives this full and complete release and discharge of the Released Parties
may hereafter prove to be different than now known or believed by such Seller
and such Seller hereby accepts and assumes the risk thereof and agrees that
his or its full and complete release and discharge of the Released Parties
shall remain effective in all respects and not be subject to termination,
rescission or modification by reason of any such difference in facts. 

    ##### 

  

     

 6.14 _Distribution of Excluded Company_. Subject to compliance of Alon with its obligations in Section 6.19, on or before the Closing Date, the Sellers shall cause all of the equity interests in the Excluded Company to be transferred to the Sellers in their Pro Rata Portion as a distribution in partial redemption of the stock of the Company. 

  

 6.15 _Subordinated Debt_. On or before the Closing Date, the Sellers shall cause the Company to repay to the Sellers the principal amount of the Subordinated Debt. For the avoidance of doubt, the net effect of such repayment shall not result in any adjustment to the Purchase Price. 

  

 6.16 _Holdback Escrow Agreement_. At or prior to the Closing, Alon and the Sellers shall, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Escrow Agent to, execute the Holdback Escrow Agreement. 

  

 6.17 _Casualty; Condemnation_. In the event that, after execution of this Agreement but prior to the Closing Date, any material asset of the Acquired Companies is subject to (a) loss, destruction or damage (a " _Casualty_ "), or (b) condemnation or partial condemnation by a Governmental Entity (a " _Condemnation_ "), all proceeds from any insurance claims, condemnation awards, compensation or other reimbursements relating to such Casualty or Condemnation (i) received by any Seller or any Affiliate of a Seller, whether before, on or after the Closing Date, shall be promptly paid over to the Company, or (ii) received by the Company whether before, on or after the Closing Date, shall be retained by the Company (and may, for the avoidance of doubt, at the Companys sole option, be used to repair any such loss, destruction or damage). Any party receiving a notice of Casualty or Condemnation shall notify all other parties to this Agreement in accordance with _Section 11.3_. 

  

 6.18 _Title Commitments_. Prior to the Closing, Alon may in its sole discretion obtain a title commitment (the " _Title Commitment_ ") for one or more ALTA title insurance policies (the " _Title Policies_ ") to be issued by a title company selected by Alon (the " _Title Company_ ") and a survey (the " _Survey_ ") with respect to each parcel of Owned Real Property and Leased Real Property. Each Title Commitment shall list as exceptions all matters that may affect title to such Owned Real Property, including, without limitation, all easements, covenants, restrictions, Liens, encumbrances, tenancies and other exceptions to title affecting title to the applicable parcel of Real Property (collectively, the " _Exceptions_ ") and shall include copies of all instruments creating such Exceptions. Alon may following its review of any Title Commitment and no more than ten days after receipt of the Title Commitment, provide the Acquired Companies with written notice of objection to any Exceptions (other than the Permitted Liens, except Permitted Liens which are unrecorded Liens) that it claims constitutes a title or survey defect that first occurred during the period such Owned Real Property was owned by the Acquired Companies, or if a shorter period, during the period the applicable Acquired Company was owned, directly or indirectly, by the Sellers (the " _Title Objections_ "). The Acquired Companies shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cure or remove such Title Objections to Alons reasonable satisfaction prior to Closing; _provided however,_ so long as the Acquired Companies have used commercially reasonable efforts to cure or remove such Title Objections, the cure or removal of such Title Objections shall not be a condition of Alon to close the transactions contemplated hereby. Sellers and the Acquired Companies agree to reasonably cooperate with Alon in executing any documents reasonably requested by the Title Company which may be necessary to 

   ##### 

  

    

issue the Title Policies, including providing any affidavit reasonably
requested by the Title Company or Alon to evidence the payment or
satisfaction of any Liens, to evidence the payment of any Taxes affecting the
Owned Real Property, or to evidence the satisfaction of any other
matter which Alon may be required to establish in order to obtain the Title
Policies or any endorsement thereto (other than in each case, Permitted
Liens, except Permitted Liens which are unrecorded Liens, if satisfied). Alon
shall pay the premium for the Title Policies, fees for title searches and
costs of any endorsements or deletions to the Title Policies. In addition,
Alon shall pay for the costs of Surveys, if any, that Alon elects to obtain
with respect to the Real Property or any portion thereof. 

  

 6.19 _Bank Facilities_. 

  

 (a) At the Closing, Alon will pay to, or make available to the Company for payment to, the lenders under the Term Loan Agreement an amount sufficient to repay the principal and accrued but unpaid interest outstanding thereunder as of the Closing Date, together with all Prepayment Penalties and other amounts due to such lenders in connection with such repayment. The Sellers will cause the Company to apply all funds made available to it pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence to the payments to the lenders under the Term Loan Agreement in the manner contemplated by the immediately preceding sentence. 

   

 (b) The Sellers and the Acquired Companies shall comply with all reasonable requests of Alon to assist Alon in its efforts to (i) cause the Revolving Credit Agreement, and the ability of the Company to effect borrowings thereunder and under the credit facilities provided for therein, to remain in full force and effect immediately after and unaffected by the Closing (subject to Alon pledging the Shares as security for the Acquired Companies obligations thereunder if and to the extent requested by the lenders thereunder) or (ii) cause all Liens securing indebtedness and other amounts due under the Revolving Credit Agreement to be released effective as of the Closing (subject to Alons fulfillment of its obligations under the immediately succeeding sentence). If, as of five Business Days prior to the Closing, the parties have not received the consent of the lenders under the Revolving Credit Agreement to, as of the Closing, (i) keep the Revolving Credit Facility in full force and effect after the Closing, (ii) release all existing guarantors, sureties, and indemnitors (other than the Acquired Companies) of or under the Revolving Credit Agreement, and any related agreements executed in connection with the Revolving Credit Agreement, from their respective obligations, and (iii) fully reconvey the Upper Bluff Property from any recorded deed of trust encumbering the Upper Bluff Property granted in connection with the Term Loan Agreement, then Alon, at the Closing, shall pay to, or make available to the Company for payment to, the lenders under the Revolving Credit Agreement an amount sufficient to repay the principal and accrued but unpaid interest outstanding thereunder as of the Closing Date, together with all Prepayment Penalties and other amounts due to such lenders in connection with such repayment.

been finally resolved. 

   

 (b) The covenants and agreements of the parties hereto contained in this Agreement shall, subject to the express terms thereof, survive the Closing indefinitely (subject to the expiration of the statute of limitations, or termination of rights under laches or other equitable bar to the matters covered thereby). 

   

 (c) Subject to _Section 7.3(a)_ and _(b)_ , for purposes of this _Article VII_ , in determining (i) whether any representation or warranty in this Agreement was true and correct as of any particular date and (ii) the amount of any Damages in respect of the failure of any such representation or warranty to be true and correct as of any particular date, any qualification or limitation as to materiality (whether by reference to Material Adverse Effect or otherwise) contained in such representation or warranty shall be disregarded.

    ##### 

  

    

(including reasonable legal, accounting and consulting fees and expenses and
any other reasonable out-of-pocket expenses) actually suffered or incurred by

otherwise initiated by any of them) (collectively " _Damages_ "), arising out
of or resulting from: 

   

 (i) any failure of any representation or warranty made by the Sellers in this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents to be true and correct as of the Closing Date; _provided however_ , that each Seller shall be solely liable for a breach by such Seller of the representations and warranties of such Seller in _Article III_, and such liability shall not be joint; 

  

 (ii) any breach of any covenant of the Sellers contained in this Agreement required to be performed on or prior to the Closing; 

  

 (iii) any breach of any covenant of the Sellers contained in this Agreement, by its terms, required to be performed after the Closing; _provided however_ , that each Seller shall be solely liable for a breach by such Seller of the covenants contained in _Section 6.8_, and such liability shall not be joint;

 (iii) the conduct of the business and operations of the Acquired Companies after the Closing Date. 

  

 7.3 _Other Limitations_. 

  

 (a) Except for claims based on fraud or intentional misrepresentations by the Sellers and claims relating to the matters arising under _Section 3.1_, _3.2,_ _4.1(a)_ ,  _4.2_ or _4.3(a)_ and _(c)_ to which the thresholds described in this _Section 7.3(a)_ shall be inapplicable, the Sellers shall have no liability (for indemnification or otherwise) with respect to (i) any individual claim based   ##### 

  

  

  

on an occurrence, event or circumstance relating to the matters described in
_Section 7.2(a)(i)_ , unless the Damages with respect to such claim exceed
$85,000, or (ii) the matters described in _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ until the
total of all Damages with respect to such matters exceeds $2,000,000, and
then only for the amount by which such Damages exceed $2,000,000 (and
for such purpose, no claims excluded under clause (i) shall be included in
determining if such aggregated Damages have been met). 

   

 (b) Except for claims based on fraud or intentional misrepresentations by Alon and claims relating to the matters arising under _Section 5.1(a)_ or _5.2_ , Alon shall have no liability (for indemnification or otherwise) with respect to (i) any individual claim based on an occurrence, event or circumstance relating to the matters described in _Section 7.2(b)(i)_, unless the Damages with respect to such claim exceed $85,000, or (ii) the matters described in  _Section 7.2(b)(i)_ until the total of all Damages with respect to such matters exceeds $2,000,000, and then only for the amount by which such Damages exceed $2,000,000 (and for such purpose, no claims excluded under clause (i) shall be included in determining if such aggregated Damages have been met). 

   

 (c) In no event will the Sellers liability (for indemnification or otherwise) with respect to the matters in _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ exceed, in the aggregate, $40,000,000, _provided however,_  (i) the Sellers liability for claims or causes of action arising from fraud or intentional misrepresentation by the Sellers or arising from the representations and warranties contained in  _Sections 3.1_, _3.2_ , _4.1(a)_ , _4.2_ and _4.3(a)_ and _(c)_  shall not be limited to $40,000,000 (collectively, with fraud and intentional misrepresentation, the " _Excluded Claims_ "); provided that with respect to the Excluded Claims, in no event shall the aggregate liability of the Sellers for Damages relating to the Excluded Claims exceed the Purchase Price. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Alon Indemnified Parties are entitled to recover any Damages relating to claims or causes of action arising from the Excluded Claims or the matters set forth in _Sections 7.2(a)(ii)_, _(iii)_ , _(iv)_ or _(v)_ , the Alon Indemnified Parties shall first satisfy such claims for indemnification from the Holdback Amount, and if the Holdback Amount is depleted and shall be insufficient to pay the full amount of such Damages, then such amounts shall be paid by the Sellers. 

   

 (d) Only the Sellers Representative, on behalf of the Seller Indemnified Parties, may assert a claim for indemnification against Alon pursuant to this _Article VII_. 

   

 (e) The amount of any Damages subject to indemnification hereunder shall be reduced by any insurance proceeds actually received by the indemnified party from an unrelated third party on account of such Damages prior to the time payment by the indemnifying party is due and payable under this Agreement. In the event that the indemnifying party pays to or on behalf of an indemnified party any amount in respect of Damages subject to indemnification under this  _Article VII_ prior to the indemnified partys receipt, directly or indirectly, of any insurance proceeds on account of such Damages from an unrelated third party which duplicate, in whole or in part, the payment made by the indemnifying party to or on behalf of the indemnified party, the indemnified party shall remit to the indemnifying party an amount equal to the amount of the insurance proceeds actually received by the indemnified party on account of such Damages which duplicate, in whole or in part, the payment made by the indemnifying party to or on behalf of the indemnified party. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (f) The amount of any Damages subject to indemnification hereunder shall be reduced by the amount of any net Tax benefit actually realized by such Person after the Closing Date on account of such Damages prior to the time payment by the indemnifying party is due and payable under this Agreement. In the event that the indemnifying party pays to or on behalf of an indemnified party any amount in respect of Damages subject to indemnification under this _Article VII_ and, subsequent to such payment the indemnified party actually realizes a net Tax benefit on account of such Damages, the indemnified party shall remit to the indemnifying party an amount equal to the amount of such net Tax benefit actually realized on account of such Damages. 

   

 (g) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Sellers shall have no liability hereunder for any Damages to the extent specific reserves for such Damages were reflected on the Closing Date Financial Statements and had the effect of reducing the Closing Date Adjusted Book Value. 

   

 (h) If Alon commences any legal proceedings seeking indemnification hereunder, it shall use commercially reasonable efforts (for a period of 30 days) to serve, and join in such action, all of the Sellers potentially liable therefor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as expressly set forth herein, each of the Sellers shall be jointly and severally liable to the Alon Indemnified Parties hereunder for 100% of the Damages to which the Alon Indemnified Parties are entitled under this Agreement. Nothing herein shall effect the rights of such Sellers to contribution from the other Sellers. 

   

 (i) Except for matters disclosed in the Sellers Disclosure Schedule, to the extent that such matters constitute exceptions to the Sellers representations and warranties, and provided, in the case of Alon, it is in material compliance with its representations and warranties in _Section 5.7(f)_ and its covenants in _Section 6.3(e)_, and in the case of the Sellers, they are in material compliance with their respective representations and warranties in _Section 4.24(b)_ and their covenants in _Section 6.3(e)_, no right or remedy of any Person shall be limited in any respect by any investigation made by such Person, the knowledge of such Person of any breach of any provision of this Agreement or any inaccuracy of any representation, warranty or certificate contained herein or delivered pursuant hereto, or the decision of such Person to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 7.4 _Procedures Relating to Indemnification Involving Third Party Claims_. 

  

 (a) In order for an indemnified party to be entitled to any indemnification provided for under this Agreement in respect of, arising out of or involving a claim or demand made by any Person not a party to this Agreement against the indemnified party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), such indemnified party must promptly notify the indemnifying party in writing of the Third Party Claim after receipt by such indemnified party of written notice of the Third Party Claim; _provided, however_ , that failure to give such notification shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the indemnifying party shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such failure. The notice of claim shall describe in reasonable detail the facts known to the indemnified party giving rise to such indemnification claim, and the amount or good faith estimate of the amount arising therefrom. Thereafter, the indemnified party shall promptly deliver to the indemnifying party after the indemnified partys receipt thereof,   ##### 

  

  

  

copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the
indemnified party relating to the Third Party Claim. In the event the
provisions of _Section 8.4_ are inconsistent with any provision of this
_Article VII_, the provisions of _Section 8.4_ shall control with respect
to the contest of Tax matters. In the event that more than one Seller is an
indemnifying party hereunder, the indemnified party may provide the notices
and other communications required pursuant to this _Section 7.5_ solely to
the Sellers Representative. 

   

 (b) The Sellers Representative, on behalf of the Sellers (if the indemnified party is an Alon Indemnified Party), or Alon (if the indemnified party is a Seller Indemnified Party), as applicable, shall be entitled to assume and control the defense of such Third Party Claim at its expense (or, in the care of the Sellers Representative, at the expense of the Sellers) and through counsel of its choice if it gives written notice of its intention to do so to the indemnified party within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the notice of claim from the indemnified party in which case the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party for any fees of counsel or any other expenses with respect to the defense of such Third Party Claim; _provided, however_ , that if the indemnified party reasonably determines based upon written advice of counsel that a conflict of interest exists that would make it inappropriate for the same counsel to represent both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party, then the indemnified party shall be entitled to retain its own counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party; _provided, further_ , that the indemnifying party shall not in such event be responsible hereunder for the fees and expenses of more than one firm of separate counsel in connection with any Third Party Claim in the same jurisdiction, in addition to one firm of local counsel. In the event that the Sellers Representative or Alon exercises the right to undertake any such defense against such Third Party Claim as provided above, the indemnified party shall cooperate with the Sellers Representative or Alon, as applicable, in such defense and make available to the Sellers Representative or Alon, as applicable, at the indemnifying partys expense, all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in the indemnified partys possession or under the indemnified partys control relating thereto as is reasonably requested by or on behalf of the indemnifying party. Similarly, in the event the indemnified party is, directly or indirectly, conducting the defense against any such Third Party Claim, the indemnifying party shall cooperate with the indemnified party in such defense and make available to the indemnified party, at the indemnifying partys expense, all such witnesses, records, materials and information in the indemnifying partys possession or under the indemnifying partys control relating thereto as is reasonably requested by the indemnified party. 

   

 (c) No compromise or settlement of such Third Party Claim may be effected by either the indemnified party, on the one hand, or the Sellers Representative (if the indemnified party is an Alon Indemnified Party) or Alon (if the indemnified party is a Seller Indemnified Party), on the other hand, without the consent of the other (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sellers Representative (if the indemnified party is an Alon Indemnified Party) or Alon (if the indemnified party is a Seller Indemnified Party) may pay, settle or compromise a Third Party Claim without the written consent of the indemnified party, so long as such settlement includes (i) an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all Liability in respect of such Third Party Claim, (ii) does not subject the indemnified party to any injunctive relief or other equitable remedy, and (iii) does not include a statement or admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party. 

    ##### 

  

     

 7.5 _Other Claims_. A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a Third Party Claim may be asserted by written notice to the Sellers Representative (if the indemnified party is an Alon Indemnified Party) or to Alon (if the indemnified party is a Seller Indemnified Party), as applicable, which notice of claim shall describe in reasonable detail the facts known to the indemnified party giving rise to such indemnification claim, and the amount or good faith estimate of the amounts thereof. Such claims shall be paid promptly after receipt of such notice, unless such claim is disputed, in which case it shall be promptly paid upon resolution of such dispute, if any payment is then due. 

  

 7.6 _Mitigation of Damages._  

  

 (a) Alon and the Sellers shall cooperate with each other with respect to resolving any claim or liability with respect to which one party is obligated to indemnify the other party hereunder, including by making commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate or resolve any such claim or liability. In the event that Alon or the Sellers shall fail to make commercially reasonably efforts to mitigate or resolve any claim or liability, which efforts are proposed by the other party, then notwithstanding anything else to the contrary contained herein, the other party shall not be required to indemnify any Person for any Damages to the extent the same could reasonably be expected to have been avoided if Alon or the Sellers, as the case may be, had made such efforts following such proposal. 

   

 (b) If any Alon Indemnified Party requests any payment from the Sellers in respect of any Damages pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)_ and the Acquired Companies or the Alon Indemnified Party could have recovered all or a part of such Damages from a third party (a " _Potential Contributor_ ") based on the underlying claim asserted against the Sellers, the Alon Indemnified Party shall assign, on a non-recourse basis and without any representation or warranty, such of its rights to proceed against the Potential Contributor as are necessary to permit the Sellers to recover from the Potential Contributor any amount paid by the Sellers to the Alon Indemnified Parties. 

   

 7.7 _Sole and Exclusive Remedy_. Should the Closing occur, except as set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement and _Section 6.8(b)_, (i) Alons sole and exclusive remedies for any breach of the representations, warranties or covenants of the Sellers under this Agreement and any other Transaction Documents (other than claims of or causes of action arising from fraud or intentional misrepresentation by the Sellers), shall be the remedies provided in this _Article VII_ and _Article VIII_, and Alon hereby waives, from and after the Closing, any and all other remedies (other than claims of or causes of actions arising from fraud or intentional misrepresentation by the Sellers) which may be available at law or equity for any breach or alleged breach of the representations, warranties and covenants of the Sellers hereunder, and (ii) the Sellers sole and exclusive remedies for any breach of the representations, warranties or covenants of Alon under this Agreement and any other Transaction Documents (other than claims of or causes of action arising from fraud or intentional misrepresentation by Alon), shall be the remedies provided in this _Article VII_ and _Article VIII_, and each of the Sellers hereby waives, from and after the Closing, any and all other remedies (other than claims of or causes of actions arising from fraud or intentional misrepresentation by Alon) which may be available at law or equity for any breach or alleged breach of the representations, warranties and covenants of Alon hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein will limit the right of any party to seek injunctive 

    ##### 

 

    

or other equitable relief for any breach or alleged or threatened breach of
any covenant in this Agreement or any other Transaction Document. 

   

ARTICLE VIII

 (ii) all losses resulting from any inaccuracy in or breach of the representations and warranties with respect to Tax matters that are contained in _Section 4.9_ or in this  _Article VIII_ and any covenants contained in this Agreement with respect to Tax matters (without giving effect to any supplement to the Sellers Disclosure Schedule delivered after the date hereof or any materiality qualifier), or contained in any certificate or other Transaction Document delivered pursuant hereto; and 

   

 (iii) all losses imposed on or sustained by Alon or its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies after the Closing Date), directly or indirectly, by reason of or in connection with the foregoing amounts. 

  

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sellers (i) shall only be liable for such amounts to the extent that such amounts are in excess of the amounts, if any, specifically reserved for such amounts (excluding any reserves for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) on the Closing Date Balance Sheet and (ii) shall in no event have any liability to Alon or any obligation to indemnify Alon for any Tax liability to the extent resulting from or related to the transactions contemplated by _Section 2.3(d)_. 

  

 (b) Alon shall be responsible for, and shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Sellers from and against: 

   

 (i) all Taxes of the Acquired Companies that are due with respect to periods commencing after the Closing Date; 

   

 (ii) all Taxes of the Acquired Companies that are due with respect to Straddle Periods to the extent attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period commencing on the day following the Closing Date; 

   

 (iii) all losses resulting from any breach of any covenants of Alon and Alon contained in this Agreement with respect to tax matters or contained in any certificate or other Transaction Document delivered by Alon pursuant hereto; 

   ##### 

  

   

 (iv) Taxes of the Acquired Companies that are due with respect to the transactions contemplated by _Section 2.3(d)_; and 

   

 (v) all losses imposed on or sustained by the Sellers or their Affiliates, directly or indirectly, by reason or in connection with the foregoing amounts. 

  

 (c) For purposes of this _Article VIII_, whenever it is necessary to determine the liability for Taxes of the Acquired Companies for a Straddle Period, the determination of the Taxes for the portion of the Straddle Period ending on and including, and the portion of the Straddle Period beginning after, the Closing Date shall be determined by assuming that the Straddle Period consisted of two taxable years or periods, one of which ended at the close of the Closing Date and the other of which began at the beginning of the day following the Closing Date, and items of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit, and state and local apportionment factors of the Acquired Companies for the Straddle Period shall be allocated between such two taxable years or periods on a "closing of the books basis" by assuming that the books of the Acquired Companies were closed at the close of business on the Closing Date; _provided however_ , (i) exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis, such as the deduction for depreciation; and (ii) periodic taxes, such as real and personal property taxes, shall be apportioned ratably between such periods on a daily basis; _provided further however_ , except with respect to any deduction for Employee Cash Bonuses and the Company Transaction Expenses (which shall be allocated to the pre-Closing Straddle Period), Alon and Sellers agree to report all transactions not in the ordinary course of business occurring on the Closing Date after Alons purchase of the Shares on Alons Federal income tax return to the extent permitted by Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 8.1_, any item of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit with respect to the transactions contemplated by  _Section 6.14_ shall be allocated to the pre-Closing Straddle Period and any items of income, gains, deduction, loss or credit with respect to the transaction contemplated by _Section 2.3(d)_ shall be allocated to the post-Closing Straddle Period. 

  

 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the obligations of the Sellers and Alon under this _Article VIII_ shall be unconditional and absolute, and shall not be subject to a deductible, threshold, or similar concept, but the representations of the Sellers set forth in _Section 4.9_ shall be subject to the $40,000,000 cap in _Section 7.3(c)_ and such representations shall remain in effect until 90 days after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations as set forth in _Section 7.1_. 

  

 8.2 _Tax Returns_. 

  

 (a) Alon shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns for the Acquired Companies that are filed after the Closing Date. 

  

 (b) All Tax Returns that are to be prepared and filed by Alon pursuant to the preceding paragraph and that relate to Taxes for which the Sellers are liable under this _Article VIII_ (including Straddle Period Tax Returns) shall be submitted to the Sellers not later than 15 days prior to the due date for filing of such Tax Returns, taking into account applicable extensions (or if such due date is within 45 days following the Closing Date, as promptly as practicable following the Closing Date). The Sellers shall have the right to review such Tax 

   ##### 

  

    

Returns and to review all work papers and procedures used to prepare any such
Tax Return. If the Sellers Representative, within 10 days after delivery of
any such Tax Return, notifies Alon in writing that it objects to any of the
items in such Tax Return, the parties shall attempt in good faith to resolve
the dispute and, if they are unable to do so, the disputed items shall be
resolved (within a reasonable time, taking into account the deadline for
filing such Tax Return) by an internationally recognized independent
accounting firm chosen by both Alon and the Sellers. Upon resolution of all
such items, the relevant Tax Return shall be filed on that basis. The
costs, fees and expenses of such accounting firm shall be borne equally by
Alon and the Sellers. 

  

 (c) Alon shall not (and shall not cause or permit the Acquired Companies to) amend, refile or otherwise modify (or grant an extension of any statute of limitation with respect to) any Tax Return relating in whole or in part to the Acquired Companies with respect to any taxable year or period ending on or before the Closing Date or with respect to any Straddle Period without the prior written consent of the Sellers Representative, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Sellers shall not amend, refile, or otherwise modify any such Tax Return if such action could have an adverse affect on the liability of the Acquired Companies, without the prior written consent of Alon, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

  

 (d) All sales, use, transfer and other similar Taxes, including any stock transfer stamp Taxes resulting from the sale of the Shares, shall be borne jointly and severally by the Sellers. 

  

 8.3 _Contest Provisions_. 

  

 (a) In the event (i) any Seller or their Affiliates or (ii) Alon or its Affiliates receive notice of any pending or threatened Tax audits or assessments or other disputes concerning Taxes with respect to which the other party may incur liability under this _Article VIII_, the party in receipt of such notice shall promptly notify the other party of such matter in writing, provided that failure to comply with this provision shall not affect a partys right to indemnification hereunder unless such failure materially adversely affects the partys ability to challenge such Tax audits or assessments. 

  

 (b) The Sellers shall have the sole right to represent the interests of the Acquired Companies in any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding relating to any Tax for any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date, and to employ counsel of their choice at their expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sellers shall not be entitled to settle, either administratively or after the commencement of litigation, any claim for Taxes with respect to any Tax Return of any of the Acquired Companies which would adversely affect the liability for Taxes of Alon or the Acquired Companies for any period after the Closing Date to any extent (including, but not limited to, the imposition of income Tax deficiencies, the reduction of asset basis or cost adjustments, the lengthening of any amortization or depreciation periods, the denial of amortization or depreciation deductions, or the reduction of the loss or credit carry forwards) without the prior written consent of Alon, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) Alon shall have the sole right to represent the interests of the Acquired Companies in any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding relating to Taxes with respect to taxable periods including (but not ending on) or beginning after the Closing Date and to employ counsel of its choice at its expense, provided that Alon shall not be entitled to settle, either administratively or after the commencement of litigation, any claim regarding Taxes that would adversely affect the liability of the Sellers for any Taxes for any period ending on or before the Closing Date or for any Straddle Period, without the prior consent of the Sellers Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and shall not be required to the extent that Alon has indemnified the Sellers against the effects of such settlement. Where consent to a settlement is withheld by the Sellers Representative pursuant to this section, the Sellers may continue or initiate any further proceedings at their own expense, Alon shall not be obligated to incur any further expenses in such matter and the liability of Alon, after giving effect to this Agreement, shall not exceed the liability that would have resulted from the settlement or amended return. 

  

 8.4 _Assistance and Cooperation_. After the Closing Date, the Sellers, on the one hand, and Alon, on the other hand, shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates to): (a) assist the other party in preparing and filing any Tax Returns or reports which such other party is responsible for preparing and filing in accordance with this _Article VIII_; (b) cooperate fully in preparing for any audits of, or disputes with taxing authorities regarding, any Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies; (c) make available to the other and to any taxing authority as reasonably requested all information, records, and documents relating to Taxes of the Acquired Companies; (d) provide timely notice to the other in writing of any pending or threatened Tax audits or assessments of the Acquired Companies for taxable periods for which the other may have a liability under this _Article VIII_; and (e) furnish the other with copies of all correspondence received from any taxing authority in connection with any Tax audit or information request with respect to any such taxable period. 

  

 8.5 _Retention of Records_. After the Closing Date, the Sellers, Alon and the Acquired Companies will preserve all information, records or documents relating to liabilities for Taxes of the Acquired Companies until six months after the expiration of any applicable statute of limitations (including extensions thereof) with respect to the assessment of such Taxes, provided that neither party shall dispose of any of the foregoing items without first offering such items to the other party. 

  

 8.6 _Refunds and Tax Benefit_. Except to the extent included as current assets in the Closing Date Adjusted Book Value, any Tax refunds that are received by Alon or the Acquired Companies, and any amount credited against Tax to which Alon or the Acquired Companies become entitled, that relate to the Tax periods or portions thereof ending on or before the Closing Date (including, without limitation, the pre-Closing Straddle Period) shall be for the account of the Sellers, and Alon shall pay to the Sellers, in their Pro Rata Portions, any such refund or the amount of any such credit within 15 days after receipt or entitlement thereto. In addition, to the extent that a claim for refund or a proceeding results in a payment or credit against Tax by a taxing authority to Alon or the Acquired Companies of any amount accrued as a current liability in the Closing Date Adjusted Book Value, Alon shall pay such amount to the Sellers, in their Pro Rata Portions, within 15 days after receipt or entitlement thereto. 

   ##### 

  

  

 8.7 _Other Provisions_. The provisions of this _Article VIII_ (and not _Section 7.2_ ) shall govern all indemnity claims with respect to Tax matters of the Acquired Companies and the Stock Purchase pursuant to this Agreement. All indemnity payments under this Agreement and any adjustment to any payment of the Purchase Price as described in _Section 2.3_ shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price paid for the Shares for tax purposes.

 (a) all of the representations and warranties of Alon set forth in this Agreement, shall be true and correct as of the Closing Date (except to the extent such representations and warranties speak as of an earlier date, in which case such representation or warranty shall be true and correct as of such earlier date), without regard to any materiality qualifier contained in such representations and warranties, except where the failure to be so true and correct, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Alon or a material adverse effect upon the consummation of the Stock Purchase;

 9.4 _Remedies in the Event of Certain Material Adverse Effects on the Company_. 

  

 (a) If after the date hereof and prior to the Closing or the termination of this Agreement, there shall be an event, circumstance or occurrence that causes the failure of any condition to the obligation of Alon set forth in _Section 9.2(a),_ _(b)_ , or _(f)_ (a " _Pre-Closing Adverse Change_ ") and the Damages that could reasonably be expected to result from such Pre-Closing Adverse Change (the " _Damage Estimate"_ ) are in the aggregate no more than $40,000,000, then the Sellers may elect to extend the Termination Date to a date no more than 30 days after the occurrence of such Pre-Closing Adverse Change and (i) if the Damages or other effects resulting from such Pre-Closing Adverse Change are curable, to cure the Damages or other effects resulting from such Pre-Closing Adverse Change in all material respects, or (ii) in the event that such Damages or effects are not curable, or the Sellers elect not to cure such Damages or effects, the Sellers may elect to proceed with the Closing, subject to and in accordance with subsection (c) below. For purposes of determining whether the Damage Estimate is no more than $40,000,000 or more 

   ##### 

  

    

than $40,000,000 in the context of determining whether Alon is obligated to
proceed with the Closing pursuant to _Section 9.4(c)_ below, the Damage
Estimate shall be determined without regard to any insurance, condemnation or
other proceeds. For purposes of determining the amount of any adjustment to
the Purchase Price (and, if applicable, the Cash Payment) pursuant to this 
_Section 9.4_, the Damage Estimate shall exclude any Damages to the extent
that such Damages shall have or have had the effect of reducing the Purchase
Price (and the Cash Payment) pursuant to  _Section 2.3(a)_ and shall be
reduced by the amount of any insurance, condemnation or other proceeds
previously received by the Acquired Companies (and, if so received prior to
the Closing, retained by the Acquired Companies), and not included in the
Closing Date Adjusted Book Value. If following any reduction in the Purchase
Price (and, if applicable, the Cash Payment) pursuant to this _Section 9.4_,
the Acquired Companies receive any insurance, condemnation or other proceeds
which duplicate, in whole or in part, such reduction in the Purchase Price
(and, if applicable, the Cash Payment), Alon shall remit to the Sellers in
their Pro Rata Portions an amount equal to the amount of such insurance,
condemnation or other proceeds actually so received by the Acquired Companies
which duplicate, in whole or in part, such reduction in the Purchase Price
(and, if applicable, the Cash Payment). 

  

 (b) If after seven days following the election set forth in subsection (a)(ii) above, the parties have not mutually agreed, after using their good faith reasonable best efforts, to the amount of the Damage Estimate, the parties shall pursue such valuation and/or dispute resolution mechanisms as may be reasonably appropriate and available to the parties to permit in all due haste a determination of the amount of the Damage Estimate prior to the Termination Date, such mechanism to include each party designating one independent expert in the profession most relevant to the nature of the Damages. 

   

 (c) (i) If prior to the Termination Date (as extended pursuant to this _Section 9.4_ , if applicable), the parties (or their independent experts, if applicable) have mutually determined the amount of the Damage Estimate and such amount is no more than $40,000,000, and all other conditions set forth in _Sections 9.1_, _9.2_ and  _9.3_ have been satisfied or waived, the parties shall proceed with the Closing and the Purchase Price (and Cash Payment) shall be reduced by the agreed amount of the Damage Estimate and the relevant condition set forth in _Section 9.2_, to the extent not satisfied as a result of the Post-Closing Adverse Change, shall be deemed satisfied. If, prior to the Termination Date (as extended pursuant to this _Section 9.4_, if applicable), the parties (or their independent experts, if applicable) have mutually determined that the Damage Estimate is greater than $40,000,000 (whether or not the specific amount of the Damage Estimate has been determined) the relevant condition set forth in  _Section 9.2_ shall be deemed to not have been satisfied and Alon shall have all remedies available to it under this Agreement. 

   

 (ii) If, prior to the Termination Date (as extended pursuant to this _Section 9.4_ , if applicable), neither the parties nor their independent experts have mutually determined that the Damage Estimate is either more than $40,000,000 or not more than $40,000,000, the Sellers may elect to extend the Termination Date by an additional fifteen days and the parties experts shall promptly provide their respective best and good faith estimate of the Damage Estimate to a third independent expert mutually selected by the parties experts (the " _Third Expert_ "), together with all information, materials, work 

   ##### 

  

    

papers and other data utilized or developed by the parties experts in
connection with their efforts to determine the amount of the Damage
Estimate. 

   

 (A) If, prior to the Termination Date (as further extended pursuant to this clause (ii)), the Third Expert shall have determined the amount of the Damage Estimate, and such amount is no more than $40,000,000, and all other conditions set forth in _Sections 9.1_, _9.2_ and _9.3_ have been satisfied or waived, the parties shall proceed with the Closing and the Purchase Price (and Cash Payment) shall be reduced by the amount of the Damage Estimate (so determined) and the relevant condition set forth in _Section 9.2_, to the extent not satisfied as a result of the specific event, circumstance or occurrence giving rise to the Damage Estimate, shall be deemed satisfied. 

   

 (B) If, prior to the Termination Date (as further extended pursuant to this clause (ii)), the Third Expert shall have determined that the Damage Estimate is greater than $40,000,000 (whether or not the specific amount of the Damage Estimate has been determined), the relevant condition set forth in _Section 9.2_ shall be deemed to not have been satisfied and Alon shall have all remedies available to it under this Agreement. 

   

 (C) If, prior to the Termination Date (as further extended pursuant to this clause (ii)), the Third Expert shall have determined that the Damage Estimate is less than $40,000,000, but has not determined the specific amount of the Damage Estimate, then if all other conditions set forth in _Sections 9.1_,  _9.2_ and _9.3_ have been satisfied or waived, (A) the parties shall proceed with the Closing, (B) the relevant condition set forth in _Section 9.2_ , to the extent not satisfied as a result of the Post-Closing Adverse Change, shall be deemed satisfied, (C) the Purchase Price (and Cash Payment), shall be reduced by the Third Experts good faith best estimate of the amount of the Damage Estimate, and (D) the Third Expert shall, within 30 days after the Closing, make a final determination of the amount of the Damage Estimate. If the final amount of the Damage Estimate determined by the Third Expert in such 30 day period exceeds the reduction to the Purchase Price (and Cash Payment) made at Closing pursuant to the proceeding sentence, the Sellers shall promptly pay the amount of the difference to Alon. If the final amount of the Damage Estimate determined by the Third Expert is less than such reduction to the Purchase Price (and Cash Payment) made at Closing, Alon shall promptly pay the amount of the difference to the Sellers. 

   

 (iii) If, prior to the Termination Date (as extended pursuant to this _Section 9.4_ , if applicable) the parties or their independent experts have mutually determined that the Damage Estimate is no more than $40,000,000, but neither the parties nor their independent experts have mutually agreed to the specific amount of the Damage Estimate, then if all other conditions set forth in _Sections 9.1_, _9.2_ and _9.3_ have been satisfied or waived, (A) the parties shall proceed with the Closing, (B) the relevant condition set forth in _Section 9.2_, to the extent not satisfied as a result of the Post-Closing Adverse Change shall be deemed satisfied, (C) the Purchase Price (and Cash Payment) shall be reduced by the average of each parties experts good faith best estimate of the 

   ##### 

  

    

amount of the Estimated Damages, and (D) the parties experts shall promptly
provide their best and good faith estimate of the Damage Estimate to the
Third Expert, together with all information, materials, work papers and other
data utilized or developed by the parties experts in connection with their
efforts to determine the amount of the Damage Estimate. The Third Expert
shall make a final determination of the amount of the Damage Estimate
which determination shall be (1) either the amount of the Damage Estimate
proposed by either partys expert or an amount between such two proposals and
(2) determined by such Third Expert no later than 30 days after the Closing
Date. If the final amount of the Damage Estimate so determined exceeds the
reduction to Purchase Price (and Cash Payment) made at Closing pursuant to
the preceding sentence, the Sellers shall promptly pay the amount of
the difference to Alon. If the final amount of the Damage Estimate so
determined is less than such reduction to the Purchase Price (and Cash
Payment) made at Closing, Alon shall promptly pay the amount of the
difference to the Sellers. 

  

 (d) For all purposes of _Section 9.4(c)_, in the event that any Damage Estimate provided by an expert engaged pursuant to this _Section 9.4_ shall consist of a range of possible amounts of the Damage Estimate, the midpoint amount in such range shall be deemed to be the Damage Estimate provided by such expert. 

  

 (e) Any mutual determination by the parties or the parties experts regarding the Damage Estimate, and any determination by the Third Expert regarding the Damage Estimate, shall be final and binding on the parties. Each party shall bear all costs and expenses of its respective expert and the costs and expenses of the Third Expert shall be shared equally by the parties. Each party shall act in good faith with respect to all matters arising under this _Section 9.4_, including in negotiating and determining the amount of any Damage Estimate and in its selection of and dealings with its respective independent expert. Each party will fully cooperate with the other party and each of the experts engaged pursuant to this _Section 9.4_ in the efforts to determine the amount of any Damage Estimate, including the provision of access to any property or facility of any affected Acquired Company and the provision of all information, materials, documents and other data relevant to such determination.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if this Agreement is terminated by a party because of the willful breach of the Agreement by another party or because one or more of the conditions to the terminating partys obligations under this Agreement is not satisfied as a result of another partys willful failure to comply with its obligations under this Agreement, the terminating partys right to pursue all legal remedies will survive such termination unimpaired. 

  

ARTICLE XI 
 MISCELLANEOUS 

   

 11.1 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. 

  

 (a) This Agreement (including the documents, schedules, exhibits and instruments referred to herein) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, and all contemporaneous oral agreements and understandings among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof. 

  

 (b) Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder will be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of each of the other parties hereto; _provided, however_ , that Alon may assign all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to any Subsidiary of Alon without the consent of the Sellers (which such assignment shall not relieve Alon of any obligation or liability under this Agreement). 

  

 (c) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. 

  

 11.2 _Validity_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision or portion of any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable Law or rule in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect the validity, legality or enforceability of any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction in such manner as will effect as nearly as lawfully possible the purposes and intent of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision. 

  

 11.3 _Notices_. All notices, requests, claims, demands and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when delivered in person, by overnight courier or facsimile to the respective parties as follows:

or to such other address as the Person to whom notice is given may have
previously furnished to the other in writing in the manner set forth above;
provided that notice of any change of address shall be effective only upon
receipt thereof. 

   

 11.4 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, regardless of the laws or rules that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof. In the event of the bringing of any action or suit by a party hereto against another party hereunder arising out of or relating to this Agreement, then in that event, (i) the sole forum for resolving such disputes shall be the federal courts located in Orange County, California, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably submits to such exclusive jurisdiction, and (ii) the prevailing party in such action or dispute, whether by final judgment, or out of court settlement shall be entitled to have and recover of and from the non-prevailing parties all costs and expenses of suit, including actual attorneys fees. Any judgment or order entered in any final judgment shall contain a specific provision providing for the recovery of all costs and expenses of suit, including actual attorneys fees (collectively " _Costs_ ") incurred in enforcing, perfecting and executing such judgment. For the purposes of this paragraph, Costs shall include, without limitation, attorneys fees, costs and expenses incurred in (a) appeals, (b) post-judgment motions, (c) contempt proceeding, (d) garnishment, levy, and debtor and third party examination, (e) discovery, and (f) bankruptcy litigation. 

  

 11.5 _Specific Performance_. The parties recognize that if the Sellers refuse to perform under the provisions of this Agreement, monetary damages alone will not be adequate to compensate Alon for its injury. Alon shall therefore be entitled, in addition to any other remedies that may be available, to obtain specific performance of this Agreement. If any action is brought by Alon to enforce this Agreement, the Sellers shall waive the defense that there is an adequate remedy at law. In the event of a default by the Sellers which results in the filing of a lawsuit for damages, specific performance, or other remedies, Alon shall be entitled to reimbursement from the Sellers of reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred by Alon. 

  

 11.6 _Construction_. The headings herein are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to be part of or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Unless the context clearly requires otherwise "or" is not exclusive, and "includes" means "includes, but is not limited to." 

  

 11.7 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, including facsimile counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile transmission shall be effective delivery of a manually executed counterpart to this Agreement. 

  

 11.8 _Parties In Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, including any employee or former employee of the Acquired Companies (or any beneficiary or dependent thereof), except that each Alon Indemnified Party and Seller 

   ##### 

  

    

Indemnified Party shall be a third party beneficiary with respect to _Article
VII_ and shall be entitled to the rights and benefits of, and to enforce, the
provisions thereof. 

  

 11.9 _Waiver_. No waiver of any breach of the provisions of this Agreement will be deemed to have been made by any party, unless such waiver is expressed in writing and signed by the party against which it is to be enforced. The waiver by any party of any right under this Agreement or to a remedy for the breach of any of the provisions herein shall not operate nor be construed by the breaching party as a waiver of the non-breaching partys remedies with respect to any other or continuing or subsequent breach. 

  

 11.10 _Amendments_. No amendment or modification in respect of this Agreement shall be effective unless it shall be in writing and signed by the parties hereto. 

  

 11.11 _Further Assurances; Post Closing Cooperation_. The parties agree (a) to furnish upon request to each other such further information, (b) to execute and deliver to each other such other documents, and (c) to do such other acts and things, all as any other party hereto may reasonably request for the purpose of carrying out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. After the Closing Date, Alon shall provide the Sellers reasonable access, during normal business hours and on at least three Business Days prior notice, to the records of the Acquired Companies relating to periods prior to the Closing Date for any reasonable purpose. After the Closing, Alon shall cause the Acquired Companies to fulfill all of their obligations hereunder, and shall guarantee such performance. 

  

 11.12 _Cumulative Remedies_. The rights, remedies, powers and privileges herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by law. 

  

 11.13 _Disclosure_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Disclosure Schedules or in this Agreement, the information and disclosures contained in any section of the Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be disclosed and incorporated by reference in any other section of the Disclosure Schedule as though fully set forth in such section of the Disclosure Schedule to the extent that the applicability of such information and disclosure is reasonably apparent on its face. The fact that any item of information is disclosed in any section of the Disclosure Schedule shall not be construed to mean that such information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement. Such information and the dollar thresholds set forth herein shall not be used as a basis for interpreting the terms "material" or "Material Adverse Effect" or other similar terms in this Agreement.
