X</U> is in addition to any other rights it may have under this Agreement or otherwise, and the
exercise of a right of termination will not be an election of remedies. If this Agreement is
terminated, all further obligations of the parties under this Agreement will terminate, except that
<U>Sections&nbsp;6.3</U> and <U>6.5</U> and <U>Article&nbsp;XI</U> hereof and the Confidentiality
Agreement will survive. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if this Agreement is terminated by a party
because of the willful breach of the Agreement by another party or because one or more of the
conditions to the terminating party&#146;s obligations under this Agreement is not satisfied as a result
of another party&#146;s willful failure to comply with its obligations under this Agreement, the
terminating party&#146;s right to pursue all legal remedies will survive such termination unimpaired.

with the laws of the State of California, regardless of the laws or rules that might otherwise
govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof. In the event of the bringing of
any action or suit by a party hereto against another party hereunder arising out of or relating to
this Agreement, then in that event, (i)&nbsp;the sole forum for resolving such disputes shall be the
federal courts located in Orange County, California, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably
submits to such exclusive jurisdiction, and (ii)&nbsp;the prevailing party in such action or dispute,
whether by final judgment, or out of court settlement shall be entitled to have and recover of and
from the non-prevailing parties all costs and expenses of suit, including actual attorneys&#146; fees.
Any judgment or order entered in any final judgment shall contain a specific provision providing
for the recovery of all costs and expenses of suit, including actual attorneys&#146; fees (collectively
"<B><I>Costs</I></B>&#148;) incurred in enforcing, perfecting and executing such judgment. For the purposes of this
paragraph, Costs shall include, without limitation, attorneys&#146; fees, costs and expenses incurred in

perform under the provisions of this Agreement, monetary damages alone will not be adequate to
compensate Alon for its injury. Alon shall therefore be entitled, in addition to any other
remedies that may be available, to obtain specific performance of this Agreement. If any action is
brought by Alon to enforce this Agreement, the Sellers shall waive the defense that there is an
adequate remedy at law. In the event of a default by the Sellers which results in the filing of a
lawsuit for damages, specific performance, or other remedies, Alon shall be entitled to
reimbursement from the Sellers of reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred by Alon.
