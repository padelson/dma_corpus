THE MERGER

  

  

Section 2.1 The Merger.

  

  

Upon and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the other
Transaction Documents and Section 13.1-716 of the VSCA, Merger Sub will be
merged with and into the Company at and as of the Effective Time (the
"Merger"). The Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger (the
"Surviving Corporation") and shall become a wholly-owned indirect Subsidiary
of the Purchaser. The separate existence of Merger Sub shall terminate at and
as of the Effective Time.

  

  

Section 2.2 Effect of the Merger.

  

  

(a) General. The Merger shall become effective at 5:00 p.m., Richmond,
Virginia time, on the Closing Date or at such later time as may be agreed to
by the Company in writing and specified in the Articles of Merger (the
"Effective Time"). The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the VSCA.

  

  

(b) Articles of Incorporation. The Articles of Incorporation of the Company
shall be amended and restated at and as of the Effective Time to be in the
form of the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit 2.2(b) and as so amended shall be the articles of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

(c) Bylaws. The bylaws of the Company shall be amended and restated at and as
of the Effective Time to be in the form of the Bylaws attached hereto as
Exhibit 2.2(c) and as so amended shall be the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation.

  

  

(d) Directors and Officers. The parties shall take all requisite action so
that the directors and officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the initial directors and officers of the Surviving
Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the articles of
incorporation and the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until
their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Surviving
Corporation's articles of incorporation and bylaws as in effect from time to
time.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

17  

  

 

 

 

  

Section 2.3 Conversion of Shares and Options.

  

  

(a) Conversion of Company Shares in the Merger. At and as of the Effective
Time, except as provided below and in Section 2.4, each Company Share that is
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by
operation of law, be converted into and represent the right to receive the Per
Share Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and each certificate that theretofore evidenced ownership of any
such Company Share (each, a "Stock Certificate") shall instead only evidence
the right to receive such Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the applicable provisions of
the VSCA. Each Company Share that is held by the Company immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall, by operation of law, be canceled and retired and no
consideration or payment shall be made or delivered in respect of such Company
Share. From and after the Effective Time, no Company Share shall be deemed to
be outstanding or to have any rights whatsoever, other than those expressly
set forth in this Section 2.3(a) or Section 2.4. The payment of Merger
Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.3(a) shall be deemed to have been
issued in full, final and complete satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
all of the Company Shares, and, from and after the Effective Time, there shall
be no further registration of transfers on the books of the Surviving
Corporation of any Company Shares that were issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Stock
Certificates representing any Company Shares that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any
reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement
and the Paying Agent Agreement.

  

  

(b) Conversion of Merger Sub Shares in the Merger. At and as of the Effective
Time, each share of the common stock of Merger Sub that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of the common stock,
no par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation and each stock
certificate that theretofore evidenced ownership of any share of the common
stock of Merger Sub shall instead, from and after the Effective Time, evidence
only ownership of such shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

(c) Effect of the Merger on Company Options. No later than ten days prior to
the Closing Date, each unvested Exempt Option granted under the 2008 Plan held
by a Selected Employee (each, as defined in the 2008 Plan), and each unvested
Company Option granted under the 2000 Plan held by a Selected Employee (as
defined in the 2000 Plan), shall vest and become exercisable in full, with the
vesting and exercise of any such accelerated Company Option subject to and
conditioned upon the occurrence of the Closing. At and as of the Effective
Time, each Company Option that is issued and outstanding and that has not been
exercised or forfeited as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall
vest and become exercisable in full to the extent not previously vested and
exercisable and shall entitle the holder thereof to the right to receive from
the Surviving Corporation, at Closing, (i) to the extent such holder is an
Accredited Investor as set forth in Section 2.3(f), a cash payment and
Purchaser Stock in an aggregate amount equal to the product of (A) the excess
of (1) the Per Share Merger Consideration over (2) the exercise price per
Company Share of such Company Option, and (B) the number of Company Shares
subject to such Company Option; or (ii) to the extent such holder is not an
Accredited Investor as set forth in Section 2.3(f), a cash payment in an
aggregate amount equal to the product of (A) the excess of (1) the Per Share
Merger Consideration over (2) the exercise price per Company Share of such
Company Option, and (B) the number of Company Shares subject to such Company
Option (collectively, the "Option Payments"). To the extent that any Non-
Exempt Option (as defined in the 2008 Plan) has vested and become payable as
of the Closing, but has not yet been paid and canceled, the Option Payments
contemplated by this Section 2.3(c) shall be in full satisfaction of any and
all right to payment in respect of such Non-Exempt Option and shall not result
in any duplication of payment or benefits thereunder. The Option Payments to
holders of Company Options who are Accredited Investors as provided in clause
(i) above shall be allocated to each such Company Option in the same ratio as
the Cash Merger Consideration and the Stock Merger Consideration are allocated
pursuant to Section 2.9(c) for Company Shareholders who have made a Cash and
Stock Election. At and as of the Effective Time, each agreement or other
document that theretofore evidenced any Company Option shall instead only
evidence the right to receive the Option Payment with respect to such Company
Option and in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. From
and after the Effective Time, no holder of any Company Option shall have any
rights in respect thereof other than to receive payment of the Option Payment
with respect to such holder's Company Options as set forth in this Section
2.3(c). Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions
necessary or desirable to effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.3(c),
including without limitation, providing any required notices and obtaining any
necessary consents. Any notices or other communications in respect of Company
Options shall be subject to review and approval by the Purchaser prior to
distribution to holders of Company Options, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

18  

  

 

 

 

  

(d) Effect of the Merger on SARs Payments. At and as of the Effective Time,
each performance unit (each a "Performance Unit") granted pursuant to the
Company's Top Performers Equity Plan, effective as of August 16, 1999, as
amended (the "SARs Plan"), that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall vest and be deemed exercised in full, and shall
entitle the holder thereof to the right to receive from the Surviving
Corporation, at the Closing, a lump-sum cash payment in an aggregate amount
equal to the product of (i) the excess of (A) the Per Share Merger
Consideration minus (B) the value of such Performance Unit (as determined
pursuant to the SARs Plan) on the date of the grant thereof, and (ii) the
number of identically valued Performance Units held by such participant in the
SARs Plan (all such payments collectively, the "SARs Payments"). At and as of
the Effective Time, each agreement or other document that theretofore
evidenced any Performance Unit shall instead only evidence the right to
receive the SARs Payment with respect to such Performance Unit in accordance
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. From and after the Effective
Time, no holder of a Performance Unit shall have any rights in respect thereof
other than to receive payment of the SARs Payment with respect to such
holder's Performance Units as set forth in this Section 2.3(d). Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary or desirable to
effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.3(d), including without
limitation, providing any required notices and obtaining any necessary
consents.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

19  

  

 

 

 

  

(e) Tax Withholding. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement: (i) the Purchaser, the Paying Agent, the Company and the Surviving
Corporation shall each be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration payable or otherwise deliverable to any holder of Company Shares
or Company Options or Performance Units under this Agreement such amounts from
the Cash Merger Consideration, and if not sufficient to cover such withholding
then from the Stock Consideration, as are required to be deducted or withheld
therefrom under applicable Law; and (ii) to the extent that such amounts are
so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under
this Agreement as having been paid to the applicable holder of Company Shares
or Company Options or Performance Units in respect to which such deduction and
withholding were made by the Purchaser, the Paying Agent, the Company or the
Surviving Corporation, as applicable.

  

  

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, a Company
Shareholder or holder of Company Options shall be entitled to receive shares
of Purchaser Stock in connection with the Merger only if such Company
Shareholder or holder (i) provides all documentation reasonably requested by
the Purchaser to allow the Purchaser to issue the Purchaser Stock to such
Person in a manner that satisfies the requirements of Rule 506 of Regulation D
under the Securities Act, including certifications to the Purchaser: (A) that
such Company Shareholder or holder, as the case may be, is and will be, as of
the Effective Time, an "accredited investor" (as such term is defined in Rule
501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act); (B) as to the basis on which
such Company Shareholder or holder, as the case may be, is an accredited
investor; and (C) that the Purchaser Stock is being acquired for such Company
Shareholder's or holder's, as the case may be, account for investment only and
not with a view towards, or with any intention of, a distribution or resale
thereof (a Person who satisfies all of the preceding requirements, an
"Accredited Investor") and (ii) executes and delivers a joinder to the
Investor Rights Agreement and a Non-Compete Agreement.

  

  

Section 2.4 Appraisal Rights.

  

  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any Company Share
that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and is held
by a Company Shareholder that has not voted in favor of the Merger or
consented thereto pursuant to Section 13.1-733 of the VSCA and that has
otherwise properly perfected such Company Shareholder's right to appraisal for
such Company Share in accordance with the VSCA (and who has not effectively
withdrawn nor lost such Company Shareholder's right to such appraisal), shall
not be converted into a right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration
with respect thereto pursuant to Section 2.3(a), but shall instead be
converted into only such rights as are granted pursuant to the applicable
provisions of the VSCA; provided, however, that any Company Share held by a
Company Shareholder who, after the Effective Time, withdraws such Company
Shareholder's demand or fails to perfect or otherwise loses such Company
Shareholder's right of appraisal pursuant to the applicable provisions of the
VSCA, shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into the
right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration with respect thereto
pursuant to Section 2.3(a), without interest thereon. The Company shall
provide the Purchaser with prompt written notice of any demands for appraisal
pursuant to the applicable provisions of the VSCA that are received by the
Company, any withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served
pursuant to the VSCA and received by the Company relating thereto, and the
Purchaser shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to such demands.

accordance with the terms of this Agreement; or (ii) at such other place, time
and date as the Purchaser and the Company may agree in writing. The date on
which the Closing takes place is referred to herein as the "Closing Date."

  

  

(b) At the Closing, Merger Sub and the Company shall file the Articles of
Merger with the SCC.

  

  

Section 2.6 Merger Consideration; Payments at Closing.

equal to the following:

  

  

(i) $217,000,000 of Purchaser Stock, valued at the Purchaser Stock Value (the

(ii) $383,000,000 in cash;

  

  

(A) plus, the Final Closing Cash;

  

  

(B) minus, the Senior Debt Payoff Amount and any other Company Indebtedness
outstanding at the Closing (other than any Current Liabilities included in the
calculation of NWC pursuant to Section 2.11);

  

  

(C) minus, the amount by which the Final NWC is less than the Target NWC, or
plus the amount by which the Final NWC is greater than the Target NWC; and

  

  

(D) minus, the Company Transaction Expenses (the amount resulting after such

For the avoidance of doubt, the amounts set forth in clause (C) above shall be
determined without double-counting for any amounts adjusted pursuant to
clauses (A), (B) or (D) above. The Merger Consideration shall be estimated at
the Closing in accordance with Section 2.6(b), and the Estimated Merger
Consideration shall be paid by the Purchaser on the Closing Date in accordance
with Section 2.6(c). The Estimated Merger Consideration is subject to
adjustment after the Closing in accordance with Section 2.11.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

21  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) At least five Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company shall
prepare in consultation with, and deliver to, the Purchaser, (i) a balance
sheet of the Company and estimated as of the Closing Date (the "Estimated
Closing Balance Sheet") and (ii) a schedule and worksheet setting forth the
Company's good faith estimate of the Merger Consideration (the "Estimated
Merger Consideration"), including: (A) a statement setting forth the Company's
good faith estimated Closing Cash (the "Estimated Closing Cash") and estimated
calculation of the NWC as of the Closing, to which the Purchaser and the
Company shall reasonably agree (the "Preliminary NWC Statement"), which shall:
(1) be in the form of the example NWC Statement set forth as Exhibit 2.6(b)
hereto (the "Example NWC Statement"); (2) be prepared in accordance with GAAP
consistent with the manner of preparation of the Company Financial Statements;

estimate of the Company Indebtedness outstanding as of the Closing, the

Expenses, the "Estimated Company Transaction Expenses"). The Company will
permit the Purchaser and its advisors and representatives reasonable access to
the books, records and other documents pertaining to or used in connection
with the preparation of the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, the schedule and
worksheet setting forth the Estimated Merger Consideration and the Preliminary
NWC Statement. If the NWC set forth on the Preliminary NWC Statement (the
"Estimated NWC") is less than the Target NWC, then the amount of such
shortfall will reduce the Cash Merger Consideration on a dollar-for-dollar
basis. If the Estimated NWC is greater than the Target NWC, then such excess
shall be added to the Cash Merger Consideration on a dollar-for-dollar basis
(any such reduction or increase in the Merger Consideration, the "Closing NWC
Adjustment"). The Estimated Closing Cash shall be added to the Cash Merger
Consideration and the Estimated Closing Indebtedness and Estimated Company
Transaction Expenses shall each be subtracted from the Cash Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 2.6(a).

  

  

(c) At the Closing, the Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid the Estimated
Merger Consideration, by wire transfer of immediately available funds and

set forth in Section 2.6(d)(ii) below and consisting of: (1) the Cash Merger
Consideration; and (2) the Stock Merger Consideration.

  

  

(d) At the Closing, the Purchaser shall also pay or cause to be paid:

  

  

(i) to the lenders under the Senior Debt Facilities, on behalf of the Company,
the Senior Debt Payoff Amount;

  

  

(ii) to the Company, the aggregate amount of the SARs Payments minus each
Performance Unit holder's Pro Rata Cash Share of the Escrowed Cash with
respect to such holder's Performance Units, for payment by the Company to each
participant in the SARs Plan; and

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

22  

  

 

 

 

  

(iii) to each of the Advisors, on behalf of the Company, their respective
portions of the Company Transaction Expenses.

(c) Following the determination of the Final NWC pursuant to Section 2.11(a)
and, if payable, the payment of the Downward Post-Closing NWC Adjustment
pursuant to Section 2.11(c), the Escrow Agent shall release from the Escrow

Performance Units pursuant to Section 2.10(b)) any remaining portion of the
Escrowed Cash. On the 15-month anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Escrow
Period Expiration Date"), the Escrow Agent shall release from the Escrow
Account to the Paying Agent (for further distribution by the Paying Agent to
the Company Shareholders pursuant to Section 2.10(b)(iv)) any remaining
portion of the Escrowed Shares minus Escrowed Shares equal in value to the sum
of the aggregate amount of unsatisfied or disputed claims for Losses specified
in Indemnity Claim Notices delivered by the Purchaser to the Shareholder
Representative on or prior to the Escrow Period Expiration Date (such
aggregate amount of unsatisfied or disputed claims for Losses, the "Pending
Claims Amount"). The Escrow Agent shall continue to hold the Pending Claims
Amount corresponding to each claim for Losses until the final resolution of
such claim, at which point, as and when such claim is resolved, the Escrow
Agent shall release shares of Purchaser Stock equal in value to the
appropriate portion of the Pending Claims Amount to the Paying Agent (for
further distribution by the Paying Agent to the Company Shareholders pursuant
to Section 2.10(b)(iv)) and/or to the Purchaser, as the case may be, depending
upon resolution of such claim.

  

  

(d) The Purchaser, the Company and the Shareholder Representative each agree
to promptly take commercially reasonable actions (including executing and
delivering joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent) requested by the
other to effect releases of Escrowed Cash and Escrowed Shares from the Escrow
Account, in each case in accordance with this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement.

  

  

Section 2.9 Merger Consideration Election.

  

  

(a) Each holder of Company Shares as of the Effective Time shall be entitled
to elect to receive, with respect to all of such holder's Company Shares,
either (i) Stock Merger Consideration only or (ii) Cash Merger Consideration
and Stock Merger Consideration, in each case pursuant to the terms and
conditions set forth in this Section 2.9.

  

  

(b) Stock Election. Each Company Share with respect to which an election to
receive Stock Merger Consideration only (a "Stock Election") has been
effectively made by the holder thereof as provided in Section 2.9(f) shall be
converted into the right to receive the number of duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Purchaser Stock determined by
dividing: (i) the Per Share Merger Consideration by (ii) the Purchaser Stock
Value.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

25  

  

 

 

 

  

(c) Cash and Stock Election. Each Company Share with respect to which an
election to receive Cash Merger Consideration and Stock Merger Consideration
(a "Cash and Stock Election" and, together with a Stock Election, an
"Election") has been effectively made by the holder thereof as provided in
Section 2.9(f) shall be converted into the right to receive an amount of cash,
without interest, and Purchaser Stock equal to the Per Share Merger
Consideration allocated as follows:

  

  

(i) an amount in cash equal to (i) (A) the Cash Merger Consideration minus (B)
the SARs Payments minus (C) the aggregate amount of cash payable to holders of
Company Options who are not Accredited Investors pursuant to Section
2.3(c)(ii) divided by (ii) (A) the number of Company Shares for which a Cash
and Stock Election has been made plus (B) the number of Outstanding Option
Shares held by holders of Company Options who are Accredited Investors; and

  

  

(ii) the number of duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable shares of Purchaser Stock determined by (i) dividing (A)(1) the
Stock Merger Consideration minus (2) the aggregate amount of the Stock Merger
Consideration issued to Company Shareholders who have made a Stock Election by
(B) (1) the number of Company Shares for which a Cash and Stock Election has
been made plus the number of Outstanding Option Shares held by holders of
Company Options who are Accredited Investors, and then dividing such amount by
(ii) the Purchaser Stock Value.

  

  

(d) Effect of Non-Election. Each Company Share with respect to which the
Company Shareholder has not made an effective Stock Election or Cash and Stock
Election as provided in Section 2.9(b) and (c), respectively, shall be deemed
to have made a Stock Election with respect to such Company Shareholder's
Company Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
including any Election, in no event will the Purchaser be required to issue
Purchaser Stock in excess of the Stock Merger Consideration or cash in excess
of the Cash Merger Consideration in connection with the Merger, and the Merger
Consideration allocated to each Company Shareholder will be adjusted as
necessary to ensure compliance with such requirement.

  

  

(e) Purchaser Stock Value. For purposes of this Agreement, the "Purchaser
Stock Value" shall be equal to the numerical average of the volume weighted
average prices on the NASDAQ Global Select for one share of Purchaser Stock
for the ten consecutive trading days immediately preceding the last trading
day prior to the Closing Date; provided, however, that if, during such ten
trading day period, the Purchaser pays a dividend in, splits, combines into a
smaller number of shares, or issues by reclassification any additional shares
of Purchaser Stock (a "Stock Event"), then the Purchaser Stock Value shall be
appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of Company Shares the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action, and as
so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event, be the Purchaser
Stock Value. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the Purchaser
Stock Value be less than $12.41 or more than $15.17 (e.g., if the calculation
of the Purchaser Stock Value in the first sentence of this paragraph would
produce a value of $12.00, then the Purchaser Stock Value will equal $12.41
and if such calculation of the Purchaser Stock Value would produce a value of
$16.00, then the Purchase Stock Value will equal $15.17). The floor of $12.41
and the ceiling of $15.17 will be adjusted as necessary to reflect any Stock
Event that occurs after the date hereof and prior to the Closing. The
Purchaser and the Company shall, prior to the Closing, jointly provide written
notice to the Paying Agent stating the Purchaser Stock Value.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

26  

  

 

 

 

  

(f) Form of Election. The Transmittal Letter provided by the Paying Agent to
Company Shareholders pursuant to Section 2.10 shall be accompanied by a form
of election directing each Company Shareholder to, prior to the Election
Deadline (as defined below), specify: (i) whether such Company Shareholder is
making a Cash and Stock Election or a Stock Election with respect to such
Company Shareholder's Company Shares (the "Form of Election"). For purposes of
this Agreement, the "Election Deadline" means 5:00 p.m., Richmond, Virginia
time, on the date that is ten Business Days following the date of the mailing
of the Transmittal Letter. Any Election shall have been effectively made only
if the Paying Agent shall have received at its designated office, prior to the
Election Deadline, a Form of Election properly completed and signed by the
applicable Company Shareholder and accompanied by the completed Transmittal
Letter and the Certificates representing the Company Shares as to which such
Form of Election relates (or a Lost Certificate Affidavit with respect to such
Company Shares, as provided in Section 2.10(c)).

  

  

(g) Determination and Interpretation of Elections. The good faith
determination of the Paying Agent (or the joint determination of the Purchaser
and the Company, if the Paying Agent declines to make any such determination)
shall be conclusive and binding as to whether or not a Cash and Stock Election
or Stock Election shall have been effectively made, revoked or invalidated
pursuant to this Section 2.9 and as to when any Cash and Stock Election or
Stock Election is received by the Paying Agent, absent manifest error. The
Paying Agent may, with the written agreement of the Purchaser after the
Purchaser's reasonable consultation with the Company, make any rules that are
consistent with this Section 2.9(g) for the implementation of the Cash and
Stock Elections and Stock Elections provided for in this Agreement as shall be
necessary or desirable to effect the Cash and Stock Elections and the Stock
Elections.

  

  

(h) Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no fractional shares of
Purchaser Stock shall be issued and if, after aggregating all shares of
Purchaser Stock (including fractional shares) that would be issued hereunder
to a Company Shareholder, such aggregate number of shares of Purchaser Stock
includes a fraction of a share of Purchaser Stock, such Company Shareholder
shall instead receive, with respect to its Company Shares: (A) the number of
full shares of Purchaser Stock determined by rounding down to the nearest
whole number of shares of Purchaser Stock, and (B) a cash payment equal to the
product of (1) such fraction of a share of Purchaser Stock, and (2) the
Purchaser Stock Value (a "Cash Payment in Lieu of Fractional Shares").

  

  

 

Section 2.10 Paying Agent.

  

  

(a) Designation of Paying Agent. The parties agree that Computershare Inc.
(the "Paying Agent") shall act as paying agent with respect to the
Transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to the terms and
conditions of a paying agent agreement by and among the Purchaser and the
Paying Agent, in the form to be mutually agreed upon (the "Paying Agent
Agreement").

 

  

 

 

 

  

 

27  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Payment of Merger Consideration. In accordance with the terms of the
Paying Agent Agreement, as soon as reasonably practicable prior to Closing,
the Paying Agent shall deliver to each Company Shareholder of record: (1) a
letter of transmittal in a form customary for transactions of a similar nature
and reasonably acceptable to the Paying Agent, the Purchaser and the Company
(a "Transmittal Letter"), which shall specify that delivery of the Stock
Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Stock
Certificates and the Company Shares evidenced thereby shall pass, only upon
the proper delivery of the Stock Certificates to the Paying Agent and
satisfaction of the other Merger Consideration Payment Conditions, and shall
be in such form and shall comply with such other requirements as are set forth
in the Paying Agent Agreement, (2) instructions as reasonably specified by the
Paying Agent for use in effecting the surrender of the Stock Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration with respect to the Company Shares
evidenced by such Stock Certificates pursuant to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement (the "Stock Certificate Surrender Instructions"), and (3) a
Form of Election as described in Section 2.9(f). Any Company Shareholder that
surrenders for cancellation to the Paying Agent the Stock Certificate(s)
evidencing such Company Shareholder's Company Shares in accordance with the
Stock Certificate Surrender Instructions, together with corresponding
Transmittal Letter, duly completed and executed, has complied with all other
requirements set forth in the instructions thereto, along with supplying to
the Paying Agent such Company Shareholder's completed and executed Form of
Election (collectively, the "Merger Consideration Payment Conditions"), shall
be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration with respect to the Company
Shares evidenced by such Stock Certificate(s) as follows:

  

  

(i) as soon as reasonably practicable after the later of: (A) the date on
which a Company Shareholder has satisfied the Merger Consideration Payment
Conditions; and (B) the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall: (1) with
respect to any Company Shareholder that has made a Cash and Stock Election or
a deemed Cash and Stock Election, in each case pursuant to Section 2.9, pay to
such Company Shareholder (x) the Cash Merger Consideration with respect to
such Company Shareholder's Company Shares in cash (less such Company
Shareholder's Pro Rata Cash Share of the Escrowed Cash with respect to such
Company Shareholder's Company Shares), without interest, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds and (y) the Stock Merger Consideration with
respect to such Company Shareholder's Company Shares (less such Company
Shareholder's Pro Rata Share of the Escrowed Shares), by delivery to such
Company Shareholder of a certificate evidencing such Stock Merger
Consideration, duly executed by the Purchaser, along with any applicable Cash
Payment in Lieu of Fractional Shares, in cash, without interest, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds; and (2) with respect to any Company
Shareholder that has made an effective Stock Election pursuant to Section 2.9,
deliver to such Company Shareholder the Stock Merger Consideration with
respect to such Company Shareholder's Company Shares (less such Company
Shareholder's Pro Rata Share of the Escrowed Shares), by delivery to such
Company Shareholder a certificate evidencing such Stock Merger Consideration,
duly executed by the Purchaser, along with any applicable Cash Payment in Lieu
of Fractional Shares, in cash, without interest, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds;

  

  

(ii) as soon as reasonably practicable after the later of: (A) the date on
which a Company Shareholder has satisfied the Merger Consideration Payment
Conditions; and (B) the Paying Agent's receipt of Upward Post-Closing NWC
Adjustment Merger Consideration by wire transfer of immediately available
funds pursuant to Section 2.11(c), the Paying Agent shall pay to each Company
Shareholder such Company's Shareholder's Pro Rata Cash Share of the Upward
Post-Closing NWC Adjustment Merger Consideration with respect to such Company
Shareholder's Company Shares in cash, without interest, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

28  

  

 

 

 

  

(iii) as soon as reasonably practicable after the later of: (A) the date on
which a Company Shareholder has satisfied the Merger Consideration Payment
Conditions; and (B) the Paying Agent's receipt of Escrowed Cash pursuant to
Section 2.8, the Paying Agent shall deliver to such Company Shareholder such
Company Shareholder's Pro Rata Cash Share of the Escrowed Cash with respect to
such Company Shareholder's Company Shares, without interest, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to such Company Shareholder; and

  

  

(iv) as soon as reasonably practicable after the later of: (A) the date on
which a Company Shareholder has satisfied the Merger Consideration Payment
Conditions; and (B) the Paying Agent's receipt of stock certificates
evidencing the Escrowed Shares in connection with any release of Escrowed
Shares pursuant to Section 2.8, the Paying Agent shall deliver to such Company
Shareholder such Company Shareholder's Pro Rata Share of the Escrowed Shares
with respect to such Company Shareholder's Company Shares, by delivery to such
Company Shareholder of a certificate evidencing such Escrowed Shares, duly
executed by the Purchaser, along with any applicable Cash Payment in Lieu of
Fractional Shares, in cash, without interest, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds.

  

  

No dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Purchaser Stock
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Stock Certificate until such
Stock Certificate is surrendered as provided above in this Section 2.10(b).
Subject to the effect of applicable Laws, following such surrender, there
shall be paid, without interest, to the record holder of the shares of
Purchaser Stock issued in exchange for Company Shares represented immediately
prior to the Effective Time by such Stock Certificate all dividends and other
distributions payable in respect of such Purchaser Stock with a record date
after the Effective Time.

  

  

In the event that a transfer of ownership of Company Shares is not registered
in the stock ledger of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be paid to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the Stock Certificate so
surrendered is registered as long as such Stock Certificate is properly
endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer, any signature guarantee or
other requirements reasonably requested by the Paying Agent have been
satisfied, and the Person requesting such payment pays any transfer or other
Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered
holder of such Stock Certificate or establishes to the satisfaction of the
Purchaser, the Company and the Paying Agent that such Taxes either have been
paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
2.10(b), each Stock Certificate shall be deemed, from and after the Effective
Time, subject to Section 2.4, to represent only the right to receive, upon
such surrender and satisfaction by the holder thereof of the Merger
Consideration Payment Conditions, the Merger Consideration with respect to the
Company Shares evidenced by such Stock Certificate, without interest. No
interest will be paid or will accrue on any amount payable upon the surrender
of any Stock Certificate.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

29  

  

 

 

 

  

The Paying Agent shall, with respect to each holder of Company Options that
has provided all documentation required by this Agreement, pay at the Closing
to such holder the Option Payments (less such holder's Pro Rata Cash Share of
the Escrowed Cash with respect to such holder's Company Options). Each holder
of Company Options or Performance Units shall be entitled to receive as soon
as reasonably practicable after the Paying Agent's receipt of Upward Post-
Closing NWC Adjustment Merger Consideration by wire transfer of immediately
available funds pursuant to Section 2.11(c), such holder's Pro Rata Cash Share
of the Upward Post-Closing NWC Adjustment Merger Consideration with respect to
such holder's Company Options or Performance Units, as applicable, in cash,
without interest, by wire transfer of immediately available funds. Each holder
of Company Options or Performance Units shall be entitled to receive as soon
as reasonably practicable after the Paying Agent's receipt of Escrowed Cash
pursuant to Section 2.8, such holder's Pro Rata Cash Share of the Escrowed
Cash with respect to such holder's Company Options or Performance Units, as
applicable, in cash, without interest, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds.

  

  

(c) Lost Stock Certificates. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
Section 2.10(b), if any Stock Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon delivery by the applicable Company Shareholder to the Paying Agent of a
lost certificate affidavit and indemnity agreement in a form reasonably
acceptable to the Paying Agent, the Purchaser and the Company, duly executed
by such Company Shareholder, and, if requested by the Paying Agent, a bond in
favor of the Paying Agent, the Paying Agent shall distribute to such Company
Shareholder in accordance with the terms of the Paying Agent Agreement, the
Merger Consideration with respect to the Company Shares evidenced by such
lost, stolen or destroyed Stock Certificate, despite such Company Shareholder
not having surrendered such lost, stolen or destroyed Stock Certificate to the
Paying Agent as provided in Section 2.10(b).

  

  

(d) Treatment of Unclaimed Merger Consideration. The Paying Agent Agreement
shall provide that the Paying Agent shall pay over to the Surviving
Corporation: (i) any Cash Merger Consideration (including any interest or
earnings thereon) and Stock Merger Consideration that has not theretofore been
distributed by the Paying Agent to Company Shareholders as provided in Section
2.10(b)(i) and is still held by the Paying Agent on the one year anniversary
of the Closing Date; and (ii) any Merger Consideration (including any interest
or earnings thereon) that has not theretofore been distributed by the Paying
Agent to Company Shareholders as provided in Section 2.10(b)(ii), (iii) or
(iv) and is still held by the Paying Agent on the one year anniversary of the
date on which the Paying Agent received the applicable Merger Consideration
from the Purchaser or the Escrow Agent, as the case may be. After any such
payment by the Paying Agent to the Surviving Corporation, all Company
Shareholders shall look solely to the Surviving Corporation (subject to
abandoned property, escheat and similar Laws) as general creditors thereof
with respect to the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration payable
with respect to their Company Shares upon satisfaction of the Merger
Consideration Payment Conditions. None of the Paying Agent, the Purchaser or
the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any Person in respect of any
funds delivered to any Governmental Entity pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

30  

  

 

 

 

  

Section 2.11 Post-Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment.

  

  

(a) Post-Closing Net Working Capital Statement. Within 90 days after the
Closing Date, the Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to the Shareholder
Representative a balance sheet of the Company as of the Closing (the "Closing
Balance Sheet") and a statement setting forth the final Cash as of the Closing
Date (the "Final Closing Cash"), the Company Indebtedness outstanding as of
the Closing (the "Final Closing Indebtedness"), the Company Transaction
Expenses (the "Final Company Transaction Expenses) and its calculation of the
NWC as of the Closing (the "Post-Closing NWC Statement"), which shall be
prepared in accordance with GAAP consistent with the manner of preparation of
the Company Financial Statements and the Example NWC Statement, and include
reasonable support for the calculations made therein. If the Shareholder
Representative disagrees with the Post-Closing NWC Statement, the Shareholder
Representative may, within 30 days after its receipt of the Post-Closing NWC
Statement, provide written notice thereof to the Purchaser (the "NWC Dispute
Notice"), which shall provide reasonable detail concerning each item that the
Shareholder Representative disputes in the Post-Closing NWC Statement and
include reasonable support for each such position. During such 30-day period
and any subsequent time period in which the Post-Closing NWC Statement is
being disputed as provided in this Section 2.11(a), the Purchaser shall
provide the Shareholder Representative and its representatives with reasonable
access, upon reasonable advance written notice to the Purchaser, to the books,
records and working papers of the Purchaser and the Company relating to the
calculations underlying the Post-Closing NWC Statement, the personnel of the
Purchaser, the Company and, if applicable, the outside accountants of the
Purchaser and the Company, in each case, who were involved in the preparation
of the Post-Closing NWC Statement. Unless the Shareholder Representative
delivers an NWC Dispute Notice within the 30-day period following delivery of
the Post-Closing NWC Statement, the Post-Closing NWC Statement shall be
conclusively deemed the "Final Post-Closing NWC Statement", and shall be final
and binding upon the Purchaser and the Company Shareholders for all purposes.
For a period of 15 Business Days after receipt by the Purchaser of the NWC
Dispute Notice, the Purchaser and the Shareholder Representative shall use
good faith commercially reasonable efforts to resolve the disputed items set
forth on the NWC Dispute Notice between themselves and, if they are able to
resolve all of such disputed items during such time period, the Post-Closing
NWC Statement shall be revised to the extent necessary to reflect such
resolution, and as so revised shall be conclusively deemed the "Final Post-
Closing NWC Statement", and shall be final and binding upon the Purchaser and
the Company Shareholders for all purposes. If the Purchaser and the
Shareholder Representative are unable to resolve all of the disputed items set
forth on the NWC Dispute Notice within such 15 Business Day period, they shall
jointly engage PricewaterhouseCoopers (the "Independent Accountants") and
submit the disputed items to the Independent Accountants for resolution. The
Independent Accountants shall act as experts and not arbiters and shall
determine only those items on the Post-Closing NWC Statement being disputed by
the Purchaser and the Shareholder Representative as of the time of engagement
of the Independent Accountants. The Purchaser and the Shareholder
Representative shall instruct the Independent Accountants not to assign a
dollar amount to any item in dispute greater than the greatest dollar amount
for such item assigned by the Purchaser, on the one hand, or the Shareholder
Representative, on the other hand (as applicable), or less than the dollar
amount for such item assigned by the Purchaser, on the one hand, or the
Shareholder Representative, on the other hand (as applicable). Promptly, but
no later than 30 days after engagement of the Independent Accountants, the
Independent Accountants shall deliver a written report to the Purchaser and
the Shareholder Representative as to their resolution of the disputed items,
which shall include the resulting Post-Closing NWC Statement incorporating
such resolution. The Post-Closing NWC Statement, as determined by the
Independent Accountants, shall be conclusively deemed the "Final Post-Closing
NWC Statement" and shall be final and binding upon the Purchaser and the
Company Shareholders for all purposes. The NWC as of the Closing set forth on
the Final Post-Closing NWC Statement is referred to herein as the "Final NWC."
The fees and expenses of the Independent Accountants incurred in connection
with the resolution of disputes pursuant to this Section 2.11(a) shall be
borne by the Purchaser or the Company Shareholders in proportion to the
amounts of the disputed items on the NWC Dispute Notice, as compared to such
items as determined by the Independent Accountants and set forth on the Final
Post-Closing NWC Statement, with such fees and expenses to be paid by the
Purchaser, on the one hand, or the Company Shareholders, on the other hand,
(as applicable) to the Independent Accountants within five Business Days after
the Independent Accountants' determination of the Final NWC.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

31  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) Post-Closing NWC Adjustment. The Merger Consideration shall be:

  

  

(i) reduced, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, by the amount (if any) by which the
Final NWC is less than the Estimated NWC, or increased, on a dollar-for dollar
basis, by the amount (if any) by which the Final NWC is greater than the
Estimated NWC;

  

  

(ii) reduced, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, by the amount (if any) by which
the Final Closing Cash is less than the Estimated Closing Cash, or increased,
on a dollar-for dollar basis, by the amount (if any) by which the Final
Closing Cash is greater than the Estimated Closing Cash;

  

  

(iii) reduced, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, by the amount (if any) by which
the Final Closing Indebtedness is greater than the Estimated Closing
Indebtedness, or increased, on a dollar-for dollar basis, by the amount (if
any) by which the Final Closing Indebtedness is less than the Estimated
Closing Indebtedness; and

  

  

(iv) reduced, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, by the amount (if any) by which
the Final Company Transaction Expenses is greater than the Estimated Company
Transaction Expenses, or increased, on a dollar-for dollar basis, by the
amount (if any) by which the Final Company Transaction Expenses is less than
the Estimated Company Transaction Expenses.

  

  

(c) Without duplication, all reductions or increases set forth in Section
2.11(b) shall be aggregated and the Merger Consideration shall be reduced (a
"Downward Post-Closing NWC Adjustment") or increased (an "Upward Post-Closing
NWC Adjustment" and, together with the Downward Post-Closing NWC Adjustment,
the "Post-Closing NWC Adjustment") accordingly. Any Downward Post-Closing NWC
Adjustment shall be satisfied, within five Business Days after determination
of the Final NWC, by release of Escrowed Cash to an account designated by the
Purchaser; provided, however, that if the Escrowed Cash is not sufficient to
satisfy payment of the Downward Post-Closing NWC Adjustment, such shortfall
shall be satisfied by release of Escrowed Shares from the Escrow Account by
delivery to the Purchaser of a stock certificate evidencing such Escrowed
Shares, accompanied by a stock power executed in blank. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Shareholder Representative may be entitled to seek contribution
from the holders of Company Options and holders of Performance Units, in each
case, in accordance with such holders' Pro Rata Cash Shares, of any shortfall
amounts satisfied by release of Escrowed Shares in accordance with the
immediately preceding sentence. Any Upward Post-Closing NWC Adjustment shall
be satisfied, within five Business Days after determination of the Final NWC,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds by the Purchaser to the Paying
Agent's account of an amount equal to the Upward Post-Closing NWC Adjustment
(for further distribution by the Paying Agent to the Company Shareholders, the
holders of Company Options and the holders of Performance Units pursuant to
Section 2.10(b)).

business as now conducted. The Company is duly licensed or qualified to do
business as a foreign corporation or limited liability company (as applicable)
in, and is in good standing under the Laws of, each jurisdiction under which
such licensing or qualification is necessary, except where the failure to be
so licensed or qualified or to be in good standing would not, either
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

(b) The Company has made available to Purchaser, prior to the execution of
this Agreement, true and complete copies of the Organizational Documents of
the Company. The Company is in compliance with the terms of its Organizational
Documents.

deliver this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which it is or
will be a party, to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder, and to

party, the performance of its obligations hereunder and thereunder, and the
consummation by the Company of the Transactions, have been duly authorized by
all requisite corporate action on the part of the Company, and no other
corporate authorization or proceedings on the part of the Company are required
therefor.

  

  

(d) This Agreement and each other Transaction Document to which the Company is

Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of this
Agreement and such other Transaction Documents by the other parties hereto and

its terms, except for the Equitable Exceptions.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

33

Shareholder to authorize the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
Transaction Documents. All approvals listed in Section 3.1(e) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule (other than the Company Shareholder Consent) are valid and
in full force and effect on the date hereof and no action has been taken by
the Company, its Board of Directors or any Company Shareholder to amend,
supersede, revoke or invalidate such approvals. The Company Shareholder
Consent, when executed and delivered in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, will be valid and in full force and effect as of the date thereof
and at the Effective Time. To the Knowledge of the Company, there is no fact
or circumstance existing as of the date of this Agreement that would
materially impede, hinder or delay the consummation of the Merger by the
Company.

  

  

Section 3.2 Capitalization; Subsidiaries.

  

  

The authorized and outstanding capital stock of the Company is as set forth in
Section 3.2(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. As of the date hereof, the
issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company are held by the

with the terms thereof, will be, duly authorized, validly issued and (to the
extent applicable) fully paid and nonassessable, and such issued or
outstanding shares were not issued in violation of any pre-emptive rights,
rights of first offer, first refusal or similar rights, or in violation of the
Securities Act or applicable state securities Laws. Except as set forth in

in Section 4975(e)(2) of the Code and Section 3(14) of ERISA, respectively)
has engaged in, or failed to engage in, any transactions with respect to any
Company Benefit Plan, including any non-exempt prohibited transaction within
the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or 406 of ERISA, that would subject
the Company to any material Tax, damages or penalties imposed by Section 409,
4975 or 4980B of the Code or Section 502(i), 502(c), 502(1) and 601 through
608 of ERISA.

employer welfare arrangement" within the meaning of Section 3(40) of ERISA,
and neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has contributed to any such
plan during the six (6) year period immediately preceding the date of this
Agreement. No Company Benefit Plan, and no employee benefit plan sponsored or
contributed to by the Company or an ERISA Affiliate has an accumulated funding
deficiency for purposes of Section 412 of the Code and each such plan is fully
funded on both an ongoing and a termination basis and neither the Company nor
any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any liability under Title IV of ERISA with
respect thereto.

any Governmental Entity and no such audit or review is pending and, to the
Knowledge of the Company, no such audit or review is threatened; and (iii) the
Company has not filed, and is not considering filing, an application under the
IRS Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System or the Department of Labor's
Voluntary Fiduciary Correction Program with respect to any Company Benefit
Plan.

Code and any similar state law, and (ii) the applicable requirements of the
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, and
the regulations (including the proposed regulations) thereunder. No Company
Benefit Plan is a voluntary employee benefit association under Section
501(a)(9) of the Code. The obligations of all Company Benefit Plans that
provide health, welfare or similar insurance are fully insured by bona fide
third-party insurers. No Company Benefit Plan is maintained through a human
resources and benefits outsourcing entity, professional employer organization,
or other similar vendor or provider.

another event, will (i) entitle any current or former employee, consultant or
director of the Company or any group of such employees, consultants or
directors to any payment of compensation; (ii) increase the amount of
compensation or benefits due to any such employee, consultant or director; or

Property right of any other Person. To the Company's Knowledge, no other
Person is infringing (whether directly or indirectly), misappropriating or
otherwise materially violating any Company Owned IP.

its Subsidiaries required to be disclosed by the Purchaser in the reports that
it is required to file, submit or furnish under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SEC's rules and forms. The Purchaser is, and has been at all times since

incorporated by reference in the Purchaser SEC Reports (the "Purchaser
Financial Statements"): (i) as of the date filed complied as to form in all
material respects with accounting requirements and the rules and regulations
of the SEC applicable thereto; (ii) were prepared in accordance with GAAP
applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods covered (except as may be
indicated in the notes to such financial statements or, in the case of
unaudited financial statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q, Form 8-K or any
successor form under the Exchange Act, and except that the unaudited financial
statements may not contain footnotes and are subject to normal and recurring
year-end adjustments, none of which were or will be material); and (iii)
fairly present, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position
of the Purchaser and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the respective dates
thereof and the consolidated results of operations and cash flows of the
Purchaser and its consolidated Subsidiaries for the periods covered thereby.

  

  

(d) The Purchaser maintains, and at all times since January 1, 2008 has
maintained, a system of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) which is designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP, and includes those policies and procedures that: (i)
pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
Purchaser and its Subsidiaries; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the Purchaser and its Subsidiaries; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of the assets of the Purchaser and its Subsidiaries that could
have a material effect on the financial statements. The Purchaser's management
has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Purchaser's system of
internal controls over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements
of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal years ended December
31, 2010 and December 31, 2011 and, except as set forth in the Purchaser SEC
Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement, such assessment concluded
that such controls were effective and the Purchaser's independent registered
accountant has issued (and not subsequently withdrawn or qualified) an
attestation report concluding that the Purchaser maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 and December 31,
2011, respectively. To the Purchaser's Knowledge, except as set forth in the
Purchaser SEC Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement or as set
forth on Section 4.3(d) of the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule, since January 1,
2008, neither the Purchaser nor any of its Subsidiaries nor the Purchaser's
independent registered accountant has identified or been made aware of: (A)
any significant deficiency or material weakness in the design or operation of
internal control over financial reporting utilized by the Purchaser; (B) any
illegal act or fraud, whether or not material, that involves the Purchaser's
management or other employees; or (C) any claim or allegation regarding any of
the foregoing.

Purchaser consists of 75,000,000 shares of Purchaser Stock and 1,000,000

Purchaser's Knowledge, the other parties thereto, subject to the Equitable
Exceptions, and is in full force and effect, except for such breaches,
defaults or failures to be valid, binding and legally enforceable, or to be in
full force and effect, as would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

Stock issuable as part of the Merger Consideration will have been duly
authorized and, when issued and delivered in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, will have been validly issued and will be fully paid and non-

rights.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

 

  

Section 4.14 No Prior Operations of Merger Sub

  

  

Merger Sub was formed solely for the purposes of engaging in the Transactions,
and has not engaged, and will not prior to the Closing engage, in any other
business activities.

  

  

Section 4.15 Financing.

  

  

(a) The Purchaser has delivered to the Company a true and complete copy of
each of (i) the executed commitment letter from Wells Fargo Bank, National
Association, Bank of America, N.A., and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas
(together, the "Lenders"), together with all exhibits, schedules and annexes
thereto (the "Financing Commitment Letter") and (ii) the executed fee letters
associated with the Financing Commitment Letter (the "Fee Letter"), pursuant
to which the Lenders have committed to provide the Purchaser with debt
financing in an aggregate principal amount of $540,000,000 (the "New
Financing"). The Financing Commitment Letter, in the form so delivered, is in
full force and effect and is a legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Purchaser and, to the Purchaser's Knowledge, the other parties thereto as of
the date hereof. As of the date of this Agreement, neither the Financing
Commitment Letter nor the Fee Letter has been withdrawn, rescinded or
terminated or otherwise amended or modified in any respect, and no such
withdrawal, rescission, termination, amendment or modification is
contemplated. As of the date hereof, subject to the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Article III, the
Purchaser is not in breach of any of the terms or conditions set forth in the
Financing Commitment Letter, and no event has occurred which, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a
default or breach on the part of the Purchaser under the Financing Commitment
Letter or failure to satisfy any condition precedent applicable to the
Purchaser contained therein. As of the date hereof, the Purchaser has no
Knowledge that any of the conditions to the Financing Commitment Letter will
not be satisfied or that the New Financing will not be available to the
Purchaser on the Closing Date. As of the date of this Agreement, no Lender has
notified the Purchaser of its intention to terminate the Financing Commitment
Letter or not to provide the New Financing. The Purchaser has fully paid any
and all commitment fees or other fees required by the Financing Commitment
Letter to be paid on or before the date of this Agreement. Assuming (i) the
New Financing is funded in accordance with the Financing Commitment Letter,
(ii) the conditions set forth in Section 6.3 will be satisfied as of the
Closing Date, the funds from the New Financing, together with funds (including
cash on hand of the Purchaser and its Subsidiaries) otherwise available to the
Purchaser, will be sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and each Transaction Document upon the terms contemplated
hereby and thereby, together with any fees and expenses of or payable by the
Purchaser on the Closing Date with respect thereto and with respect to the New
Financing.

  

  

(b) There are no side letters, understandings or other agreements or
arrangements relating to the New Financing to which the Purchaser of any of
its Affiliates is a party other than (i) as expressly set forth in the
Financing Commitment Letter and delivered to the Seller prior to the date of
this Agreement and (ii) the Fee Letter. There are no conditions precedent or
other contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of the New
Financing or the conditions precedent thereto under any agreement relating to
the New Financing to which the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates is a party,
other than as set forth in the Financing Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter
that do not impact the conditionality of the New Financing (the "Disclosed
Conditions"). No Person has any right to impose, and none of the Purchaser or
any Lender has any obligation to accept, any condition precedent to such
funding other than the Disclosed Conditions nor any reduction to the aggregate
amount available under the Financing Commitment Letter on the Closing Date
(nor any term or condition which would have the effect of reducing the
aggregate amount available under the Financing Commitment Letter on the
Closing Date). As of the date of this Agreement, the Purchaser believes that
it will be able to satisfy on a timely basis any conditions to the funding of
the full amount of the New Financing, and that the New Financing will be
available to the Purchaser on the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt,
the Purchaser's obligations under this Agreement are not subject to any
conditions regarding its or any other Person's ability to obtain financing for
the consummation of any transaction contemplated by this Agreement and each
Transaction Document.

therein based on information supplied by the Company specifically for

Documents to which Purchaser is a party, the Merger and the other transactions

Section 4.18 Opinion of Financial Advisor

Section 4.19 No Other Representations or Warranties

analysis of the business, operations, assets, Liabilities, results of
operations, financial condition and prospects of the Company and the Business,
which investigation, review and analysis was done by the Purchaser and its
Affiliates and representatives. In entering into this Agreement, the Purchaser
acknowledges that it has relied solely upon the aforementioned investigation,
review and analysis and not on any factual representations or opinions
(whether written or oral) of the Company (except the specific representations
and warranties set forth in Article III as modified by the Company Disclosure
Schedule and in the Transaction Documents). The Purchaser hereby acknowledges
and agrees that other than the representations and warranties made in Article
III or in the Transaction Documents, none of the Company or any of its
Shareholders, officers, directors, employees or representatives makes or has
made any representation or warranty, express or implied, written or oral, at
law or in equity, in respect of the Company, the Business, the Company Shares,
or any other assets, Liabilities, operations, businesses, prospects or
condition (financial or otherwise) of the Company, including as to (i)
merchantability or fitness for any particular use or purpose, (ii) the
operation of the Company or the Business by the Purchaser after the Closing in
any manner other than as used and operated by the Company prior to the Closing
or (iii) the probable success or profitability of the Company or the Business
after the Closing, and none of the Company or any of the Company Shareholders,
officers, directors, employees or representatives has any authority, express
or implied, to make any representation or warranty not expressly set forth in
this Agreement or in the Transaction Documents and no such Person will have or
be subject to any liability or indemnification obligation to the Purchaser,
the Surviving Company or to any other Person resulting from the distribution
to the Purchaser, its Affiliates or representatives of, or the Purchaser's use
of, any Non-Representation Information relating to the Company or the
Business, including in the Virtual Data Room, management presentations,
functional "break-out" discussions, confidential information memoranda,
responses to questions submitted on behalf of the Purchaser or in any other
form in expectation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
Purchaser further acknowledges and agrees that any Non-Representation
Information has been expressly disclaimed.

Purchaser, or any of their respective affiliates, officers or directors,

Purchaser and the Company shall mutually agree upon a joint initial press
release concerning this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and the
Transactions, which shall be disseminated at such time and in such manner as
is agreed upon in writing by the Purchaser and the Company (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). After such initial press
release is disseminated, the Company and Purchaser will consult with each
other and will mutually agree upon any press releases or public announcements
pertaining to the Transactions and shall not issue any such press releases or

with any national securities exchange, in which case the party proposing to
issue such press release or make such public announcement shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to consult in good faith with the other party
before issuing any such press releases or making any such public
announcements; provided, that each of Purchaser and the Company may make any
public statement to the press, analysts, investors, lenders, rating agencies,
proxy advisory firms or those attending industry conferences or Purchaser
conference calls, so long as such statements are substantially similar to
previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made jointly
by Purchaser and the Company (or individually, if approved by the other
party).

During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall, and shall cause its
directors, officers, shareholders, employees, agents and advisors
(collectively, the "Company Representatives") to, deal exclusively with the
Purchaser and its designated representatives regarding any and all
acquisitions of, or investments in, the Company, or the Business, whether by
way of merger, consolidation or other business combination with any other
Person, purchase or exchange of capital stock or other equity interests,
purchase of assets or otherwise (an "Alternative Transaction") and, without
the prior consent of the Purchaser, the Company shall not, and shall cause the
Company Representatives not to: (a) solicit, initiate or otherwise engage in
any negotiations, discussions or other communications with any other Person
relating to any Alternative Transaction; (b) provide information or
documentation to any other Person with respect to the Company or any of its
assets in respect of any Alternative Transaction; or (c) enter into any
Contract, letter of intent, memorandum of terms or understanding with any
other Person in respect of any Alternative Transaction. The Company shall, and
shall cause the Company Representatives to, cease immediately all discussions
and negotiations that commenced prior to the date of this Agreement regarding
any Alternative Transaction or would reasonably be expected to lead to an
Alternative Transaction. The Company shall promptly after the date of this
Agreement instruct each Person which has heretofore executed a confidentiality
agreement relating to an Alternative Transaction with or for the benefit of
the Company to promptly return or destroy all information, documents, and
materials relating to the Alternative Transaction or to the Company or its
businesses, operations or affairs heretofore furnished by the Company or any
of the Company Representatives to such Person or any of the Company
Representatives in accordance with the terms of any confidentiality agreement
with such Person.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

65  

  

 

 

 

  

Section 5.10 Notification

  

  

During the Pre-Closing Period, the Purchaser and the Company shall each give
written notice to the other promptly (and in any event within five Business
Days) after acquiring actual knowledge of the occurrence of any omission,
event or action that: (a) has caused, or is reasonably likely to cause the
failure of such party to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under
this Agreement; (b) has caused, or is reasonably likely to cause any condition
to the other party's obligation to consummate the Closing not to be satisfied;
or (c) would otherwise be reasonably expected to delay materially or prevent
the consummation of the Closing.

  

  

Section 5.11 DandO Indemnification and Insurance.

  

  

(a) Except as required by applicable Law, the Purchaser agrees to honor and
fulfill in all material respects the Company's obligations to provide
indemnification and exculpation from liability for acts or omissions occurring
on or prior to the Closing Date now existing in favor of the current or former
directors, officers or employees of the Company, as provided in its
Organizational Documents or in indemnification agreements (correct and
complete copies of which were made available by the Company to the Purchaser
in the Virtual Data Room prior to the date of this Agreement), in each case in
effect as of the Closing, (i) in accordance with their respective terms, with
respect to any indemnification agreements, or (ii) for a period of not less
than six years after the Closing Date, with respect to the Organizational
Documents.

  

  

(b) The Purchaser shall be responsible for paying the cost of a non-cancelable
run-off insurance policy, for a period of six years after the Closing Date to
provide insurance coverage for events, acts or omissions occurring on or prior
to the Closing Date for all Persons who were covered by the Company's
directors and officers policy in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date,
which the Purchaser shall procure and put into effect on or prior to the
Closing Date; provided, that the Purchaser shall not be required to pay an
annual premium for such insurance policy in excess of 200% of the last annual
premium paid by the Company prior to the date of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 5.12 Employee Benefits.

  

  

(a) Following the Closing, the Purchaser shall cause the Company to honor all
rights to paid time off, including vacation, personal and sick days, accrued
by employees of the Company under any Company Benefit Plan through the Closing
Date. For the period from the Closing through December 31, 2013, the Purchaser
shall cause the Company to provide to all individuals employed by the Company
as of the Closing who continue to be employed after the Closing ("Business
Employees"), (i) an annual base salary or hourly wage rate, as applicable,
that is no less than the annual base salary or hourly wage rate provided to
such Business Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time (disregarding
any increase in salary or wage rate made between the date of this Agreement
and the Closing Date in violation of Section 5.3(e) above) and (ii) employee
benefits (excluding equity-based compensation, retiree medical, retiree life
and defined benefit plans) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than
those provided to such Business Employee immediately prior to the Closing.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

66  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plan, policy, program or arrangement
in which any Business Employee first becomes eligible to participate on or
after the Closing Date, and in which such Business Employee did not
participate prior to the Closing Date (the "Post-Closing Plans"), the
Purchaser shall (and shall cause the Company to) use commercially reasonable
efforts to: (i) for purposes of each Post-Closing Plan providing medical,
dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any Business Employee, (A) waive
all pre-existing conditions, evidence of insurability or good health or
actively-at-work exclusions applicable to such Business Employee, except to
the extent such pre-existing conditions, evidence of insurability or good
health or actively-at-work exclusions would apply under the analogous Company
Benefit Plan; and (B) provide each such Business Employee with credit for any
co-payments and deductibles paid by such Business Employee during the plan
year that includes the Closing Date (to the same extent such credit would have
been given under the analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to the Closing); and
(ii) for purposes other than benefit accrual under any Post-Closing Plan that
is a defined benefit pension, equity incentive or similar plan, recognize all
service of such Business Employee with the Company for purposes of eligibility
to participate and vesting. The Purchaser shall designate the Company as a
"Designated Subsidiary" within the meaning of the Purchaser's 2010 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan. Following the Closing, the Business Employees will be
eligible to participate in the Purchaser's 2010 Incentive Award Plan, as
amended.

  

  

(c) For the period from the Closing through at least December 31, 2013, except
as set forth on Schedule 5.12(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule or as
approved by the Senior Executives, the Purchaser shall maintain in full force
and effect all of the Company Benefit Plans that were in effect immediately
prior to the Closing and shall continue to administer such plans and provide
eligibility for benefits to the Business Employees under such plans that are
substantially comparable to those in effect immediately prior to the Closing.

  

  

(d) During the 16-month period following the Closing, the Purchaser shall not
cause a reduction in the number of "shared service" Business Employees who are
employed by the Purchaser or its Subsidiaries unless (i) approved by the
Senior Executives after the Closing or (ii) such Business Employee is
terminated for cause or disruptive behavior. The Purchaser further agrees to
negotiate in good faith with the Senior Executives to develop a severance plan
or program for the benefit of "shared service" Business Employees in
accordance with Exhibit 5.12(d).

  

  

(e) From and after the Closing, the Purchaser agrees to maintain and perform
all obligations under the Company's 2010 Long Term Incentive Program (the
"2010 LTIP") in accordance with the terms of the 2010 LTIP in effect as of the
date of this Agreement (except as may be modified in accordance with the terms
of the 2010 LTIP), unless otherwise approved by the Senior Executives after
the Closing. Following the expiration or termination of the 2010 LTIP, but in
no event prior to 2013, the Purchaser shall implement a new long-term
incentive program for the benefit of Business Employees who remain employed
with the Company or its Affiliates at such time, the terms and conditions of
which shall be substantially similar to those of the 2010 LTIP (as adjusted
for the size and profitability of the business).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

67  

  

 

 

 

  

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall, or shall be construed so as to: (i)
prevent or restrict in any way the right of the Purchaser to terminate,
reassign, promote or demote any employee, independent contractor, director or
other service provider of the Company (or to cause any of the foregoing
actions) at any time following the Closing, or to change (or cause the change
of) the title, powers, duties, responsibilities, functions, locations,
salaries, other compensation or terms or conditions of employment or service
of any such service providers at any time following the Closing; (ii) create
any third-party rights in any such current or former service provider of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or any beneficiaries or dependents
thereof); (iii) require the Purchaser to continue any Company Benefit Plan
(other than as set forth in Sections 5.12(c) or (e)) or be construed to
prevent, and no action by the Company prior to the Closing shall limit the
ability of, the Purchaser from terminating, amending or modifying to any
extent or in any respect of any Purchaser Benefit Plan that the Purchaser may
establish or maintain; or (iv) be construed as amending any Company Benefit
Plan or any Purchaser Benefit Plan.

  

  

Section 5.13 Maintenance of Books and Records

  

  

For a period of at least seven years after the Closing Date: (a) the Purchaser
shall cause the Company to maintain its books and records in existence as of
the Closing Date; and (b) upon reasonable written notice, the Purchaser shall
cause the Company to provide to any Company Shareholder and its
representatives, employees, counsel and accountants access, during normal
business hours and upon reasonable advance notice, such books and records
relating to periods prior to the Closing Date, and shall permit such Persons
to examine and copy, at the sole cost and expense of the party providing
access, such books and records to the extent reasonably requested by any such
Persons as is reasonably necessary for financial reporting, accounting and Tax
matters, the preparation and filing of any Tax Returns, reports or forms or
the defense of any claim or assessment. The parties agree to cooperate so that
such access does not unreasonably disrupt the normal operations of the
Company.

  

  

Section 5.14 Shareholder Approval

  

  

The Company shall, promptly after the execution of this Agreement and the
Related Plan of Merger, obtain the approval and adoption of this Agreement,
the Merger and the other Transactions by the required vote of the Company
Shareholders under the VSCA and the Company's Organizational Documents
pursuant to the Company Shareholder Consent.

  

  

Section 5.15 Tax Matters.

  

  

(a) Section 338(h)(10) Election.

  

  

(i) At the Purchaser's option, each Company Shareholder shall: (A) join with
the Purchaser in making an election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and
any corresponding election under state, local, and foreign Tax law) with
respect to the Merger (collectively, a "Section 338(h)(10) Election"); (B)
cooperate with the Purchaser and take all commercially reasonable actions
necessary and appropriate or requested by the Purchaser (including executing,
at or prior to the Closing, IRS Form 8023 and any similar forms under
applicable state income tax laws, and otherwise timely preparing, executing or
filing such Tax Returns, forms, elections, schedules and other documents that
may be required) to effect and preserve any such Section 338(h)(10) Election;
(C) take no position to the contrary in any Tax Return, any proceeding before
a Tax Authority or otherwise prejudice any such Section 338(h)(10) Election;
and (D) include his, her or its respective share of any income, gain, loss,
deduction, or other Tax item resulting from a Section 338(h)(10) Election on
his, her or its Tax Returns to the extent required by applicable Law and
subject to the terms of this Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

68  

  

 

 

 

  

(ii) In connection with the Section 338(h)(10) Election, the Purchaser and the
Company Shareholders agree that the Merger Consideration and the liabilities
of the Company (plus other relevant items required under Section 338(h)(10) of
the Code, and Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder) will be allocated
to the assets of the Company for Tax purposes in a manner consistent with
Sections 338 and 1060 of the Code and the Treasury regulations promulgated
thereunder, and shall negotiate in good faith to determine a proposed
allocation schedule (the "Allocation Schedule"). As soon as practicable after
the date hereof, in all events within 20 days of the date hereof, the
Purchaser shall deliver a proposed Allocation Schedule, based on the assets on
the balance sheet of the Company as of February 29, 2012, to the Shareholder
Representative, which allocation shall be consistent with Sections 338 and
1060 of the Code and the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder. The
Shareholder Representative shall within 20 days of receipt of such proposed
Allocation Schedule notify the Purchaser that it is in agreement with such
proposed allocation or of any reasonable objections that it has with respect
to such proposed Allocation Schedule, and the Shareholder Representative and
the Purchaser agree to consult and attempt to resolve in good faith any such
objection. To the extent that the Purchaser and the Shareholder Representative
are unable to reach an agreement regarding such objection, the dispute shall
be submitted to the Independent Accountants for resolution, with the costs of
the Independent Accountants borne equally by the Purchaser and the Company
Shareholders. After the Purchaser and the Shareholder Representative are in
agreement on the Allocation Schedule or the Allocation Schedule has otherwise
been finally determined, and within 60 days after closing, the Purchaser and
the Shareholder Representative will apply the Allocation Schedule to the
assets on the balance sheet of the Company as of the Closing Date to create a
final allocation schedule (the "Final Allocation Schedule"). The Purchaser,
the Company and the Company Shareholders shall file all Tax Returns (including
amended returns and claims for refund) and information reports in a manner
consistent with such Final Allocation Schedule. Appropriate adjustments to the
Final Allocation Schedule shall be made in the event that the Merger
Consideration is adjusted, and such adjustments shall be determined in
accordance with the Treasury regulations promulgated under Sections 338 and
1060 of the Code, as agreed by the Purchaser and the Shareholder
Representative. In the event that any of the allocations provided on such
Final Allocation Schedule are disputed by a Tax Authority, the party receiving
notice of such dispute shall use reasonable efforts to notify the other party,
and the Company Shareholders and Purchaser shall cooperate in good faith in
responding to such challenge to preserve the effectiveness of such Final
Allocation Schedule, each at its own cost and expense.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

69  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) Tax Returns.

  

  

(i) The Company Shareholders shall prepare or cause to be prepared and timely
file or cause to be timely filed all Income Tax Returns of the Company for all
periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date that have not yet been filed
and are required to be filed after the Closing Date. The Purchaser agrees that
the Transaction Tax Deductions may be claimed in such Income Tax Returns
prepared or caused to be prepared by the Company Shareholders. The Shareholder
Representative shall permit the Purchaser to review and comment on each such
Income Tax Return not less than ten days prior to filing, and the Shareholder
Representative shall consider in reasonable good faith any comments from the
Purchaser and attempt in reasonable good faith to resolve any disagreements
regarding such Income Tax Returns prior to the due date for filing.

  

  

(ii) The Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared and timely file or
cause to be timely filed: (A) all non-Income Tax Returns of the Company for
all periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date that have not yet been
filed and are required to be filed after the Closing Date, and (B) all Tax
Returns of the Company for taxable years or periods ending after the Closing
Date. Such Tax Returns, to the extent relating to any Pre-Closing Taxable
Period (including any Straddle Period), shall be prepared consistently with
past practice to the extent permitted by applicable law and the Purchaser
shall permit the Shareholder Representative to review and comment on each such
Tax Return not less than ten days prior to filing. The Shareholder
Representative shall notify the Purchaser of any reasonable objections that it
has with respect to any items set forth in such Tax Return, and the
Shareholder Representative and the Purchaser agree to consult and attempt to
resolve in good faith any such objection. To the extent that the Purchaser and
the Shareholder Representative are unable to reach an agreement regarding the
revisions to be made to such Tax Returns, the dispute shall be submitted to
the Independent Accountants for resolution, with the costs of the Independent
Accountants borne equally by the Purchaser and the Company Shareholders. The
Company Shareholders shall be liable for any Taxes due in respect of such Tax
Returns solely to the extent provided in Section 8.2.

  

  

(iii) The Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation, on the one hand, and the
Company Shareholders and the Shareholder Representative, on the other hand,
agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to the other, upon request, as
promptly as practicable, such information and assistance relating to Taxes or
refunds thereof, including, without limitation, access to books and records,
as is reasonably necessary for the filing of all Tax Returns by such parties
pursuant to clause (i) or clause (ii) above, or for claiming refunds of Taxes
as contemplated under Section 5.15(d) below, as applicable.

  

  

(c) Tax Contests. Whenever any Tax Authority asserts a claim, makes an
assessment, or otherwise disputes the amount of Taxes for which the Company
Shareholders are or may be liable under Section 8.2, the Purchaser or the
Shareholder Representative shall, if informed of such an assertion, promptly
inform the other party, and the Shareholder Representative shall have the
right to control any resulting proceedings and to determine whether and when
to settle any such claim, assessment or dispute to the extent such proceedings
or determinations affect the amount of Taxes for which the Company
Shareholders may be liable under this Agreement; provided, however, that if
such proceeding or such settlement would reasonably be expected to adversely
affect the liability of the Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation for Taxes
for any taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date,
the Purchaser shall have the right to participate, at its own expense, in such
proceeding and such settlement shall not be agreed to without the consent of
the Purchaser, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever any Tax Authority asserts a claim,
makes an assessment or otherwise disputes the amount of Taxes relating to a
Straddle Period, the Purchaser shall have the right to control any resulting
proceedings and to determine whether and when to settle any such claim,
assessment or dispute, except to the extent such proceedings would reasonably
be expected to affect the amount of Taxes for which the Company Shareholders
are liable under Section 8.2, in which case such settlement shall not be
agreed to by the Purchaser without the consent of the Shareholder
Representative, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of any conflict between this Section
5.15(c) and Section 9.5, the procedures set forth in this Section 5.15(c)
shall control.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

70  

  

 

 

 

  

(d) Tax Refunds. The amount of any refunds of Taxes of the Company relating to
a Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Taxable Period received by the Purchaser or the
Surviving Corporation shall be for the account of the Company Shareholders,
net of any reasonable cost incurred by the Purchaser or the Surviving
Corporation directly attributable to the obtaining and receipt of such
refunds, provided, however, that (i) such Taxes were paid by the Company or
the Company Shareholders prior to the Closing Date or by the Company
Shareholders after the Closing Date (in either case, whether directly, as a
result of any indemnity provision under this Agreement or pursuant to any
other adjustment to the Merger Consideration) and (ii) such refunds do not
arise as a result of a carryback of a loss or other Tax benefit from a taxable
period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the case of such refunds other than those related to
Transaction Tax Deductions, the amount of any such refunds shall be for the
account of the Purchaser to the extent such refunds have already been
reflected in the Closing Balance Sheet and the Final NWC. All refunds held by
one party for the account of another pursuant to this Section 5.15(d) shall be
paid to such other party within fifteen days of receipt. To the extent any Tax
refund for the account of and paid to one party by the other party pursuant to
this Section 5.15(d) is subsequently disallowed or required to be returned to
the applicable Tax Authority, such recipient of a refund agrees to promptly
repay the amount of such refund, together with any interest, penalties or
other additional amounts imposed by such Tax Authority, to the other party.

  

  

(e) Tax Sharing Agreements. Any Tax allocation or sharing agreement to which
the Company is a party shall be terminated on or before the Closing Date.
After the Closing Date, no party shall have any rights or obligations under
any such Tax allocation or sharing agreement.

  

  

(f) Transfer Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration
and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred

the Company Shareholders when due, and the responsible party under applicable
law will file or cause to be filed all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to all such transfer, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, registration and other Taxes and fees. The expenses of such filing
shall be borne equally by the Purchaser and the Company Shareholders.

Section 5.16 Assistance with Financing.

  

  

(a) The Company acknowledges that the Purchaser may seek to obtain financing
from time to time after the date of this Agreement, including pursuant to the
New Financing, although the parties agree and acknowledge that the Purchaser's
receipt of any such financing shall not be a condition to the Purchaser's
obligation to consummate the Transactions. In furtherance of such efforts, the
Purchaser will need to provide third parties, including lenders from whom the
Purchaser intends to obtain such financing, including the Lenders (the
"Financing Parties"), the information which is reasonably customary in
connection with the arrangement of debt financing (the "Company Information"),
including, without limitation, the following: (i) as promptly as practicable
all historical financial and other pertinent historical information regarding
the Company and its Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested in writing by
Purchaser in connection with the financing contemplated by the New Financing
(including such information which Purchaser has determined is necessary for
the preparation of one or more information packages regarding the business,
operations, financial projections and prospects of the Company and its
Subsidiaries customary for such financing or reasonably necessary for the
syndication of the New Financing by the financing sources) and (ii) furnishing
all financial statements expressly required by the Financing Commitment Letter
within the time periods specified therein. Upon the reasonable request of the
Purchaser, the Company shall provide the Company Information to the Purchaser
or a Financing Party upon such Financing Party's customary undertaking of
confidentiality. In addition, the Company shall provide reasonable
cooperation, and shall cause its independent accountants to cooperate, as
reasonably requested by the Purchaser, in connection with the arrangement of,
and the negotiation of agreements with respect to, any such financing.

  

  

(b) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts, at the Purchaser's sole expense, to provide, and shall
cause its independent accountants to provide, the Purchaser with such
information as the Purchaser may reasonably request (including Company
Information and management representation letters required for any audit and
accountants comfort letters required in connection with debt offerings) in
connection with: (i) the completion of any private offering memorandums or
other disclosure documents, (ii) the Purchaser's efforts to cause the
Company's financial statements and the pro forma financial information
described in clause (iii) to comply with Regulation S-X and (iii) the
Purchaser's preparation of pro forma financial information for purposes of its
reports, or other filings (including the Form S-4, the Proxy Statement or any
other registration statement, any amendments thereto, or any prospectus or
prospectus supplement in connection therewith) in accordance with Securities
Act or the Exchange Act; provided, however, that while it is a condition that
the Company provide information that complies with the provisions of clause
(ii) and (iii) above, the Purchaser agrees and acknowledges that compliance
with Regulation S-X or preparation of such pro forma financial information
shall not be a condition to its obligation to consummate the Closing.

  

  

(c) During the Pre-Closing Period, in the event the SEC has comments or
questions on any of the Company's financial information, the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to reasonably assist and cooperate, and shall
cause its independent accountants to assist and cooperate, with the Purchaser,
the Purchaser's independent accountants and the SEC to resolve any such issues
and questions regarding the Company Information and take such commercially
reasonably actions with respect to such financial statements or information as
are necessary for the Purchaser to satisfy its obligations under Regulation
S-X.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

72  

  

 

 

 

  

(d) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to reasonably cooperate with the Purchaser's reasonable
requests in connection with the Purchaser's compliance with applicable Laws
with respect to the transactions hereunder, including: (i) providing access to
its management upon reasonable prior notice during normal business hours to
assist with SEC reporting obligations of the transactions hereunder, including
the preparation by the Purchaser of pro forma financial statements and
addressing purchase accounting issues; (ii) allowing access to the Company's
independent accountants (including to the extent required by such accountants,
consent to the release of their work papers to the Purchaser or the
Purchaser's independent accountants), and discussing with the Company's
independent accountants appropriate consents to fulfill the Purchaser's
reporting requirements, including financial statements and the notes thereto;
(iii) assisting Purchaser in preparation of materials for rating agency
presentations, offering documents, offering circulars or private placement
memoranda, bank information memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents
required in connection with the New Financing, (iv) participating in a
reasonable number of meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence
sessions, drafting sessions and sessions with rating agencies in connection
with the New Financing, (v) assisting in the amendment of any of the Company's
or its Subsidiaries' currency or interest hedging agreements, or other
agreements, in each case, on terms satisfactory to the Purchaser, (vi)
providing authorization letters to the New Financing sources authorizing the
distribution of information to prospective lenders and containing a customary
representation that such information does not contain a material misstatement
or omission and containing a representation to the New Financing sources that
the public side versions of such documents, if any, do not include material
non-public information about the Company or its Subsidiaries or their
securities, (vii) cooperating reasonably with Purchaser's New Financing
sources' due diligence, to the extent customary and reasonable and to the
extent not unreasonably interfering with the business of the Company, and
(viii) using its commercially reasonable efforts to arrange for customary
payoff letters, lien terminations and instruments of discharge to be delivered
at Closing providing for the payoff, discharge and termination on the Closing
Date of all indebtedness contemplated by the Financing Commitment Letter to be
paid off, discharged and terminated on the Closing Date; provided, that the
Company shall not be required to take any action prior to the Closing in
contravention of the terms of any Company Indebtedness and the effectiveness
of any such documentation executed by the Company shall be subject to the
consummation of the Closing.

  

  

(e) The parties agree and acknowledge that all actions taken by the Company
pursuant to the terms of this Section 5.16 shall be at the sole cost and
expense of the Purchaser and the Purchaser shall, promptly upon written
request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all costs reasonably
incurred by the Company in connection with the actions taken by the Company
pursuant to the terms of this Section 5.16.

  

  

Section 5.17 NASDAQ Listing

  

  

The Purchaser shall promptly prepare and submit to NASDAQ, a listing
application covering the shares of Purchaser Stock to be issued in the Merger,
and shall use its reasonable efforts to obtain, prior to the Effective Time,
approval for the listing of such Purchaser Stock on the NASDAQ Global Select,
subject to official notice of issuance to NASDAQ, and the Company shall
cooperate with the Purchaser with respect to such listing.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

73

Section 5.19 Further Efforts.

  

  

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Purchaser agrees to negotiate in good faith with
the Senior Executives the terms of employment agreements to be entered into
with each of the Senior Executives in connection with the Closing, with such
agreements to include terms and conditions consistent with employment
agreements currently in place between the Purchaser and its senior executive

Purchaser a Non-Compete Agreement and (ii) Company Shareholder and holder of

76  

  

 

 

 

  

(a) upon the written agreement of the Company and the Purchaser;

  

  

(b) by either the Company or the Purchaser if the Closing shall not have
occurred on or before July 18, 2012 (or such other date to which the Company
or the Purchaser may agree upon in writing) (the "End Date") because one or
more conditions to respective obligations of the Company or the Purchaser and
Merger Sub to consummate the Closing set forth in Sections 6.1, 6.2 or 6.3, as
applicable, has not been satisfied, or for any other reason; provided,
however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(b)
shall not be available to either party if such party's willful breach of any
of its obligations under this Agreement caused, or resulted in, the failure of
the Closing to occur on or before such date;

  

  

(c) by either the Company or the Purchaser if any Order permanently preventing
the consummation of the Closing shall have been entered by any court of
competent jurisdiction and shall have become a Final Order; provided, however,
that neither party may terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
7.1(c) unless such party has used commercially reasonable efforts to prevent
the entry of and to procure the removal, reversal, dissolution, setting aside
or invalidation of such Order;

  

  

(d) by the Purchaser, either: (i) after the occurrence of a non-curable breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company set
forth in this Agreement that shall have rendered impossible the satisfaction
of the conditions to Closing in Sections 6.3(a) or 6.3(b); or (ii) 30 days
after receipt by the Company of notice from the Purchaser of the occurrence of

within such time period (or if the End Date is less than 30 days from such
notice, if not cured by the End Date); provided, however, that the Purchaser
shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
7.1(d) if the Purchaser is then in material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement;

  

  

(e) by the Company, either: (i) after the occurrence of a non-curable breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Purchaser or
Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement that shall have rendered impossible the

agreement of the Purchaser or Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement that
would result in the failure of the conditions to the Company's obligation to
consummate the Closing set forth in Sections 6.2(a) and 6.2(b) to be satisfied
if such breach has not been cured within such time period (or if the End Date
is less than 30 days from such notice, if not cured by the End Date);
provided, however, that the Company shall not have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(e) if it is then in material breach of

terminating party's obligation to consummate the Closing set forth in Sections
6.1, 6.2 or 6.3, respectively, shall have become incapable of satisfaction
(other than as provided in Sections 7.1(c), (d) or (e)); provided, however,
that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(f) shall not
be available to either party if such party's willful breach of any of its
obligations under this Agreement caused such Closing condition to have become
incapable of satisfaction.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

77  

  

 

 

 

  

Any termination made in accordance with Section 7.1(b), (c), (d), (e) or (f)

party to the Purchaser or the Company (as applicable), which notice shall
refer to the subsection of this Section 7.1 pursuant to which such termination
is being made.

  

  

Section 7.2 Effect of Termination.

  

  

(a) Except as set forth in Section 7.2(b), if this Agreement is terminated

covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents, in each case occurring prior to such termination; (b) the Purchaser

(b) The Purchaser agrees that if this Agreement shall be terminated (i) by the
Purchaser or the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(b), (ii) by the Company
pursuant to Section 7.1(e), or (iii) by the Purchaser pursuant to Section
7.1(f) arising from the failure of the Purchaser to satisfy the condition set
forth in Section 6.3(e), under circumstances in which (A) all of the
conditions set forth in Sections 6.1 and 6.3 (other than Section 6.3(e)) have
been satisfied or are capable of being satisfied prior to the End Date and (B)
upon request of the Purchaser, the Company has irrevocably confirmed to the
Purchaser in writing that if the New Financing were funded then the Company
would, assuming all conditions set forth in Section 6.2 are satisfied, take
such actions that are within its control to cause the Closing to occur, then
the Purchaser shall pay the Company the Reverse Termination Fee in immediately
available funds within five Business Days after such termination. "Reverse
Termination Fee" means $21,000,000. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement: (i) the Company's right to receive the Reverse
Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 7.2(b) shall be the Company's sole
and exclusive remedy against the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, for any
Loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated in
circumstances giving rise to the right to receive the Reverse Termination Fee;
and (ii) upon payment of the Reverse Termination Fee pursuant to this Section
7.2(b), none of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
Merger. The Purchaser acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
Section 7.2(b) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and that without these agreements the Company would not enter into
this Agreement. If the Purchaser shall fail to pay the Reverse Termination
Fee, when due, the Purchaser shall reimburse the Company for all costs and
expenses actually incurred or accrued by the Company (including reasonable
fees and expenses of counsel) in connection with the collection under and
enforcement of this Section 7.2(b).

Article VIII to be due to any Purchaser Indemnified Party under this Article
VIII.

  

  

Section 8.4 Indemnification Claim Procedure.

  

  

(a) Promptly after becoming aware of the existence of any potential matter
that a party hereto, acting in good faith, reasonably believes will entitle
such party (the "Indemnified Party") to indemnification from another party
hereto (the "Indemnifying Party"), under this Article VIII, the Indemnified
Party shall promptly provide to the Indemnifying Party notice describing the
matter in reasonable detail, including the nature of the claim, the basis for
the indemnification obligation and the Losses resulting therefrom (an
"Indemnity Claim Notice"); provided, however, that the Shareholder
Representative shall be deemed to be the Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying
Party, as applicable, for purposes of sending or receiving Indemnity Claim
Notices or Indemnity Claim Responses on behalf of the Company Shareholders or
the Company Shareholder Indemnified Parties, as the case may be, and otherwise
taking actions pursuant to this Section 8.4 and Section 8.5. To the extent
that any such matter relates to a Claim or Proceeding by any Person other than
an Indemnified Party, such Claim or Proceeding is referred to herein as a
"Third Party Claim", which is governed by Section 8.5. No delay on the part of
the Indemnified Party in giving the Indemnifying Party an Indemnity Claim
Notice shall limit or reduce the Indemnified Party's right to indemnification
hereunder, nor relieve the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations
under this Article VIII, unless (and then only to the extent that) the
Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced thereby.

  

  

(b) For claims for indemnification under this Article VIII other than those
relating to Third Party Claims, the Indemnifying Party shall have 20 Business
Days after its receipt of the Indemnity Claim Notice to respond to the
claim(s) described therein (an "Indemnity Claim Response"), which shall set
forth, in reasonable detail, the Indemnifying Party's objection(s) to the
claim(s) and its bases for such objection(s). If the Indemnifying Party fails
to provide an Indemnity Claim Response with such time period, the Indemnifying
Party will be deemed to have conceded the claim(s) set forth in the Indemnity
Claim Notice. If the Indemnifying Party provides an Indemnity Claim Response
within such time period, the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party
shall negotiate the resolution of the claim(s) for a period of not fewer than
20 Business Days after the Indemnity Claim Response is provided. If the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party are unable to resolve any such
claim(s) within such time period, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
pursue any legal remedies available to the Indemnified Party against the
Indemnifying Party with respect solely to the unresolved claim(s), subject to
the limitations set forth in Section 8.3 and the other provisions of this
Article VIII, as applicable.

  

  

Section 8.5 Third Party Claims.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

81  

  

 

 

 

  

(a) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume and pursue the
defense of any Third Party Claim involving solely monetary damages (if (A)
such Third Party Claim does not, and would not reasonably be expected to,
result in criminal liability of, or equitable remedies against, the
Indemnified Party and (B) in the reasonable judgment of the Indemnified Party
the aggregate amount of the potential obligations of the Indemnified Party
regarding such Third Party Claim does not exceed twice the amount of the
remaining portion of the Overall Company Shareholder Indemnity Cap or Overall
Purchaser Indemnity Cap, as applicable), at its sole cost and expense and with
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, upon notification
thereof to the Indemnified Party within ten Business Days after the Indemnity
Claim Notice has been delivered to the Indemnifying Party; provided, however,
that if the Indemnifying Party's assumption of the defense of any Third Party
Claim would (as described in a written opinion of counsel to the Indemnified
Party or the Indemnifying Party) result in a conflict of interest arising out
of the joint representation by counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party of
the interests of both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to engage separate counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party to represent the Indemnified Party (at
the Indemnifying Party's sole cost and expense) and, if the Indemnifying Party
fails to do so during the ten Business Day period referred to above, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume the Indemnified Party's
defense of such Third Party Claim. It is agreed and understood that the
Indemnifying Party's election to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim
shall not constitute an admission that any Losses resulting therefrom are
indemnifiable Losses under this Article VIII or in any way prejudice or limit
the Indemnifying Party's ability to dispute any determination of whether or
not any such Losses are indemnifiable Losses under this Article VIII. If: (i)
the Indemnified Party does not receive notification from the Indemnifying
Party of its assumption of the defense of a Third Party Claim within the ten
Business Day time period referred to above; (ii) the Indemnifying Party is not
entitled to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim as described above in
this Section 8.5; or (iii) at any time after the Indemnifying Party has
assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party fails to
perform or unreasonably delays in performing its obligations to assume or
pursue the defense of such Thirty Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall
fully assume, commence and pursue its defense of such Third Party Claim on a
timely and prudent basis and thereafter promptly inform the Indemnifying Party
of all material developments related thereto and the Indemnifying Party shall
pay the reasonable fees and disbursements of such counsel for the Indemnified
Party as incurred.

  

  

(b) If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, it
shall thereafter promptly inform the Indemnified Party of all material
developments related thereto. With respect to any Third Party Claim for which
the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense, the Indemnified Party shall
have the right, but not the obligation, to participate, at its own cost and
expense, in the defense of such Third Party Claim through legal counsel
reasonably selected by it, but shall not assert or pursue, directly or through
its counsel, any contrary or inconsistent defenses without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party. As long as the Indemnifying Party is
performing its obligations under this Section 8.5, the Indemnified Party
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, during normal business hours, upon
reasonable notice, at the cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party,
cooperate in all reasonable ways with, make its and their relevant files and
records reasonably available for inspection and copying by, make its and their
employees reasonably available to, and otherwise render reasonable assistance
to, the Indemnifying Party.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

82  

  

 

 

 

  

(c) If the Indemnifying Party (having assumed the defense of a Third Party
Claim) or the Indemnified Party (having proceeded with its own defense of a
Third Party Claim in accordance with this Section 8.5) proposes to settle or
compromise such Thirty Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified
Party (as applicable) shall provide notice to that effect (together with a
statement in reasonable detail of the terms and conditions of such settlement
or compromise) to the Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party (as
applicable), which shall be provided a reasonable time prior to the proposed
time for effecting such settlement or compromise, and may not effect any such
settlement or compromise without the prior consent of the Indemnified Party or
the Indemnifying Party (as applicable); provided, however, that the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to settle or compromise any Third Party
Claim after having provided such notice to the Indemnified Party but without
the consent of the Indemnified Party if: (i) such settlement or compromise
does not include any admission of liability by the Indemnified Party or its
Affiliates; (ii) such settlement or compromise provides for the full and
unconditional release of the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates from any and
all Liability in respect of such Third Party Claim; (iii) any monetary
obligations of the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates to the applicable Third
Party with respect to such settlement or compromise are paid in full by the
Indemnifying Party; and (iv) such settlement or compromise does not include
any equitable remedies restricting future actions by the Indemnified Party or
its Affiliates.

  

  

Section 8.6 Payment of Amounts Due for Indemnification.

  

  

(a) Within five Business Days after it is determined pursuant to this Article
VIII that any amount is due to any Purchaser Indemnified Party in respect of
Losses specified in Indemnity Claim Notices delivered by the Purchaser to the
Shareholder Representative on or prior to the Escrow Period Expiration Date, a
portion of the Escrowed Shares that is the lesser of: (i) such amount; or (ii)
the amount of the Escrowed Shares then remaining in the Escrow Account, shall
be released from the Escrow Account to the Purchaser, consisting of the
transfer of Escrowed Shares (valued at the Purchaser Stock Price), rounded to
the nearest number of whole Escrowed Shares, by delivery to the Purchaser of a
stock certificate evidencing such Escrowed Shares, accompanied by a stock
power executed in blank. Each Company Shareholder shall have a right of
contribution from the applicable other Company Shareholder(s) to the extent
that any Escrowed Shares from the Escrow Account in excess of such Company
Shareholder's Pro Rata Share of the Escrowed Shares in the Escrow Account are
released to the Purchaser in connection with any Purchaser Indemnified Party
claim under Section 8.2.

  

  

(b) Within five Business Days after it is determined pursuant to this Article
VIII that any amount is due to any Purchaser Indemnified Party in respect of
Losses specified in Indemnity Claim Notices delivered by the Purchaser to the
Shareholder Representative after the Escrow Period Expiration Date, the
Shareholder Representative shall effect payment of such amount by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the
Purchaser.

  

  

(c) Within five Business Days after it is determined pursuant to this Article
VIII that any amount is due to any Company Shareholder Indemnified Party,
Purchaser shall effect payment of such amount by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by the Shareholder Representative.

  

  

 

Section 8.7 Recoveries from Third Parties

  

  

The indemnification amount to which an Indemnified Party may become entitled
under this Article VIII shall be net of any actual recovery received by the
Indemnified Party from a third party with respect to the facts giving rise to
the Claim less any costs reasonably incurred by the Indemnified Party in
connection with obtaining such recovery in respect of such Claim.

 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

83  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 8.8 Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments

  

  

Any indemnification payments made pursuant to this Article VIII shall be
treated for all Tax purposes as adjustments to the Merger Consideration,
unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

  

  

Section 8.9 No Contribution

  

  

No Company Shareholder shall have, and no Company Shareholder shall exercise
or assert (or attempt to exercise or assert), any right of contribution or
right of indemnity against the Surviving Corporation, in connection with any
indemnification obligation to a Purchaser Indemnified Party to which such
Company Shareholder may become subject under or in connection with this
Agreement. From and after the Effective Time, the Company Shareholders, hereby
irrevocably waive and release the Surviving Corporation from any such right of
contribution or right of indemnity from or against the Surviving Corporation
with respect to indemnification payments to Purchaser Indemnified Parties
pursuant to this Agreement.

  

  

Section 8.10 Indemnification Sole Remedy

  

  

Except for: (a) the ability of the parties to obtain equitable remedies in
accordance with Section 9.13 (Remedies) in connection with any breach or
threatened breach of any of the covenants and agreements of the parties set
forth herein; and (b) with respect to any claim related to fraud, intentional
misrepresentation or willful or criminal misconduct by the Company, any
Company Shareholder, the Shareholder Representative or the Purchaser in
connection with the Transactions from and after the Closing, (i) the
indemnification rights provided pursuant to this Article VIII shall be the
sole and exclusive remedies of the parties and their respective officers,
directors, employees, Affiliates, agents, representatives, successors and
assigns for any breach of any representations and warranties, covenants and
agreements contained in this Agreement; and (ii) each party hereby irrevocably
waives any right to any remedy relating to any such breach other than the
indemnification rights provided pursuant to this Article VIII (whether by
contract, common law, statute, regulation or otherwise).

  

  

ARTICLE IX

  


 

  

  

GENERAL PROVISIONS

  

  

Section 9.1 Shareholder Representative.

  

  

(a) Pursuant to the Shareholder Representative agreement, in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit 9.1(a) (the "Shareholder Representative Agreement"), the
Shareholder Representative shall be named as the agent and representative of
all of the Company Shareholders, including without limitation, for purposes of
receiving on their behalf all notices under this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement and the Paying Agent Agreement, issuing on their behalf such notices
under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Paying Agent Agreement, in
each case as the Shareholder Representative shall determine in its sole
discretion to issue, and performing such other administrative and other
functions under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Paying Agent
Agreement, in each case as may become necessary or desirable.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

84  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) The Shareholder Representative shall have full power and authority to act
for and on behalf of the Company Shareholders and their respective heirs,
successors and assigns in regard to their rights and obligations under this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Paying Agent Agreement. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Shareholder Representative is
authorized on behalf of the Company Shareholders to: (i) administer the Post-
Closing NWC Adjustment process under Section 2.11; (ii) resolve all claims for
indemnification under Article VIII of this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and
the Paying Agent Agreement; (iii) retain counsel of its choosing, experts and
other professionals as may be necessary or desirable to assist in any such
matters; and (iv) give such notices to the Escrow Agent under the Escrow
Agreement or to the Paying Agent under the Paying Agent Agreement, in each
case as the Shareholder Representative, in its sole and absolute discretion,
may determine to be necessary or appropriate. The Shareholder Representative
shall have no right to act as agent for service of process for any one of the
Company Shareholders, except that any notice delivered to the Shareholder
Representative from the Purchaser or the Escrow Agent with respect to the
Escrow Agreement, or from the Paying Agent with respect to Paying Agent
Agreement, shall be deemed notice to all Company Shareholders with respect
thereto and any notice delivered to the Shareholder Representative with
respect to any claim under Article VIII and any other matter under this
Agreement after the Closing shall be deemed notice to all Company Shareholders
with respect thereto.

  

  

(c) The Purchaser shall be named as a third party beneficiary in the
Shareholder Representative Agreement. Neither the removal of a then acting
Shareholder Representative nor such appointment of a successor Shareholder
Representative shall be effective until notice of such act has been provided
to the Purchaser and the delivery to the Purchaser and Escrow Agent of
executed counterparts of a writing signed by sufficient number of Company
Shareholders necessary to authorize such removal and appointment, together
with an acknowledgment signed by the successor Shareholder Representative
appointed in such writing that it, he or she accepts the responsibility of
successor Shareholder Representative and agrees to perform and be bound by all
of the provisions of this Agreement applicable to the Shareholder
Representative, with a copy of such acknowledgement being promptly provided to
the Purchaser. Each successor Shareholder Representative shall have all of the
power, authority, rights and privileges conferred by this Agreement upon the
original Shareholder Representative, and the term "Shareholder Representative"
as used herein, in the Escrow Agreement and the Paying Agent Agreement shall
be deemed to include any interim or successor Shareholder Representative.

  

  

(d) The Purchaser will at all times without any further act or inquiry have
the right to rely on any act, decision, consent or instruction of, or
instrument or other writing executed by, the Shareholder Representative as the
final and binding act of all of the Company Shareholders, and by approval of
the Merger the Company Shareholders waive any claim arising out of, or right
to object to, any action so taken by the Purchaser or any of its
Representatives or Affiliates. It is understood and agreed by each of the
parties hereto that nothing in this Agreement shall be construed or deemed to
expand or create any right on the part of a Company Shareholder, with respect
to the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, or any obligation on the part of
the Purchaser, or any of its Affiliates, to any Company Shareholder not
otherwise expressly set forth in clear and unambiguous terms in this Agreement
(to the extent that there may be any such provisions herein).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

85  

  

 

 

 

  

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 9.1, the
Shareholder Representative shall not have any power or authority to act for or
on behalf of any Company Shareholder or its heirs, successors or assigns, with
respect to any claim that a Company Shareholder, in its capacity as such,
committed fraud (each, an "Individual Shareholder Claim"). The Shareholder
Representative shall have no right to act as agent for service of process for
any Company Shareholder with respect to an Individual Stockholder Claim.

  

  

Section 9.2 Notices.

for in this Agreement shall be provided or made in writing and shall be

agents relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the New Financing or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.
