(3)   RETEK INC., a Delaware corporation (the COMPANY).

WHEREAS:

(A)   the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Sub and the Company have
      approved the acquisition of the Company on the terms and subject to the
      conditions set forth in this Agreement;

(B)   in furtherance of such acquisition, Parent will cause Sub to make a tender
      offer (as it may be amended from time to time as permitted under this
      Agreement, the OFFER) to purchase all the outstanding shares of common
      stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the COMPANY COMMON
      STOCK) at a price per share of Company Common Stock of $8.50, net to the
      seller in cash (the OFFER PRICE), on the terms and subject to the
      conditions set forth in this Agreement;

(C)   the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Sub and the Company have
      approved the merger (the MERGER) of Sub into the Company on the terms and
      subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, whereby each issued
      share of Company Common Stock not owned directly by Parent, Sub or the
      Company (other than Appraisal Shares, as defined in Section 3.1(d)) shall
      be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the
      Offer Price on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
      Agreement; and

(D)   Parent, Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations,
      warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Offer and the

            the Offer or (vii) amend any other condition of the Offer in any
            manner adverse to the Company's stockholders. Sub may, without the
            consent of the Company, (A) extend the Offer in increments of not
            more than ten business days each, if at the scheduled Expiration
            Date any of the conditions to Sub's obligation to purchase shares of
            Company Common Stock are not satisfied, until such time as such
            conditions are satisfied or waived, (B) extend the Offer for any
            period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation, position or
            request of the SEC or the staff thereof applicable to the Offer and
            (C) make available a subsequent offering period (within the meaning
            of Rule 14d-11 promulgated by the SEC). Without limiting the right
            of Sub to extend the Offer, in the event that any condition set
            forth in Annex 1 is not satisfied or waived at the scheduled
            Expiration Date, at the request of the Company, Sub shall, and
            Parent shall cause Sub to, extend the Expiration Date of the Offer
            in increments of five business days each until the earliest to occur
            of (v) the date that is 15 days after the initial Expiration Date,
            (w) the satisfaction or waiver of such condition, (x) the
            determination by Parent that such condition to the Offer is not
            capable of being satisfied on or prior to the date specified in
            Section 9.1(b)(ii)(B), provided that such inability to satisfy such
            condition is not due to any failure of Parent or Sub to perform in
            any material respect any covenant or agreement of Parent or Sub
            contained herein, or the material breach by Parent or Sub of any
            representation or warranty contained herein, (y) the termination of
            this Agreement in accordance with its terms and (z) the date
            specified in Section 9.1(b)(ii)(B); provided, however, that Parent
            and Sub shall not be required to so extend the Expiration Date if
            the failure to satisfy any condition set forth in Annex 1 was caused
            by or resulted from the failure of the Company to perform in any
            material respect any covenant or agreement of the Company contained
            herein, or the material breach by the Company of any representation
            or warranty contained herein. On the terms and subject to the
            conditions of the Offer and this Agreement, Sub shall, and Parent
            shall cause Sub to, accept for payment shares of Company Common
            Stock tendered as soon as it is legally permitted to do so under
            applicable Law.

      (b)   On the date of commencement of the Offer, Sub shall, and Parent
            shall cause Sub to, file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on
            Schedule TO with respect to the Offer, which shall contain an offer
            to purchase and a related letter of transmittal and summary
            advertisement (such Schedule TO and the documents included therein
            pursuant to which the Offer will be made, together with any
            supplements or amendments thereto, the OFFER DOCUMENTS). The Company
            shall cooperate fully in the preparation of the Offer Documents and
            the Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity
            to review the Offer Documents before they are filed with the SEC.
            Each of Parent, Sub and the Company shall promptly correct any
            information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to
            the extent that such information shall have become false or
            misleading in any material respect, and each of Parent and Sub shall
            take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the Offer Documents
            and to cause the Offer Documents as so amended or supplemented to be
            filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to the Company's
            stockholders, in each case as and to the extent required by
            applicable Federal securities Law. Parent and Sub shall provide the
            Company and its counsel in writing with any comments Parent, Sub or
            their counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to
            the Offer Documents promptly after the receipt of such comments.

            Offer Documents the information set forth in any such registration
            statement to the extent and within the time period required by
            Chapter 80B of the Minnesota Statutes.

      (a)   The Company hereby approves of and consents to the Offer, the Merger
            and the other matters contemplated by this Agreement (collectively,
            the TRANSACTIONS).

      (b)   On the date the Offer Documents are filed with the SEC and as soon
            as practicable on such date after such filing, the Company shall
            file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on
            Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the Offer, including an appropriate
            information statement (INFORMATION STATEMENT) under Rule 14f-1 (such
            Schedule 14D-9 and Information Statement, as amended or supplemented
            from time to time, the SCHEDULE 14D-9) containing the determinations
            and recommendations described in Section 4.4(b) and shall mail the
            Schedule 14D-9 to all holders of Company Common Stock. Each of
            Parent, Sub and their counsel shall be given a reasonable
            opportunity to review the Schedule 14D-9 before it is filed with
            SEC. Each of the Company, Parent and Sub shall promptly correct any
            information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to
            the extent that such information shall have become false or
            misleading in any material respect, and the Company shall take all
            steps necessary to amend or supplement the Schedule 14D-9 and to
            cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so amended or supplemented to be filed
            with the SEC and disseminated to all Company stockholders, in each
            case as and to the extent required by applicable Federal securities
            Law. The Company shall provide Parent and its counsel in writing
            with any comments the Company or its counsel may receive from the
            SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after
            the receipt of such comments.

      (c)   In connection with the Offer, the Company shall cause its transfer
            agent to furnish Sub promptly with mailing labels containing the
            names and addresses of the record holders of Company Common Stock as
            of the most recent practicable date and of those persons becoming
            record holders subsequent to such date, together with copies of all
            lists of stockholders, security position listings and computer files
            and all other information in the Company's possession or control
            regarding the beneficial owners of Company Common Stock, and shall
            furnish to Sub such information and assistance (including updated
            lists of stockholders, security position listings and computer
            files) as Parent or Sub may reasonably request in communicating the
            Offer to the Company's stockholders. Subject to the requirements of
            applicable Law, and except for such steps as are necessary to
            disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to
            consummate the Transactions, Parent and Sub shall hold in confidence
            the information contained in any such labels, listings and files,
            shall use such information only in connection with the Offer and the
            Merger and, if this Agreement shall be terminated in accordance with
            Section 9.1, shall, upon written request, deliver, and shall use
            their reasonable efforts to cause their affiliates, agents and
            advisors to deliver, to the Company all copies of such information
            then in their possession.

1.3   DIRECTORS

      (a)   Promptly upon the acceptance for payment of, and payment by Sub for,
            any shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer, Sub shall
            be entitled to designate such number of directors on the Company
            Board as will give Sub, subject to compliance with Section 14(f) of
            the


                                       3
<PAGE>

            Exchange Act, representation on the Company Board equal to at least
            that number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, that
            equals the product of (i) the total number of directors on the
            Company Board (giving effect to the directors elected pursuant to
            this sentence) multiplied by (ii) the percentage that (A) such
            number of shares of Company Common Stock so accepted for payment and
            paid for by Sub plus the number of shares of Company Common Stock
            otherwise owned by Sub or any other subsidiary of Parent bears to
            (B) the number of such shares outstanding, and the Company shall, at
            such time, cause Sub's designees to be so elected or appointed to
            the Company Board, provided that in the event that Sub's designees
            are appointed or elected to the Company Board, until the Effective
            Time the Company Board shall have at least three directors who are
            members of the Company Board on the date of this Agreement and who
            are not officers of the Company (the INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS); and
            provided further that, in such event, if the number of Independent
            Directors shall be reduced below three for any reason whatsoever,
            the remaining Independent Directors shall be entitled to nominate a
            person to fill such vacancy who shall be deemed to be an Independent
            Director for purposes of this Agreement or, if no Independent
            Directors then remain, the other directors shall designate two
            persons to fill such vacancies who are not officers, employees,
            stockholders or affiliates of the Company, Parent or Sub, and such
            persons shall be deemed to be Independent Directors for purposes of
            this Agreement. Subject to applicable Law, the Company shall take
            all action requested by Parent necessary to effect any such election
            or appointment, including mailing to its stockholders the
            Information Statement containing the information required by Section
            14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder, and
            the Company shall make such mailing with the mailing of the Schedule
            14D-9 (provided that Sub shall have provided to the Company on a
            timely basis all information required to be included in the
            Information Statement with respect to Sub's designees). In
            connection with the foregoing, the Company shall promptly, at the
            option of Sub, either increase the size of the Company Board or
            obtain the resignation of such number of its current directors as is
            necessary to enable Sub's designees to be elected or appointed to
            the Company Board as provided above. The Company shall also use its
            reasonable efforts to cause the Sub's designees to be
            proportionately represented on each committee of the Company Board
            (other than any committee of the Company Board established to take
            action under this Agreement) and each board of directors of each
            subsidiary of the Company designated by Sub.

      (b)   Following the election or appointment of Sub's designees pursuant to
            Section 1.3(a) until the Effective Time, the concurrence of a
            majority of the Independent Directors shall be required for any
            amendment to this Agreement, any termination of this Agreement by
            the Company, any extension by the Company of the time for the
            performance of any of the obligations of Sub or Parent under this
            Agreement (except as expressly permitted hereunder), any
            recommendation to stockholders or any modification or withdrawal of
            any such recommendation, any retention of counsel or other advisors
            in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, any
            required or permitted consent or action by the Company Board
            hereunder or any waiver of any of the Company's rights or Parent's
            or Sub's obligations under this Agreement.

1.4   TOP-UP OPTION

      (a)   Subject to the terms and conditions herein, the Company hereby
            grants to Parent an irrevocable option (the TOP-UP OPTION) to
            purchase up to that number of shares of the Company Common Stock
            (the TOP-UP OPTION SHARES) equal to the lowest number of shares of
            Company Common Stock that, when added to the number of shares of
            Company Common Stock collectively owned by Parent, Sub and any of
            their respective affiliates immediately following consummation of
            the Offer shall constitute 90% of the shares of Company Common Stock
            then outstanding (after giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up
            Option Shares) at a purchase price per Top-Up


                                       4
<PAGE>

            Option Share equal to the Offer Price. Notwithstanding the foregoing
            provisions of this Section 1.4(a), the Top-Up Option shall not be
            exercisable if the aggregate number of shares issuable upon exercise
            of the Top-Up Option, plus the aggregate number of then-outstanding
            shares of Company Common Stock, plus the aggregate number of shares
            of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of all options and
            other rights to purchase Company Common Stock, plus the aggregate
            number of shares reserved for issuance pursuant to the Company Stock
            Plans (as defined in Section 7.4) would exceed the number of
            authorized shares of Company Common Stock.

      (b)   Parent may, at its election, exercise the Top-Up Option, in whole,
            but not in part, at any one time after the occurrence of a Top-Up
            Exercise Event and prior to the occurrence of a Top-Up Termination
            Event.

            (i)   A TOP-UP EXERCISE EVENT shall occur upon Parent's or Sub's
                  acceptance for payment pursuant to the Offer (which shall
                  include, for sake of clarity, any subsequent offering period
                  that Parent or Sub may elect to extend pursuant to the terms
                  and conditions of this Agreement) of shares of Company Common
                  Stock constituting, together with Company Common Stock owned
                  directly or indirectly by any other affiliates of Parent, at
                  least 80 percent, but less than 90 percent of the shares of
                  the Company Common Stock then outstanding.

            (ii)  The TOP-UP TERMINATION DATE shall occur upon the earliest to
                  occur of (A) the Effective Time, (B) the termination of this
                  Agreement, (C) the date that is ten business days after the
                  occurrence of a Top-Up Exercise Event, unless the Top-Up
                  Option has been previously exercised in accordance with the
                  terms and conditions hereof and (D) the date that is ten
                  business days after the Top-Up Notice Date unless the Top-Up
                  Closing shall have previously occurred.

      (c)   If Parent wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Parent shall send to
            the Company a written notice (a TOP-UP EXERCISE NOTICE, and the date
            of receipt of which notice is referred to herein as the TOP-UP
            NOTICE DATE) specifying the place for the closing of the purchase
            and sale of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Top-Up
            Option (the TOP-UP CLOSING) and a date not earlier than one business
            day nor later than ten business days after the Top-Up Notice Date
            for the Top-Up Closing. The Company shall, promptly after receipt of
            the Top-Up Exercise Notice, deliver a written notice to Parent
            confirming the number of Top-Up Option Shares and the aggregate
            purchase price therefor.

      (d)   At the Top-Up Closing, subject to the terms and conditions of this
            Agreement, (i) the Company shall deliver to Parent a certificate or
            certificates evidencing the applicable number of Top-Up Option
            Shares, provided that the obligation of the Company to deliver
            Top-Up Option Shares upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option is
            subject to the condition that no provision of any applicable Law or
            Judgment shall prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the
            delivery of the Top-Up Option Shares in respect of any such exercise
            and (ii) Parent shall purchase each Top-Up Option Share from the
            Company at the Offer Price. Payment by Parent of the purchase price
            for the Top-Up Option Shares may be made, at Parent's option, by
            delivery of (A) immediately available funds by wire transfer to an
            account designated by the Company or (B) a demand note issued by
            Parent in customary form that is reasonably acceptable to the
            parties and in a principal face amount equal to the aggregate amount
            of the cash portion of the purchase price for the Top-Up Option
            Shares. Any demand note issued pursuant to the preceding sentence
            shall be accompanied by a credit support arrangement reasonably
            acceptable to the parties hereto.


                                       5

            Notice, and the tender of the consideration described in Section
            1.4(d), Parent shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the
            Top-Up Option Shares issuable upon that exercise, notwithstanding
            that the stock transfer books of the Company shall then be closed or
            that certificates representing those Top-Up Option Shares shall not
            then be actually delivered to Parent or the Company shall have
            failed or refused to designate the bank account described in Section
            1.4(d).

      (f)   Certificates evidencing Top-Up Option Shares delivered hereunder may
            include legends legally required including a legend in substantially
            the following form:

            THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN

3.    EFFECT ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF
      CERTIFICATES

3.1   EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK

      At the Effective Time, the following events shall occur by virtue of the
      Merger and without any further action on the part of Sub, the Company or
      the holders of any securities of the Company or Sub.

      (a)   CAPITAL STOCK OF SUB. Each issued and outstanding share of common
            stock of Sub shall be converted into and become one validly issued,
            fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01
            per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

      (b)   CANCELLATION OF TREASURY STOCK AND PARENT-OWNED STOCK. Each share of
            Company Common Stock that, immediately prior to the Effective Time,
            is owned directly by the Company as treasury stock, or by Parent or
            Sub, shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and
            no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

      (c)   CONVERSION OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK.

            (i)   Subject to Sections 3.1(b) and 3.1(d), each share of Company
                  Common Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior
                  to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to
                  receive an amount in cash equal to the Offer Price, without
                  interest (the MERGER CONSIDERATION).


                                       7
<PAGE>

            (ii)  As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common
                  Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
                  be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
                  certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time
                  represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (a
                  CERTIFICATE) shall cease to have any rights with respect
                  thereto, except the right to receive Merger Consideration,
                  without interest, upon surrender of such Certificate in
                  accordance with Section 3.2.

      (d)   APPRAISAL RIGHTS. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
            contrary, shares (APPRAISAL SHARES) of Company Common Stock that are
            issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
            that are held by any person who is entitled to demand and properly
            demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who complies in
            all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (SECTION 262), shall not
            be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as
            provided in Section 3.1(c), but instead such holder shall be
            entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares in accordance
            with Section 262. At the Effective Time, all Appraisal Shares shall
            no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
            shall cease to exist, and each holder of Appraisal Shares shall
            cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
            receive the fair value of such shares in accordance with the
            provisions of Section 262. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any
            such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw
            or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 or if a court of
            competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not
            entitled to the relief provided by Section 262, then the right of
            such holder to be paid the fair value of such holder's Appraisal
            Shares under Section 262 shall cease and each such Appraisal Share
            shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time
            into, and to have become, the right to receive Merger Consideration
            without interest as provided in Section 3.1(c). The Company shall
            provide prompt notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any
            shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 262, and Parent
            shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations
            and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective
            Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
            Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
            settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

3.2   EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

      (a)   PAYING AGENT. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a
            bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act
            as agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration (the PAYING
            AGENT). From time to time after the Effective Time, Parent shall
            provide, or cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, to the
            Paying Agent funds in amounts and at the times necessary for the
            payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(c) upon
            surrender of Certificates, it being understood that any and all
            interest or income earned on funds made available to the Paying
            Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall be turned over to Parent
            (such funds being hereinafter referred to as the EXCHANGE FUND).

      (b)   EXCHANGE PROCEDURE. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
            Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record
            of a Certificate (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify
            that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
            Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
            Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in customary form and
            have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and
            (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of a
            Certificate in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender
            of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with
            such letter of transmittal, duly completed, validly executed and
            authenticated, and such other documents as may reasonably be
            required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall
            be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash into
            which the shares formerly represented


                                       8
<PAGE>

            by such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to Section
            3.1(c), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
            cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common
            Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer books of the
            Company, the proper amount of cash may be paid in exchange therefor
            to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so
            surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be properly
            endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person
            requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes
            required by reason of the payment to a person other than the
            registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the
            satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid or is not
            applicable. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash
            payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

      (c)   NO FURTHER OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN COMPANY COMMON STOCK. All cash paid
            upon the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with the terms of
            this Article 3 shall be deemed to have been paid in full
            satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company
            Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate. At the close
            of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock
            transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no
            further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
            Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that
            were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after
            the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
            Corporation or the Paying Agent for transfer or any other reason,
            they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article 3.

      (d)   NO LIABILITY. None of Parent, Sub, the Company or the Paying Agent
            shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash delivered to a
            public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
            escheat or similar Law.

      (e)   LOST CERTIFICATES. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen,
            defaced or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
            by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, defaced
            or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such person
            of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct as
            indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Surviving
            Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall
            pay in respect of such lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed
            Certificate the Merger Consideration with respect to each share of
            Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate.

      (f)   WITHHOLDING RIGHTS. Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
            Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold any applicable taxes
            from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
            to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock. To the extent that
            amounts are so deducted and withheld and paid over to the
            appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
            the Paying Agent, such deducted and withheld amounts shall be
            treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
            the stockholder in respect of which such deduction and withholding
            was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.

      (g)   TERMINATION OF EXCHANGE FUND. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
            remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for six
            months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon
            demand, and any holder of a Certificate who has not theretofore
            complied with this Article 3 shall thereafter look only to Parent,
            as general unsecured creditors thereof, for payment of its claim for
            Merger Consideration.

4.    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

      Except as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered to Parent and Sub
      contemporaneously with the execution of this Agreement (the COMPANY
      DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE), the Company represents and warrants to Parent and
      Sub as follows:

4.1   ORGANIZATION, STANDING AND POWER

      The Company and each of its subsidiaries (the COMPANY SUBSIDIARIES) is a
      corporation or other legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in
      good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept)
      under the Law of the jurisdiction in which it is organized and has the
      requisite corporate or other power, as the case may be, and authority
      necessary to enable it to own, lease or otherwise hold its properties and
      assets and to conduct its businesses as currently conducted. The Company
      and each of the Company Subsidiaries is duly qualified to do business in
      each jurisdiction where the nature of its businesses or its ownership or
      leasing of properties make such qualification necessary except where the
      failure to so qualify has not had and would not reasonably be expected to
      have a material adverse effect (as defined in Section 10.3) on the Company
      and the Company Subsidiaries taken as a whole (a COMPANY MATERIAL ADVERSE
      EFFECT). The Company has delivered to Parent true and complete copies of
      the certificate of incorporation of the Company, as amended to the date of
      this Agreement (as so amended, the COMPANY CHARTER), and the by-laws of
      the Company, as amended to the date of this Agreement (as so amended, the
      COMPANY BY-LAWS), and the comparable charter and organizational documents
      of each of the Company Subsidiaries, in each case as amended through the
      date of this Agreement. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is
      in default or violation of any term, provision or condition of any
      document referred to in the preceding sentence.

4.2   COMPANY SUBSIDIARIES; EQUITY INTERESTS

            Company Subsidiaries and its jurisdiction of organization. All the

            in, each of the Company Subsidiaries have been validly issued and
            are fully paid and nonassessable and are owned by the Company, by
            another Company Subsidiary or by the Company and another Company
            Subsidiary, free and clear of all pledges, claims, liens, charges,
            mortgages, encumbrances and security interests of any kind or nature
            whatsoever (including any restriction on the right to vote, sell,
            transfer, pledge or otherwise dispose of capital stock or other
            ownership interests) (collectively, LIENS).

      (b)   Except for its interests in the Company Subsidiaries, the Company
            does not own, directly or indirectly, any capital stock, membership
            interest, partnership interest, joint venture interest or other
            equity or ownership interest in any person.

            commitments, Contracts, arrangements or undertakings of any kind to
            which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or by which
            any of them is bound (x) obligating the Company or any Company
            Subsidiary to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued,
            delivered or sold, additional shares of capital stock or other
            equity interests in, or any security convertible or exercisable for

            terms of all outstanding Company Stock Options and all outstanding
            Company SARs granted under any Company Stock Plan, by resolution or
            other action, to provide that each such Company Stock Option and
            Company SAR outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
            shall be cancelled in accordance with Section 7.4, with the holder
            thereof becoming entitled to receive the amount of cash specified in
            Section 7.4. Such cancellation of Company Stock Options and Company
            SARs in exchange for the cash

<PAGE>

            payments described in Section 7.4 will extinguish any and all rights
            the holders of such Company Stock Options and Company SARs had or
            may have had in respect thereof. No consents of the holders of the
            Company Stock Options or Company SARs are necessary to effectuate
            the foregoing. The Company Board or a committee administering the
            Company Stock Plans has the power and authority to cause (i) the
            Company Stock Plans to terminate as of the Effective Time and (ii)
            the provisions in any other Company Benefit Plan providing for the

            any interest in respect of any capital stock of the Company to be
            deleted as of the Effective Time. Following the Effective Time no
            holder of a Company Stock Option or Company SAR or any participant
            in any Company Stock Plan or other Company Benefit Plan will have
            any right thereunder to acquire any capital stock of the Company or
            the Surviving Corporation.

      (a)   The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to
            execute, deliver and perform this Agreement and to consummate the
            Transactions. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company
            of this Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the
            Transactions have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate
            and stockholder action on the part of the Company, subject, in the
            case of the Merger, to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval
            if required by applicable Law. The Company has duly executed and
            delivered this Agreement and this Agreement constitutes its legal,
            valid and binding obligation, enforceable against the Company in
            accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be
            limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium and other similar Laws
            affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of
            equity.

      (b)   The Board of Directors of the Company (the COMPANY BOARD), at a
            meeting duly called and held at which directors of the Company
            constituting a quorum were present, duly and unanimously adopted
            resolutions (i) approving and declaring advisable this Agreement,
            the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions, (ii) determining
            that the terms of the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions
            are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its
            stockholders, (iii) recommending that the holders of Company Common
            Stock accept the Offer and tender their shares of Company Common
            Stock pursuant to the Offer, (iv) directing that, if required by the
            DGCL, this Agreement be submitted to a vote at a meeting of the
            Company's stockholders and (v) recommending that, if required by the
            DGCL, the Company's stockholders adopt this Agreement. Such
            resolutions are sufficient to render the restrictions on "business
            combinations" (as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) of Section 203
            of the DGCL inapplicable to Parent and Sub and this Agreement, the
            Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions. Other than Section 203
            of the DGCL and Chapter 80B of the Minnesota Statutes, no state
            takeover statute or similar statute or regulation applies to the
            Company or any Company Subsidiary with respect to this Agreement,
            the Offer, the Merger or any other Transaction.

      (c)   The Company has been advised by each of its directors and executive
            officers (which executive officers are, to the knowledge of the
            Company, aware of the Transactions as of the date hereof) that each
            such person intends to tender and sell all shares of Company Common
            Stock owned by such person in the Offer, except to the extent of any
            restrictions created by Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act
            of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated
            thereunder (the EXCHANGE ACT) and otherwise intends to support the
            consummation of the Transactions.

            Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in excess of $5,000,000.

      (b)   No consent, approval, license, permit, order or authorization
            (CONSENT) of, or registration, declaration or filing with, or Permit
            from, any Federal, state, local or foreign government or any court
            of competent jurisdiction, administrative agency or commission or

            or supranational (a GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY), or termination or
            expiration of any waiting period under applicable Law, is required
            to be obtained or made by or with respect to the Company or any
            Company Subsidiary in connection with the execution, delivery and
            performance of this Agreement or the consummation of the
            Transactions, other than: (i) compliance with and filings under the
            Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended
            (the HSR ACT) and all other applicable competition and antitrust

            the Company's stockholders (the PROXY STATEMENT), if such adoption
            is required by Law, (C) the Information Statement and (D) such
            reports under Section 13 of the Exchange Act, as may be required in

            Statutes.

4.6   SEC DOCUMENTS; UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES

      (a)   The Company has filed all reports, schedules, forms, statements and
            other documents required to be filed by the Company with the SEC
            since December 31, 2002 (together with all information incorporated
            therein by reference, the SEC DOCUMENTS). As of its respective date,
            each SEC Document complied in all material respects with the
            requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the
            rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the SECURITIES ACT),
            the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and the rules
            and regulations promulgated thereunder (SOX), in each case,
            applicable to such SEC Document, and none of the SEC


                                       13
<PAGE>

            Documents contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
            omitted a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
            in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
            circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Except to
            the extent that information contained in any SEC Document has been
            duly revised or superseded by a later-filed SEC Document filed and
            publicly available prior to February 24, 2005 (a FILED SEC
            DOCUMENT), none of the SEC Documents contains any untrue statement
            of a material fact or omits any material fact required to be stated
            therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
            light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
            misleading. As of their respective dates of filing with the SEC, the
            consolidated financial statements (including the related notes) of
            the Company included in the SEC Documents complied as to form in all
            material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the
            published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto,
            have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
            principles in the United States (GAAP) (except, in the case of
            unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied
            on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be
            indicated in the notes thereto). Such consolidated financial
            statements fairly present the consolidated financial position of the
            Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the dates thereof
            and the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for
            the periods then ended. None of the Company Subsidiaries is, or has
            at any time been, subject to the reporting requirements of Section
            13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

      (b)   Except as set forth on the face of, or expressly identified in the
            notes to, the most recent balance sheet of the Company included in
            the Filed SEC Documents, neither the Company nor any Company
            Subsidiary has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether
            accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) required under GAAP to
            be set forth on such balance sheet or in such notes thereto that
            individually or in the aggregate have had or would reasonably be
            expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

      (c)   Each of the Company and its senior financial officers has consulted
            with the Company's independent auditors and with the Company's
            outside counsel with respect to, and (to the extent applicable to
            the Company) is familiar in all material respects with, the
            requirements of SOX as in existence on the date hereof. The Company
            is, and has been, in compliance in all material respects with the
            provisions of SOX applicable to it.

      (d)   Each of the principal executive officer of the Company and the
            principal financial officer of the Company has made all
            certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange
            Act and Sections 302 and 906 of SOX with respect to the SEC
            Documents, and the statements contained in such certifications are
            accurate in all material respects as of the date hereof. For
            purposes of this Agreement, "principal executive officer" and
            "principal financial officer" shall have the meanings given to such
            terms in SOX. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has
            outstanding, or has arranged any outstanding, "extensions of credit"
            to directors or executive officers within the meaning of Section 402
            of SOX.

      (e)   Neither the Company nor Company Subsidiary is a party to, or has any
            commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance
            sheet partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract
            relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the
            Company and any Company Subsidiary, on the one hand, and any
            unconsolidated affiliate, including any structured finance, special
            purpose or limited purpose entity or person, on the other hand or
            any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of
            Regulation S-K of the SEC)), where the result, purpose or effect of
            such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction
            involving, or material liabilities of, the Company or any Company
            Subsidiary in the


                                       14
<PAGE>

            Company's or such Company Subsidiary's published financial
            statements or other SEC Documents.

      (f)   The books, records and accounts of the Company, all of which have
            been made available to Parent upon Parent's request, are complete
            and correct in all material respects.

      (g)   The Company's system of internal controls over financial reporting
            are reasonably sufficient in all material respects to provide
            reasonable assurance (i) that transactions are recorded as necessary
            to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with
            GAAP, (ii) that receipts and expenditures are executed only in
            accordance with the authorization of management and (iii) regarding
            prevention or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use
            or disposition of the Company's assets that would materially affect
            the Company's financial statements. No significant deficiency or
            material weakness was identified in management's assessment of
            internal controls as of December 31, 2004 (nor has any such
            deficiency or weakness since been identified) and, to management's
            knowledge and belief, the Company's external auditors are in a
            position to deliver an attestation without qualification of
            management's internal control report to be included in the Company's
            Form 10-K filing for the period ended December 31, 2004.

      (h)   The Company's "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in
            Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) are reasonably
            designed to ensure that (i) all information (both financial and
            non-financial) required to be disclosed by the Company in the
            reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
            processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
            in the rules and forms of the SEC and (ii) all such information is
            accumulated and communicated to the Company's management as
            appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure
            and to make the certifications of the principal executive officer
            and principal financial officer of the Company required under the
            Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

      (i)   Since the date of this Agreement, neither the chief executive
            officer nor the chief financial officer of the Company has become
            aware of any fact or circumstance that is reasonably likely to
            result in a substantial change to the Company's internal controls
            over financial reporting.

      (j)   Since the date of the most recent Filed SEC Report, neither the
            chief executive officer nor the chief financial officer of the
            Company has become aware of any fact, circumstance or change that is
            reasonably likely to result in a "material weakness" in the
            Company's internal controls over financial reporting.

      (k)   The audit committee of the Board of Directors of the Company
            includes an Audit Committee Financial Expert, as defined by Item
            401(h)(2) of Regulation S K.

      (l)   The Company has adopted a code of ethics, as defined by Item 406(b)
            of Regulation S-K, for senior financial officers, applicable to its
            principal financial officer, comptroller or principal accounting
            officer, or persons performing similar functions. The Company has
            promptly disclosed, by filing a Form 8-K, any change in or waiver of
            the Company's code of ethics, as required by Section 406(b) of SOX.
            To the knowledge of the Company, there have been no violations of
            provisions of the Company's code of ethics.

      inclusion or incorporation by reference in (a) the Offer Documents, the
      Schedule 14D-9 or the Information Statement will, at the time such
      document is filed with the SEC, at any time it is amended or supplemented
      or at the time it is first published, sent or given to the Company's

      required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
      therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
      misleading. The Schedule 14D-9, the Information Statement and the Proxy
      Statement will comply as to form in all material respects with the
      requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder,
      except that no representation is made by the Company pursuant to this
      Section 4.7 with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference
      therein based on information supplied by Parent or Sub for inclusion or
      incorporation by reference therein.

      business in the ordinary course of business and there has not been:

      (a)   any event, change or development that, individually or in the

            be paid all material Taxes due with respect to the taxable periods
            covered by such Tax Returns and all other Taxes otherwise due and

            Tax Return filed by the Company or any Company Subsidiary. No claim
            has been made by any Tax authority in a jurisdiction where the

            is or may be subject to Taxation by that jurisdiction.

            under Treasury Regulation 1.1502-6 or comparable provision of
            foreign, state or local Law) with any party other than the Company
            or any Company Subsidiary or (ii) tax indemnity obligation or
            similar agreement, arrangement or practice (including any liability
            for Taxes of any other Person under Treasury Regulation 1.1502-6 or
            comparable provision of foreign, state or local Law) other than with
            respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary. Neither the
            Company nor any Company Subsidiary is liable for Taxes of any other
            Person other than the Company or any Company Subsidiary as
            transferee or otherwise and whether by contract or otherwise.

      (e)   There is no currently effective agreement or other document
            extending the period of limitation on assessment or collection of

            similar provisions under any state, local or foreign Laws).

      (g)   Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has constituted
            either a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" in
            a distribution of stock qualifying for tax-free treatment under
            Section 355 of the Code in the two-year period ending on the date of
            this Agreement (or will constitute such a corporation in the
            two-year period ending on the Effective Time).

      (h)   For purposes of this Agreement:

            (i)   TAX or TAXES (and with correlative meaning, TAXATION) means
                  any and all taxes, charges, fees, levies, tariffs, duties,

            Internal Revenue Service with respect to TRA (as defined in Section

            would adversely affect its qualification or materially increase its
            costs.

      (c)   With respect to all Company Benefit Plans, the reporting, disclosure

            Plans, any trusts created thereunder or any trustee or administrator
            thereof, has engaged in a "prohibited transaction" (as defined in
            Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) or any other
            breach of fiduciary responsibility that would subject the Company,
            any Company Subsidiary or any officer of the Company or any Company
            Subsidiary to the tax or penalty on prohibited transactions imposed
            by such Section 4975 or to any liability under Section 502(i) or

            of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a COMPANY MULTIEMPLOYER PENSION
            PLAN), and neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any
            actual or contingent liability under any former Company
            Multiemployer Pension Plan.

            Section 419(e) of the Code), (ii) each such Company Benefit Plan
            that is a "group health plan" (as defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of
            the Code) complies in all material respects with the applicable
            requirements of Section 4980B(f) of the Code and (iii) each such
            Company Benefit Plan (including any such Plan covering retirees or
            other former employees) may be amended or terminated without
            material liability to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries on or

            Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the COMPANY ESPP)), the consummation
            of the Offer, the Merger or any other Transaction will not (i)

            or property or the vesting of property) as a result of the Offer,
            the Merger or any other Transaction (including as a result of
            termination of employment on or following the Effective Time) by any
            employee, officer or director of the Company or any of its

            characterized as an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in

            entitled to receive any additional payment from the Company or any

            sought or imposed thereby.

      (b)   There is no investigation or review by any Governmental Entity or
            self-regulatory authority with respect to the Company or any Company
            Subsidiary (excluding investigations and reviews of Intellectual
            Property applications by the Intellectual Property offices of a
            Governmental Entity) or any of their respective employees (insofar
            as any such investigation or review relates to their activities with
            the Company or any Company Subsidiary) actually pending or, to the
            knowledge of the Company, threatened, nor has any Governmental
            Entity or self-regulatory authority indicated to the Company or any
            Company Subsidiary in writing or, to the knowledge of the Company,
            verbally, an intention to conduct the same.

4.13  COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAW

      (a)   Except as disclosed in the Filed SEC Documents, the Company and the
            Company Subsidiaries and their personnel and operations are, and
            since January 1, 2003 have been, in compliance in all material
            respects with all material Laws applicable to the Company or any
            Company Subsidiary. Except as disclosed in the Filed SEC Documents,
            neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received any
            written notice since January 1, 2003 (i) of any administrative,
            civil or criminal investigation or audit (other than Tax audits) by
            any Governmental Entity relating to the Company or any Company
            Subsidiary or (ii) from any Governmental Entity alleging that the
            Company or a Company Subsidiary is not in compliance in any material
            respect with any applicable Law.

      (b)   Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries has in effect all
            approvals, authorizations, certificates, filings, franchises,
            licenses, variances, exemptions, notices, permits and rights of or

            lease or otherwise hold and to operate its properties and assets and
            to carry on its businesses and operations as now conducted, except
            for the failure to have such Permits that, individually and in the
            aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have
            a Company Material Adverse Effect. There have occurred no defaults
            (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) under violations
            of, or event giving to others any right of termination, amendment or
            cancellation of, with or without notice or lapse of time or both,
            any such Permit, except for such defaults, violations and events
            that, individually and in the aggregate, have not had and would not
            reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
            Neither the Offer nor the Merger, in and of itself, would reasonably
            be expected to cause the revocation or cancellation (with or without
            notice or lapse of time or both) of any such Permit that
            individually or in the aggregate would reasonably be expected to
            have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

            Subsidiaries is and has been in compliance with all applicable
            Environmental Laws and possesses and is and has been in compliance
            with all required Environmental Permits; (ii) there are no

            REPRESENTATIVES) of, the Company or any Company Subsidiary to,
            directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage the
            submission of, any Company Takeover Proposal (as defined below),
            (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or
            furnish to any person any information with respect to, or take any
            other action to facilitate knowingly the making of any inquiry or
            any proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to
            lead to, any Company Takeover Proposal or (iii) make or authorize
            any statement, recommendation or solicitation in respect of any
            Company Takeover Proposal (except as permitted by Section 6.2(b)).
            The Company shall, and shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries
            and each Representative of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to,
            (A) immediately cease and cause to be terminated all discussions or
            negotiations with any person conducted heretofore with respect to
            any proposal that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to
            lead to a Company Takeover Proposal and (B) request the prompt
            return or destruction of all confidential information previously
            furnished. The Company shall, and shall cause each Company
            Subsidiary to, enforce (and not release any person from any
            obligations under) any confidentiality, standstill or similar
            agreement to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party.
            Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to acceptance for
            payment of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer, the
            Company may, in response to a Company Takeover Proposal that the
            Company Board determines in good faith after consultation with
            outside counsel and an independent financial advisor of nationally
            recognized reputation is or is reasonably likely to result in a
            Superior Company Proposal (as defined below) that was not solicited
            by the Company or its Representatives and that did not otherwise
            result from a breach or a deemed breach of this Section 6.2(a), and
            subject to providing prior written notice of its decision to take
            such action to Parent and compliance with Section 6.2(c): (x)
            furnish information with respect to the Company and the Company
            Subsidiaries to the person making such Company Takeover Proposal
            pursuant to a confidentiality agreement not less restrictive of the
            other party (including with respect to standstill provisions) than
            the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in Section 7.2), provided
            that all such information not previously provided to Parent
            is provided or made available on a substantially concurrent basis to
            Parent and (y) participate in discussions or negotiations with the
            person making such Company Takeover Proposal regarding such Company
            Takeover Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, any violation of
            the restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by any
            Representative or affiliate of the Company or any Company
            Subsidiary, whether or not such person is purporting to act on
            behalf of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or otherwise, shall
            be deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.2(a) by the Company.

      (b)   Neither the Company nor the Company Board nor any committee thereof
            shall (i) (A) withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify
            the approval or recommendation by the Company Board or any such
            committee of this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger or (B) approve
            or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, any Company
            Takeover Proposal (either (A) or (B) being an ADVERSE CHANGE IN
            RECOMMENDATION) or (ii) approve, cause or permit the Company or any
            Company Subsidiary to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in
            principle, acquisition agreement or similar agreement (each, an
            ACQUISITION AGREEMENT) relating to any Company Takeover Proposal.
            Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may, to the extent that a
            failure to do so would be inconsistent with the fiduciary
            obligations of the Company Board under applicable Law as determined
            in good faith by a majority of the disinterested members thereof
            after consultation with outside counsel, (x) make an Adverse Change
            in Recommendation or (y) at any time prior to the acceptance for
            payment of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer, in
            response to a Superior Company Proposal that was not solicited by or
            on behalf of the Company or any Company Subsidiary and did not
            otherwise

            result from a breach of Section 6.2(a), terminate this Agreement
            pursuant to Section 9.1(e) so long as concurrently with or
            immediately after such termination, the Company Board causes the
            Company to accept such Superior Company Proposal and enter into an
            Acquisition Agreement with respect thereto; provided, however, that
            such determination shall not be made prior to: (1) the fifth
            business day following the receipt by Parent of a Notice of Superior
            Proposal if such Notice of Superior Proposal is received prior to
            the date on which the Company has filed the Schedule 14D-9 or (2)
            the third business day following receipt of such Notice of Superior
            Proposal thereafter. A NOTICE OF SUPERIOR PROPOSAL means a written
            notice to Parent from the Company advising Parent that the Company
            Board is prepared to make an Adverse Change in Recommendation or
            accept a Superior Company Proposal, specifying the terms and
            conditions of such Superior Company Proposal and identifying the
            person making such Superior Company Proposal (it being understood
            and agreed that any amendment to the price or any other material
            term of such Superior Company Proposal shall require a new Notice of
            Superior Proposal and a new three or five business day period, as
            provided above). In determining whether to make an Adverse Change in
            Recommendation or to accept a Superior Company Proposal, the Company
            Board shall give effect to any changes to the terms of this
            Agreement proposed by Parent following receipt of such written
            notice.

      (c)   The Company shall promptly, but in any event within 24 hours, advise
            Parent orally and in writing of any Company Takeover Proposal or any
            inquiry with respect to, or that would reasonably be expected to
            lead to or contemplates, any Company Takeover Proposal (including
            any change to the terms of any such Company Takeover Proposal or
            inquiry) and the identity of the person making any such Company
            Takeover Proposal or inquiry. The Company shall (i) keep Parent
            fully informed of the status of any such Company Takeover Proposal
            or inquiry, (ii) promptly advise Parent of any material amendments
            to the terms of any such Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry and
            (iii) provide to Parent copies of all correspondence and other
            written material in the possession or control of the Company or its
            Representatives, in connection with any Company Takeover Proposal,
            as soon as practicable after receipt or delivery thereof. The
            Company shall not take any actions whether contractually or
            otherwise to limit its ability to comply with its obligations
            hereunder.

      (d)   For purposes of this Agreement:

            (i)   COMPANY TAKEOVER PROPOSAL means any inquiry, proposal or offer
                  from any person relating to, or that is reasonably likely to
                  lead to, directly or indirectly: (A) a merger, consolidation,
                  tender offer, exchange offer, binding share exchange, joint
                  venture, dissolution, recapitalization, liquidation, business
                  combination or other similar transaction involving the Company
                  or any Company Subsidiary, (B) the acquisition by any person
                  in any manner of a number of shares of any class of equity
                  securities of the Company or any Company Subsidiary equal to
                  or greater than 15% of the number of such shares outstanding
                  before such acquisition or (C) the acquisition by any person
                  in any manner, directly or indirectly, of assets that
                  constitute 15% or more of the net revenues, net income, EBITDA
                  or assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries taken as
                  a whole, in each case other than the Transactions.

            (ii)  SUPERIOR COMPANY PROPOSAL means any bona fide written offer
                  not solicited by or on behalf of the Company or any Company
                  Subsidiary made by a third party that if consummated would
                  result in such third party acquiring, directly or indirectly,
                  at least a majority of the voting power of the Company Common
                  Stock (so long as such third party is obliged to consummate a
                  customary back end merger pursuant to which any remaining
                  holders of Company Common Stock are entitled to receive the
                  same

                  consideration) or all or substantially all the assets of the
                  Company and the Company Subsidiaries taken as a whole, (A) for
                  consideration that the Company Board determines in its good
                  faith judgment to be superior from a financial point of view
                  on a present value basis to the holders of Company Common
                  Stock than the Transactions (based on the advice of an
                  independent financial advisor of nationally recognized
                  reputation), taking into account all the terms and conditions
                  of such proposal, this Agreement and any proposal by Parent to
                  amend the terms of this Agreement, (B) for which financing, to
                  the extent required, is then committed, (C) for which, in the
                  good faith judgment of the Company Board, no regulatory
                  approvals are required, including antitrust approvals, that
                  would not reasonably be expected to be obtained without undue
                  cost or delay and (D) that, in the good faith judgment of the
                  Company Board, is otherwise reasonably likely to be
                  consummated, taking into account all legal, financial,
                  regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the person
                  making the proposal.

7.    ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

7.1   PREPARATION OF PROXY STATEMENT; STOCKHOLDERS MEETING

      (a)   If the adoption of this Agreement by the Company's stockholders is
            required by Law, the Company shall, as soon as practicable following
            the expiration of the Offer (provided that the Minimum Tender
            Condition has been satisfied), prepare and file with the SEC the
            Proxy Statement in preliminary form, and each of the Company and
            Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly
            as practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto. The
            Company shall notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any comments
            from the SEC or its staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff
            for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for
            additional information and shall supply Parent with copies of all
            correspondence between the Company or any of its representatives, on
            the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with
            respect to the Proxy Statement. If at any time prior to receipt of
            the Company Stockholder Approval there shall occur any event that
            should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
            Statement, the Company shall promptly prepare and mail to its
            stockholders such an amendment or supplement. No filing of, or
            amendment to, the Proxy Statement or any response to comments of the
            SEC shall be made by the Company without first providing Parent a
            reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. The Company
            shall include in such document or response all comments reasonably
            proposed by Parent and shall not mail any Proxy Statement, or any
            amendment or supplement thereto, to which Parent reasonably objects.
            The Company shall use its reasonable efforts to cause the Proxy
            Statement to be mailed to the Company's stockholders as promptly as
            practicable after filing with the SEC.

      (b)   If the adoption of this Agreement by the Company's stockholders is
            required by Law, the Company shall, as soon as practicable following
            the expiration of the Offer (provided that the Minimum Tender
            Condition has been satisfied), duly call, give notice of, convene
            and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the COMPANY STOCKHOLDERS
            MEETING) for the purpose of seeking the Company Stockholder Approval
            regardless of whether the Company Board determines at any time that
            this Agreement or the Merger are no longer advisable or recommends
            that the stockholders of the Company reject this Agreement or the
            Merger. The Company shall, through the Company Board, recommend to
            its stockholders that they give the Company Stockholder Approval
            (subject to Section 6.2(b)). Without limiting the generality of the
            foregoing, the Company agrees that its obligations pursuant to the
            first sentence of this Section 7.1(b) shall not be affected by the
            commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to
            the Company of any Company Takeover Proposal or the occurrence of
            any Adverse Change in


                                       39
<PAGE>
            Recommendation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Sub or any other
            subsidiary of Parent shall acquire at least 90% of the outstanding
            shares of Company Common Stock with or without exercising its rights
            under the Top-Up Option, the parties shall take all necessary and
            appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective as soon
            as practicable after the expiration of the Offer without a
            stockholders meeting in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL.

      (c)   Parent shall cause all shares of Common Stock purchased pursuant to
            the Offer and all other shares of Company Common Stock owned by Sub
            or any other subsidiary of Parent to be voted in favor of the
            approval and adoption of this Agreement.

7.2   ACCESS TO INFORMATION; CONFIDENTIALITY

      (a)   The Company shall, and shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries
            to, afford to Parent, and to Parent's officers, employees,
            accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other advisors and
            representatives, reasonable access during reasonable business hours
            during the period prior to the Effective Time to: (i) all their
            respective properties, facilities, books, contracts, commitments,
            personnel and records and other information and business documents
            and (ii) customers of the Company or any Company Subsidiary as may
            reasonably be designated by Parent, provided that a representative
            of the Company shall be entitled to participate in any meetings or
            calls with such customers. During the period prior to the Effective
            Time, the Company shall, and shall cause each of the Company
            Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to Parent (A) a copy of each
            report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed by
            it during such period pursuant to the requirements of Federal or
            state securities Laws and (B) all other information concerning its
            business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request
            (including the work papers of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP). Without
            limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall, within
            two business days of request therefor, provide to Parent the
            information described in Rule 14a-7(a)(2)(ii) under the Exchange Act
            and any information to which a stockholder of the Company would be
            entitled under Section 219 of the DGCL (assuming such holder met the
            requirements of such section). In connection with the access
            contemplated by this Section 7.2, Parent shall, and shall cause its
            representatives to, act in a manner as not to unreasonably interfere
            with the operations of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries.

      (b)   Neither any investigation conducted by Parent or its representatives
            pursuant to this Section 7.2 nor the results thereof shall affect
            any representation or warranty of the Company contained in this
            Agreement or the ability of Parent to rely thereon. All information
            exchanged pursuant to this Section 7.2 shall be subject to the
            confidentiality agreement dated October 29, 2004, between the
            Company and Parent (the CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT).

7.3   REASONABLE BEST EFFORTS

      (a)   Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
            Agreement (including Section 6.2), each of the parties shall use all
            reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
            and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the
            other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
            consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
            reasonably practicable, the Offer, the Merger and the other
            Transactions, including: (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions
            or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental
            Entities and the making of all necessary registrations and filings
            (including using all reasonable best efforts to cause the pre-merger
            notifications required under the HSR Act to be filed within seven
            business days after the date hereof and including other


                                       40
<PAGE>
            filings with Governmental Entities, if any) and the taking of all
            reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver
            from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental
            Entity, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or
            waivers from third parties, (iii) the defending of any lawsuits or
            other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
            challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions,
            including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order
            entered by any court or other Governmental Entity vacated or
            reversed and (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional
            instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions and to fully
            carry out the purposes of this Agreement; provided, however, that
            Parent shall not be required to consent to any action described in
            paragraph (a) of Annex 1 to this Agreement. In connection with and
            without limiting the foregoing, Parent, Sub, the Company and the
            Company Board shall (A) take all action necessary to ensure that no
            state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or
            becomes applicable to any Transaction or this Agreement and (B) if
            any state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation becomes
            applicable to this Agreement, take all action necessary to ensure
            that the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions may be
            consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by
            this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute
            or regulation on the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions.

      (b)   The Company shall give prompt notice orally and in writing to
            Parent, and Parent or Sub shall give prompt notice orally and in
            writing to the Company, of any failure of any condition to the Offer
            set forth in Annex 1 or any condition to the Merger set forth in
            Article 8; provided, however, that no such notification shall affect
            the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the
            parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under
            this Agreement.

7.4   STOCK OPTIONS

      (a)   The holder of each vested Company Stock Option that has not been
            exercised prior to the Effective Time shall be entitled to receive
            an amount of cash equal to the product of the following: (1) the
            excess, if any, of (A) the per share Merger Consideration over (B)
            the exercise price per share of the Company Common Stock subject to
            such Company Stock Option, multiplied by (2) the number of shares of
            Company Common Stock issuable pursuant to the vested and unexercised
            portion of such Company Stock Option. Any Company Stock Option that
            is unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
            terminated and cancelled as of the Effective Time without any
            consideration paid in respect thereof. No Company Stock Options
            shall be assumed by Parent. No amount greater than the amount
            provided under the first sentence of this subparagraph may be paid
            to any option holder in respect of any Company Stock Option. All
            Company Stock Plans shall be terminated as of the Effective Time.

      (b)   All amounts payable pursuant to this Section 7.4 shall be subject to
            any required withholding of Taxes and shall be paid at or as soon as
            practicable following the Effective Time, but in any event within
            seven days following the Effective Time, without interest. The
            cancellation of Company Stock Options in exchange for the cash
            payments described in this Section 7.4 shall be deemed a release of
            any and all rights the holder of such Company Stock Options had or
            may have had in respect thereof.

      (c)   The Company Board (or if appropriate, any committee administering
            the Company ESPP) has adopted resolutions providing that a new
            purchase date for the Purchase Period (as defined in the Company
            ESPP) ongoing at the date of this Agreement (the CURRENT PURCHASE
            PERIOD) shall be set as of the date immediately preceding the
            Effective Time and any Offering Periods (as defined in the Company
            ESPP) shall end, and each participant's right to purchase any


                                       41
<PAGE>
            Company Common Stock pursuant to the Company ESPP shall be
            converted, as of the date immediately preceding the Effective Time,
            into the right to receive an amount of cash equal to (i) (A) the
            Merger Consideration minus the Purchase Price (as defined in the
            Company ESPP) per share of the Company Common Stock multiplied by
            (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that such
            participant's actual payroll contributions during the Current
            Purchase Period up to the date immediately preceding the Effective
            Time would have purchased at the Purchase Price plus (ii)
            reimbursement of such participant's actual payroll contribution
            during the Current Purchase Period up to the date immediately
            preceding the Effective Time; provided, however, that the maximum
            number of shares that would have been subject to purchase for the
            Current Purchase Period shall not exceed 286,434 shares. The Company
            ESPP shall terminate immediately following the consummation of such
            conversion.

      (d)   As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the
            Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the
            Company Stock Plans) shall take or cause to be taken such actions as
            are required to cause (i) the Company Stock Plans to terminate as of
            the Effective Time and (ii) the provisions in any other Company
            Benefit Plan providing for the issuance, transfer or grant of any
            capital stock of the Company to be deleted as of the Effective Time.

      (e)   In this Agreement:

            (i)   COMPANY SAR means a stock appreciation right awarded pursuant
                  to the Retek Inc. 1999 Equity Incentive Plan;

            (ii)  COMPANY STOCK OPTION means any option to purchase Company
                  Common Stock granted under any Company Stock Plan; and

            (iii) COMPANY STOCK PLANS means the Retek Inc. 1999 Director Stock
                  Option Plan, the Retek Inc. 1999 Equity Incentive Plan, the
                  Retek Inc. 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, the Hightouch
                  Technologies, Inc. 1999 Stock Option Plan, and any other
                  Company stock option, stock incentive, employee stock purchase
                  or other equity-based stock plans in effect, in each case as
                  amended from time to time.

      (f)   Without limiting the generality of Section 10.7 (Entire Agreem; No
            Third-Party Beneficiaries), the provisions of this Section 7.4 shall
            be limited by and subject to the provisions of Section 10.7.

7.5   INDEMNIFICATION

      (a)   Parent and Sub agree that all rights to indemnification for all acts
            or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time now existing in
            favor of the current or former directors or officers of the Company
            and its subsidiaries (the INDEMNIFIED PARTIES) as provided in their
            respective certificates of incorporation, by-laws or indemnification
            agreements shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force
            and effect in accordance with their terms until the expiration of
            the applicable statute of limitations; provided, that in the event
            any claim or claims are asserted or made prior to the expiration of
            all applicable statutes of limitations, all rights to
            indemnification in respect of any such claim or claims shall
            continue until disposition of any and all such claims.

      (b)   Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain
            in effect for six years after the Effective Time the current
            policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained
            by


                                       42
<PAGE>
            the Company and the Company Subsidiaries on the date hereof
            (provided that Parent may substitute therefor policies with
            reputable and financially sound carriers having at least the same
            coverage and amounts thereof and containing material terms and
            conditions that are no less advantageous to the persons currently
            covered by such policies as the insured) for acts or omissions
            occurring at or prior to the Effective Time to the extent that such
            liability insurance can be maintained annually at a cost to Parent
            not greater than 200% of the current annual premium for the current
            Company directors' and officers' liability insurance; provided,
            however, that if such insurance cannot be so maintained or obtained
            at such cost, Parent shall maintain or obtain as much of such
            insurance as can be so maintained or obtained at a cost equal to
            200% of the current annual premium of the Company for such
            insurance.

7.6   FEES AND EXPENSES

      (a)   Except as provided below, all fees and expenses incurred in
            connection with the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions
            shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether
            or not the Offer or the Merger is consummated, except that printing
            costs related to the Transactions are to be shared equally between
            the Company and Parent.

      (b)   In the event that:

            (i)   this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
                  Section 9.1(e) or by Parent or Sub pursuant to Section
                  9.1(d)(i), or

            (ii)  (A) the Company has knowledge of a Company Takeover Proposal,
                  (B) a Company Takeover Proposal shall have been made directly
                  to holders of Company Common Stock or (C) any person has
                  announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make a
                  Company Takeover Proposal, and thereafter this Agreement is
                  terminated pursuant to Section 9.1(b)(ii), 9.1(c), or
                  9.1(d)(ii),

            and within twelve months of such termination the Company either
            enters into an Acquisition Agreement or consummates a Company
            Takeover Proposal, then the Company shall promptly, but in no event
            later than the date of the earliest such event, pay to Parent a fee
            equal to $15,000,000 (the TERMINATION FEE), payable by wire transfer
            of same day funds.

      (c)   The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
            Section 7.6 are an integral part of the Transactions, and that,
            without these agreements, Parent and Sub would not enter into this
            Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to make a
            payment due pursuant to this Section 7.6, and, in order to obtain
            such payment, Parent or Sub commences a suit that results in a
            judgment against the Company, the Company shall pay to Parent and
            Sub their reasonable costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees
            and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest
            on the amount set forth in this Section 7.6 at the prime rate of
            Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be
            made. The Company acknowledges and agrees that the payment of any
            amounts due pursuant to this Section 7.6 shall not constitute the
            exclusive remedy of Parent and Sub under this Agreement. Without
            limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event of a breach
            or deemed breach by the Company of Section 6.2, Parent and Sub shall
            be entitled to the remedies set forth in Section 10.10, including an
            injunction, and all other remedies available at law or in equity to
            which Parent and Sub are entitled.

      (d)   In no event shall more than one Termination Fee be payable
            hereunder.

      issuing, and provide each other a reasonable opportunity to review and
      comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to
      the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions and shall not issue any
      such press release or make any such public statement prior to such

      Transactions shall be paid by the party upon whom the primary burden is
      placed by the applicable Law. Each party shall cooperate with the other in

      The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate at Parent's

      shall not agree to any such settlement without Parent's consent.

7.10  FURTHER ASSURANCES

      At and after the Effective Time, the officers and directors of the

      Surviving Corporation to provide benefit plans and arrangements to

      favorable in the aggregate than the benefit plans and arrangements
      (excluding compensation and equity-based plans and arrangements) provided
      to such employees as of the date hereof. Parent shall, or shall cause the
      Surviving Corporation to (a) waive all limitations as to pre-existing
      conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation
      and coverage requirements applicable to the employees of the Surviving
      Corporation who were employees of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries
      as of the Effective Time under any welfare plan in which such employees

      similar plan of the Company in which such employees participated prior to
      the Effective Time and (b) provide each such employee with credit for
      service with the Company and the Company Subsidiaries under each employee
      benefit plan, program, or arrangement in which such employees become
      eligible to participate following the Effective Time for purposes of
      eligibility to participate and vesting of benefits,

            and filings under any foreign competition and antitrust Law,
            including the German Federal Cartel Office, the absence of which

            consummate the Transactions contemplated hereby whether U.S. or
            foreign shall have been obtained and shall be in full force and

            effect; provided, however, that prior to asserting this condition,
            subject to Section 7.3, the party asserting such condition shall
            have used all reasonable efforts to prevent the entry of any such
            injunction or other order and to appeal as promptly as possible any

      (d)   NO STATUTORY PROHIBITION. No statute, rule or regulation shall have

            payment and paid for shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the

9.    TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

9.1   TERMINATION

      This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger may be abandoned at any
      time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after receipt of
      Company Stockholder Approval:

      (a)   by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

      (b)   by either Parent or the Company:

            (i)   if any Governmental Entity issues an order, decree or ruling
                  or takes any other action permanently enjoining, restraining
                  or otherwise prohibiting the acceptance for payment of, or
                  payment for, shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the
                  Offer or the Merger and such order, decree, ruling or other
                  action shall have become final and nonappealable; or

            (ii)  if as the result of the failure of any of the conditions set
                  forth in Annex 1 to this Agreement, (A) Sub shall have failed
                  to commence the Offer within 30 days following the date of
                  this Agreement or (B) the Offer shall have terminated or
                  expired in


                                       45
<PAGE>
                  accordance with its terms (including after giving effect to
                  any extensions) without Sub having purchased any shares of
                  Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer prior to September
                  30, 2005, provided, however, that the right to terminate this
                  Agreement pursuant to this Subsection (ii) shall not be
                  available to any party whose failure to comply with its
                  obligations under or breach of this Agreement results in the
                  failure of any such condition;

      (c)   by Parent, if any representation or warranty made by the Company in
            this Agreement shall not be true and correct, or if the Company
            breaches or fails to perform in any material respect any of its
            covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, which failure
            to be true and correct, breach or failure to perform (i) would give
            rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Annex 1 and (ii)
            cannot be or has not been cured within 15 days after the giving of
            written notice to the Company of such breach;

      (d)   by Parent if (i) either Parent or Sub is entitled to terminate the
            Offer as a result of the occurrence of any event set forth in
            paragraph (e) of Annex 1 to this Agreement or (ii) there shall not
            have been validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration
            of the Offer at least a majority of the outstanding shares of
            Company Common Stock, on a fully diluted basis, on or prior to such
            date;

      (e)   by the Company, prior to the acceptance for payment of shares of
            Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer, in accordance with
            Section 6.2(b); provided, however, that, in order for the
            termination of this Agreement pursuant to this subparagraph to be
            effective, the Company shall have complied with all of the
            provisions of Section 6.2, including the notice provisions therein,
            and with all applicable requirements of Section 7.6 including
            payment of the Termination Fee; or

      (f)   by the Company prior to the acceptance of shares of Company Common
            Stock for payment pursuant to the Offer, if Parent shall have
            breached or failed to perform in any material respect any of its
            representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in
            this Agreement and if such failure to perform cannot be or has not
            been cured within 15 days after the giving of written notice to
            Parent of such breach.

9.2   EFFECT OF TERMINATION

      In the event of termination of this Agreement by either the Company or
      Parent as provided in Section 9.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become
      void and have no effect, without any liability or obligation on the part
      of Parent, Sub or the Company, other than Section 4.20, Section 5.6,
      Section 7.2(b), Section 7.6, this Section 9.2 and Article 10, which
      provisions shall survive such termination, and except that nothing in this
      Section 9.2 shall relieve a party from liability for fraud or to the
      extent that such termination pursuant to Section 9.1 results from the
      willful and material breach by a party of any representation, warranty or
      covenant set forth in this Agreement.

9.3   AMENDMENT

      This Agreement may be amended, supplemented or modified by the parties at
      any time before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval;
      provided, however, that after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval,
      there shall be made no amendment, supplement or modification that by Law
      requires further approval by the stockholders of the Company without the
      further approval of such stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended,
      supplemented or modified except by an instrument in writing duly executed
      and delivered by or on behalf of each of the parties.


                                       46
<PAGE>
9.4   EXTENSION; WAIVER

      At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties may (a) extend the
      time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the
      other parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
      warranties contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered
      pursuant to this Agreement or (c) subject to the proviso of Section 9.3,
      waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained in
      this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension
      or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing
      duly executed and delivered by or on behalf of such party. The failure or
      delay of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under
      this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

10.   GENERAL PROVISIONS

10.1  NONSURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

      None of the representations and warranties in this Agreement (including
      the Company Disclosure Schedule and the Parent Disclosure Schedule) or in
      any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the

      agreement of the parties hereto that by its terms contemplates performance
      after the Effective Time.

10.4  INTERPRETATION; COMPANY DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE

      (a)   When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article, Section,
            Subsection or Schedule, such reference shall be to an Article,
            Section or Subsection of, or a Schedule to, this Agreement unless
            otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in
            this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect
            in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever
            the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this
            Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
            limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words
            of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this
            Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
            Agreement. The term "or" is not exclusive. The definitions contained
            in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the
            plural forms of such terms. Any agreement or instrument defined or
            referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that is
            referred to herein means such agreement or instrument as from time
            to time amended, modified or supplemented, except as otherwise
            specified herein. References to a person are also to its permitted
            successors and assigns.

      (b)   Matters reflected in the Company Disclosure Schedule are not
            necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement to be so
            reflected. Such additional matters are set forth for informational
            purposes and do not necessarily include other matters of a similar
            nature. Any matter disclosed in any section of the Company
            Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed disclosed with respect to all
            Sections of this Agreement to the extent that such disclosure of the
            matter is reasonably sufficient to inform Parent of the nature of
            the matter. If the same item is required to be disclosed in more
            than one section of the Company Disclosure Schedule, such item may
            be fully described in the principal section to which such item
            relates and incorporated into another section by a specific cross
            reference in such other section to the section in which such item is
            fully described. Nothing in the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be
            deemed adequate to disclose an exception to a representation or
            warranty made herein unless the Company Disclosure Schedule
            identifies the exception with reasonable particularity. Without
            limiting the generality of the foregoing, the mere listing (or
            inclusion of a copy) of a document or other item shall not be deemed
            adequate to disclose an exception to a representation or warranty
            made herein (unless the representation or warranty has to do with
            the existence of the document or other item itself or the copy
            adequately describes the matter at issue).

10.5  SEVERABILITY

      If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or
      incapable of being enforced by any rule or Law, or public policy, all
      other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain


                                       49
<PAGE>
      in full force and effect so long as the economic and legal substance of
      the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
      party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
      invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
      negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
      original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable
      manner to the end that the Transactions are fulfilled to the extent
      possible.

10.6  COUNTERPARTS

      This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which
      shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective
      when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and
      delivered to the other parties.

10.7  ENTIRE AGREEMENT; NO THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARIES

      This Agreement, taken together with the Company Disclosure Schedule and
      the Parent Disclosure Schedule constitutes the entire agreement and
      supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
      among the parties with respect to the Transactions. For the avoidance of
      doubt and without limiting the foregoing, except for the provisions of
      Article 3 and Section 7.5 (and only in that case after the Effective
      Time), no other provision of this Agreement, including any provision
      relating to employee benefits or compensation, shall be deemed to confer
      any rights as a third-party beneficiary or otherwise on any person
      notwithstanding any principle of contractual interpretation that would
      otherwise be deemed to establish or confer such rights.

10.8  GOVERNING LAW

      This Agreement (and any claims or disputes arising out of or related
      thereto or to the transactions contemplated thereby or to the inducement
      of any party to enter therein, whether for breach of contract, tortious
      conduct or otherwise and whether predicated on common law, statute or
      otherwise) shall in all respects be governed by and construed in
      accordance with the Laws of the State of New York, including all matters
      of construction, validity and performance, in each case without reference
      to any conflict of Law rules that might lead to the application of the
      Laws of any other jurisdiction, except to the extent the Laws of Delaware
      are mandatorily applicable to the Company Board (including the fiduciary
      duties thereof and any actions taken pursuant to Section 6.2), the

10.9  ASSIGNMENT

      Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations
      under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation
      of Law or otherwise by any of the parties without the prior written
      consent of the other parties, except that Sub may assign, in its sole
      discretion, any of or all its rights, interests and obligations under this
      Agreement to Parent or to any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary
      of Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve Sub of any of its
      obligations under this Agreement if its transferee does not perform such
      obligations. Any purported assignment without such consent shall be void.
      Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon,
      inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and
      their respective successors and assigns.

10.10 ENFORCEMENT; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL

      The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
      any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
      with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly
      agreed that the parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or
      injunctions or other appropriate equitable relief to prevent breaches of
      this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms

      and provisions of this Agreement in any federal court located in the State
      of Delaware or any Delaware state court, this being in addition to any
      other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, and the
      parties hereby waive in any such proceeding the defense of adequacy of a
      remedy at law and any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond
      or any other security relating to such equitable relief. In addition, each
      of the parties hereto (a) consents to submit itself to the personal
      jurisdiction of any federal court located in the State of Delaware or any
      Delaware state court in the event any dispute (whether in contract, tort
      or otherwise) arises out of this Agreement or any Transaction, (b) agrees
      that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by
      motion or other request for leave from any such court, (c) agrees that it
      will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any Transaction in
      any court other than any federal court located in the State of Delaware or
      any Delaware state court and (d) waives any right to trial by jury with
      respect to any action related to or arising out of this Agreement or any
      Transaction.
