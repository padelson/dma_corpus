agreed or determined in accordance with clause 11.7 (the "Retained Amount").

Claim, to the extent that the Sellers or the Warrantors (as applicable) have
not otherwise made payment to the Buyer in respect of such Retention Claim,
the Due Amount shall be deducted from the Retained Amount(s) in satisfaction
pro tanto of such Retention Claim (and such Retention Claim shall be regarded
as satisfied to the extent of such deduction, but not further or otherwise
where the amount of such deduction is insufficient to satisfy such Retention
Claim in full) and the Earn Out Consideration payable under Schedule 7 shall
be reduced accordingly. 
---|--- 



   11.6 | Upon all Due Amounts being determined in respect of all
Retention Claims: 
---|--- 



     | (a) | if there is a surplus of the Retained Amount(s) after all

Warrantors (as applicable) to the Buyer within 10 Business Days.

   11.7 | The Retained Amount in respect of a Retention Claim shall either
be determined by the Buyer with agreement in writing of the Sellers
Representative or, in the absence of such agreement, the Retained Amount
shall be determined as follows: 
---|--- 



     | (a) | the Independent Expert shall be jointly instructed by the
Sellers and the Buyer to determine whether or not, in his opinion, the
Retention Claim is likely to be successful on a balance of probabilities (that
is, that the Retention Claim is likely on a balance of probabilities to be
adjudged in favour of the Buyer by a court of competent jurisdiction) and, if
so, the Independent Experts estimate of the likely quantum of such Retention
Claim;  
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | if the Independent Expert determines that the Retention
Claim is not likely to be successful on a balance of probabilities, then the
Retained Amount shall be zero and the Independent Experts fees shall be borne
by the Buyer; 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | if the Independent Expert determines that the Retention
Claim is likely to be successful on a balance of probabilities and agrees with
the Buyers assessment of the quantum of the Retention Claim, then such
amount shall be the Retained Amount and the Independent Experts fees shall
be borne by the Sellers or the Warrantors (as applicable); 
---|---|--- 
 



30 Claim is likely to be successful on a balance of probabilities but not for the
full amount of the Retention Claim proposed by the Buyer, then the amount of
the Retention Claim for the purposes of calculating the Retained Amount shall
be the amount of the Retention Claim which the Independent Expert estimates is
likely on a balance of probabilities to be awarded by a court of competent
jurisdiction and/or determined pursuant to clause 19 and the Independent
Experts fees shall be borne by the Sellers or the Warrantors (as applicable)
and the Buyer in the respective proportions which the amount of the Retention
Claim (as so estimated by the Independent Expert) bears to the original
amount of the Retention Claim proposed by the Buyer; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | in the event that the Independent Expert determines that

borne by the Buyer. 
---|---|---

Chairman for the time being of the Bar Council of England and Wales. 
---|--- 



   11.9 | The Independent Expert shall be instructed jointly by the Buyer
and the Sellers to act as an expert and not as an arbitrator and to reach a
decision within 20 Business Days of his nomination or appointment or as soon
as reasonably practicable. A written copy of the decision shall be sent
promptly to both the Buyer and the Sellers Representative. Subject to the
Independent Expert agreeing to comply with such confidentiality undertakings
as the Buyer may reasonably require, the Buyer and the Sellers shall provide
the Independent Expert with such documents and other information in the
possession of the Buyer or the Buyers Group or the Sellers, insofar as the
appropriate party is able to locate such documents and information, as the
Independent Expert may reasonably request for the purpose of making his
determination in a timely manner taking account of any timing requirements of
the Independent Expert. In the absence of manifest error, his decision shall
be final and binding on all parties who shall pay his costs in accordance with
clause 11.7 or otherwise as he directs. 
---|---

   12 | PAYMENTS TO ESCROW ACCOUNT 
---|--- 



   12.1 | If the Release Date has not occurred on or before 1 July 2016,
the parties agree that a maximum principal amount of £4,000,000 shall be held
in the Escrow Account from the end of the Earn Out Period in relation to any
GSOP Claim or potential GSOP Claim. 
---|--- 



   12.2 | The Escrow Account shall be established, if required, not less
than 5 Business Days prior to 1 July 2016 or such earlier date as the Escrow
Account may be required pursuant to clause 12.3, and shall be administered in
accordance with the provisions of Schedule 9. The Sellers Representative is
hereby duly authorised to sign the Escrow Letter on behalf of the Sellers for
the purpose of establishing the Escrow Account if required. 
---|--- 
 



   12.3 | If, prior to 1 July 2016, the aggregate of the Due Amounts in
respect of a Claim or Claims exceeds £1,000,000, the Buyer and the Warrantors
shall procure that the Escrow Account is opened as soon as reasonably
practicable and in any event within 10 Business Days of the aggregate Due
Amount exceeding £1,000,000 and the Warrantors shall within a further period
of 5 Business Days of the Escrow Account having been opened and
being available to receive funds pay an amount equal to such aggregate of the
Due Amounts (less any previous amount paid into the Escrow Account pursuant to
this clause 12.3) into the Escrow Account provided that the maximum principal
sum to be held in the Escrow Account shall not at any time exceed £4,000,000. 
---|--- 



   12.4 | Unless, on or before 1 July 2016, the Release Date has occurred,
the Buyer shall be entitled to deduct the sum of £4,000,000 (or such other sum
as is agreed or determined pursuant to clauses 12.5 to 12.7), less the
aggregate amount paid into the Escrow Account by the Warrantors under clause
12.3 (if any), from the Earn Out Consideration and pay it into the Escrow
Account. 
---|--- 
 



   12.5 | If, not later than 40 Business Days prior to the end of the Earn
Out Period, the Sellers Representative has produced to the Buyer evidence to
the Buyers satisfaction, acting reasonably but in its absolute discretion,
that a sum less than £4,000,000 is required to be paid into the Escrow
Account, then the Buyer and the Warrantors shall negotiate in good faith to
agree the amount to be held in the Escrow Account in relation to any GSOP
Claim or potential GSOP Claim. If the parties cannot agree such amount within
15 Business Days of the production of the evidence to the Buyer pursuant to
this clause 12.5, the matter will be referred to an appropriate independent
expert ("Tax Expert") for determination of the amount to be paid into the
Escrow Account based on the available evidence and clauses 12.6 and 12.7 shall
apply. 
---|--- 



   12.6 | The Tax Expert shall be tax counsel of at least 7 years
standing nominated jointly by the Buyer and the Sellers Representative or,
failing such nomination within 5 Business Days following the matter
needing to be referred under clause 12.5, at the request of either party, by
the Chairman for the time being of the Bar Council of England and Wales. 
---|--- 
 



32 the Warrantors to act as an expert and not as an arbitrator and to reach a
decision within 20 Business Days of his nomination or appointment or as soon
as reasonably practicable. The Tax Expert shall be instructed to determine
what in his view as an expert is the most likely quantum of a GSOP Claim or
potential GSOP Claim, and not to express such liability within a range. In the
event that the Tax Expert is only able to express such liability, within a
range and the upper end of the range expressed by the Tax Expert is less than
£4,000,000, then such amount at the upper end of the range expressed by the
Tax Expert shall be paid into the Escrow Account. In the event that either
(i) the quantum or the upper end of the range expressed by the Tax Expert is
equal to or greater than £4,000,000, or (ii) the Tax Expert is unable to
express a quantum or a range then £4,000,000 shall be paid into the Escrow
Account. A written copy of the decision shall be sent promptly to both the
Buyer and the Sellers Representative. Subject to the Tax Expert agreeing to
comply with such confidentiality undertakings as the Buyer may reasonably
require, the Buyer and the Warrantors shall provide the Tax Expert with such
documents and other information in the possession of the Buyer or the Buyers
Group or the Warrantors, insofar as the appropriate party is able to locate
such documents and information, as the Tax Expert may reasonably request for
the purpose of making his determination in a timely manner taking account of
any timing requirements of the Tax Expert. In the absence of manifest error,
the Tax Experts decision shall be final and binding on all parties. The
Warrantors shall bear the costs of the Tax Expert.

ICDR shall send to each party a list of partners of Ernst and Young LLP and one
other internationally recognised accounting firm that is not either partys
regular accounting firm and that was not involved in the transaction for any
party (or such other firm as the parties may agree upon) who are experienced
in the arbitration of disputes arising from business transactions. The parties
shall attempt to agree to an arbitrator from the submitted list for a period
of seven (7) Business Days and will advise the ICDR if they reach an
agreement. If the parties are unable to agree, each party may strike up to
seven (7) (but not more than one-half of the number of names on the composite
list) unacceptable names from the list, number the remaining names in order
of preference and return the list to the ICDR within three (3) Business Days
of receiving the list. From among the arbitrators who have been mutually
approved by the parties, and in accordance with the designated order of
mutual preference, the ICDR shall invite an arbitrator to serve. If there is
no mutually acceptable name, the ICDR shall appoint this arbitrator with
preference being given to a chartered public accountant with
substantial experience in the resolution of complex business disputes. 
---|---|--- 
 



39 as follows. Each party shall supply to the ICDR up to five (5) names of

Business Day period at 19.6. The ICDR shall then send to each party a
composite list that includes a list of arbitrators from the ICDRs Panel of
Arbitrators and also the names supplied to it by the parties. The parties
shall attempt to agree to an arbitrator or arbitrators from the submitted
list for a period of seven (7) Business Days and will advise the ICDR if they
reach an agreement. If the parties are unable to agree, each party may strike
up to seven (7) (but not more than one-half of the number of names on the
composite list) unacceptable names from the list, number the remaining names
in order of preference and return the list to the ICDR within three (3)
Business Days of receiving the list. From among the arbitrators who have been
mutually approved by the parties, and in accordance with the designated order
of mutual preference, the ICDR shall invite an arbitrator or arbitrators to
serve. If there are not a sufficient number of mutually approved arbitrators,
the ICDR shall appoint the remaining arbitrator or arbitrators. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | If the parties cannot agree on which arbitrator shall be the
presiding arbitrator within the above-mentioned twenty (20) Business Day
period, the ICDR shall decide upon the presiding arbitrator. 
---|---|--- 
 



   19.7 | In any proceeding hereunder, each party may present testimony,
witnesses, and experts, and each party shall have the right to cross-examine

following additional procedures, limitations and/or exceptions: 
---|--- 



     | (a) | The respondent shall have thirty (30) Business Days after
the Arbitration Panel has been appointed to respond to the Notice of
Arbitration with a Statement of Defence and Counterclaim (if any). The
claimant will have fifteen (15) Business Days to submit a written statement

Arbitration Panel shall not require that any depositions be taken.

     | (c) | There shall be no disclosure of documents other than the
documents that each side will present in support of its submissions and at the
hearing of its case. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (d) | The parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to
complete discovery and to have agreed a hearing date that is within sixty (60)
Business Days from the date the Arbitration Panel is established, or at
such later date as the parties may mutually agree upon. The Arbitration Panel
and the parties shall use reasonable efforts to schedule consecutive hearing
days if more than one day is necessary. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (e) | Each Party may submit a pre-hearing brief not later than ten
(10) Business Days before the hearing date, summarizing the facts and evidence
the Party intends to present, the applicable law and the basis for
the requested award or denial of relief sought. The parties shall not make
any other written submissions to the Arbitration Panel prior to the hearing
unless permitted by the Arbitration Panel. 
---|---|--- 
 



40 written statements, unless both parties agree otherwise, except that written
reports of experts may be submitted. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (g) | Each party may submit a post hearing brief (with no right of

irrevocably and unconditionally waive any and all rights to any form of
appeal, review or recourse to any state or other judicial authority, insofar
as such waiver may be validly made. 
---|--- 



   19.9 | The costs of arbitration, including the arbitrators fees and
related administrative fees shall be borne equally by the parties to such
arbitration, except that each party shall bear the costs and fees of its

   4 | THIRD PARTY RECOVERIES 
---|--- 



   4.1 | The Warrantors shall not be liable in respect of a Warranty Claim
(which shall include any costs, charges and expenses, including any
irrecoverable VAT and disbursements, in each case, reasonably and properly
incurred by the Buyer or any member of the Buyers Group in recovering that

member of the Buyers Group or those deriving title from the Buyer have
already obtained reimbursement or restitution in respect of such Warranty
Claim from any third party. 
---|--- 



   4.2 | Subject to the Buyer being indemnified and secured by any of the
Warrantors to the reasonable satisfaction of the Buyer, if the Buyer or any
other member of the Buyers Group has a claim against, or is entitled
to recover from, any third party in relation to any matter which would or, in
the reasonable opinion of the Buyer, is likely to give rise to a Warranty
Claim, the Buyer shall use reasonable endeavours to recover any amounts due
from such third party before taking any action (other than notifying the
Sellers Representative of the claim pursuant to paragraph 9 of this Schedule)
against the Warrantors (or any of them) PROVIDED THAT nothing in this
paragraph 4.2 shall require the Buyer or any other member of the Buyers
Group to take or refrain from taking any action which it considers, acting
reasonably and in good faith, would materially and adversely affect the
goodwill or bona fide commercial interests of any member of the Buyers
Group. 
---|--- 



   4.3 | If the Warrantors (or any of them) pay to the Buyer an amount in
respect of any Warranty Claim and the Buyer or any other member of the Buyers

payment is made, the Buyer shall repay to the Warrantors so much of the amount
originally paid by the Warrantors as does not exceed the sum recovered from
the third party after deduction of all reasonable and properly incurred costs
and expenses of recovery. 
---|--- 
 



102 ---|--- 



   5.1 | Without prejudice to paragraph 4 of this Schedule and subject
always to paragraph 5.2 of this Schedule, where the Buyer or any other member
of the Buyers Group is entitled to recover any sum under any policy
of insurance which is in force as at the date of this agreement in respect of
any matter or event which gives rise to a Warranty Claim and which, acting
reasonably, the Buyer determines is commercially reasonable to make (taking
into account the chances of recovery, the amounts capable of recovery in
respect of the relevant insurance claim and the deductible which will apply
and the increase in the deductible as a result of pursuing any such claim),
the Buyer will (or will procure that the relevant member of the Buyers Group
will) take all appropriate steps to recover that sum before making such
Warranty Claim and, to the extent that recovery is actually made by the Buyer
or any other member of the Buyers Group under such policy of insurance, the
Warrantors shall have no liability in respect of such Warranty Claim. 
---|--- 



   5.2 | In the event that recovery is actually made by the Buyer or any
member of the Buyers Group under any policy of insurance pursuant to
paragraph 5.1 above, the Warrantors shall pay within 5 Business Days of
written demand to the Buyer an amount equal to the excess amount, all
properly and reasonably incurred costs, charges and expenses reasonably
incurred by the Buyers Group in recovery under such policy and of any
increase in the premiums payable over the following three year period under
such policy of insurance, provided always that such increase in premiums has
arisen as a direct consequence of such recovery. 
---|--- 
 



   6 | ACTS OF THE BUYER 
---|--- 

The Warrantors shall not be liable in respect of any Warranty Claim: 



     | (a) | to the extent that such Warranty Claim arises or is
increased as a result of any breach by the Buyer of any of its obligations
under this agreement or any of the Transaction Documents; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | to the extent that such Warranty Claim arises or is
attributable to or is increased by any voluntary act, transaction or
arrangement carried out by or at the written request of, or with the written
consent of, any member of the Buyers Group before Completion; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | to the extent that such Warranty Claim would not have arisen
but for any voluntary act or omission carried out after Completion by any
member of the Buyers Group (including any member of the Target Group)
outside the ordinary course of business unless the Buyer considers, acting
reasonably and in good faith, that taking or not taking such action would
materially and adversely affect the goodwill or bona fide commercial interests
of any member of the Buyers Group. 
---|---|--- 
 



103 ---|--- 

The Warrantors shall not be liable in respect of any Warranty Claim to
the extent that an amount which is directly referable to the subject matter
of a Warranty Claim is included as a liability (or otherwise provided for) in
the Completion Accounts.



    8 | GENERAL LIMITATIONS 
---|--- 

The Warrantors shall not be liable in respect of any Warranty Claim:



     | (a) | which is based upon a liability which, at the time such
Warranty Claim is notified to the Sellers Representative, is contingent only
or otherwise not capable of being quantified unless and until such
liability ceases to be contingent or becomes capable of being quantified.
Subject to such claim being notified to the Sellers Representative within the
time limits specified in paragraph 1.1 of this Schedule, the time limit for
issuing and serving proceedings for the purposes of paragraph 1.2 of this
Schedule shall begin on the date on which such liability ceases to be
contingent or becomes capable of being quantified; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | to the extent that the matter giving rise to the Warranty
Claim falls to be done in implementing the terms of this agreement or any of
the Transaction Documents; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) | which arises as a result of, or would not have arisen but
for, or a liability is increased as a result of any law, legislation, rule or
regulation not in force at the date of this agreement or any change in any
law, legislation, rule or regulation with retrospective effect after the date
of this agreement; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | which is capable of remedy, unless and until the Buyer has
given the Sellers Representative not less than 20 Business Days written
notice within which to remedy such breach and the Warrantors (or either

   11 | OVERPROVISIONS AND SAVINGS 
---|--- 



   11.1 | If before the seventh anniversary of Completion the Auditors
certify (at the request and expense of the Warrantors) that there has been an
Overprovision or Saving then the amount of that Overprovision or Saving
(the "Relevant Amount") shall be dealt with in accordance with paragraph 11.2
provided that no account shall be taken of any Overprovision or Saving to the
extent that it arises as a consequence of the utilisation of any
Buyers Relief or any change in law or in the published practice of any Tax
Authority after Completion. 
---|--- 



   11.2 | Where it is certified under paragraph 11.1 that a Relevant
Amount has arisen the Relevant Amount is to be dealt with in accordance with
this paragraph 11.2: 
---|--- 
 



     | (a) | the Relevant Amount shall first be set off against any
payment then due from the Warrantors under the Tax Covenant and/or for breach
of any of the Tax Warranties; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | to the extent that there is an excess of the Relevant Amount
after any amounts have been set off under paragraph 11.2(a), a refund shall be
made to the Warrantors of any previous payment or payments made by
the Warrantors under the Tax Covenant and/or for breach of any of the Tax
Warranties and not previously refunded to the Warrantors up to the amount of
any excess; and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) | to the extent that the excess referred to in paragraph
11.2(b) is not exhausted under that paragraph, the remainder of that excess
shall be carried forward and set off against any future payment or payments
which become due from the Warrantors under the Tax Covenant and/or for breach
of any of the Tax Warranties. 
---|---|--- 



   11.3 | Where any certification as is mentioned in paragraph 11.1 has
been made, the Warrantors or the Buyer or the Target may request that the
Auditors of the Target review (at the expense of the party so requesting)
that certification in the light of all relevant circumstances, including any
facts which have become known only since the certification, and to certify
whether the certification remains correct or whether in the light of those
circumstances the amount which was the subject of the certification should be
amended. 
---|--- 



   11.4 | If the Auditors certify under paragraph 11.3 that an amount
previously certified should be amended, that amended amount shall be
substituted for the purposes of paragraph 11.2 as the Relevant Amount in
respect of the certification in question in place of the amount originally
certified, and the adjusting payment (if any) as may be required by virtue of
the above-mentioned substitution shall be made as soon as practicable by the
Warrantors or (as the case may be) to the Warrantors. 
---|--- 



   11.5 | The Buyer will procure that the Target uses any Corresponding
Relief available to it which would give rise to a Saving as soon as it is
reasonably practicable for the Target to do so provided that the Target or
the Buyer shall be under no obligation to use a Corresponding Relief in
precedence over any other Relief available. 
---|--- 
 



148 practicable after it or the Target becomes aware that the Target may obtain a
Saving or that there may be an Overprovision provided the Buyer shall not
be obliged to notify the Warrantors under this paragraph until a claim has
been made under this Schedule or in respect of the Tax Warranties. 
---|--- 



   12 | RECOVERY FROM OTHER PERSONS 
---|--- 



   12.1 | If the Buyer or the Target recovers from any other person any
amount which is referable to a liability of the Target in respect of which the
Warrantors are liable to make a payment (but have not made such payment)
under this Tax Covenant or in respect of the Tax Warranties, the amount that
the Warrantors are so liable to pay shall be reduced by an amount equal to the
amount so recovered less any Tax chargeable on the Target or the Buyer in
respect of the amount recovered and all liabilities (including additional
Tax) and any reasonable costs or expenses properly incurred by the Target and
the Buyer in obtaining recovery of the sum. 
---|--- 
 



   12.2 | If before the seventh anniversary of Completion: 
---|--- 



     | (a) | the Warrantors have made a payment to the Buyer under the
Tax Covenant and/or for breach of any of the Tax Warranties; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | the Target either is immediately or subsequently becomes
entitled to recover from any person (including any Tax Authority but excluding
a member of the Buyers Group) any sum in respect of that liability; and  
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | the Warrantors indemnify the Buyer and the Target to the
Buyers satisfaction against any liabilities (including additional Tax) and
any reasonable costs or expenses which may be properly incurred in taking
steps to enforce that recovery, 
---|---|--- 

then the Buyer shall procure that the Target shall take reasonable steps to
enforce that recovery requested by the Warrantors and shall keep the
Warrantors fully informed of the progress of any action requested by the
Warrantors.



   12.3 | If the Target or the Buyer recovers from the third party any sum
referred to in paragraph 12.2(b), the Buyer shall pay to the Warrantors the
lesser of: 
---|--- 
 



     | (a) | any sum so recovered by the Target or the Buyer in respect
of that liability (including any interest or repayment supplement paid by the
Tax Authority or other person on or in respect of that sum) less any
Tax chargeable on the Target or the Buyer in respect of the amount recovered
and all liabilities (including additional Tax) and any reasonable costs and
expenses properly incurred by the Target and the Buyer in obtaining recovery
of the sum (and for which the Warrantors have not already made payment under
paragraph 12.2(c)); and 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | the amount paid by the Warrantors under the Tax Covenant
and/or for breach of any of the Tax Warranties in respect of that liability. 
---|---|--- 
 



149 apply in respect of any amount recoverable in respect of a liability of the
Warrantors under the Tax Covenant and/or for breach of any of the Tax
Warranties to the extent that that amount is a Saving, in which case the
provisions of paragraph 11 shall apply. 
---|--- 



   13 | BUYERS COVENANT 
---|--- 



   13.1 | The Buyer covenants with the Warrantors to pay the Warrantors an
amount equal to any Tax for which the Warrantors are liable as a result of the
application of section 710 or 713 CTA 2010 where the taxpayer company or the
transferred company (as defined in sections 710(1)(a) and 713(1)(a)
respectively) is the Target together with any reasonable costs and expenses
properly incurred by the Warrantors in taking any successful action under this
paragraph but only in circumstances where the Tax is directly or primarily
chargeable against or attributable to the Target and arises: 
---|--- 



     | (a) | in respect of income profits or gains earned, accrued or
received in respect of any period after Completion; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | as a result of the failure of the Buyer or the Target to
apply an amount: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | provided for in the Completion Accounts, or 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | paid by the Warrantors to the Buyer under the Tax Covenants
or in satisfaction of a claim for breach of any of the Tax Warranties, 
---|---|--- 
 

to discharge a liability to which the amount relates.



    13.2 | The Buyer shall not be liable under the covenant in paragraph
13.1 to the extent that: 
---|--- 



     | (a) | the Warrantors are liable for the Tax in question under the
Tax Covenant or for breach of the any of the Tax Warranties; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | the Warrantors have claimed the amount in question from the
Buyer or the Target under a statutory right of recovery, 
---|---|--- 
 

save where in either case the Warrantors have paid an amount in respect of Tax
to the Buyer and the Target has not satisfied the liability in question.



   13.3 | To the extent that the Buyer has made payment under this
paragraph 13 and the Warrantors have a statutory right of recovery in respect
of that amount the Warrantors undertake to the Buyer not to pursue such
statutory right of recovery in respect of that amount. 
---|--- 



   13.4 | A payment to be made by the Buyer under this paragraph 13 shall
be made in cleared funds seven days after written demand for that payment. 
---|--- 
 



   14 | ADMINISTRATION 
---|--- 



   14.1 | The Warrantors or their duly authorised agents shall (at the
Targets expense) prepare the accounts and corporation tax returns of the
Target for all accounting periods ending on or before Completion to the
extent that they have not been prepared before Completion and the Buyer shall
procure that the Target provides reasonable access to the Targets books,
accounts and records to enable the Warrantors or their duly authorised agents
to prepare the accounts and corporation tax returns and to deal with all
matters relating to them. 
---|--- 
 



150 the Buyer shall procure that the Target shall cause the accounts and returns
mentioned in paragraph 14.1 of this Part so far as it is legally able to
do so to be authorised, signed and submitted to the appropriate Tax Authority
with all reasonable amendments, if any, as the Buyer may propose and as the
Warrantors (or their duly authorised agents) shall agree (both parties acting
reasonably and in good faith) and shall give the Warrantors and their agents
all assistance as may be reasonably required to agree those returns with the
appropriate Tax Authority provided that the Target shall not be obliged to
sign and submit a return which is incorrect. 
---|--- 



   14.3 | The Warrantors shall ensure that all communications to the
relevant Tax Authority under this paragraph 14 are first sent to the Buyer at
least fourteen days before the due date for the submission of each
communication and the Warrantors shall not unreasonably refuse to incorporate
any reasonable comments of the Buyer. 
---|--- 



   14.4 | The Buyer shall ensure that all material communications to the
relevant Tax Authority in respect of the accounting period in which Completion
takes place are first sent to the Warrantors and the Buyer shall consult
with the Warrantors regarding the contents of those communications and
(without prejudice to the Buyers rights under this Schedule) shall
incorporate any reasonable comments of the Warrantors. 
---|--- 
 



   14.5 | Upon the agreement with HMRC or other Tax Authority of the
matters conducted by the Warrantors or their agents under this paragraph 14
the Warrantors or their agents shall immediately deliver all copies of all
relevant files, documents and information to the Buyer. 
---|--- 



   14.6 | The Warrantors shall use or shall procure that their agents
ensure that all the tax affairs of the Target conducted by the Warrantors or
their agents under this paragraph 14 are completed as soon as reasonably
possible.  
---|--- 



   14.7 | For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that any matter gives
rise to a Tax Claim, the provisions of paragraph 7 shall, in relation to such
matter, take precedence over the provisions of this paragraph 14 and the
Tax Claim shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of paragraph
7. 
---|--- 



   15 | RELEASE 
---|--- 



   15.1 | Any liability of the Warrantors under the Tax Covenant or for
breach of any of the Tax Warranties may in whole or in part be released,
compounded or compromised by the Buyer in its absolute discretion or time
or indulgence may be given by the Buyer in its absolute discretion as regards
a Seller who is under that liability without in any way prejudicing or
affecting its rights against the other Seller under the same or a like
liability whether joint and several or otherwise. 
---|--- 



   15.2 | No delay or omission of the Buyer in exercising any right, power
or privilege under this Schedule or in relation to the Tax Warranties shall
impair that right, power or privilege or be construed as a waiver of
that right, power or privilege and any single or partial exercise of any that
right, power or privilege shall not preclude the further exercise of any
right, power or privilege. 
---|--- 
 



151 SCHEDULE 9

 

Escrow



   1 | ESCROW ACCOUNT 
---|--- 



   1.1 | If the Escrow Account is required to be opened pursuant to clause
12 of this agreement, the Sellers Representative (on behalf of all the
Warrantors) and the Buyer shall sign the Escrow Letter and procure that
the Escrow Agents sign and deliver the Bank Instruction Letter to the Escrow
Bank. 
---|--- 



   1.2 | Any interest that may accrue on the credit balance on the Escrow
Account shall be credited to the Escrow Account and any payment of principal
out of the Escrow Account shall include a payment of the interest earned
on such principal sum by the Escrow Account. 
---|--- 



   1.3 | The liability to taxation on any interest on any amount in the
Escrow Account shall be borne by the party ultimately entitled to that amount. 
---|--- 
 



   1.4 | The Escrow Account shall otherwise be administered in accordance
with the provisions of the Escrow Letter but subject always to the provisions
of this agreement in the event of conflict between the two.  
---|--- 



   2 | PAYMENTS FROM THE ESCROW ACCOUNT 
---|--- 



   2.1 | No amount shall be released out of the Escrow Account otherwise
than in accordance with this paragraph 2. 
---|--- 



   2.2 | Each of the Buyer and the Warrantors shall bear their own costs
in connection with establishing and maintaining the Escrow Account. 
---|--- 



    2.3 | In the event that the Warrantors are entitled to payment of any
sum out of the Escrow Account in accordance with the provisions of this
paragraph 2 then: 
---|--- 
 



     | (a) | the Buyers sole obligation in relation to such payment
shall be to deliver the applicable release instruction in writing to the
Escrow Agents pursuant to the Escrow Letter; and, 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | subject to the Buyer delivering such instruction when
required the Buyer shall have no further obligation to any Warrantor in
respect of any amount standing to the credit of the Escrow Account. 
---|---|--- 
 



   2.4 | Subject as otherwise provided by this paragraph 2, the amount (if
any) standing to the credit of the Escrow Account (including any accrued
interest but less any applicable bank charges) shall be released to
the Warrantors according to the proportions set opposite their respective
names in column 6 of Part 1 of Schedule 1 on the Release Date. 
---|--- 



   2.5 | If, following the Escrow Account being established and prior to
the Release Date, a GSOP Claim is settled and there is a Due Amount in respect
of the GSOP Claim which has not been otherwise satisfied by the
Warrantors under this agreement, then each of the Warrantors unconditionally
and irrevocably agrees that: 
---|--- 
 



152 Warrantors under this agreement shall first be satisfied by immediate release
of funds standing to the credit of the Escrow Account from time to time to the
Buyer; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | the Sellers Representative shall be automatically
authorised (without further action required on the part of the Warrantors) to
execute and deliver to the Escrow Agents an instruction for the release of
such amount as is equal to the Due Amount to the Buyer, 
---|---|--- 

and accordingly the Sellers Representative and the Buyer shall, as soon as
practicable, irrevocably instruct the Escrow Agents to pay to the Buyer out of
the Escrow Account the lesser of the Due Amount not otherwise satisfied by the
Warrantors under this agreement and the amount standing to the credit of the
Escrow Account (together with any interest which has accrued on the amount so
paid but less any applicable bank charges). Following settlement of all Due
Amounts in respect of any GSOP Claims (if any) at the Release Date, the
Sellers Representative and the Buyer shall, subject to paragraph 2.6 below,
as soon as practicable irrevocably instruct the Escrow Agents to pay any
balance standing to the credit of the Escrow Account (together with any
interest which has accrued on such balance less any applicable bank charges)
to the Warrantors according to the proportions set opposite their respective
names in column 6 of Part 1 of Schedule 1.



   2.6 | If, as at the Release Date, any GSOP Claim(s) have been notified
by the Buyer in accordance with the terms of this agreement but have not yet
been settled, then a reasonable estimate of the amount of such GSOP
Claim(s) shall be retained in the Escrow Account until such time as they are
settled, whereupon such retained amount shall be paid out of the Escrow
Account in accordance with the preceding provisions of this Schedule. The
Buyer and the Sellers Representative (on behalf of the Warrantors) shall
negotiate such reasonable estimate in good faith and if the parties cannot
agree such amount within 15 Business Days of the Release Date, the matter will
be referred to a Tax Expert for determination based on the then available
evidence in which case clauses 12.6 and 12.7 of this agreement shall apply 
---|--- 



   2.7 | A GSOP Claim shall be deemed settled for the purposes of this
paragraph 2 if: 
---|--- 



     | (a) | the Sellers Representative and the Buyer so agree in
writing; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | the GSOP Claim has been determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction from which there is no right of appeal or from whose judgment the
Buyer or the Warrantors (as the case may be) are debarred by passage of time
or otherwise from making an appeal. 
---|---|--- 



   3 | CLAIMS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT 
---|--- 

The Warrantors agree that:

 



     | (a) | if a Due Amount in respect of a GSOP Claim is not satisfied
in full from the Escrow Account that the same shall (to the extent not so
satisfied) remain fully enforceable against and payable by the Warrantors;  
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | the amount paid into the Escrow Account shall not be
regarded as imposing any limit on the amount of any claims under this
agreement; and 
---|---|--- 
 



153 otherwise affect any right (including any right to make any claim) or remedy
the Buyer may have from time to time against the Warrantors under this
agreement.

160 ANNEX 1



   1.1 | Revenue 
---|--- 



     | (a) | Revenue is recognised when goods have been despatched to the
customer or collected by the customer, based on an agreed order and an agreed
upon price that is documented in a sales contract or sales order  
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | Revenue will not be recognised where goods are supplied to a
customer on a consignment basis 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | Revenue will not be recognised where they have been supplied
on a sale or return basis or under a bill and hold transaction 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | Revenue or Sales should be recorded net of customer
allowances or rebates, such as those awarded as a volume incentive or rebate,
or a listing allowance, or a promotional allowance or a Marketing or
Development Fund. Provisions for allowances or rebates should be made in
accordance with customer agreements or, where not documented, in line with
recent custom and practise. 
---|---|--- 



   1.2 | Stock 
---|--- 



     | (a) | Stock shall comprise ingredients, packaging, work-in-
progress and finished goods (together, "Stock") and shall be valued on a first
in first out basis at the lower of: 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (i) | actual cost of ingredients, packaging and direct and
indirect manufacturing cost, based on the actual purchase cost; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | net realisable value. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | Stock at all locations shall be counted at the end of each
financial year and any differences between book stock and physical should be
charged in the financial year in which the loss occurred. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) | A provision shall be made in respect of any ingredients or
packaging (either stated on the balance sheet, or for which an obligation to
purchase such material from a supplier exists) of 100 per cent. of
the carrying value of the item less any sums recoverable under customer
indemnities if the item: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | has exceeded the stated "use-by" "best before" or "due by"
date (as specified by the manufacturer of the item); 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | will exceed the stated "use-by", "best before" or "due by"
date (as specified by the manufacturer of the item) before the next production
run in which the material is scheduled to be used;  
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | was uniquely used in the manufacture of a finished goods
item that has been delisted by any Target Group Company and where there is no
bona fide intention to re-launch; 
---|---|--- 
 



161 balance sheet date after allowing for an amount of raw material that can
demonstrably be used in servicing and setting up existing production lines in
the following 12 months; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (v) | cannot be used in a production run due to either a
suspected, or known, quality or other technical issue. 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | For all finished goods products (both Target Group brands
and retailer own label products), a 100 per cent. provision less any sums
recoverable under customer indemnities shall be made for any item that:  
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | cannot be sold to a customer due to either a suspected, or
known, quality or other technical issue; 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | has exceeded the stated "use-by", "best before" or "due by"
date (as specified on the product); and 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | has less remaining life (according to the stated "use-by",
"best before" or "due by" date specified on the product) than is accepted by
customers that list that item. For the avoidance of doubt, any 100 per cent
provision in this instance shall be reduced by the actual realisable value for
such finished goods, in the event that an agreement is reached with any
customer to purchase such finished goods or the finished goods can
be reworked into saleable stock. 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | For all retailer own label finished goods products only: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | a 50 per cent. provision shall be made for any item that is
expected to have less remaining life (according to the stated "use-by", "best
before" or "due by" date specified on the product) than is accepted or agreed
by customers that list that item, within eight weeks of the balance sheet date
according to the latest bona fide sales forecast, but provided always that (1)
if a customer has committed in writing to buy such item at a higher price
than the 50% provision, such item will be included at the higher price agreed
with such customer and (2) if the item contains ingredients that can be used
in an alternative product, the relevant item shall be included at the cost of
such ingredients; and; 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | a 25 per cent. provision shall be made for any item that
has a stock level at the balance sheet date that exceeds the bona fide
forecasted sales of that item in the following sixteen weeks. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (f) | Except as specifically set forth above, provision for
inventory shall be made as provided in paragraph 4.1 (c) of Schedule 7. 
---|---|--- 



   1.3 | Engineering Spares 
---|--- 

Will continue to be expensed on an order basis

 



162 ---|--- 



     | (a) | Trade debts shall be recognised in accordance with the
revenue recognition policies shown in 1.1 above. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | The provisions for trade debtors shall be calculated as
provided below in this paragraph 1.4 and in paragraph 1.5 (b), having taken
into account debit notes received from customers and relevant corresponding
accruals as appropriate: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | a 50 per cent. provision shall be made for all trade debtors
that are between 90 and 120 days (both days inclusive) beyond the invoice due
date; or 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | a 100 per cent. provision shall be made for all trade
debtors which are: 
---|---|--- 



     | (A) | more than 120 days beyond the invoice due date; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (B) | insolvent; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (C) | the subject of insolvency proceedings. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | The provisions of paragraph 1.4(b) above are subject to
adjustment in the event of written confirmation from the customer that the
invoice will be paid, in which case no provision will be made, and are subject
to the netting-off of retention of title claims or other customers right of
offset. 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | All legitimate customer deductions (irrespective of age)
that are included within the trade debtors balance are accrued at 100 per
cent. of value, save to the extent otherwise already accrued elsewhere in
the Accounts. 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | Subject to the other provisions of this paragraph 1.4, trade
debtors shall be shown at their book amount after deduction of any settlement
discount, volume discounts and credit notes, save to the extent that any
such credit is recognised elsewhere in the Accounts. 
---|---|--- 



     | (f) | Customer multi-buy, rebates and over-rider provisions shall
be calculated on a basis consistent with the agreement or arrangements between
the Target Group and the customer concerned, save to the extent that any
such credit is recognised elsewhere in the Accounts. These provisions will be
calculated on the assumption that the proportion of the relevant performance
trigger achieved to date, taking into account the current forecast for the
relevant customers trading year, will continue to the end of the period of
the relevant agreement or agreements. 
---|---|--- 



   1.5 | Other Debtors and Prepayments 
---|--- 



     | (a) | All items classified as prepayments shall show a true
reflection of the advance payment of liabilities which have arisen in the
normal course of business. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | No debtors will be recognised or included in relation to
claims by any Target Group Company against suppliers, save to the extent that
can be reasonably supported by documentary evidence as to a legally
binding obligation to make payment.

paid will be included.

(including suppliers of ingredients and packaging) and services which have
been received by the Target Group up to the end of the earn out period (net of
any credit notes due from suppliers) shall be included in Creditors. Where
there is a dispute with the supplier over amounts owing the amount included in
Creditors will be in accordance with the agreed contract or purchase order,
unless the supplier can produce documentary evidence to support their claim
or where no purchase order or contract is available but it is reasonable to
estimate what the correct amount owing should be. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | The Accounts shall include accruals for the following, which
