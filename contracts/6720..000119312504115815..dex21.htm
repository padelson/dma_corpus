except for representations and warranties made as of a specific date which
shall be true and correct only as of such date, with respect to all of the
Shares, the Volkl Group Companies and the Business:



   A. | Capacity 
---|--- 



Each of Sellers has the necessary capacity and authority to enter into this
Agreement, and to the extent applicable, the Ancillary Documents, and
to perform his obligations hereby and thereby.



   B. | Organization and Qualification 
---|--- 



Each of the Volkl Group Companies is duly organized and validly existing under
the laws under which it has been incorporated and has full right
and authority to own and to operate its properties and to engage in the
business in which it is now engaged. _Schedule IV.B_ contains the articles of
incorporation and by-laws of the Volkl Group Companies as in force on the date
of this Agreement. __



   C. | Capital Structure 
---|--- 



As of the Closing Date, the Volkl Group Companies have the capital structure
set



 

15 forth in _Schedule IV.C_. No further capital, non-voting stock, convertible
securities, option rights or similar rights in the Volkl Group Companies have
been or will by the Closing Date be created or issued or agreed to be issued.
All the Shares sold pursuant to art. II.A(a) of this Agreement have been
validly issued and are fully paid in and non-assessable ( _nicht
nachschusspflichtig_ ). There are no restrictions of whatever nature on any of
the Volkl Group Companies to make any declaration, setting aside or payment of
any dividend or any other distribution of profit, other than with respect to
any applicable corporate law and except as disclosed in _Schedule IV.C_.



VSH owns the shares of the Subsidiaries as set forth in _Schedule_ _IV.C_ (and
shares in Volkl Sport America Corporation, representing 40% of the
outstanding and issued share capital of Volkl Sport America Corporation), free
and clear of any Liens. The transfer of control in (i) the shares of the
Subsidiaries in _Schedule_ _IV.C_ , (including the transfer of the shares of
Volkl Sport America Corporation under the Volkl Sport America Corporation
Purchase Agreement) and (ii) the Volkl Tennis Share does not require any
governmental, administrative or third party filing, approval or consent of
any nature except for the approvals provided for in art. III.B.1 of this
Agreement.



The list of Subsidiaries in _Schedule_ _IV.C_ is complete and correct. Except
as set forth in _Schedule IV.L_ _,_ VSH owns no shares, equity or silent
partnership interests or any right to profits, or has any obligation to bear
losses in any business association other than with respect to the
Subsidiaries. There are no Liabilities with respect to any of the Inactive
Companies. The Inactive Companies are the only inactive Volkl Group
Companies.



The option to acquire the remaining 5% partnership interest in BIL GmbH and Co.
WEDA KG pursuant to the agreement dated December 2, 1997 held by Volkl Sports
GmbH and Co. KG is in full force and effect. None of the Volkl Group Companies
has any option or similar right to acquire any partnership interests or
shares in any business association or company.



For the avoidance of doubt, the Sellers do not confirm that the state
subsidies in the total amount of DM 9,000,000 (the equivalent of EUR
4,601,627) by the District Government of Lower Bavaria ( _Regierung von
Niederbayern_ ) do not provide for such consent requirement and that such
subsidies cannot be revoked, terminated or otherwise repayment sought due to
the change of control contemplated by this Agreement and that any terms and
provisions of these subsidies have been complied with. Accordingly, the
Sellers do not represent or warrant that the mentioned subsidies will not be
revoked, terminated or otherwise repayment sought, it being understood and
agreed that (i) Sellers shall remain liable if such subsidies are revoked,
terminated or otherwise repayment is sought due to (aa) any Environmental
Pollution existing on or prior to the Closing Date, or (bb) due to the
intentional or grossly negligent non-compliance of the Volkl Group Companies
with the terms and conditions



 

16 of such subsidies prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) if such subsidies are
revoked, terminated or otherwise repayment is sought for any other reason, in
particular due to a change of control or due to a reduction in workforce, the
risk shall be borne by Purchasers.



   D. | Ownership 
---|--- 



Each of Sellers has full legal and beneficial ownership to all of the Shares
as indicated in _Schedule IV.C_ (and the shares in Volkl Sport America
Corporation, representing 40% of the outstanding and issued share capital of
Volkl Sport America Corporation), and has the right and capacity to transfer
and sell complete title to the Shares. The Shares are held in their
entirety by Sellers, and are free and clear of any Liens and will constitute,
as of the Closing, all of the equity securities of VSH. Cleven has full legal
and beneficial ownership to the Loans and has the right and capacity to sell
and assign the Loans. The Loans are free and clear of any Liens; for the
avoidance of doubt, Purchasers confirm that they are aware that some of the
Loans are subordinated to some obligations resulting of the Financial Debt as
disclosed in _Schedule D_. Sellers do not, however, make any representation
or warranty regarding the ability of the Volkl Group Companies to repay the
Loans.



Upon the delivery of the Shares provided for in art II.A(a), Luxco will
receive good and valid title to the Shares, free and clear of any Liens.
Upon assignment of the Loans provided for in art. II. A(b) and (c), Cayco
will receive good and valid title to each of the Loans, free and clear of any
Liens subject to the subordination agreements listed in _Schedule D_.



   E. | No Breach 
---|--- 



The execution of this Agreement, and to the extent applicable, of any of the
Ancillary Documents, by each Seller, and the performance by each Seller
of his obligations under this Agreement, and to the extent applicable, under
any of the Ancillary Documents, does not (i) violate, conflict with or result
in a breach, termination or default of any agreement by which any Seller or
any of his assets are bound or subject, (ii) violate any applicable law,
enforceable court or administrative order or ruling binding on any of Sellers
or (iii) violate the articles of incorporation or by-laws of VSH or any other

---|---|--- 


     | (iv) | any Taxes attributable to any period starting on April 1,
2004, through and including the Closing Date (whether or not a taxable
period), but only to the extent that such Taxes arise from income generated
by the Volkl Group Companies, or events, transactions, and activities that
occur, outside the ordinary course of business diligently and prudently
conducted. For purposes of this paragraph, it is understood that events
outside the ordinary course of business shall include, without limitation,
treasury share transfers, restructurings, financial reconstructions,
reorganizations, and non-arms length transactions. In addition, events
outside the ordinary course of business shall not include sale leaseback
transactions undertaken in a manner consistent with past practice. It is
further understood that the Volkl Group Companies shall be liable for Taxes

In determining the Taxes for which the Sellers are liable pursuant to this
Art. VI.C.1(e), the Sellers shall be entitled to utilize up to one half of
the Tax loss carryforwards ( _steuerliche Verlustvortr age_) of the Volkl
Group Companies as of March 31, 2004 (as determined prior to any adjustment to
such items by any Tax authority or pursuant to any amended return) to offset
up to one-half of any cumulative increases in the taxable income of the Volkl
Group Companies for periods prior to and including March 31, 2004, as
determined pursuant to an adjustment made by any Taxing authority with respect
to periods through March 31, 2004, but only to the extent that such offset is
permissible under the Applicable Law. For purposes of determining the Taxes
for which the Sellers are liable pursuant to this Art. VI.C.1(e), the
remaining increase in any taxable income of the Volkl Group Companies cannot
be offset with any Tax loss carryforwards. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tax
loss carryforwards of the Volkl Group Companies shall be taken into account
for purposes of determining Taxes of the Volkl Group Companies for any
Current Period, but only to the extent that such Tax loss carryforwards are
used to offset income generated by the Volkl Group Companies in the ordinary
course of business diligently and prudently conducted during such period. For
purposes of the preceding sentence, income generated by the Volkl Group
Companies in the ordinary course of business shall exclude, without
limitation, income generated from



 

36 treasury share transfers, restructurings, financial reconstructions,
reorganizations, non-arms length transactions (in which case Sellers shall
still be entitled to utilize up to one half of the Tax loss carryforwards) and
any income arising from the breach of representation of warranties contained
in the last paragraph of art. IV.K. In addition, income generated by the
Volkl Group Companies in the ordinary course of business shall include sale
leaseback transactions undertaken in a manner consistent with past practice.



Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, Sellers shall not be required
to indemnify Purchasers or the Volkl Group Companies as a result of the
Purchasers (or the Volkl Group Companies) inability to use any Tax loss
carryforwards arising in a period prior to the Closing Date to reduce taxable
income relating to a period after the Closing Date if (a) such Tax loss
carryforwards are disallowed as a result of change in applicable law or (b)
such Tax loss carryforwards expire. For the avoidance of doubt, the statement
set forth in the preceding sentence shall not under any circumstances relieve
Sellers of their obligation to indemnify Purchasers or the Volkl Group
Companies for any Taxes for periods up to and including the Closing Date.



     | (f) | any Liability arising out of or in connection with the
claims raised by Gaston Hudry against any of the Volkl Group Companies based

which that Tax becomes payable to the relevant Governmental Entity in order to
avoid a liability to interest or penalties accruing.

after having been notified of such alleged breach or pay to Purchasers the
amount which is necessary to establish the state of the Volkl Group Companies
described in such representation or warranty, or otherwise fully cure any
damage or Loss arising in connection with any other liability arising under
art. VI.C.1 of this Agreement. Any compensation shall be made as follows:



(a) during the term of the lock-up pursuant to art. X.A, compensation shall
be made in kind by delivery of all or part of the K2 Shares transferred
hereunder valued at EUR 12.497445 per K2 Share (regardless of the then current
market



 

37 price of shares of K2), but not in cash. Sellers at their sole discretion may
deliver K2 Shares either from the Escrow, the remaining K2 Shares subject to
the lock-up pursuant to art. X.A. or other shares in K2 purchased by the
Sellers.



     | (b) | after expiry of the lock-up period set forth in art. X.A,
compensation shall be made, at the option of Sellers, in K2 Shares valued at
the market price on the Business Day prior to payment (whether or not from
the Escrow), or in cash. __

participate (but not control) in any defense of such claim. Purchasers shall
control any defense of such claim but shall consult with Sellers prior to the
settlement of any such claim and discuss with Sellers in good faith



 

40 any input regarding the claim and potential settlement the Sellers may have
prior to any settlement. After such consultation, Purchasers shall have the
right to settle any such claim; _provided, however_ , that except with the
joint consent of Sellers (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), no settlement of any such claim with third-party claimants shall
alone be determinative of the amount of any claim for Losses. If Sellers have

authority to object under any provision of this art. VI.E to the amount of
any claim for Losses of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties with respect to such

their sole cost and expense and with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Purchasers, upon written notice to the Purchasers, assume the defense of such
claims or legal proceedings if (i) the Sellers acknowledge to the Purchasers
in writing, within 15 calendar days after receipt of notice from the
Purchasers, their obligations to indemnify the Purchasers with respect to all
elements of such claim, if and to the extent such claims are finally
determined (by judgment or settlement) to be existing, (ii) the Sellers
provide the Purchasers with evidence reasonably acceptable to the Purchasers
that the Sellers will have the financial resources to defend against the
competent authorities such claim and fulfill their indemnification
obligations hereunder, (iii) the claims involve only money damages and do not
seek an injunction or other equitable relief, and (iv) settlement or an
adverse judgment of such claim is not, likely to establish a pattern or
practice adverse to the continuing business interests of the Purchasers. The
Purchasers will be entitled to participate in (but not control) the defense of
any such action, with their counsel and at their own expense; _provided,_ that
if there are one or more legal defenses available to the Purchasers that
conflict with those available to the Sellers, or, Purchasers shall have the
right to join the proceedings as an independent party (to the extent permitted
under applicable procedural rules; and further _provided, _ that if the
Sellers fail to take reasonable steps necessary to defend diligently the claim
after receiving notice from the Purchasers that it believes the Sellers have
failed to do so, the Purchasers may assume the defense of such claim. If
the Purchasers assume the defense of the claim, the Sellers shall reimburse
the Purchasers for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel retained by the
Purchasers and the Sellers shall be entitled to participate in (but not
control) the defense of such claim, with their counsel and at their own
expense. The Parties agree to render, without compensation, to each other such
assistance as they may reasonably require of each other in order to insure the
proper and adequate defense of any action, suit or proceeding, whether or not
subject to indemnification hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, neither



 

41 the Sellers nor the Purchasers can settle any such claim without the consent
of the other Party (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
unless such settlement provides for an absolute and unconditional release of
Purchasers or the Sellers, as the case may be, and imposes no damages,
injunction, sanction or other remedy of any kind against the Purchasers or
the Sellers, as the case may be.



3. If Sellers undertake or cause a third party to undertake any clean-up
activities relating to a Relevant Pollution on any site of the Volkl Group
Companies, such activities shall only be undertaken (i) to the extent the
existing business activities of the Volkl Group Companies are not disrupted,
(ii) in a manner that brings the relevant operations to their previous
operating condition, and (iii) at costs that are not expected to exceed the
maximum amount of liability of Sellers then in effect.



   F. | Escrow 
---|--- 



1\. In order to secure any claims which Purchasers may have pursuant to art.
VI.C or pursuant to any other provision of this Agreement, Sellers
and Purchasers agree to jointly appoint, and to enter into an escrow
agreement on the Closing Date with, a reputable Swiss Bank or any of its
Affiliates, or a reputable Swiss trust company (the "Escrow Agent") providing
for the escrow (the "Escrow") of the K2 Shares (the "Escrow Agreement"). The
Escrow Agreement shall be substantially in the form attached hereto as
_Schedule_ _VI.F_.



2\. On the date 18 months after the Closing Date, the Escrow Agent
shall release such a number of K2 Shares so that the number of K2 Shares
remaining in Escrow is equal to Purchasers reasonable estimate of the value
of all claims notified but not yet settled divided by EUR 12.497445 per K2
Share, as further set out in, and subject to the terms of, the Escrow
Agreement.



   G. | Rights of Sellers 
---|---

indemnification, hold harmless or similar



 

42 undertakings given by the Volkl Group Company in favor of any director or
auditor shall automatically terminate as of the Closing Date.



Purchasers agree to hold extraordinary shareholders meetings of the Volkl
Group Companies (to the extent necessary) immediately after the Closing Date
and to elect new directors at such meeting. Purchasers agree to grant complete
discharge to the present directors at such meeting. The consent of Purchasers
to VSHs financial statements and the discharge of the directors in the
extraordinary shareholders meetings do not operate, and shall not be
construed, as a waiver of Purchasers claims under art. VI of this Agreement.



VIII. ACTIONS BEFORE CLOSING

---|--- 



The Parties acknowledge that Purchasers have conducted a legal, financial,
environmental and actuarial due diligence review of the Volkl

reasonably requested by Purchasers. On the Closing Date, Sellers will provide
Purchasers with a list of information received by Purchasers after the date
hereof.



It is understood, for the avoidance of doubt, that the result of
such confirmatory due diligence (limited to the matters set out in the

extending beyond the Closing Date. 



   C. | Termination of Commitments

The Parties hereto shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to ensure
that, as promptly as practicable following the execution of this
Agreement and the CTS Stock and Loan Purchase Agreement, but in any case on
or before December 31, 2004, a Volkl Group Company shall fully cooperate with
a subsidiary of CTS and Tecnica S.p.A. in connection with the amendment by CTS
of all patent applications (the "Patent Applications") filed by a subsidiary
of CTS to date in respect of the new form of skiing system jointly developed
by CTS, Tecnica S.p.A and VSH and known as "AthleticSkiing"
(the "Amendment"), in order to provide that Tecnica S.p.A. and VSH are,
together with CTS, joint owners of the Patent Applications and of any and all
patents issuing in respect thereof, in order to ensure that Tecnica S.p.A. and
VSH, and the companies respectively controlled by, controlling or affiliated
with them, as well as CTS, have the right fully to exploit and/or to cause to
be exploited for their benefit the results of said joint development efforts
with respect to bindings (in the case of Marker), with respect to skis (in
the case of Volkl) and with respect to boots (in the case of Tecnica).



Furthermore, the Parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
ensure that CTS, Tecnica S.p.A and VSH enter into an agreement whereby
each such company commits to a common project plan (which plan will define
the timings for the necessary steps and activities to be carried out by each
such company in order to carry the AthleticSkiing joint project into effect)
the resources which shall be further invested by each such company in the
respective area of competence with reference to research and development,
tooling and marketing; the agreement, which shall specify the respective
responsibilities of the Parties, shall be negotiated in good faith so as to
be entered into at the same time as the Amendment above referred to, in which
case said Amendment shall be deemed an integral part of the agreement;
however, should the parties be unable to reach said agreement at the
latest on or before December 31, 2004, the Amendment, nevertheless, shall be
carried out on or before December 31, 2004.



Said agreement and/or amendment of the Patent Applications (the
"AthleticSkiing Agreement") shall be carried out at arms length after having
been submitted to the Purchasers for their approval, which approval shall not
be unreasonably withheld. __

Sellers shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any such contacts
or negotiations with third parties relating to any Competing Transaction. In
addition to the foregoing, if



 

49 any of the Sellers, VSH or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates receive prior

any offer or concrete proposal relating to any Competing Transaction, Sellers
immediately shall notify Purchasers thereof, including information as to the
identity of the offeror or the party making any such offer or proposal and
the specific terms of such offer or proposal, as the case may be, and such
other information related thereto as Purchasers may request.



   D. | Insurance 
---|--- 



Sellers undertake to keep the insurance coverage of the Volkl Group Companies
in force, at the expense of the Volkl Group Companies, with respect to all
insurance policies relating to the Business prior to the Closing Date.

   X. | Post-closing covenants 
---|--- 



   A. | Lock-Up 
---|--- 



Each of Sellers agrees, with respect to the K2 Shares received on the Closing
Date, that he will not, without the prior written consent of Purchasers,
for a period of eighteen months following the Closing Date:



     | (a) | offer, pledge, sell, contract to sell, write any call option
on, buy any put option for, or otherwise transfer or dispose of, directly or
indirectly, any of the K2 Shares received under this Agreement; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | enter into any swap or other arrangements that transfers to
another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of the
ownership of K2 Shares. 
---|---|--- 
 



Transfers made among the Sellers or any of their Affiliates ( _provided_ that
any such Affiliate undertakes in a prior written declaration to be bound by
this lock-up undertaking and to assist the relevant Seller in the satisfaction
of any indemnity claims under art. VI.C.3(a) of this Agreement), are exempt
from this lock-up undertaking. For avoidance of doubt, any K2 Shares
transferred among the Sellers under such exemption shall not be released from
the lock-up undertaking under this art. X.A. It is understood, for the
avoidance of doubt, any such transfer to an Affiliate shall not affect any
obligations of the Sellers to deliver K2 Shares pursuant to this Agreement, in
particular art. VI.



2\. All offers and sales of the K2 Shares by any Seller to any Person
(including



 

50 any Sellers or Affiliates) shall only be made (i) in accordance with
Regulation S or (ii) pursuant to an available exemption from the registration
requirements of the United States Securities Act, each as confirmed by a legal
opinion of counsel to Purchasers.



3\. Stop transfer instructions will be given to Purchasers transfer agent
with respect to K2 Shares and there will be placed on the certificates
for such K2 Shares, or any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in
substance:



"This certificate and the shares represented hereby have been issued pursuant
to a transaction governed by Rule 144 ("Rule 144") and Regulation S
("Regulation S") promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the "Securities Act"), and may not be sold or otherwise disposed of unless
subsequently registered under the Securities Act pursuant to a Registration
Statement in effect at the time or unless the proposed sale or other
disposition can be made in compliance with Rule 144 and Regulation S without
registration in reliance on another exemption therefrom. Reference is made to
that certain Stock and Loan Purchase Agreement dated as of June 15, 2004
between the Holder and Purchasers, a copy of which is on file in the principal
office of Purchasers that contains a Lock-Up and further restrictions on the
transferability of this certificate and the shares represented hereby."

 



   B. | Orderly Distribution __ 
---|--- 



After the lapse of the lock-up period referred to in art. X.A above and
subject to all applicable U.S. state and federal securities laws and
regulations, Purchasers hereby agree to use commercially reasonable efforts
to assist Sellers in arranging any transaction with respect to the sale of K2
Shares by Sellers after the Closing (any such transaction, a "Post-Closing
Transaction"). Sellers hereby agree to effect all Post-Closing Transactions
pursuant to the provisions of this art. X.B. Prior to effecting any Post-
Closing Transaction, Sellers shall first notify Purchasers of their intent to
effect a Post-Closing Transaction with respect to any or all of the K2
Shares. Such notice shall set forth information with respect to the proposed
Post-Closing Transaction, including the number of K2 Shares Sellers desire to
sell and the time period that Sellers desire to effect such Post-Closing
Transaction. Within one (1) Business Day after receipt of such notice from
Sellers, Purchasers shall propose at least two brokers to be used by Sellers
to effect such Post-Closing Transaction (such list of proposed brokers,
a "Broker Slate"). Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
effect such Post-Closing Transaction through one or more of the brokers set
forth on the Broker Slate. In the event that Sellers determine not to use
any of the



 

51 brokers set forth on the Broker Slate, Sellers shall thereafter be permitted
to select, subject to Purchasers prior written consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld), one or more brokers to effect such Post-Closing
Transaction.



In addition, each Seller undertakes with Purchasers that



     | (a) | Sellers shall not engage in hedging transaction with regard
to the K2 Shares other than in compliance with the United States Securities
Act; 
---|---|--- 


     | (b) | Sellers shall not use offering materials or other documents
in connection with offers and sales of the K2 Shares unless such offering
materials and other documents have been provided or approved by Purchasers
and their counsel. 
---|---|--- 



   C. | Information of Employees 
---|--- 



Sellers shall comply before the Closing Date with all legal requirements
regarding information and consultation with the Volkl Group
Companies employees. Sellers shall inform Purchasers on such requirements
and on the form and content of the information to be disclosed to the
employees and shall coordinate such information with Purchasers.



   C. | Covenant with Respect to State Subsidies 
---|--- 



The Sellers shall assist Purchasers by undertaking best efforts that the
Purchasers can ensure that the state subsidies in the total amount of
DM 9,000,000 by the District Government of Lower Bavaria will not be revoked,
terminated or otherwise repayment sought.



   XI. | TERMINATION OF THE AGREEMENT 
---|--- 



This Agreement including the Ancillary Documents may be terminated and the
transactions contemplated herein abandoned at any time prior to the
Closing Date: __



     | (a) | by mutual consent of Purchasers and Sellers; 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | jointly by Purchasers if: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | the representations and warranties of Sellers shall not be
true and correct as of the Closing Date; _provided, however_ , that Purchasers
shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement as a result of a breach of
a representation or warranty by Sellers unless such breach has or is
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect, and Sellers have not
cured such breach (if capable of being cured) within 30 days after notice
thereof, whether or not foreseeable; further _provided, however_ , that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, if the representations and warranties set forth
in art. III.B.2(a) of this Agreement are not true and correct in all respects
as  
---|---|--- 



 

52 of the Closing Date, Purchasers may terminate this Agreement regardless of
whether such breach would constitute a Material Adverse Effect; or



     | (ii) | Purchasers are not in material breach of their obligations
under this Agreement and there has been a material breach of any covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement on the part of Sellers, and Sellers
have not cured such breach (if capable of being cured) within 30 days after
notice thereof; _provided, however_ , that such notice shall not be required
if Sellers breach occurs on or after the date six months after the date of
this Agreement; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | the Volkl Group Companies have suffered a Material Adverse
Effect, _provided, however_ , that, Material Adverse Effect has not been,
cannot be or is not reasonably likely to be remedied within 30 days after
notice thereof by Purchasers. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | jointly by Sellers if 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | Sellers are not in material breach of their obligations
under this Agreement and there has been a material breach of any covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement on the part of Purchasers, and
Purchasers have not cured such breach (if capable of being cured) within 30
days after notice thereof; _provided, however_ , that such notice shall not be
required if Purchasers breach occurs on or after the date six months after
the date of this Agreement; 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | the representations and warranties of Purchasers shall not
be true and correct as of the Closing Date; _provided, however_ , that Sellers
shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement as a result of such breach
of a representation or warranty by Purchasers, unless such breach has or is
reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the ability of
Purchasers to fulfill their obligations under this Agreement and Purchasers
have not cured such breach (if capable of being cured) with 30 days after
notice thereof by Sellers, whether or not foreseeable; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | K2 has suffered a Material Adverse Effect on K2 which
cannot or is not reasonably likely to be remedied within 30 days after notice
thereof by Sellers (it being understood that for the purposes of this art.
XI(d)(iii), the term "Material Adverse Effect on K2" shall have the meaning
defined in art. III.B.3); 
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) | K2 has not provided Sellers, within 45 calendar days after
the date hereof, with a confirmation of a reputable bank or other reputable
financial institution, acting as lead manager or lead arranger, that
Purchasers have entered into a financing agreement for the purposes of
financing the cash portion of the Purchase Price, subject only to conditions
customary for financings of this type, to procure the necessary funds
for financing the cash portion of the Purchase Price, _provided, however,_
that such failure is not primarily the result of non-fulfillment of the
conditions precedent set forth in art.s III.B.1 or III.B.2 (other than
III.B.2(g);  
---|---|--- 



 

53 ---|---|--- 



     | (i) | the Closing has not occurred by the date six months after
the date of this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that the Party seeking
termination shall not be in material breach of its obligations under this
Agreement or cause the aforementioned date to have passed; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | a court or other Governmental Entity has issued a final
order, decree or ruling prohibiting the proposed transaction, and such order
decree or ruling shall have become non-appealable. 
---|---|--- 



If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this art. XI, such termination
shall be without liability of one Party to the other Party; _provided_ that if
such termination results from the intentional or grossly negligent failure of
a Party to fulfill a condition of this Agreement (to the extent such Party
would be in a position to cause the condition to be fulfilled), such Party
shall, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, pay to the other
Party liquidated damages ( _Konventionalstrafe_ ) in the amount of EUR. For
purposes of the preceding sentence, Sellers on the one hand and Purchasers and
K2 on the other hand shall be treated as one Party only, so that the liability
to pay liquidated damages shall only exist in the aggregate and
not individually to each signatory to this Agreement. Evidence of actual
damage is not required for claims to pay liquidated damages. Such liquidated
damages shall be in lieu of any other damages, whether direct, indirect,
consequential or of whatever nature.



Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if Sellers
jointly terminate this Agreement in accordance with article XI(c)(iv) in a
situation where such failure is not primarily the result of non-fulfillment of
the conditions precedent set forth in art.s III.B.1, III.B.2 (other
than III.B.2(g)), Purchasers shall in any event, whether Purchasers acted
intentional, negligent or not, pay to Sellers liquidated damages (
_Konventionalstrafe_ ) in the amount of EUR, _provided, however_ , that the
inability of Purchasers to obtain such financing is not primarily due to
actions or omissions of the Sellers. Evidence of actual damage is not required
for claims to pay such liquidated damages. Such liquidated damages shall be in
lieu of any other damages, whether direct, indirect, consequential or of
whatever nature.



If this Agreement is terminated, all provisions of this Agreement shall cease
to be effective except for this art. XI, art. XIII (Miscellaneous) and art.
XIV (Governing Law and Arbitration).



   XII. | TAXES AND OTHER CHARGES 
---|--- 



Sellers shall be responsible for the timely preparation and filing of all Tax
Returns of



 

54 or with respect to the Volkl Group Companies required to be filed on or before
the Closing Date. Purchasers shall be responsible for the preparation and
filing of all Tax Returns of or with respect to the Volkl Group Companies
required to be filed after the Closing Date. Purchasers shall have the right
to review Tax Returns required to be filed between signing of this Agreement
and Closing and Sellers shall have the right to review material Tax Returns
required to be filed after Closing for taxable periods ending on or before the
Closing Date or Straddle Periods prior to their filing.



Each of Sellers and Purchasers and their respective Affiliates shall
cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other Party
and as set forth in art. VI.E., in connection with the filing of Tax Returns
and any audit or proceedings with respect to Taxes, such
cooperation including the obligation to submit to the other Party all
correspondence and documents which a Party intends to submit to a Governmental
Entity and the taking into account of all reasonable comments made by the
other Party. Such cooperation shall include the retention and the provision
of records and information which are reasonably relevant to any such filing,
audit or proceedings and making employees available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder. Each Party agrees to retain all of its books and records
with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the business of the other Party
relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until
the expiration of the statute of limitations (and any extensions thereof)
relating to Tax and penalty proceedings of the respective taxable periods, and
to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any Governmental
Entity.

 



The parties hereby agree to use commercially reasonable efforts by
the Closing Date consistent with applicable law to reduce or eliminate any
Taxes attributable to the direct or indirect transfer of ownership of BIL
Grundstuckverwaltungs-GmbH and Co WEDA KG). Any costs associated with such
efforts shall be borne one-half by the Purchasers and one-half by the
Sellers. In the event that, by the Closing Date, the Parties are unable to
agree on a method to be utilized in order to reduce or eliminate such Taxes,
any such Taxes shall be borne one-half by the Purchasers and one-half by the
Sellers. __



Any Swiss Taxes or other charges which become due in connection with the
transfer of the Shares shall be at the charge of Sellers; all other transfer
Taxes (subject to the provisions set forth in the preceding paragraph) which
become due in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or by the
Ancillary Documents shall be borne one-half by Purchasers and one-half by
Sellers.



Until the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date, Purchasers shall not perform
any of the following transactions, unless Sellers consent thereto in writing:



 

55 earnings of the Volkl Group Companies accrued before March 31, 2004; 
---|---|--- 


     | (b) | liquidation of VSH, except for a deemed liquidation of VSH
for United States federal income tax purposes as a result of an election under
the "check-the-box" rules by VSH to be treated as a disregarded entity for
such purposes; 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | merger of VSH into any other company; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | payment of part of the Purchase Price allocated to the
Shares, directly or indirectly, out of the funds of the Volkl Group Companies
as at Closing Date.  
---|---|--- 



Sellers shall not withhold their consent to any of the above transactions if
Purchasers can provide rulings from the competent tax authorities that the
planned transaction will not result in a retroactive reclassification of the
tax-free capital gain realized by the Sellers on the sale of the Shares into
taxable income under the so-called doctrine of indirect partial liquidation (
_indirekte Teilliquidation)_. Sellers shall fully cooperate with Purchasers in
order to obtain such rulings. If Purchasers breach their covenants not
to perform any of the above transactions, they shall hold harmless the
Sellers from any Liability, subject to the limitations set forth in art. VI.D
of this Agreement.



   XIII. | MISCELLANEOUS

Party in the manner described above. All notices shall be effective upon

   D. | No Waiver 
---|--- 



The failure of any of the Parties to enforce a provision of this Agreement or
any



 

57 rights with respect thereto shall in no way be considered as a waiver of such
provisions or rights or in any way affect the validity of this Agreement. The
waiver of any claim for breach of this Agreement by a Party hereto shall not
operate as a waiver of any claim pertaining to another, prior or subsequent
breach.



   E. | Entire Agreement; Amendments 
---|--- 



This instrument embodies the entire agreement between the Parties hereto with
respect to the transaction contemplated herein and there have been and are no
agreements or warranties between the Parties other than those set forth or
provided for herein.



In case of inconsistencies or discrepancies between this Agreement and any of
the Ancillary Documents that cannot be resolved by the Parties
acting reasonably, the provisions of this Agreement shall prevail unless the
Ancillary Document provides for a specific rule for the matter in question,
which rule shall not, however, deviate from the general principles set forth
in this Agreement. 



This Agreement may be amended only in writing through a document signed by
all the Parties hereto.



   F. | Binding on Successors 
---|--- 



All of the terms, provisions and conditions of this Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their
respective heirs, successors and assigns.



   G. | Announcements 
---|--- 



Following execution of this Agreement, the Parties shall jointly communicate
and inform the press and the public regarding the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as set forth in _Schedule XIII.G_. Sellers and
Purchasers shall consult before issuing press releases or otherwise making any
public statements or any statements to the Volkl Group Companies employees
with respect to this Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or
statement without the prior approval of the other Party.



The Parties shall co-operate in good faith in order to jointly inform
customers, suppliers or distributors of the acquisition of the Business
by Purchasers as of Closing.



Nothing in this Agreement shall restrict or prohibit:



     | (a) | any announcement or disclosure required by statutory law or
by any competent judicial or regulatory authority or by any competent
securities exchange (in 
---|---|--- 
 



 

58 which case the Parties shall co-operate in good faith in order to agree the
content of any such announcement prior to it being made);



     | (b) | the Parties and their Affiliates from making any disclosure
to any of their directors, officers, employees, agents or advisers who are
required to receive such information to carry out their duties (conditional
upon any such person agreeing to keep such information confidential for so
long as the disclosing Party is obligated to do so in accordance with this
Agreement or applicable law). 
---|---|--- 


   H. | Severability; Good Faith 
---|--- 



Should any part or provision of this Agreement be held to be invalid or
unenforceable by any competent court, governmental or administrative
authority having jurisdiction, the other provisions of this Agreement shall
nonetheless remain valid. In such case, the Parties shall endeavor to
negotiate a substitute provision that best reflects the economic intentions of
the Parties without being unenforceable, and shall execute all agreements and
documents required in this connection.



If a Party to this Agreement (the "Failing Party") should fail to take any
action to be taken or to deliver any document to be delivered as of a specific
date, the other Party shall not resort to any contractual remedies under this
Agreement if such failure is promptly and fully cured in good faith by the
Failing Party.



   I. | Confidentiality 
---|--- 



The Parties undertake to keep the contents of this Agreement, particularly the
Purchase Price, and all information obtained in the course of the
due diligence and in any negotiations and discussions prior to or after
Closing Date in strict confidence, and undertake to impose the same
confidentiality obligation on their Affiliates, directors, officers, employees
and advisors. The Parties further undertake not to disclose any such
information to third parties, and the Parties to this Agreement shall in all
respects keep confidential and not at any time disclose to anyone or use for
their own or any other persons benefit or to the detriment of the other
party or parties any confidential information, in each case unless:



     | (a) | a Party is required to do so by a competent court or
administrative authority under compulsory law; 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | a Party is required to do so under applicable stock exchange
or other securities regulations; 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | such information is already in the public domain by reason
other than a breach of this confidentiality undertaking. 
---|---|--- 


If this Agreement is terminated for any reason whatsoever, each Party
shall promptly



 

59 return the information provided by the other Party and keep the other Partys
information confidential and not use any of such other Partys information.



This confidentiality undertaking shall remain in force until the 5th (fifth)
anniversary of the Closing.



   J. | No Assignment 
---|--- 



Except as set forth hereunder, neither the Parties nor any of their Affiliates
shall assign this Agreement or any rights or obligations to an Affiliate
or any third party without the prior written consent of the Sellers (if the
assignment is proposed to be undertaken by Purchasers) or Purchasers (if the
assignment is proposed to be undertaken by Sellers).



Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchasers shall subject to the conditions set
forth below have the right:



     | (a) | to consummate the transactions contemplated under this
Agreement through one or more of their Affiliates; or 
---|---|--- 


     | (b) | to assign after Closing any or all of Purchasers rights or
obligations under this Agreement or any or all of their interests in VSH to an
Affiliate. 
---|---|--- 
 



Purchasers and their wholly-owned subsidiaries shall be jointly and severally
liable for any and all obligations and liabilities of Purchasers or any of
their Affiliates as well as claims of Sellers or their Affiliates against
Purchasers or their Affiliates contemplated under this Agreement.



   XIV. | GOVERNING LAW AND ARBITRATION 
---|--- 



   A. | Governing Law 
---|--- 



This Agreement and the Ancillary Documents (if not otherwise agreed to the
contrary therein) shall be subject to and governed by Swiss substantive law,
to the exclusion of the rules set forth in the United Nations Convention on
the International Sale of Goods.



   B. | Arbitration 
---|--- 



Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or in relation to this
contract, including the validity, invalidity, breach or termination thereof,
shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the Swiss Rules of
International Arbitration of the Swiss Chambers of Commerce in force on the
date when the Notice of Arbitration is submitted in accordance with these
Rules.



 

60 The number of arbitrators shall be three. The seat of the arbitration shall be
in Zurich. The arbitral proceedings shall be conducted in English.



Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party shall have the right to seek
injunctive relief ( _vorsorgliche Massnahmen_ ) before the ordinary courts of
