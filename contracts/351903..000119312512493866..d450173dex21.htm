THE MERGER

1.1.  _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in

mutually agree (the date on which the Closing occurs, the " _Closing Date_
"). The Closing shall be held at the offices of Simpson Thacher and Bartlett

agreed upon in writing by the parties. 

1.4. _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger
shall have the effects set forth in the DGCL. Without limiting the foregoing
and subject to the foregoing, at the Effective Time, all of the property,
assets, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of Merger Sub
and the Company shall vest in the Surviving Company and all of the debts,
liabilities and duties of Merger Sub and the Company shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Company.

1.5. _Certificate of Incorporation_. The certificate of incorporation of the
Company, as in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall by
virtue of the Merger be amended and restated as of the Effective Time so as

following the Merger until thereafter amended in accordance with the
provisions thereof and of applicable Law.

1.6. _Bylaws_. The bylaws of the Company, as in effect as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall by virtue of the Merger be

in the form of the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, except that the name of the Surviving Company shall be "Epoch
Holding Corporation", and as so amended and restated shall be the bylaws of
the Surviving Company until thereafter amended in accordance with the
provisions thereof, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Company
and of applicable Law.

1.7. _Board of Directors_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Company as of the
Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Company as amended as of
the Effective Time, until their respective successors are duly elected or
appointed (as the case may be) and qualified, or their earlier death,
resignation or removal.

 



\- 2 -  1.8. _Officers_. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Company as of the
Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of

ARTICLE II

 

CONSIDERATION

 

2.1. _Effect on Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares (the "
_Shares_ ") of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "
_Common Stock_ "):

(a) Other than Shares held in trust accounts, managed accounts, brokerage
accounts and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary, advisory or agency
capacity, for the benefit of customers, clients or mutual funds or other
pooled investment vehicles, all shares of Common Stock that are (i) owned
directly by the Company or (ii) owned directly by Merger Sub shall be
cancelled and retired and no cash or other consideration shall be delivered
in exchange therefor. All shares of Common Stock that are owned by any wholly
owned Subsidiary of the Company, by Parent or by any wholly owned Subsidiary
of Parent (other than any Subsidiary of Parent described in  _Section
2.1(a)(ii)_) other than shares of Common Stock held in trust accounts, managed
accounts, brokerage accounts and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary,
advisory or agency capacity, for the benefit of customers, clients or mutual
funds or other pooled investment vehicles, shall remain outstanding, and no
cash or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(b) Except as otherwise provided in _Section 2.1(a)_, each share of Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
Dissenting Shares) shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive
$28.00 in cash (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), without interest.

2.2.  _Merger Sub Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any Shares, the
shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall (in consideration for the
shares of Merger Sub and the payment of the Merger Consideration) be converted
into and become a number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Company
equal to the number of shares of Common Stock of the Company which were
cancelled pursuant to _Sections 2.1(a)_ or _2.1(b)_ above.

2.3. _Treatment of Options and Other Stock Based Awards_. (a) At the
Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase shares of Common Stock
(each a " _Company Option_ ") granted pursuant to the Companys Amended and
Restated 2004 Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan or any other plan
or arrangement (collectively, the " _Company Stock Plan_ "), whether vested or
unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall
not be assumed by Parent and automatically shall be terminated at the
Effective Time and converted

 



\- 3 -   into the right of the holder thereof to receive, in full satisfaction of the
Companys obligations with respect to any such Company Option, as of the
Effective Time, an amount in cash (subject to any applicable withholding
Taxes) equal to the product of (x) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the applicable exercise price of such Company Option and
(y) the number (determined without reference to vesting requirements or other
limitations on exercisability) of shares of Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of such Company Option (the " _Option Consideration_ "). For the
avoidance of doubt, Parent and the Company acknowledge and agree that any
Company Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
has an exercise price greater than the Merger Consideration shall expire upon
the Effective Time without being converted into the right to receive any
consideration in respect thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company
shall, as required by the terms of the Company Stock Plan, provide each holder
of outstanding Company Options written notice of the Merger a reasonable
period of time prior to the Effective Time in order that any holder of a
Company Option has a reasonable period of time in which to exercise in full
all such Company Options prior to the Effective Time.

(b) At the Effective Time, each share of Common Stock granted subject to
vesting or other lapse restrictions (each, a " _Company Restricted Share_ ")
pursuant to the Company Stock Plan which is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall not be assumed by Parent and as such shall become
fully vested immediately prior to the Effective Time, such that each such
share of Common Stock shall be outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and otherwise treated in accordance with the provisions of _Section 2.1_
above.

2.4.  _Withholding_. Parent or any of its Subsidiaries and the Paying Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any payment otherwise payable
pursuant to the Merger such amounts as are required to be deducted and
withheld with respect to such payment under all applicable Tax laws. To the
extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the recipient of the
payment in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

2.5. _Certain Adjustments_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary
but without limiting the effect of _Sections 8.2(a)_ and _8.2(b)_ , if:
between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the number of
Shares or the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion,
exchange or exercise of any issued and outstanding securities of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries are changed into a different number or a different
class by reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse
stock split), stock dividend or non-cash distribution, recapitalization, or
other similar transaction, then the Merger Consideration and any other
dependent items, as applicable, shall be appropriately and proportionately
adjusted and as so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event, be
the Merger Consideration or other dependent item, as applicable. For avoidance
of doubt, the payment of the special dividend described in _Section 6.2(a)_
shall not result in any adjustment of the Merger Consideration pursuant
to this _Section 2.5_.

2.6. _Dissenting Shares_. (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, any shares of Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and as to which the holders thereof
have properly demanded appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL
and have not effectively withdrawn such demand (collectively, " _Dissenting
Shares_ ") shall not be converted as provided in _Section 2.1_, and such

 



\- 4 -   holders shall be entitled only to such rights and payments as are granted by
Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder
shall effectively waive, withdraw or lose such holders rights under Section
262 of the DGCL, each of such holders Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be
deemed to have been eligible for conversion as provided in _Section 2.1_ and
to have been converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 2.1_, without interest and after
giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided herein, and such
holder thereof shall cease to have any other rights with respect thereto.

(b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written notices
received by the Company with respect to any intent to demand, or written
demands for, appraisal with respect to any shares of Common Stock, attempts to
withdraw such notices or demands and any other instruments or notices served
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or other applicable Law relating to
stockholders appraisal rights and (ii) the right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights
under Section 262 of the DGCL or other applicable Law relating to
stockholders appraisal rights. The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent or as otherwise required by an order of a
Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction, make any payment or other
commitment with respect to any such demands for appraisal, offer to settle or
settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.

3.1. _Parent to Make Merger Consideration Available_. At or immediately prior
to the Effective Time, Parent or one of its Subsidiaries shall deposit, or
shall cause to be deposited, with a paying agent selected by Parent (subject
to the consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, of the Company) (the "
_Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of certificates that
immediately prior to the Effective Time evidenced shares of Common Stock (the
" _Certificates_ ") and the holders of uncertificated shares of Common Stock
(" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), for exchange in accordance with this _Article III_
cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section
2.1_.

3.2. _Exchange of Certificates_. (a) As soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a
Certificate and, if applicable, each holder of Book-Entry Shares immediately
prior to the Effective Time whose shares of Common Stock were converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1_ a
form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate for exchange and
cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with a letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions,
the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Merger Consideration in respect of the shares of Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate and such Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued for the
benefit of holders of the Certificates on the Merger Consideration payable
upon the surrender of the Certificates.

 



\- 5 -  (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, or, if
applicable, receipt by the Paying Agent of a letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the
Paying Agent shall issue and deliver to each holder of Book-Entry Shares a
check or wire transfer for the amount of cash that such holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to _Section 2.1_ of this Agreement in respect of such Book-
Entry Shares, without such holder being required to deliver a Certificate to
the Paying Agent, and such Book-Entry Shares shall then be canceled. No
interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of Book-Entry
Shares on the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such Book-
Entry Shares.

(c) If the payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a person other
than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered in exchange
therefor or the registered holder of Book-Entry Shares, it shall be a
condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and
otherwise in proper form for transfer or such Book-Entry Shares shall be
properly transferred, and that the person requesting such payment shall pay to
the Paying Agent in advance any applicable stock transfer or other Taxes or
shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such
Taxes have been paid or are not payable.

(d) At and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of the shares of Common Stock that were issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented for
transfer to the Paying Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the
Merger Consideration as provided in this _Article III_.

(e) Any portion of the property deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to
_Section 3.1_ (including interest thereon) that remains unclaimed by the
stockholders of the Company for six (6) months after the Effective Time shall
be paid, at the request of Parent, to or as directed by Parent. Any
stockholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with this
_Article III_ shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger
Consideration in respect of each share of Common Stock held by such
stockholder at the Effective Time as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in
each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, none of Parent, the Company, the Paying Agent
or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Common
Stock for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

(f) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the
posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Parent or one of its
Subsidiaries may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying
Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this
Agreement.

Subsidiaries or Representatives pursuant to _Section 7.1(a)_ in confidence to
the extent required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated May 27, 2011, between Parent and the
Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

(c) No investigation by Parent or its Representatives shall constitute
a waiver of or otherwise affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the Company set forth herein.

7.2.  _Stockholder Approval_. (a) The Company shall duly take all lawful
action to call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders
as promptly as practicable following the date the SEC confirms it has no
further comments to the Proxy Statement (the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_
") for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval and, subject
to _Section 7.2(b)_, shall take all lawful action to solicit the adoption of
this Agreement by such stockholders; _provided_ that if on the date of the
Company Stockholders Meeting, the Company has not received proxies
representing a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock to obtain the
Company Stockholder Approval, the Company shall be permitted to adjourn,
delay or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting until such date as shall be
mutually agreed upon by the Company and Parent to solicit additional proxies
in favor of adoption of this Agreement. The Company Board shall recommend
adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company (the " _Company
Recommendation_ ") in the Proxy Statement and shall not directly or indirectly
(x) withdraw, modify or qualify in any manner adverse to Parent such Company
Recommendation or (y) adopt, approve, or publicly recommend, declare advisable
or otherwise endorse the adoption or approval of any Acquisition Proposal (any
action or public statement described in clause (x) or (y) being referred to
as a " _Change in Company Recommendation_ "), except as and to the extent
expressly permitted by _Section 7.2(b)_ _provided_ _that_ the delivery by the
Company, the Company Board or any committee thereof of any notice to Parent
to the extent required by _Section 7.2(b)(ii)_ or _Section 7.4(b)_ shall
not, in and of itself, be deemed to be or constitute a Change in Company
Recommendation. Notwithstanding any Change in Company Recommendation, unless
this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with _Article IX_ , this
Agreement shall be submitted to the stockholders of the Company at the Company
Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of adopting this Agreement and nothing
contained herein shall be deemed to relieve the Company of such obligation. In
addition to the foregoing, the Company shall not submit to the vote of its
stockholders any Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger prior to the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article IX_.

 



\- 32 -  (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval, but not after, the Company and the Company Board shall be permitted
to effect a Change in Company Recommendation if and only if:

 

(i) the Company Board, after consultation with its outside legal advisors,
determines in good faith that failure to take such action is more likely than
not to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and

(ii) the Company has notified Parent, at least four (4) Business Days in
advance, of its intention to effect a Change in Company Recommendation (the "
_Notice Period_ "), specifying in reasonable detail the reasons therefor, and
if the Company Board intends to effect a Change in Company Recommendation in
relation to an Acquisition Proposal, (A) such Acquisition Proposal was
unsolicited and the Company Board has concluded in good faith that such
Acquisition Proposal still constitutes a Superior Proposal after giving
effect to all of the adjustments which may be offered by Parent pursuant to
clause (C) below, (B) the notice provided by the Company to Parent at the
beginning of the Notice Period specifies the material terms and conditions of
any such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the party making such
Superior Proposal) and includes a copy of the relevant proposed transaction
agreements with the party making such Superior Proposal and all
other material documents and (C) during the Notice Period the Company has
negotiated, and has caused its financial and legal advisors to negotiate, with
Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal.

In the event of any material revisions to the Superior Proposal, the Company
shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to again
comply with the requirements of this _Section 7.2(b)_ with respect to such
new written notice, except that the Notice Period shall be reduced to three
(3) Business Days with respect to such revised Superior Proposal. No Change in
Company Recommendation shall change the approval of this Agreement by the
Company Board, and no Change in Company Recommendation shall have the effect
of causing any state corporate takeover statute or other similar statute
(including Section 203 of the DGCL) to be applicable to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger). 

7.3. _Proxy Statement_. (a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the
date of this Agreement (and in any event within twenty-five (25) Business
Days after the date hereof), the Company shall, with the assistance of Parent,
prepare and file the Proxy Statement with the SEC. Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company will cooperate with each other in the preparation of the Proxy
Statement. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve all
SEC comments with respect to the Proxy Statement as promptly as reasonably
practicable after receipt thereof and to have the Proxy Statement cleared by
the staff of the SEC as promptly as reasonably practicable after such filing.
Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees to correct any information
provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement which shall have become false or
misleading. The Company shall as soon as reasonably practicable notify Parent
and Merger Sub of the receipt of any comments from the SEC with respect to the
Proxy Statement and of any request by the SEC for any amendment to the Proxy
Statement or for additional information and shall promptly provide Parent
with copies of all such comments and correspondence. Prior to filing or
mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or
responding to any comments of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with respect
thereto, the Company shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review
and to comment on such document or response and shall include any such
comments reasonably proposed by Parent.

 

(b) Parent and the Company shall, upon request, furnish each other with all
information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, officers
and stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement or any
other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of
Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Parent and the Company shall make any
necessary filings with respect to the Merger under the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.

 



\- 33 -  7.4. _Acquisition Proposals_. (a) From the date hereof until the Effective
Time or, if earlier, the date on which this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with _Article IX_ , the Company shall not, shall cause its
Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries respective directors, officers and
employees not to and shall not authorize or permit its and its Subsidiaries
respective other Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate,
solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate (including by way of
providing information) the submission of any inquiries, proposals or offers
(whether firm or hypothetical) or any other efforts or attempts that
constitute or may reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal,
(ii) have any discussions or negotiations with or provide any confidential
information or data to any person relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or
engage in any negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) approve
or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition
Proposal, (iv) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, or
execute or enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in principle,
memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, asset or share purchase or
share exchange agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement related
to any Acquisition Proposal, (v) enter into any agreement or agreement in
principle requiring, directly or indirectly, the Company to abandon, terminate
or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or breach its
obligations hereunder, or (vi) propose or agree to do any of the foregoing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 7.4(a)_, prior to
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, but not after, in the event that
the Company receives after the date hereof an unsolicited _bona fide_ written
Acquisition Proposal and the Company Board concludes in good faith that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a
Superior Proposal, the Company may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its
and their directors, officers, employees and Representatives, to take any
action described in clause (ii) above if the Company Board, after
consultation with its outside legal advisors, determines in good faith that
failure to take such action is more likely than not to result in a violation
of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that
prior to providing (or causing to be provided) any confidential information
or data permitted to be provided pursuant to this sentence, the Company shall
have entered into a written confidentiality agreement with such third party on
terms no less favorable to the Company than the Confidentiality Agreement and
the Company shall promptly provide to Parent an executed copy of such
confidentiality agreement (provided that the standstill in such
confidentiality agreement need not prohibit the recipient thereunder
from making any Acquisition Proposal of a type that could constitute or
result in a Superior Proposal or preclude discussions or negotiations related
to any such Acquisition Proposal); and _provided_ , _further_ , that the
Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) provide Parent with
any non-public information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries provided
to such person which was not previously provided to Parent (or its
Representatives).

 



\- 34 -  (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval, but not after, the Company may terminate this Agreement in
accordance with _Section 9.1(h)_ in order to execute or otherwise enter into
a binding definitive agreement to effect a transaction constituting a Superior
Proposal if and only if: (A) such Acquisition Proposal was unsolicited and
the Company Board has concluded in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal
still constitutes a Superior Proposal after giving effect to all of the
adjustments which may be offered by Parent pursuant to clause (C) below, (B)
the Company has notified Parent, at least four (4) Business Days in advance,
of such proposed termination (the " _Superior Proposal Notice Period_ "),
specifying the material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal
(including the identity of the party making such Superior Proposal) and
furnishing to Parent a copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreements
with the party making such Superior Proposal and all other material documents
and (C) during the Superior Proposal Notice Period, the Company has
negotiated, and has caused its financial and legal advisors to negotiate, with
Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make
such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal. In the event of
any material revisions to the Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required
to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to again comply with the
requirements of this _Section 7.4(b)_ with respect to such new written
notice, except that the Superior Proposal Notice Period shall be reduced to
three (3) Business Days with respect to such revised Superior Proposal.

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any
inquiry, proposal or offer from any person (other than Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries) relating to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to,
any direct or indirect (i) acquisition, purchase or sale of a business or
assets (including rights under Management Contracts) that constitute 20% or
more of the consolidated business, revenues, net income or assets (including
stock of the Companys Subsidiaries) of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii)
merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
the Company or the Investment Management Subsidiary, (iii) purchase or sale
of, or tender or exchange offer (including a self-tender offer) for,
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that, if consummated,
would result in any person (or the stockholders of such person) beneficially
owning securities representing 20% or more of the equity or total voting
power of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or the surviving parent entity
in such transaction.

 

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means a _bona
fide_ written Acquisition Proposal (with all references to "20% or more"
being deemed to be references to "more than 50%"), which the Company Board
concludes in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal advisors, taking into account timing and all legal, financial,
regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the person making the
proposal (including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions and
conditions to consummation), (i) is more favorable to the stockholders of the
Company from a financial point of view than the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and (ii) is reasonably capable of being completed on the terms
proposed on a timely basis.

 

(e) The Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries and its and its
Subsidiaries directors, officers, employees and Representatives to,
immediately cease and cause

 



\- 35 -   to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted
before the date of this Agreement with any persons other than Parent with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal, including immediately revoking or
withdrawing access of any person other than Parent and its directors,
officers, employees and Representatives to any data room (virtual or actual)
containing any non-public information with respect to the Company or
its Subsidiaries previously furnished with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal, and will use its reasonable best efforts to enforce, and will not
waive or amend any provision of, any confidentiality, standstill or similar
agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal, including by requiring the
other parties thereto to promptly return or destroy any confidential
information previously furnished by or on behalf of the Company thereunder.
The Company will promptly (and in all events within 24 hours) following
receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry which could reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal advise Parent of the material
terms thereof (including the identity of the person making such
Acquisition Proposal), and will keep Parent reasonably apprised of any
material related developments, discussions and negotiations and the status and
terms thereof (including providing Parent with a copy of all material
documentation and correspondence relating thereto or a written summary of the
material terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposals or requests
that are not made in writing) on a reasonably current basis. Without limiting
the foregoing, the Company shall notify Parent orally and in writing within
24 hours after it enters into discussions or negotiations with another person
regarding an Acquisition Proposal, executes and delivers a confidentiality
agreement with another person in connection with an Acquisition Proposal,
or provides non-public information or data to another person in connection
with an Acquisition Proposal. The Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries
will not enter into any confidentiality or other agreement with any person
following the date of this Agreement that prohibits the Company from
providing such information to Parent or otherwise complying with the terms of
this Agreement.

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the
Company Board from (i) complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated
under the Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_ ,
that such Rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action
pursuant to such Rules would otherwise have under this Agreement); or (ii)
making any required factual disclosure to the stockholders of the Company if
the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that the failure to make such disclosure is more likely
than not to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable
Law ( _provided_ , that the foregoing will in no way eliminate or modify the
effect that any such disclosure would otherwise have under this Agreement);
_provided_ that in no event shall this _Section 7.4(f)_ affect the other
obligations of the Company under this Agreement, including under _Sections
7.2(b)_ and this _Section 7.4_; it being understood that any disclosure
pursuant to this _Section 7.4(f)_ (other than a "stop, look and listen"
communication to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be a Change in Company
Recommendation unless the Company Board expressly and concurrently reaffirms
the Company Recommendation.

7.5. _Reasonable Efforts_. (a) Subject to the other provisions of this
Agreement (including any other level of efforts specified in the other
Sections of this Agreement with respect to the matters contemplated by such
other Sections, including _Section 7.12_), each of Parent and the Company
shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable
efforts (i) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or
advisable to

 



\- 36 -   comply promptly with all legal requirements which may be imposed on such
party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and, subject to the
conditions set forth in _Article VIII_  hereof, to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) to obtain (and to
cooperate with the other party to obtain) any consent, authorization, order or
approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any other third
party which is required to be obtained by the Company or Parent or any of
their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to the other provisions
of this Agreement (including any other level of efforts specified in the
other Sections of this Agreement with respect to the matters contemplated by
such other Sections, including _Section 7.12_), the parties hereto shall
cooperate with each other and use reasonable efforts to promptly prepare and
file all necessary documentation, to effect all applications, notices,
petitions and filings, to obtain as promptly as practicable all permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental
Entities which are necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and to comply with the terms and conditions of
all such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all such third
parties and Governmental Entities. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, each party hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing of a
Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act as promptly as
practicable after the date hereof (and, in any event, within fifteen (15)
Business Days following the date hereof). Parent and the Company shall keep
the other party reasonably informed and promptly advise each other upon
receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity whose consent or
approval is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement which causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable
likelihood that any Requisite Regulatory Approval will not be obtained or
that the receipt of any such approval will be materially delayed or
conditioned.

(b) Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement (including any other
level of efforts specified in the other Sections of this Agreement with
respect to the matters contemplated by such other Sections, including _Section
7.12_), each of Parent and the Company agrees to use reasonable efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, as
soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, the transactions
contemplated hereby, including using reasonable efforts to (i) modify or amend
any Contracts, plans or arrangements to which Parent or the Company is a party
(to the extent permitted by the terms thereof) if necessary in order
to satisfy the conditions set forth in _Article VIII_ hereof, (ii) lift or
rescind any injunction or restraining order or other order adversely affecting
the ability of the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,
and (iii) defend any litigation seeking to enjoin, prevent or delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or seeking material
damages.

7.6. _Employees; Employee Benefit Plans_.

(a) Following the Effective Time, the Company Employees who are employees of
the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company at the Effective Time (such Company
Employees, " _Transferred Employees_ ") shall continue to participate in all
employee benefit plans of the Company until the later of December 31, 2013 or
such time(s) as the Transferred Employees become eligible to participate in
the corresponding employee benefit plans sponsored or maintained by Parent in
which similarly situated employees of Parent participate (the " _Parent
Plans_ "), to the same extent as such similarly situated employees of Parent

 



\- 37 -   so participate (it being understood that inclusion of Transferred Employees
in such Parent Plans may occur at different times with respect to different
Parent Plans); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that (i) nothing contained herein
shall require Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to make any grants to any
Company Employee under any equity-based plans, it being understood that any
such grants are completely discretionary, (ii) nothing contained herein shall
require Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to permit a Company Employee who is
receiving severance as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (or together with any other action) pursuant to any employment,
severance, change-in-control, consulting or other compensation agreements,
plans and arrangements with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
participate in any severance or change-in-control agreement or plan offered by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries and (iii) nothing contained herein shall
require a Company Employees participation in Parents or any of its
Subsidiaries post-retirement welfare benefit plans or defined benefit pension
plans. 

(b) As soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement but in no event
later than the Effective Time, Parent and Company shall cooperate in good
faith to cause the adoption, implementation and entry into, for the benefit of
the Transferred Employees, certain compensation plans, the material terms of
which are described in Section 7.6(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
which plan documents shall be in accordance with such material terms and
subject to Parents final approval of such plan documents (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). For a period beginning at the
Effective Time and continuing through December 31, 2013: (i) Parent shall
(and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) maintain and keep in full force and
effect the Company 401(k) plan in accordance with the terms of such plan, and
during this time, without the prior written consent of the plan
administrators of such plans and (ii), Parent shall not (and shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to) permit or cause the early termination of any such plan or
the amendment or modification any such plan in a manner adverse to any
beneficiary thereof, in any such case that would be effective during such
period, except as may be otherwise required by Law.

(c) On and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or cause its Subsidiaries
to, provide the Transferred Employees with such cash and equity-based
compensation opportunities as are set forth in any such employees Employment
Contract (which are listed in Section 7.6(c) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule), and/or the applicable compensation plans as described in Section
7.6(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and otherwise as shall be agreed
between Parent and senior management of the Company.

(d) With respect to each Parent Plan, for purposes of determining eligibility
to participate, vesting, entitlement to benefits and vacation entitlement (but
not for accrual of benefits or "core contributions" under the U.S. tax
qualified defined contribution Parent Plan), service with the Company or any
Subsidiary shall be treated as service with Parent; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition
would result in a duplication of benefits. Such service also shall apply for
purposes of satisfying any waiting periods, evidence of insurability
requirements, or the application of any pre-existing condition limitations
with respect to any Parent Plan. Each Parent Plan shall waive pre-existing
condition limitations to the same extent waived under the applicable Plan.
The Transferred Employees shall be given credit for amounts paid under a
corresponding Plan of the Company or any Subsidiary during the same period for
purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as
though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions
of the Parent Plan during the applicable plan year.

 



\- 38 -  (e) The Company and Parent acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained
in this  _Section 7.6_ with respect to employees, officers and directors are
included for the sole benefit of the Company and Parent and shall not create
any right (i) in any other person, including Plans or any beneficiary thereof
or (ii) to continued employment with Parent or any of its affiliates or any
continued compensation, employee benefits or other right. Nothing contained
herein, whether express or implied, shall be treated as an amendment or
modification of any employee benefit plan, program, arrangement or agreement.

7.7. _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. (a) From and
after the Effective Time, in the event of any claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, in which any
person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this
Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") is,
or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising
in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) any event or occurrence
related to the fact that such Indemnified Party is or was a director or
officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or was prior to the
Effective Time serving at the request of any such party as a director,
officer, employee, trustee, agent, partner or fiduciary of another
corporation, partnership, trust, joint venture, employee benefit plan or other
entity (a list of the directors and officers of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries who are serving, as of the date of this Agreement, in any such
capacity with another corporation, partnership, trust or other enterprise, and
a description of the nature of such service, is set forth in Section 7.7(a)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule) or (ii) this Agreement, or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby and all actions taken by an Indemnified Party
in connection herewith, in each case in his or her capacity as a director or
officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether in any case
asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Company to indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent
provided in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company as in
effect on the date of this Agreement and permitted by applicable Law, each
such Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in advance
of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to
each Indemnified Party upon receipt of an undertaking, to the extent required
by the DGCL, from such Indemnified Party to repay such advanced expenses if
it is determined by a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party was not entitled to
indemnification hereunder), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement
in connection with any such actual or threatened claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under
this  _Section 7.7_ (i) upon learning of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Parent in writing thereof,
_provided_ , that the failure to so notify shall not affect the obligations of
Parent under this _Section 7.7_ except (and only) to the extent such failure
to notify materially prejudices Parent and (ii) shall give Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries such information and cooperation as they may reasonably
require and as shall be within such Indemnified Partys power. From and after
closing, Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to continue in full force
and effect, on the same terms existing on the date of this Agreement, any
indemnification agreement in favor of any individual listed on Section 7.7(a)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 



\- 39 -  (b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the persons serving as officers and directors of the Company prior to the
Effective Time to be covered by the directors and officers liability
insurance policy or policies (providing only for Side A coverage for such
persons where the existing policies also include Side B or Side C coverage
for the Company) maintained by Parent or one of its Subsidiaries ( _provided_
, that Parents directors and officers liability insurance policy or
policies provide at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions which are, in the aggregate, not materially less advantageous to
such directors and officers of the Company than the terms and conditions of
the existing directors and officers liability insurance policy of the
Company) with respect to claims arising from facts or events that existed or
occurred at or prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
no event will Parent be required to expend, in the aggregate and on an annual
basis, an amount in excess of 250% of the annual premiums currently paid by
the Company for such insurance, which current premiums are set forth in
Section 7.7(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the " _Insurance Amount_
"), and if Parent is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for by
this _Section 7.7(b)_ for an amount per year equal to or less than the
Insurance Amount, Parent shall obtain as much comparable insurance as may be
available for the Insurance Amount. The provisions of this _Section 7.7(b)_
shall be deemed to have been satisfied if tail policies have been obtained by
Parent or by the Company with Parents consent (not to be unreasonably
withheld), which policies provide the persons covered by the Companys
directors and officers liability insurance policy immediately prior to the
Effective Time with coverage (on terms not materially less favorable
than those of the policies in effect as of the date of this Agreement) for a
period of not less than six (6) years after the Effective Time with respect to
claims arising from facts or events that occurred at or prior to the Effective
Time;  _provided_ , that such tail policies shall not be obtained at an
annual cost that is higher than the Insurance Amount. If such prepaid policies
have been obtained by the Company prior to the Effective Time with Parents
consent, Parent shall maintain such policies in full force and effect and
continue to honor all obligations thereunder.

(c) The provisions of this _Section 7.7_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs
and personal representatives.

7.8. _Advice of Changes_. The Company shall promptly advise Parent of any
change or event which, individually or in the aggregate with other such
changes or events, has or would have a Material Adverse Effect or which it
believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material
breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained
herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that any noncompliance with the foregoing
shall not constitute the failure to be satisfied of a condition set forth in
_Article VIII_ or give rise to any right of termination under _Article IX_
unless the underlying breach shall independently constitute such a failure or
give rise to such a right.

7.9. _Financial Statements and Other Current Information; Revenue Run
Rate Reports_. As soon as reasonably practicable after they become available,
but in no event more than 30 days after the end of each calendar month ending
after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall furnish to Parent (a)
consolidated and consolidating financial statements (including balance
sheets, statements of operations and stockholders equity) of the Company and
each of its

 



\- 40 -   Subsidiaries as of and for such month then ended, (b) internal management
financial control reports showing actual financial performance against plan
and previous period, (c) any reports provided to the Company Board or any
committee thereof relating to the financial performance and risk management of
the Company and (d) in respect of the month of February 2013 and each calendar
month thereafter, statements (each report, a " _Run Rate Report_ ") that set
forth the Revenue Run Rate as of the last Business Day of such month for the
Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to the Assets Under Management of
all Clients from or in respect of whom the Company shall have received a
Client Consent on or prior to such date, together with reasonable supporting
detail with respect to such Run Rate Report. All information furnished by the
Company to Parent pursuant to this _Section 7.9_ shall be held in confidence
to the same extent of Parents obligations under _Section 7.1(b)_.

7.10.  _Takeover Laws_. If any state takeover Law or similar Law becomes
applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, the Voting and Support Agreements or
any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Voting and
Support Agreements, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to take
such actions as necessary so that the Merger and the other transactions

pursuant to the provisions of the Investment Company Act applicable thereto,
of the new Management Contract (which new Management Contract shall be on
terms substantially the same in all material respects to the Management
Contract existing between the Investment Management Subsidiary and such Client
as of the date of this Agreement with the exception of its effective and
termination dates or otherwise acceptable to Parent) for such Sub-Advised
Fund approved by the applicable Sub-Advised Fund Board. Without limiting the
foregoing, subject in each case to requirements of applicable Law:

(i) With respect to each Sub-Advised Fund (other than an Exempt Sub-Advised
Fund in the case of clauses (B), (C) and (D) below) and the Sub-Advised Fund
Board thereof, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts, (A) to
obtain, as promptly as

 



\- 42 -   reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Fund Board
Approval from such Sub-Advised Fund Board (and, except in respect of an Exempt
Sub-Advised Fund, the agreement of such Sub-Advised Fund Board to recommend
that the shareholders of such Sub-Advised Fund approve) a new Management
Contract (which new Management Contract shall be on terms substantially the
same in all material respects to the Management Contract existing between the
Investment Management Subsidiary and such Client as of the date of this
Agreement, with the exception of its effective and termination dates or
otherwise acceptable to Parent); (B) to cause, as promptly as
reasonably practicable following receipt of the approval and recommendation

reasonably practicable for the purpose of voting upon a proposal to approve
(in the requisite manner) such new Management Contract; (C) to prepare and to
file (or to cause to be prepared and filed) with the SEC and all other

cause to be mailed) such proxy solicitation materials as promptly as
reasonably practicable after clearance thereof by the SEC (if applicable); and
(D) to cause such Sub-Advised Fund Board to submit, as promptly as
practicable following the mailing of the proxy materials, to the shareholders
of such Sub-Advised Fund for a vote at a shareholders meeting the proposal

(ii) The parties hereto agree that a Sub-Advised Fund shall be deemed to have
consented for all purposes under this Agreement to the transactions
contemplated hereby and the continued management of such Sub-Advised Fund by
the Investment Management Subsidiary following the Effective Time if the
applicable Fund Board Approval is obtained and, except in the case of an
Exempt Sub-Advised Fund, requisite approval is obtained from the shareholders
of such Sub-Advised Fund in the manner contemplated by _Section 7.12(c)(i)_,
unless at any time prior to the Closing the respective Sub-Advised Fund
Board notifies the Company in writing or orally that such Sub-Advised Fund

Subsidiaries shall use reasonable best efforts to cause such Sub-Advised Fund
Board to approve, in conformity with Rule 15a-4 under the Investment Company
Act, an interim Management Contract for the applicable Sub-Advised Fund to be
effective immediately following the Effective Time. For the avoidance of
doubt, entry by a Client into an "interim contract" pursuant to Rule 15a-4

purposes of this Agreement until such time as the applicable Fund Board
Approval has been obtained and (except in the case of an Exempt Sub-Advised
Fund) the applicable new Management Contract described in _Section
7.12(c)(i)_ has been approved by the shareholders of such Sub-Advised Fund.

(iv) The Company agrees that the information provided by it or its

materials) will not contain, as of the date of such proxy materials, any
untrue statement of a material fact, or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Parent
agrees that the information provided by it or its affiliates (or on its
behalf) in writing specifically for inclusion in the proxy materials to be
furnished to the shareholders of any Sub-Advised Fund will not contain, as of
the date of such proxy materials, any untrue statement of a material fact, or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. Each of the Company and Parent shall have the right
to review in advance and to approve (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld) all the information relating to it or its affiliates proposed to
appear in (A) any proxy statement or any amendment or supplement thereto
submitted to the SEC or such other applicable Governmental Authority in
connection with the approvals contemplated by this _Section 7.12_ or (B) any

Fund Client Investor of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement which
would result in the "assignment" (as defined under the Advisers Act or such
Management Contract) of such Exempt Fund Clients Management Contract and (ii)
requesting the consent of such Exempt Fund Client Investor to such
"assignment." The parties hereto agree that, with respect to each Exempt Fund
Client, Client Consent shall be deemed given for all purposes under this
Agreement if (I) the written consent of the Exempt Fund Client Investors of
such Exempt Fund Client representing more than 50% of the total capital
accounts of all Exempt Fund Client Investors in such Exempt Fund Client has
been obtained (and has not been withdrawn or superseded) or (II) if no such
written consent is obtained, if written notice has been sent to the Exempt
Fund Client Investors in such Exempt Fund Client (which notice may be included
in the notice referred to in the first sentence of this _Section 7.12(d)_)
informing such Exempt Fund Client Investors: (x) of the intention to complete
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (y) of the intention of the
Investment Management Subsidiary to continue to provide advisory services to
the Exempt Fund Client after the Effective Time and (z) explaining that each
Exempt Fund Client Investor that does not object to the assignment of the
applicable Management Contract within 45 days following delivery of such
notice will be deemed to have consented to such assignment; provided that, in
any case, no consent shall be deemed to have been given for any purpose under
this Agreement in respect of an Exempt Fund Client if at any time prior to the
Closing Exempt Fund Client Investors in such Exempt Fund Client representing
more than 50% of the total capital accounts of all Exempt Fund Client
Investors in such Exempt Client Fund notify the Company orally or in writing
that they have not so consented (and such notice is not withdrawn or
superseded in writing by such Exempt Fund Client Investors). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Assets Under Management for any Exempt Fund Client shall
exclude the Assets Under Management with respect to any Exempt Fund Client
Investor who has at any time prior to the Effective Time notified the Company
or the Investment Management

 



\- 44 -   Subsidiary orally or in writing that such Exempt Fund Client Investor has
not so consented or has terminated or intends to terminate, its account (and

promptly as practicable following the later of (x) the date of this Agreement
and (y) the launch of any UCITS, any approvals in respect of a UCITS for the
continuation of its Management Contract in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby if and to the extent required by the terms of such
Management Contract and/or applicable Law. The parties hereto agree that a
UCITS shall be deemed to have consented for all purposes under this Agreement
to the transactions contemplated hereby and the continued management of such
UCITS by the Company or the applicable Subsidiary following the Closing if
continued management of such UCITS by such person following the Closing has
been approved in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

(f) Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause their affiliates to,
cooperate with the Company and furnish to the Company such reasonably
necessary information and reasonable assistance as the Company may reasonably
request in connection with seeking all Client consents pursuant to this
Agreement. The Company shall use reasonable efforts to cause to be amended in
the manner set forth in Section 7.12(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule the
Contracts set forth on such schedule.

(g) In connection with obtaining Client Consents under this _Section 7.12_,
the Company shall deliver (or cause to be delivered) drafts of all consent
materials prepared by the Company or its Subsidiaries to Parent a reasonable
time prior to the mailing or distribution of such documents to any Client in
order to afford Parent an opportunity to review and comment on such documents.
The forms of all such consent materials shall be subject to the approval of
Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

(h) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, prior to the Closing,
without the prior written consent of the Company (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld), other than for communications made by Parent or its
affiliates in connection with their ordinary course of business or
investor relations activities neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall, directly
or indirectly, knowingly contact or communicate with any Client, any
shareholder of a Sub-Advised Fund, any Exempt Fund Client Investor or any
member of any Sub-Advised Fund Board specifically regarding the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ _that_ the consent of the Company
pursuant to the foregoing sentence shall not be required in connection with
any responses or communications by Parent or Merger Sub or any of their
affiliates to any Sub-Advised Fund Board specifically regarding the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (in each case which responses and
communications are also promptly provided to the Company) in connection
with any requests directed to Parent or Merger Sub relating to the approval
by such Sub-Advised Fund Board pursuant to the provisions of Section 15 of the
Investment Company Act.

 

(i) In connection with obtaining Client Consents under this _Section 7.12_,
each party shall keep the others reasonably informed of the status thereof
and the Company shall promptly advise Parent as promptly as practicable if any
Client notifies the Company or the Investment Management Subsidiary (or, in
the case of a Client which is a Sub-Advised Fund, if 

 



\- 45 -   the advisor or manager thereof notifies the Company or the Investment
Management Subsidiary) orally or in writing that such Client (or the relevant
Sub-Advised Fund Board) has not so consented or has terminated, or intends to
terminate, its Management Contract, intends to put its account up for bid or
intends to materially reduce its investment relationship with the Company or
the Investment Management Subsidiary.

 

7.13. _NASDAQ Delisting_. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all
things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable
Law and rules and policies of NASDAQ to cause the shares of Common Stock to no

or changes suggested thereto by Parent.

7.15. _Section 15(f)_.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the Company is entering into this
Agreement in reliance upon the benefits and protections provided by Section
15(f) of the Investment Company Act. Parent and Merger Sub shall not take, and

take any action that would have the effect, directly or indirectly, of
causing the requirements of any of the provisions of Section 15(f) of the
Investment Company Act not to be met in respect of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement with respect to the Sub-Advised Funds. In that
regard, Parent and Merger Sub shall conduct their business, and shall use
their reasonable best efforts to cause each of their affiliates to conduct
their businesses, so as to assure that for a period of not less than three
years after the Effective Time, no "interested person" (within the meaning of
Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act) of Parent, Merger Sub or any
of their affiliates becomes a member of the board of directors or trustees of
such Sub-Advised Funds if doing so would cause less than 75% of the members
of the boards of directors or trustees of each such Sub-Advised Fund not to be
(A) "interested persons" (within the meaning of Section 2(a)(19) of the
Investment Company Act) of an investment adviser (within the meaning of
Section 2(a)(20) of the Investment Company Act) of such investment company
after the Effective Time or (B) "interested persons" (within the meaning of

(within the meaning of Section 2(a)(20) of the Investment Company Act) of such
investment company immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(b) For a period of three years from the Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub
shall use commercially reasonable efforts not to engage, and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Company and its Subsidiaries not
to engage, in any transaction

 



\- 46 -   that would constitute an "assignment" (as defined in the Investment Company
Act) to a third party of any Management Contract between (i) the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries and (ii) any such Sub-Advised Fund as of the
Effective Time without first obtaining a covenant in all material respects the
same as that contained in this _Section 7.15_; _provided_ that the foregoing
shall not apply in the event that Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act
no longer applies to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the covenants of
the parties hereto contained in this  _Section 7.15_ are intended only for
the benefit of such parties and for no other Person.

Acquisition Proposal to "20% or more" shall instead refer to "50% or more".

(c) Any Termination Payment or portion thereof that becomes payable pursuant

specified in such sections, the Company shall pay the out-of-pocket costs and
expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by Parent in

shall be made which by Law requires further approval by such stockholders
without such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

9.4. _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
parties hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set

 



\- 51 -   forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such
extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an
obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver

other before issuing any press release with respect to this Agreement, the

(but after prior consultation, to the extent practicable in the circumstances)
issue such press release or make such public statement as may upon the advice

the New York Stock Exchange or the Toronto Stock Exchange. Without limiting
the reach of the preceding sentence, Parent and the Company shall cooperate

otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other party, except that

hereunder to any affiliate without the prior written consent of the Company;
_provided_ , that no such assignment shall change the amount or nature of the
Merger Consideration or relieve the assigning party of its obligations
hereunder if such assignee does not perform such obligations. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Except as otherwise set forth in the provisions of (A)
_Articles I_ and _II_ (which, from and after, the Effective Time (but not
unless the Effective Time occurs), shall be for the benefit of holders of
Shares, Company Options and Company Restricted Shares) and (B) _Section 7.7_

without regard to the identity of the person who drafted the various
provisions of the same. Each and every provision of this Agreement and such

parties acknowledge and agree that any rule of construction that a document is
to be construed against the drafting party shall not be applicable either to
this Agreement or such other documents and instruments.
