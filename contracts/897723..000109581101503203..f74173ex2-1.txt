                      AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

         This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION (the "AGREEMENT") is made and
entered into as of July 13, 2001, among Sanmina Corporation, a Delaware
corporation ("PARENT"), Sun Acquisition Subsidiary, Inc., a Delaware corporation
and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("MERGER SUB") and SCI Systems, Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("COMPANY").

                                    RECITALS

         A. Whereas, the Board of Directors of each of Parent, Merger Sub and
Company have determined that it is in the best interests of each corporation and
their respective stockholders that the Company and Parent enter into a strategic
business combination transaction by means of the merger of Merger Sub with and
into the Company (the "MERGER") and, in furtherance thereof, have approved the
Merger and declared the Merger advisable;

         B. Whereas, pursuant to the Merger, the outstanding shares of common
stock of Company will be converted into shares of common stock of Parent at the
rate set forth herein; and

         C. Whereas, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the
Merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 (a) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "CODE"); and

         D. Whereas, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as
an inducement to Parent's and Company's willingness to enter into this
Agreement, (i) certain affiliates of Company are entering into Voting Agreements
in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A-1 (the "COMPANY VOTING
AGREEMENTS") and (ii) certain affiliates of Parent are entering into Voting
Agreements substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A-2 (the "PARENT
VOTING Agreements").

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants, promises and
representations set forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree
as follows:

                                   ARTICLE I
                                     MERGER

         1.1 THE MERGER. At the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2) and
subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
applicable provisions of Delaware Law, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into
Company (the "MERGER"), the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall
cease and Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the "SURVIVING
CORPORATION").

         1.2 EFFECTIVE TIME; CLOSING. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing
the Certificate of Merger (the "CERTIFICATE OF MERGER") with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL" or "DELAWARE LAW") (the time of
such filing (or such later time as may be agreed in writing by Company and
Parent and



<PAGE>   7

specified in the Certificate of Merger) being the "EFFECTIVE TIME")
as soon as practicable on or after the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined).
Unless the context otherwise requires, the term "AGREEMENT" as used herein
refers collectively to this Agreement and Plan of Reorganization and the
Certificate of Merger. The closing of the Merger (the "CLOSING") shall take
place at the offices of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, Professional
Corporation, 650 Page Mill Road, Palo Alto, California, at a time and date to be
specified by the parties, which shall be no later than the second business day
after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI, or
at such other time, date and location as the parties hereto agree in writing
(the "CLOSING DATE").

         1.3 EFFECT OF THE MERGER. At the Effective Time, the effect of the
Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of
the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto,
at the Effective Time all the property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation,
and all debts, liabilities and duties of Company and Merger Sub shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

         1.4 CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION; BYLAWS. At the Effective Time, the
Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by law and such Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation; provided, however, that at the
Effective Time the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
shall be amended so that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be "Sun,
Inc." The Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be, at the Effective Time, the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter amended.

         1.5 DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS. The initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation immediately following the Effective Time shall be the directors of
Merger Sub, until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and
qualified. The initial officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be the
officers of Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, until their
respective successors are duly appointed.

         1.6 EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, Company or the holders
of any of the following securities:

                  (a) CONVERSION OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK. Each share of Common
Stock, $0.10 par value per share, of Company (the "COMPANY COMMON STOCK") issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than any shares
of Company Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 1.6(b), will be
canceled and extinguished and automatically converted (subject to Section
1.6(f)) into the right to receive 1.36 (the "EXCHANGE RATIO") validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock, $0.01 par value per share,
of Parent (the "PARENT COMMON STOCK") upon surrender of the certificate
representing such share of Company Common Stock in the manner provided in
Section 1.7 (or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon
delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if required) in the manner provided in
Section 1.9). If any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time are unvested or are subject to a repurchase option,
risk of forfeiture or other condition under any applicable restricted stock
purchase agreement or other agreement with the Company, then the shares of
Parent Common Stock issued in exchange for such shares of Company Common Stock
will




                                      -2-
<PAGE>   8

also be unvested and/or subject to the same repurchase option, risk of
forfeiture or other condition, and the certificates representing such shares of
Parent Common Stock may accordingly be marked with appropriate legends. Company
shall take all action that may be necessary to ensure that, from and after the
Effective Time, Parent is entitled to exercise any such repurchase option or
other right set forth in any such restricted stock purchase agreement or other
agreement.

                  (b) CANCELLATION OF PARENT-OWNED AND COMPANY-HELD STOCK. Each
share of Company Common Stock held by Company or owned by Merger Sub, Parent or
any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Company or of Parent
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished
without any conversion thereof.

                  (c) STOCK OPTIONS; EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLANS. At the
Effective Time, all options to purchase Company Common Stock then outstanding
under Company's 1994 Stock Incentive Plan, 2000 Stock Incentive Plan and
Directors Deferred Compensation Plan (collectively, the "COMPANY STOCK OPTION
PLANS") shall be assumed by Parent in accordance with Section 5.8 hereof. Rights
outstanding under Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan shall be treated as set
forth in Section 5.8.

                  (d) CAPITAL STOCK OF MERGER SUB. Each share of Common Stock,
$0.001 par value per share, of Merger Sub (the "MERGER SUB COMMON STOCK") issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of Common Stock, $0.001
par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation. Each certificate evidencing
ownership of shares of Merger Sub Common Stock shall evidence ownership of such
shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

                  (e) ADJUSTMENTS TO EXCHANGE RATIO. The Exchange Ratio shall be
adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of any stock split, reverse stock
split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock), reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification or other like change with respect to Parent
Common Stock or Company Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and
prior to the Effective Time.

                  (f) FRACTIONAL SHARES. No fraction of a share of Parent Common
Stock will be issued by virtue of the Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder of
shares of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of
a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock that otherwise would be received by such holder) shall
receive from Parent an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent) equal
to the product obtained by multiplying (i) such fraction, by (ii) the average of
the closing price of Parent Common Stock on the Nasdaq National Market
("NASDAQ") for the five trading days immediately preceding the trading day on
which the Effective Time occurs.

         1.7 SURRENDER OF CERTIFICATES.

                  (a) Exchange Agent. Parent shall designate Wells Fargo
Shareowner Services, the transfer agent for Parent's Common Stock, to act as the
exchange agent (the "EXCHANGE AGENT") in the Merger.




                                      -3-
<PAGE>   9

                  (b) PARENT TO PROVIDE COMMON STOCK. Promptly after the
Effective Time, Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent for exchange
in accordance with this Article I, the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
pursuant to Section 1.6 in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock, and cash in an amount sufficient for payment in lieu of fractional shares
pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or distributions to which holders
of shares of Company Common Stock may be entitled pursuant to Section 1.7(d).

                  (c) EXCHANGE PROCEDURES. Promptly after the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of
the Effective Time) of a certificate or certificates (the "CERTIFICATES"), which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock whose shares were converted into the right to receive
shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.6, cash in lieu of any
fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or other
distributions pursuant to Section 1.7(d), (i) a letter of transmittal in
customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent and containing such other provisions as
Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing shares
of Parent Common Stock, cash in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to
Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section
1.7(d). Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or
to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor certificates representing the number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has a right to receive pursuant
to Section 1.6(a), payment in lieu of fractional shares which such holders have
the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or
distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.7(d), and the Certificates so

purposes, subject to Section 1.7(d) as to the payment of dividends or other
distributions, to evidence only the right to receive the number of full shares
of Parent Common Stock issuable in exchange for such shares of Company Common
Stock pursuant to Section 1.6(a) and the right to receive an amount in cash in
lieu of the issuance of any fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.6(f)

dividends or other distributions declared or made after the date of this
Agreement with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the
Effective Time will be paid to the holders of any unsurrendered Certificates
with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in exchange therefor
until the holders of record of such Certificates shall surrender such
Certificates. Subject to applicable law, following surrender of any such
Certificates, the Exchange Agent shall deliver to the record holders thereof,
without interest, certificates representing the number of whole shares of Parent
Common Stock issued in exchange therefor along with payment in lieu of

                  (e) TRANSFERS OF OWNERSHIP. If certificates representing
shares of Parent Common Stock are to be issued in a name other than that in
which the Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor are registered, it will
be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificates so

surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer
and that the persons requesting such exchange will have paid to Parent or any
agent designated by it any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
issuance of certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock in any name
other than that of the registered holder of the Certificates surrendered, or
established to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by
it that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

                  (f) REQUIRED WITHHOLDING. Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent,
and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder or former holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as may be required
to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or under any provision of
state, local or foreign tax law or under any other applicable legal requirement.
To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the person
to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

                  (g) NO LIABILITY. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Section 1.7, neither the Exchange Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation
nor any party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Parent Common
Stock or Company Common Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

         1.8 NO FURTHER OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN COMPANY COMMON STOCK. All shares of
Parent Common Stock issued in accordance with the terms hereof (including any
cash paid in respect thereof pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and 1.7(d)) shall be
deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock. At the Effective Time: (i)
all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled and retired and cease to exist,
and all holders of Certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights as stockholders of Company other than the rights expressly provided in
this Agreement and (ii) there shall be no further registration of transfers on
the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock which
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If after the Effective
Time Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason,
they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article I.

         1.9 LOST, STOLEN OR DESTROYED CERTIFICATES. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, certificates
representing the shares of Parent Common Stock into which the shares of Company
Common Stock represented by such Certificates were converted pursuant to Section
1.6, cash for fractional shares, if any, as may be required pursuant to Section
1.6(f) and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.7(d);
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the issuance of such certificates representing shares of Parent
Common Stock, cash and other distributions, require the owner of such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may
reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent with respect to the
Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

         5.2 MEETINGS OF COMPANY STOCKHOLDERS AND PARENT STOCKHOLDERS.

                  (a) COMPANY STOCKHOLDERS' MEETING.

                           (i) Promptly after the date hereof, Company will take
all action necessary in accordance with the DGCL and its Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws to convene the Company Stockholders' Meeting to be held
as promptly as practicable, and in any event (to the extent permissible under
applicable law and Company's Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws) within 45
days after the declaration of effectiveness of the S-4, for the purpose of
voting upon this Agreement and the Merger. Subject to Section 5.2(a)(iii),
Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to solicit from its
stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption and approval of this Agreement and
the approval of the Merger and will take all other action necessary or advisable
to secure the vote or consent of its stockholders required by the rules of the
NYSE or the DGCL to obtain such approvals ("COMPANY STOCKHOLDER VOTE"). Company
shall ensure that the Company Stockholders' Meeting is called, noticed,
convened, held and conducted, and subject to Section 5.2(a)(iii), that all
proxies solicited by Company in connection with the Company Stockholders'
Meeting are solicited, in compliance with the DGCL, its Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws, the rules of the NYSE and all other applicable legal
requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders' Meeting to
the extent necessary to ensure that any necessary supplement or amendment to the
Joint Prospectus/Proxy Statement is provided to Company's stockholders in
advance of a vote on the Merger and this Agreement or if as of the time for
which Company Stockholders' Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the
Joint Prospectus/Proxy Statement) there are insufficient shares of Company
Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholders' Meeting.

                           (ii) Subject to Section 5.4: (A) the Board of
Directors of Company shall recommend that Company's stockholders vote in favor
of and adopt and approve this Agreement and the Merger at the Company
Stockholders' Meeting; (B) the Joint Prospectus/Proxy Statement shall include a
statement to the effect that the Board of Directors of Company has recommended
that Company's stockholders vote in favor of and adopt and approve this
Agreement and the Merger at




                                      -41-
<PAGE>   47

the Company Stockholders' Meeting; and (C) neither the Board of Directors of
Company nor any committee thereof shall withdraw, amend or modify, or propose or
resolve to withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, the
recommendation of the Board of Directors of Company that Company's stockholders
vote in favor of and adopt and approve this Agreement and the Merger.

                           (iii) Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the
Board of Directors of Company from withholding, withdrawing, amending or
modifying its recommendation in favor of the Merger, ceasing to solicit from its
stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption and approval of this Agreement and
the approval of the Merger, or from endorsing or recommending to its
stockholders a Superior Offer (as defined below) if (A) a Superior Offer is made
to Company and is not withdrawn, (B) Company shall have not violated any of the
restrictions set forth in Section 5.4, (C) the Board of Directors of Company
concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that, in
light of such Superior Offer, the failure to withhold, withdraw, amend or modify
its recommendation, ceasing to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of
the adoption and approval of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger,
would result in a reasonable likelihood that the Board of Directors of Company
would not fulfill its fiduciary duties to the Company's stockholders under
Delaware Law and (D) the Company provides Parent with two (2) business days
prior written notice of its intent to approve, endorse or recommend any Superior
Offer, such notice to include the material terms and conditions of such Superior
Offer and the identity of the person or group making any such Superior Offer.
For purposes of this Agreement "SUPERIOR OFFER" shall mean an unsolicited, bona
fide offer made by a third party to consummate any of the following
transactions: (x) a sale or other disposition by Company of all or substantially
all of its assets or (y) the acquisition by any person or group (including by
way of a merger, tender offer or an exchange offer or issuance by Company),
directly or indirectly, of beneficial ownership or a right to acquire beneficial
ownership of shares representing a majority of the voting power of the then
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, on terms that the Board of Directors
of Company determines, in good faith, after consultation with the Company
Financial Advisor, to be more favorable to Company stockholders than the terms
of the Merger; provided, however, that any such offer shall not be deemed to be
a Superior Offer if any financing required to consummate the transaction
contemplated by such offer is not committed or is not likely in the reasonable
judgment of Company's Board of Directors after consultation with the Company
Financial Advisor to be obtained by such third party on a timely basis.

                  (b) PARENT STOCKHOLDERS' MEETING.

                           (i) Promptly after the date hereof, Parent will take
all action necessary in accordance with the DGCL and its Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws to convene the Parent Stockholders' Meeting to be held
as promptly as practicable, and in any event (to the extent permissible under
applicable law and Parent's Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws) within 45
days after the declaration of effectiveness of the S-4, for the purpose of
voting upon this Agreement, the Merger, the change of Parent's name and the
issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock as pursuant to the Merger
(collectively, the "PARENT STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS"). Parent will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in
favor of the Parent Stockholder Proposals and will take all other action
necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of its stockholders
required by the rules of Nasdaq or Delaware Law to obtain such approval ("PARENT
STOCKHOLDER VOTE"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, Parent may adjourn or postpone the Parent Stockholders' Meeting to
the extent




                                      -42-
<PAGE>   48

necessary to ensure that any necessary supplement or amendment to the
Joint Prospectus/Proxy Statement is provided to Parent's stockholders in advance
of a vote on the Parent Stockholder Proposals or, if as of the time for which
Parent Stockholders' Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Joint
Prospectus/Proxy Statement) there are insufficient shares of Parent Common Stock
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to
conduct the business of the Parent Stockholders' Meeting. Parent shall ensure
that the Parent Stockholders' Meeting is called, noticed, convened, held and
conducted, and that all proxies solicited by Parent in connection with the
Parent Stockholders' Meeting are solicited, in compliance with Delaware Law, its
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, the rules of Nasdaq and all other
applicable legal requirements.

                           (ii) The Board of Directors of Parent shall recommend
that Parent's stockholders vote in favor of and adopt and approve the Parent
Stockholder Proposals at the Parent Stockholders' Meeting; (B) the Joint
Prospectus/Proxy Statement shall include a statement to the effect that the
Board of Directors of Parent has recommended that Parent's stockholders vote in
favor of and adopt and approve the Parent Stockholder Proposals at the Parent
Stockholders' Meeting; and (C) neither the Board of Directors of Parent nor any
committee thereof shall withdraw, amend or modify, or propose or resolve to
withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to Company, the recommendation of
the Board of Directors of Parent that Parent's stockholders vote in favor of and
adopt and approve the Parent Stockholder Proposals.

         5.3 NON-DISCLOSURE; ACCESS TO INFORMATION.

                  (a) The parties acknowledge that Company and Parent have
previously executed a Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement, dated as of June 12, 2001
(the "NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT"), which Non-Disclosure Agreement will continue
in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

                  (b) ACCESS TO INFORMATION.

                           (i) COMPANY. Company will afford Parent and its
accountants, counsel and other representatives reasonable access during normal
business hours to the properties, books, records and personnel of Company during
the period prior to the Effective Time to obtain all information concerning the
business, including the status of product development efforts, properties,
results of operations and personnel of Company, as Parent may reasonably
request. Parent and its agents and representatives shall have access during
normal business hours to the Company's facilities for the purpose of performing
such environmental testing and investigations (including, without limitation,
sampling of subsurface soils and groundwater) that Parent, in its sole
discretion, deems necessary (such testing and investigation, whenever performed,
referred to as an "ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW") at any time prior to the Closing;
provided, however, that Parent shall not unreasonably interfere with the
operations of the Company during the performance of the Environmental Reviews.

                           (ii) PARENT. Parent will afford Company and its
accountants, counsel and other representatives reasonable access upon reasonable
notice during normal business hours to the properties, books, records and
personnel of Parent during the period prior to the Effective Time to obtain all
information concerning the business, including the status of product development
efforts, properties, results of operations and personnel of Parent, as Company
may reasonably request.




                                      -43-
<PAGE>   49

Company and its agents and representatives shall have access during normal
business hours to the Parent's facilities for the purpose of performing
Environmental Reviews at any time prior to the Closing; provided, however, that
Company shall not unreasonably interfere with the operations of the Parent
during the performance of the Environmental Reviews.

                           (iii) No information or knowledge obtained by Parent
or Company in any investigation pursuant to this Section 5.3 will affect or be
deemed to modify any representation or warranty contained herein or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the Merger.

         5.4 NO SOLICITATION.

                  (a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time or termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VII, Company
and its subsidiaries will not, nor will they authorize or knowingly permit any
of their respective officers, directors, or affiliates or any investment banker,
attorney or auditor retained by any of them to, directly or indirectly, (i)
solicit, initiate, encourage or knowingly induce the making, submission or
announcement of any Acquisition Proposal (as hereinafter defined), (ii)
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
person any non-public information with respect to, or take any other action to
facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes or would
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) subject to
Section 5.2(a)(iii), approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal or
(iv) enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any contract,
agreement or commitment contemplating or otherwise relating to any Acquisition
Transaction; provided, however, that prior to the approval of this Agreement by
the required Company Stockholder Vote, this Agreement shall not prohibit Company
from (A) furnishing nonpublic information regarding Company and its subsidiaries
to, entering into a confidentiality agreement with or entering into discussions
or negotiations with, any person or group in response to a Superior Offer
submitted by such person or group (and not withdrawn) if (1) Company and its
subsidiaries shall not have violated any of the restrictions set forth in this
Section 5.4, (2) the Board of Directors of Company concludes in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such
action will result in a reasonable likelihood that the Company's Board of
Directors will not fulfill its fiduciary obligations to the Company's
stockholders under Delaware Law, (3) prior to furnishing any such nonpublic
information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, such person
or group, Company gives Parent two (2) business days prior written notice of the
identity of such person or group and of Company's intention to furnish nonpublic
information to, or enter into discussions or negotiations with, such person or
group and Company receives from such person or group an executed confidentiality
agreement containing customary limitations on the use and disclosure of all
nonpublic written and oral information furnished to such person or group by or
on behalf of Company that is no more favorable to such person or group than the
Non-Disclosure Agreement is to Parent (provided that any such confidentiality
agreement need not contain restrictions of the nature set forth in Section 7
thereof), and (4) contemporaneously with furnishing any such nonpublic
information to such person or group, Company furnishes such nonpublic
information to Parent (to the extent such nonpublic information has not been
previously furnished by Company to Parent) or (B) complying with Rules 14d-9 and
14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act or other applicable law with regard to
an Acquisition Proposal, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that unless the conditions set forth
in clauses (A) through (C) of the first sentence of Section 5.2(a)(iii) are
satisfied, the Company's Board of Directors may not withhold, withdraw,




                                      -44-
<PAGE>   50

modify or change in a manner adverse to Parent, or fail to make, any of its
recommendations in connection with this Agreement and the Merger, or approve,
endorse or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal. The Company also will promptly
request each Person that has executed a confidentiality agreement in connection
with its consideration of an Acquisition Proposal to return all confidential
information heretofore furnished to such person by or on behalf of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries. Company and its subsidiaries will immediately cease
any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties
conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. Without limiting
the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth
in this Section 5.4 by any officer, director or affiliate of Company or any of
its subsidiaries or any investment banker, attorney or auditor of Company or any
of its subsidiaries that results in a Superior Offer shall be deemed to be a
breach of this Section 5.4 by Company. In addition to the foregoing, Company
shall provide Parent with at least two (2) business days prior notice of any
meeting of Company's Board of Directors at which Company's Board of Directors is
reasonably expected to consider a Superior Offer.

                  For purposes of this Agreement, "ACQUISITION PROPOSAL" shall
mean any inquiry, offer or proposal (other than an inquiry, offer or proposal by
Parent) relating to any Acquisition Transaction. For the purposes of this
Agreement, "ACQUISITION TRANSACTION" shall mean any transaction or series of
related transactions other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
involving: (A) any acquisition or purchase from Company by any person or "group"
(as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder) of more than a 15% interest in the total outstanding
voting securities of Company or any of its subsidiaries or any tender offer or
exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person or "group" (as
defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder) beneficially owning 15% or more of the total outstanding voting
securities of Company or any of its subsidiaries or any merger, consolidation,
business combination or similar transaction involving Company pursuant to which
the stockholders of Company immediately preceding such transaction hold less
than 85% of the equity interests in the surviving or resulting entity of such
transaction; (B) any sale, lease (other than in the ordinary course of
business), exchange, transfer, license (other than in the ordinary course of
business), acquisition or disposition of more than 50% of the assets of Company;
or (C) any liquidation or dissolution of Company.

                  (b) In addition to the obligations of Company set forth in
paragraph (a) of this Section 5.4, Company as promptly as practicable, and in
any event within two (2) business days, shall advise Parent in writing of any
request for non-public information which Company reasonably believes would lead
to an Acquisition Proposal or of any Acquisition Proposal, the material terms
and conditions of such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry and the identity
of the person or group making any such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry.
Company will keep Parent informed in all material respects of the status and
details (including material amendments or proposed amendments) of any such
request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry.

         5.5 PUBLIC DISCLOSURE. Parent and Company will consult with each other,
and to the extent practicable, agree, before issuing any press release or
otherwise making any public statement with respect to the Merger and this
Agreement and will not issue any such press release or make any such public
statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by law or any
listing agreement with a national securities exchange, the NYSE (in the case of
Company) or Nasdaq (in the case of Parent).

         5.6 REASONABLE EFFORTS; NOTIFICATION.

                  (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use all commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including using reasonable efforts to accomplish
the following: (i) the taking of all reasonable acts necessary to cause the
conditions precedent set forth in Article VI to be satisfied, (ii) the obtaining
of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, approvals, orders and
authorizations from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary
registrations, declarations and filings (including registrations, declarations
and filings with Governmental Entities, if any) and the taking of all reasonable
steps as may be necessary to avoid any suit, claim, action, investigation or
proceeding by any Governmental Entity, (iii) the obtaining of all necessary
consents, approvals or waivers from third parties, (iv) the defending of any
suits, claims, actions, investigations or proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including seeking to have any stay or
temporary restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental Entity
vacated or reversed and (v) the execution or delivery of any additional
instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to
fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement. In connection with and without
limiting the foregoing, Company and its Board of Directors shall, if any state
takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to
the Merger, this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, use all reasonable efforts to ensure that the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the Merger, this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to require Parent or Company
or any subsidiary or affiliate thereof to agree to any divestiture by itself or
any of its affiliates of shares of capital stock or of any business, assets or
property, or the imposition of any material limitation on the ability of any of
them to conduct their businesses or to own or exercise control of such assets,
properties and stock.

                  (b) Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any
representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement becoming
untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or any failure of Company to
comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement, in each
case, such that the conditions set forth in Section 6.3(a) or 6.3(b) could not
be satisfied, provided, however, that no such notification shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

                  (c) Parent shall give prompt notice to Company of any
representation or warranty made by it or Merger Sub contained in this Agreement
becoming untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or any failure of Parent
or Merger Sub to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this
Agreement, in each case, such that the conditions set forth in Section 6.2(a) or

                                      -46-

covenants or agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of
the parties under this Agreement.

         5.7 THIRD PARTY CONSENTS. As soon as practicable following the date
hereof, Parent and Company will each use all commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain any consents, waivers and approvals under any of its or its subsidiaries'
respective agreements, contracts, licenses or leases required to be obtained in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or
necessary to enable the Surviving Corporation to conduct and operate the
business of Company and its subsidiaries substantially as presently conducted.

         5.8 STOCK OPTIONS, COMPANY ESPP AND BENEFIT PLANS.

                  (a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase
shares of Company Common Stock under Company's Stock Option Plans, whether or
not exercisable and whether or not vested, shall by virtue of the Merger and
without any further action on the part of Company or the holder thereof, be
assumed by Parent, all outstanding options under the Company Stock Option Plans
(each a "COMPANY STOCK OPTION" and collectively the "COMPANY STOCK OPTIONS"),
whether or not exercisable and whether or not vested, shall, and without any
further action on the part of the Company or the holder thereof, be assumed by
Parent, in such manner (with respect to all such option assumptions) that Parent
(i) is "assuming a stock option in a transaction to which Section 424(a)
applied" within the meaning of Section 424(a) of the Code, or (ii) to the extent
that Section 424 of the Code does not apply to any such Company Stock Options,
would be a transaction within Section 424 of the Code. Each Company Stock Option
so assumed by Parent under this Agreement will continue to have, and be subject
to, the same terms and conditions set forth in the applicable Company Stock
Option Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time (including, without
limitation, any repurchase rights or vesting provisions), except that (1) each
Company Stock Option will be exercisable (or will become exercisable in
accordance with its terms) for the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock
equal to the product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were
issuable upon exercise of such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest
whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock and (2) the per share exercise
price for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such
assumed Company Stock Option will be equal to the quotient determined by
dividing the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock at which such
Company Stock Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by
the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent.

                  (b) It is intended that Company Stock Options assumed by
Parent shall qualify following the Effective Time as incentive stock options as
defined in Section 422 of the Code to the extent such Company Stock Options
qualified as incentive stock options immediately prior to the Effective Time and
the provisions of this Section 5.8 shall be applied consistent with such intent.

                  (c) Company shall take actions as are necessary to cause the
"Purchase Date" (as such term is used in the Company ESPP) applicable to the
then current Offering (as such term is used in the Company ESPP) to be the last
trading day on which the Company Common Stock is traded on the NYSE immediately
prior to the Effective Time (the "FINAL COMPANY PURCHASE DATE"); provided, that
such change in the Purchase Date shall be conditioned upon the consummation of
the Merger. On the Final Company Purchase Date, Company shall apply the funds




                                      -47-
<PAGE>   53

credited as of such date under the Company ESPP within each participant's
payroll withholding account to the purchase of whole shares of Company Common
Stock in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP. Any such shares
purchased under the Company ESPP shall be automatically converted on the same
basis as all other shares of Company Common Stock (other than shares canceled
pursuant to Section 1.6(b)), except that such shares shall be converted
automatically into shares of Parent Common Stock without the issuance of
certificates representing issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
to the Company ESPP participants.

                  (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
Company shall not incur any obligations under the Company ESPP after the Final
Company Purchase Date and the Company shall take any steps necessary to
terminate the Company ESPP on the Final Company Purchase Date immediately after
effecting the transactions described in Section 5.8(c).

         5.9 FORM S-8. Parent agrees to file a registration statement on Form
S-8 for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to assumed
Company Stock Options as to which Form S-8 is available within ten (10) business
days following the Effective Time and to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement thereafter for so long as any of such options or other
rights remain outstanding.

         5.10 INDEMNIFICATION.

                  (a) Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to fulfill and
honor in all respects the obligations of Company pursuant to any indemnification
agreements between Company and its present and former directors, officers,
employees and agents in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (the
"INDEMNIFIED Parties") and any indemnification provisions under Company's
Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws as in effect on the date hereof. The
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation will
contain provisions with respect to exculpation and indemnification that are at
least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as those contained in the
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of Company as in effect on the date
hereof, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for
a period of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of individuals who, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, were directors, officers, employees or agents of Company, unless
such modification is required by law.

                  (b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time,
Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect the current
policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by the
Company and its subsidiaries (provided that such policy shall during such period
cover only acts of Company's directors and officers occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time and not thereafter). Parent may substitute therefor policies of
substantially similar coverage containing terms and conditions that are not less
advantageous, in all material respects to the Indemnified Parties; provided,
however, that in no event will Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required
to expend in excess of 125% of the annual premium currently paid by Company for
such coverage (or, alternatively, shall obtain such coverage as is available for
125% of such annual premium).

                  (c) The provisions of this Section 5.10 are intended to be in
addition to the rights otherwise available to the Indemnified Parties by law,
charter, statute, bylaw, resolution of the Board




                                      -48-
<PAGE>   54

of Directors of Company or agreement, and shall operate for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their heirs and their
representatives.

                  5.11 NASDAQ LISTING. Parent agrees to authorize for listing on
Nasdaq the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable, and those required to be
reserved for issuance, in connection with the Merger, upon official notice of
issuance.

                  5.12 COMPANY AFFILIATE RESTRICTIONS. Set forth in the Company
Disclosure Schedule is a list of those persons who may be deemed to be, in
Company's reasonable judgement, affiliates of Company (each a "COMPANY
AFFILIATE"), as such term is defined in paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145
promulgated by the Securities Act. Company will provide Parent with such
information and documents as Parent reasonably requests for purposes of
reviewing and validating such list. Parent will be entitled to place appropriate
legends referring to SEC Rule 145 on the certificates evidencing any Parent
Common Stock to be received by a Company Affiliate pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, and to issue appropriate stop transfer instructions to the transfer
agent for the Parent Common Stock, consistent with the provisions of Rule 145.

                  5.13 REGULATORY FILINGS; REASONABLE EFFORTS. As soon as may be
reasonably practicable, Company and Parent each shall file with the United
States Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the Antitrust Division of the
United States Department of Justice ("DOJ") Notification and Report Forms
relating to the transactions contemplated herein as required by the HSR Act, as
well as comparable pre-merger notification forms required by the merger
notification or control laws and regulations of any applicable jurisdiction, as
agreed to by the parties in the exercise of reasonable business judgment and
with the advice of counsel. Company and Parent each shall (a) cooperate and
coordinate with one another in the making of such Filings, (b) promptly supply
the other with any information which may be required in order to effectuate such
filings and (c) promptly supply any additional information which reasonably may
be required by the FTC, the DOJ or the competition or merger control authorities
of any other jurisdiction and which the parties may reasonably deem appropriate.

                  5.14 COMPANY REPRESENTATIVES ON PARENT BOARD OF DIRECTORS. At
the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of Parent shall amend its bylaws to
increase the size of its Board of Directors from seven (7) to ten (10) persons
and shall appoint three (3) representatives of Company (the "COMPANY DIRECTORS")
to fill such vacancies. Each Company Director who is not an employee of Parent
or one of its subsidiaries shall be entitled to participate in the compensation
and benefits plans to the same extent as other nonemployee directors of Parent
and shall become a party to an indemnification agreement with Parent that is
substantially similar to the indemnification agreements between Parent and its
nonemployee directors who were not formerly directors of the Company. Parent
shall nominate the Company Directors for election as members of the Parent's
Board of Directors at Parent's 2002, 2003 and 2004 annual meetings of
stockholders, provided that the Company Directors are willing to be so nominated
and, in the case of Company directors standing for re-election, shall have
average board meeting attendance for the prior year at least equal to the
average meeting attendance for the prior year of all Parent's other directors as
a group.

of $3.0 million (the "EXPENSE FEE") in the event this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(i) as a result of the failure to receive the Company
Stockholder Vote if the Parent Stockholder vote has been obtained. The Expense
Fee will, to the extent paid by the Company or on its behalf, be credited
against the Termination Fee, if any, payable under Section 7.3(b).

                           (ii) Parent shall pay Company the Expense Fee in the
event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii) as a result of
the failure to receive the Parent Stockholder Vote if (A) the Company

this Section 7.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other party would not enter

amounts due pursuant to this Section 7.3, and, in order to obtain such payment,
the other party commences a suit which results in a judgment against such party
for the amounts set forth in this Section 7.3, such party shall pay to the other
party its reasonable costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses)
in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts set forth in
this Section 7.3 at the prime rate of Bank of America N.A. in effect on the date

7.3 shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by the party to whom such fees are payable.

                  (f) Payment of the fees and expenses described in Sections

the words "INCLUDE," "INCLUDES" and "INCLUDING" when used herein shall be deemed
in each case to be followed by the words "without limitation" except when

from action taken by a party in connection with fulfilling its obligations
hereunder. For purposes of this condition, changes in the trading price of the
Parent Common Stock, as reported by Nasdaq, or the Company Common Stock, as

the parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that all
parties need not sign the same counterpart.

         8.5 ENTIRE AGREEMENT; THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES. This Agreement and the
documents and instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto as
contemplated by or referred to herein, including Company Disclosure Schedule and
the Parent Disclosure Schedule (a) constitute the entire agreement among the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with

intended to confer upon any other person any rights or remedies hereunder,
except as expressly and specifically provided herein.

         8.6 SEVERABILITY. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or
the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably
to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further agree to replace
such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and
enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic,
business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

         8.7 OTHER REMEDIES; SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE. Except as otherwise provided
herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be
deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby,
or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one
remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto
agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions
hereof in any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity.

         8.8 GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that
might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law thereof;
provided that issues involving the corporate governance of any of the parties
hereto shall be governed by their respective jurisdictions of incorporation.
Each of the parties hereto irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of
any state or federal court within the State of Delaware, in connection with any
matter based upon or arising out of this Agreement or the matters contemplated
herein, agrees that process may be served upon them in any manner authorized by
the laws of the State of Delaware for such persons and

otherwise have to such jurisdiction and such process.

represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefore, waive the application of any law, regulation, holding or rule of
construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will
be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.

         8.10 ASSIGNMENT. No party may assign either this Agreement or any of
its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written
approval of the other parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and
their respective successors and permitted assigns.
