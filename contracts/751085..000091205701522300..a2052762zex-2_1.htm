Closing Working Capital is less than the Closing Working Capital Target. If the Closing Working Capital is determined to be greater than the Closing Working Capital Target, there will be a

Capital Target. In addition, there will be a dollar-for-dollar downward adjustment of the Purchase Price in the amount of the principal and accrued interest of the Assumed Debt

Closing Date to the date of payment at a rate per annum equal to the prime rate charged by Bank of America in effect on the closing Date, will be paid within two Business Days of the determination of

Competitive Business of such Person is sold or otherwise disposed of or discontinued within the year following such acquisition. In addition, nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit Seller from

Buyer is indemnified in respect thereof as an Excluded Liability. MagneTek agrees to keep Buyer reasonably informed on an ongoing basis as to material developments in the defense or prosecution of the
litigation matters described on Schedule&nbsp;3.12. MagneTek will have the right to control such litigation and the settlement, if any, of such litigation, but except as set forth in this

his successors or assigns in the Nilssen Litigation raising substantively the same claims as made in the Nilssen Litigation in respect of products sold by Buyer after the Closing Date that have not
been modified by Buyer from those sold by Seller prior to the Closing Date except in a way that would not adversely affect the defense of an infringement claim or as required by Section&nbsp;5.4(c)
(the "Covered Products") and (ii)&nbsp;Losses of Buyer arising out of any injunction that may be issued as a result of the Nilssen Litigation or any other such above-described litigation that is
filed against Buyer by Nilssen after the Closing in respect of such products; provided, however, that Seller will not have an obligation to indemnify Buyer for Losses arising from an
injunction to the extent Buyer could have avoided such Losses by complying with Section&nbsp;5.4(c) and failed to do so. Buyer shall cooperate with MagneTek in MagneTek's defense of the Nilssen
Litigation and will provide MagneTek with any needed Records as provided in Section&nbsp;7.6. Buyer will, at MagneTek's expense (limited, however, to Buyer's reasonable
out-of-pocket expenditures with regard to any employee travel or lodging expenses), cooperate with MagneTek in furnishing information, evidence and testimony, making employees
available for such purposes and providing other reasonable assistance in connection with the Nilssen Litigation. Schedule&nbsp;5.4(b) contains a list of Transferred Employees who may be called as
witnesses in the Nilssen Litigation, and Buyer agrees to provide written notice to MagneTek in the event any such person terminates or notifies Buyer that he or she intends to terminate his or her
employment with Buyer. </FONT></P>

sold prior to such settlement. Buyer further agrees that upon written notice from MagneTek that is accompanied by a written opinion of its patent counsel reasonably acceptable to Buyer that the
product as proposed to be modified and redesigned does not infringe any existing patent, including those patents alleged to have been infringed in the Nilssen Litigation, given no sooner than six

MagneTek will also reimburse Buyer for the costs, if any, incurred by Buyer commencing production of such modified products (including retooling costs) based on reasonable documentation of such costs.
