For purposes of preparing the Closing Balance Sheet, Buyer and its accountants shall have access to MagneTek\'s Records relating to the Division or otherwise relevant to the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet, and MagneTek shall make the appropriate personnel reasonably available to and shall respond to appropriate inquiries from the Buyer and its accountants. During the 30 days immediately following MagneTek\'s receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet, MagneTek shall be entitled to review the Closing Balance Sheet and Buyer\'s working papers relating to the Closing Balance Sheet, and Buyer shall provide MagneTek reasonable access to its personnel, properties and Records (to the extent comprising Assets) for such purpose. The Closing Balance Sheet shall become final and binding upon the parties on the thirtieth day following delivery thereof unless MagneTek gives written notice to Buyer of its disagreement with the method of presentation thereof or with the determination of any amount thereon (a "Notice of Disagreement") prior to such date. Any Notice of Disagreement shall specify in reasonable detail the nature of any 

  

    

 disagreement so asserted. If a timely Notice of Disagreement is received by
Buyer with respect to the Closing Balance Sheet, then such Closing Balance
Sheet (as revised in accordance with clause (x) or (y) below), shall become
final and binding upon the parties on the earlier of (x) the date the parties
resolve in writing any differences they have with respect to any matter
specified in a Notice of Disagreement or (y) the date any matters properly in
dispute are finally resolved in writing by the Accounting Firm (as defined
below). During the 30 days immediately following the delivery of any Notice
of Disagreement, MagneTek and Buyer shall seek in good faith to resolve in
writing any differences, which they may have with respect to any matter
specified in such Notice of Disagreement. During such period and during any
subsequent period of arbitration by the Accounting Firm, MagneTek shall have
access to Buyer\'s working papers relating to the Closing Balance Sheet and
to Buyer\'s Records to the extent comprising Assets, and Buyer shall have
access to MagneTek\'s working papers relating to the Notice of Disagreement
and to MagneTek\'s Records related to the Division or otherwise relevant to
the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet. At the end of such 30-day period
(or such longer period on which MagneTek and Buyer may from time to time
agree in writing), MagneTek and Buyer shall submit to an independent
accounting firm (the "Accounting Firm") for review and resolution any and all
matters that remain in dispute and which were properly included in any Notice
of Disagreement, and the Accounting Firm shall reach a final, binding
resolution of all matters which remain in dispute. The Closing Balance Sheet,
adjusted in accordance with the parties\' mutual written agreement, and with
such adjustments necessary to reflect the Accounting Firm\'s resolution of the
matters in dispute, shall become final and binding on the parties on the date
the Accounting Firm delivers its final resolution to the parties. The
Accounting Firm shall be a nationally-recognized independent accounting firm
mutually agreed upon by the parties hereto in writing, provided that in the
event that the parties are unable to agree on such a firm, they shall each
select an accounting firm and those two accounting firms shall select a third
accounting firm which has no present or past experience with either party and
such accounting firm shall be the Accounting Firm. The cost of any arbitration
(including the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm) pursuant to this
Article II shall be borne 50% by Buyer and 50% by MagneTek.

   

 (b) If the current assets minus the current liabilities, each as reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet ("Closing Working Capital") is determined to be less than the Closing Working Capital Target, there will be a dollar-for-dollar downward adjustment of the Purchase Price, with Seller being obligated to pay Buyer the sum by which the Closing Working Capital is less than the Closing Working Capital Target. If the Closing Working Capital is determined to be greater than the Closing Working Capital Target, there will be a dollar-for-dollar upward adjustment of the Purchase Price, with Buyer being obligated to pay Seller any sum by which the Closing Working Capital exceeds the Closing Working Capital Target. In addition, there will be a dollar-for-dollar downward adjustment of the Purchase Price in the amount of the principal and accrued interest of the Assumed Debt as of the Closing Date. For avoidance of doubt, all cash held by the Companies on the Closing Date will be included in the current assets for the purposes of determining Closing Working Capital. Finally, the Purchase Price shall also be subject to adjustment after the Closing Date on account of the proration of water, electricity, gas, sewage and other utility charges and sale and property taxes applicable to the U.S. Business if and only to the extent such amounts are not already reflected in the adjustment resulting from the difference between the Closing Working Capital and the Closing Working Capital Target. If the Purchase Price is subject to adjustment pursuant to this Section 2.1(b), the required adjustment, together with interest on the amount being paid from the Closing Date to the date of payment at a rate per annum equal to the prime rate charged by Bank of America in effect on the closing Date, will be paid within two Business Days of the determination of the amount due. Either party may, in its discretion, make a payment pursuant to this Section 2.1(b) prior to the final determination of the Closing Balance Sheet for the purpose of reducing the interest it may be obligated to pay pursuant to such provision. 

  

    

  (c) The Closing Balance Sheet, including the reserves for inventory,
warranty, accounts receivable and bad debt, shall be prepared in accordance
with GAAP (except as set forth in Section 3.4(b)), applied in a manner
consistent with that followed in the preparation of the Financial Statements
(as defined in Section 3.4), an example of which is reflected in the August
Balance Sheet.

  

 (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.1, no adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to this Section 2.1 shall be made unless such adjustment would exceed $100,000, then the full amount of the adjustment shall be made. 

  

 (e) Buyer agrees that it will not take any actions with respect to its accounting books, Records, policies and procedures of the Division which would impede the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet on the basis provided in this Agreement. 

  

  

 2.2 _ Tax Allocation._ The parties agree that the aggregate Purchase Price shall be allocated as set forth in a certificate of Buyer delivered to Seller together with the Closing Balance Sheet. In the event that Seller disagrees with the allocation set forth in such certificate, it shall notify Buyer within fifteen (15) days of its receipt thereof, and if the parties are unable to agree on such allocation within thirty (30) days of such notice, they shall select a nationally recognized accounting firm to prepare such schedule (the cost of which shall be borne equally by Buyer and Seller). Such revised allocation shall be final and binding on the parties. Buyer and Seller shall report the purchase and sale of the Assets in accordance with the allocation (as finally determined) for all Tax purposes (including the filing of the forms prescribed under Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder). 

  

 2.3 _ Transfer Taxes._ Buyer and Seller shall cooperate in preparing, executing and filing use, sales, real estate, transfer and similar Tax Returns relating to, and at the Closing, Buyer and Seller each shall pay one-half of any and all sales, real estate, transfer, use and similar Taxes due with regard to, the purchase and sale of the Assets. To the extent such Taxes are not computed at the Closing, the parties shall each pay their respective one-half of such Taxes when they are due. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner that is consistent with the allocation of the Purchase Price and Assumed Liabilities contemplated by Section 2.2. Buyer will cooperate with Seller in providing such resale certificate as may be requested in order to comply with the requirements of applicable state taxation laws.

    adequate as of the dates thereof in all material respects. Credits or
returns (other than in the Ordinary Course which do not materially exceed the
historical amounts for returns as a percentage of sales) and rebates shall
not constitute payment of such Accounts Receivable. In determining whether
there has been any nonpayment of any such Account Receivable, all payments
received from any account debtor shall, unless otherwise specified by such
account debtor, be first applied to the oldest outstanding Account Receivable
of such account debtor until said Account Receivable of such account debtor
has been paid in full.

  

 3.23 _ Inventory._ The inventory set forth in the March Balance Sheet, in all material respects: (i) is properly stated at the lower of cost or market (cost being determined by the FIFO accounting method) and (ii) written off or reserved to the extent it is physically damaged, previously used, obsolete, discontinued or treated as excess. 

  

 3.24 _ Brokers\' Fees._ No broker, finder, or investment banker is entitled to any brokerage, finder\'s fee or commission in connection with the Transactions as a result of any actions taken by Seller except for any fees payable to ING Barings, for which Seller will be solely responsible. 

  

 3.25 _ Exclusivity of Representations._ Except as expressly provided herein, MagneTek makes no representation or warranty concerning the Assets or the U.S. Business, including as to the quality, condition, merchantability, salability, obsolescence, working order or fitness for a particular purpose thereof.

ARTICLE V 

COVENANTS OF SELLER 

  

 Seller covenants and agrees as follows: 

  

 5.1 _ Confidentiality._ On and after the Closing Date, Seller will hold, and will use its best efforts to cause its officers, directors, employees, accountants, counsel, consultants, advisors and agents ("Representatives") to hold, in confidence, unless compelled to disclose by any Requirement of Law, all confidential documents and information concerning the Business (including any confidential information or documents provided to it pursuant to Section 7.5 and any trade secrets or other proprietary information forming a part of the Intellectual Property) (the "Confidential Information"), except to the extent that such information is (a) in the public domain through no fault of Seller or any of its Representatives or (b) later lawfully acquired by Seller on a non-confidential basis from sources other than Buyer or any of its Affiliates. The obligation of Seller to hold any such information in confidence shall be satisfied if it exercises the same care with respect to such information as it would take to preserve the confidentiality of its own similar information. Nothing in the foregoing is intended to expand the covenant of Seller contained in Section 5.3, it being understood, however, that this Section 5.1 shall continue to preclude the divulgence of Confidential Information by Sellers to third parties after the expiration of the covenant contained in Section 5.3. 

       

 5.2 _ Accounts Receivable._ Seller agrees to forward to Buyer, within three Business Days after receipt thereof, any and all proceeds from Accounts Receivable that are received by Seller after the Closing Date. If, after the Closing Date, Seller receives any payment from any Person who at the time of such payment has outstanding accounts payable to Seller, on the one hand (for the purposes of this section and Section 6.2, "MagneTek Accounts Receivable") and to Buyer or a Company, on the other hand (for the purposes of this section and Section 6.2, "Buyer Accounts Receivable"), and the payment (a) does not indicate whether it is in respect of MagneTek Accounts Receivable or Buyer Accounts Receivable or (b) indicates that it is in payment of both MagneTek Accounts Receivable and Buyer Accounts Receivable without specifying the portion to be allocated to each, Seller will first contact the payor to determine the payor\'s intended allocation of the payment and such allocation will govern, and if the payor does not provide the intended allocation, then MagneTek and Buyer shall consult with one another to determine the proper allocation of such payment; and, if they are unable to reach agreement on the proper allocation, such payment shall be applied so as to retire MagneTek Accounts Receivable and Buyer Accounts Receivable in chronological order based upon the period of time such accounts receivable have existed. 

  

 5.3 _ Noncompetition._ 

  

  

 (a) Seller shall not, and shall not permit Affiliates controlled by it, from and after the Closing until the seventh anniversary (subject to Section 6.7 of the Other Agreement relating to the sale of the stock of the Mexican Companies (the "Mexican SPA")) of the Closing Date to engage, whether or not such engagement shall be as a partner, stockholder, Affiliate or other participant, in any Competitive Business. Seller hereby agrees that in connection with a sale of all or a substantial portion of the assets or capital stock of any subsidiary, Affiliate or division of MagneTek that is, prior to such divestiture, engaged in a Competitive Business, Seller will cause the purchaser in such transaction to agree to the terms of this Section 5.3; _provided, however that,_ the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that such purchaser of such entity has for at least six months prior to the date of the closing of such transaction, been engaged in the ballast business in North America. Seller hereby agrees to give notice of any such sale to Buyer reasonably promptly after consummation thereof. As used herein, "Competitive Business" shall mean the design, development, manufacture, sale, and distribution of magnetic and electronic ballasts (a) for specific types of applications currently served by the Division, including but not limited to applications for use in fluorescent, compact fluorescent, high intensity discharge (HID), sign and neon lighting products and specialty ballasts for indoor tanning and transportation applications for use in buses and subway trains and (b) for future applications in commercial building, residential building and industrial building lighting fixtures in any city or county in any state of the United States or anywhere in North America. Anything in this Section 5.3 to the contrary notwithstanding, the acquisition by any Seller of any Person, less than 10% of the gross revenues of which are derived in a Competitive Business, shall not constitute a breach of this Section 5.3 if such Competitive Business of such Person is sold or otherwise disposed of or discontinued within the year following such acquisition. In addition, nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit Seller from acquiring no more than 2%, in the case of a privately held Person, and no more than 5%, in case of a Person whose securities are actively traded in any securities market worldwide, of the securities of any class of a Person engaged in a Competitive Business. 

  

 (b) Subject to Section 6.7 of the Mexican SPA, the prohibition in Section 5.3(a) shall apply to all political subdivisions or regions in all states of the United States and all geographical areas in North America. Seller agrees that, in connection with the purchase by Buyer of the Assets (including the goodwill) of the U.S. Business, the time and geographic restrictions set forth above are reasonable. Seller agrees that the remedy at law for any breach by Seller of this Section 5.3 will be inadequate and that Buyer shall be entitled to injunctive relief. The parties intend that the unenforceability or invalidity of any term or provision of this Section 5.3 shall not render any other term or provision contained herein unenforceable or invalid. If the activities described in 

  

    

 Section 5.3(a) or the period of time or the geographical area covered by
this Section 5.3 should be deemed too extensive by a court of competent
jurisdiction, then the parties intend that this Section 5.3 be construed to
cover the maximum scope of business activities, period of time and
geographical area (not exceeding those specifically set forth herein) as may
be permissible under applicable law.

  

 (c) Seller shall not, and shall not permit Affiliates controlled by it, from and after the Closing until the second anniversary of the Closing Date induce any employee of Buyer or the Division to terminate his or her employment with Buyer. 

  

  

 5.4 _ Pending Litigation._ 

  

  

 (a) The parties agree that MagneTek will continue to defend and/or prosecute all of the litigation matters described on Schedule 3.12 at its own expense and that Buyer is indemnified in respect thereof as an Excluded Liability. MagneTek agrees to keep Buyer reasonably informed on an ongoing basis as to material developments in the defense or prosecution of the litigation matters described on Schedule 3.12. MagneTek will have the right to control such litigation and the settlement, if any, of such litigation, but except as set forth in this Section 5.4 or in Article X, will not have authority to bind Buyer in the context of any such settlement. 

  

 (b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, MagneTek will have responsibility for managing the Nilssen Litigation and will make all determinations in respect thereof. MagneTek agrees that the indemnification of Buyer in respect of the Nilssen Litigation includes (i) Losses of Buyer from litigation against Buyer after the Closing by the plaintiff or his successors or assigns in the Nilssen Litigation raising substantively the same claims as made in the Nilssen Litigation in respect of products sold by Buyer after the Closing Date that have not been modified by Buyer from those sold by Seller prior to the Closing Date except in a way that would not adversely affect the defense of an infringement claim or as required by Section 5.4(c) (the "Covered Products") and (ii) Losses of Buyer arising out of any injunction that may be issued as a result of the Nilssen Litigation or any other such above-described litigation that is filed against Buyer by Nilssen after the Closing in respect of such products; provided, however, that Seller will not have an obligation to indemnify Buyer for Losses arising from an injunction to the extent Buyer could have avoided such Losses by complying with Section 5.4(c) and failed to do so. Buyer shall cooperate with MagneTek in MagneTek\'s defense of the Nilssen Litigation and will provide MagneTek with any needed Records as provided in Section 7.6. Buyer will, at MagneTek\'s expense (limited, however, to Buyer\'s reasonable out-of-pocket expenditures with regard to any employee travel or lodging expenses), cooperate with MagneTek in furnishing information, evidence and testimony, making employees available for such purposes and providing other reasonable assistance in connection with the Nilssen Litigation. Schedule 5.4(b) contains a list of Transferred Employees who may be called as witnesses in the Nilssen Litigation, and Buyer agrees to provide written notice to MagneTek in the event any such person terminates or notifies Buyer that he or she intends to terminate his or her employment with Buyer. 

  

 (c) With respect to the Nilssen Litigation, Buyer agrees that MagneTek has the right, at any time, to enter into a settlement that includes a license of the patents in dispute in such matter in Buyer\'s favor so long as the fees payable by Buyer in such license do not exceed $.025 per unit sold and Buyer has no liability for any infringement in respect of products sold prior to such settlement. Buyer further agrees that upon written notice from MagneTek that is accompanied by a written opinion of its patent counsel reasonably acceptable to Buyer that the product as proposed to be modified and redesigned does not infringe any existing patent, including those patents alleged to have been infringed in the Nilssen Litigation, given no sooner than six months after the Closing Date it will, as soon as reasonably feasible, take the necessary steps to discontinue selling or using products which incorporate allegedly infringing technology and for which Seller would have an indemnification obligation under Section 5.4(b) and to redesign and modify such products 

  

    

 as proposed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall not be required to
take such action unless (i) the proposed redesigned product does not infringe,
in the opinion of counsel to Buyer reasonably acceptable to MagneTek any
existing patents, including the patents alleged to have been infringed in the
Nilssen Litigation and (ii) the proposed modified products to be sold
by Buyer are technologically and commercially viable to the same extent as
the comparable products then being sold and meet all applicable governmental,
safety and industry codes and other requirements to the same extent as the
comparable products of Buyer then being sold. To the extent the production of
such modified products results in any increased production costs, MagneTek
will reimburse Buyer, based on reasonable documentation of such increased
costs, for Buyer\'s production costs in excess of $.025 per unit sold for a
period not exceeding five years from the commencement of such
production. MagneTek will also reimburse Buyer for the costs, if any,
incurred by Buyer commencing production of such modified products (including
retooling costs) based on reasonable documentation of such costs. Buyer may
at any time, at its sole risk and expense, re-design its products that
incorporate allegedly infringing technology so that such products do not
utilize the allegedly infringing technology, but will only be reimbursed
therefor if requested to do so by MagneTek as provided in this Section 5.4(c)
and Seller\'s indemnification obligations are limited to those set
forth herein.

  

  

 5.5 _ Assets._ If, after the Closing Dates, Assets shall remain on the premises utilized or controlled by Seller, then, unless the location of the Assets is covered by an Ancillary Agreement, Seller shall reasonable steps at the expense of Buyer to deliver such Assets to Buyer, and so long as such assets remain in the Seller\'s control, shall exercise reasonable care with respect thereto, and in no event less care than with respect to its own properties. 

   

 5.6 _ Material Software Licenses._ Seller shall, at its sole cost and expense, assign to Buyer each Material Software License (as defined below), effective as of the Closing, and secure from the licensors thereof all required consents related to such assignments. Seller will indemnify Buyer from any Liability it may incur as a result of (i) the failure to so assign any Material Software License or (ii) the licensor imposing or attempting to impose penalties or additional fees (in addition to license fees payable under the respective licenses, if any) in respect of such assignment. For purposes hereof, the term "Material Software Licenses" shall mean all licenses and contracts for all those software programs, applications, development tools, operating systems and utilities, and all appurtenant maintenance and service agreements which are installed on any of the computer hardware included in the Assets. In the event that Seller fails for any reason to obtain the consent of any licensor to the assignment of any Material Software License as contemplated by this Section 5.6 within sixty (60) days of the Closing Date, then, in addition to all other rights Buyer may have, and notwithstanding any provisions of this Agreement or the Information Support Services Agreement, Buyer shall be entitled to negotiate and purchase such consent (or new license substantially identical to such Material Software License) directly from the relevant licensor, and Seller shall, within ten (10) days of its receipt of reasonable documentation thereof, reimburse Buyer for all costs incurred by Buyer in connection with obtaining such consent or new license, as the case may be. 

  

    
ARTICLE VI 

COVENANTS OF BUYER 

  

 Buyer covenants and agrees as follows: 

  

 6.1 _ Confidentiality._ Buyer acknowledges that the information regarding the Business heretofore and hereafter provided to it by Seller is subject to the terms of a confidentiality agreement between MagneTek and Buyer dated as of July 11, 2000 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference except that the expiration is extended by twelve (12) months from the date hereof. Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement will terminate; _provided, however_ , that Buyer acknowledges that the Confidentiality Agreement will 

    terminate only with respect to information relating solely to the Division;
and _provided, further_ , however, that Buyer acknowledges that any and
all other provisions shall remain in effect, and all information provided to
it by MagneTek or its representatives concerning MagneTek (other than the U.S.
Business) shall remain subject to the terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement after the date of the Closing.

  

 6.2 _ Accounts Receivable._ Buyer agrees to forward or cause to be forwarded to MagneTek, within three business days after the receipt thereof, any and all proceeds from MagneTek Accounts Receivable that are received by Buyer or any Company after the Closing Date. If, after the Closing Date, Buyer or any Company receives any payment from any Person who at the time of such payment has outstanding MagneTek Accounts Receivable and Buyer Accounts Receivable, and the payment (a) does not indicate whether it is in respect of MagneTek Accounts Receivable or Buyer Accounts Receivable or (b) indicates that it is in payment of both MagneTek Accounts Receivable and Buyer Accounts Receivable without specifying the portion to be allocated to each, Seller will first contact the payor to determine the payor\'s intended allocation of the payment and such allocation will govern, and if the payor does not provide the intended allocation, then MagneTek and Buyer shall consult with one another to determine the proper allocation of such payment; and, if they are unable to reach agreement on the proper allocation, such payment shall be applied so as to retire MagneTek Accounts Receivable and Buyer Accounts Receivable in chronological order based upon the period of time such accounts receivable have existed. 

  

 6.3 _ Waiver of Bulk Sales Law Compliance._ Buyer hereby waives compliance by Seller with the requirements, if any, of Article 6 of the Uniform Commercial Code as in force in any state of the United States in which Assets are located and all other similar Requirements of Law applicable to bulk sales and transfers, to the extent applicable to the Transactions. Seller agrees to indemnify and hold Buyer harmless from and against any and all liability or claims arising out of such waiver, upon receipt of written notice from Buyer of the existence thereof with respect to an Excluded Liability, which indemnification shall be without limitation as to time or amount of claim. 

  

 6.4 _ Excluded Assets._ If, after the Closing Date, Excluded Assets shall remain on the premises utilized or controlled by Buyer, then Buyer shall take reasonable steps at the expense of Seller to deliver such Excluded Assets to such Seller, and so long as such assets remain in Buyer\'s control, shall exercise reasonable care with respect thereto, and in no event less care than with respect to its own properties. 

   

 6.5 _ Insurance._ Buyer shall secure insurance with respect to the Division from the Closing Date covering general liability and products liability in amounts customary for the industry of which the Business is a part. 

  

    
ARTICLE VII 

MUTUAL COVENANTS 

  

 Seller covenants and agrees with Buyer, and Buyer covenants and agrees with Seller as follows: 

  

 7.1 _ Cooperation._ Seller and Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with each other and shall cause their officers, employees, agents, auditors and representatives to cooperate with each other after the Closing to ensure the orderly transition of the U.S. Business to Buyer and to minimize any disruption to the respective businesses of MagneTek, Buyer or the Companies that might result from the transactions contemplated hereby. No party shall be required by this Section 7.1 to take any action that would unreasonably interfere with the conduct of its business in the Ordinary Course. 

  

 7.2 _ Publicity._ Seller and Buyer agree that, from the date hereof through the Closing Date, no public release or announcement concerning the transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued by any party without the prior consent of the other (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) except as such release or announcement may be required by any Requirement of Law, in 

    which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall
allow the other party reasonable time to comment on such release or
announcement in advance of such issuance.

   

 7.3 _ Records._ On the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Buyer all Records, subject to the following exceptions:

 (b) Seller may retain all Records prepared in connection with the sale of the Division, including bids received from other parties and analyses relating to the Division prepared solely in connection with the sale of the Division provided that Seller will provide Buyer the identity of each Person that presented Seller with a bid for the purchase of all or substantially all of the Division within the last twelve months; and

 7.4 _ Consents._ Buyer agrees that, except as set forth in Section 5.6 hereof, Seller shall have no liability whatsoever to Buyer arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any consents to the assignment of Contracts that may be required in connection with the Transactions or because of the default, acceleration or termination of any Assigned Contract as a result thereof. Buyer further agrees that, except for Section 3.2(b) in the event a required consent under a Material Contract is not scheduled, no representation, warranty or covenant of Seller contained herein shall be breached or deemed breached solely as a result of (i) the failure to obtain any such consent or as a result of any such default, acceleration or termination or (ii) any lawsuit, action, claim, proceeding or investigation commenced or threatened by or on behalf of any Person arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any such consent or any such default, acceleration or termination. Seller shall cooperate with Buyer in any reasonable manner in connection with Buyer obtaining any such consents; _provided, however_ , that such cooperation shall not include any requirement that Seller commence any litigation or offer or grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third party. The Purchase Price shall not be subject to adjustment by reason of any such consents that are not obtained. With respect to each Contract not assigned on the Closing Date, after the Closing Date Seller shall, if necessary, continue to deal with the other contracting party as the prime contracting party, and Buyer and Seller shall continue to use reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of the required parties to the assignment of such Contract to Buyer. Notwithstanding the absence of any such consent, Buyer shall be entitled to the benefits of such Contract accruing after the Closing Date to the extent that Seller may provide Buyer with such benefits without violating the terms of such Contract, and to the extent benefits are so provided, Buyer agrees to perform at its sole expense all of the obligations of Seller to be performed under such Contract after the Closing Date, and such obligations shall comprise Assumed Liabilities and such Contracts shall comprise Assigned Contracts; provided that to the extent that any such benefits are to be provided under any of the Administrative Services Agreement or the Information Systems Support Agreement or the obligations of Buyer shall be solely as set forth in such agreement.

During such period, Buyer will afford authorized representatives of Seller (including its auditors) access to such Records at reasonable times and during normal business hours at its principal business office, or at such other location or locations at which such Records may be stored or maintained from time to time, and will permit such representatives to make abstracts from, or copies of, any of such Records, or to obtain temporary possession of any thereof as may be reasonably required by Seller at Seller\'s sole cost and 

    expense _provided, however_ , that any such access under this Section 7.5
shall not unreasonably disrupt the normal business operations of the
U.S. Business. Buyer will, at Seller\'s expense (limited, however, to
Buyer\'s reasonable out-of-pocket expenditures with regard to any employee
travel or lodging expenses), cooperate with Seller in furnishing information,
evidence, testimony, making employees available for such purposes and other
reasonable assistance in connection with any action, proceeding, Tax audit,
or investigation to which Seller or any of its Affiliates is subject relating

Seller\'s reasonable out-of-pocket expenditures with regard to any employee
travel or lodging expenses), cooperate with Buyer in furnishing information,
evidence, testimony, making employees available for such purposes and other

sublease effective from the Closing Date.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT MATTERS 

  

 9.1 _ Employees._ 

  

  

 (a) Buyer shall offer employment to commence as of the Closing Date to all Division Employees at the same salaries and wages (but excluding any bonus and incentive programs), equivalent benefits in the aggregate, and on substantially the same terms and conditions as those in effect on or immediately prior to the Closing Date. The Division Employees who will be offered employment with Buyer are listed on Schedule 9.1(a). Such employees who accept and commence employment with Buyer are hereinafter collectively referred to as "Transferred Employees." Buyer has no present intention (subject to its discretion as to employee performance) to terminate the employment of any Transferred Employee within the sixty (60) days following the Closing Date, and Buyer assumes all obligations and liabilities relating to the Division, if any, under the WARN Act and any analogous state legislation relating to or arising out of the Transactions from actions taken by Buyer. 

  

 (b) Buyer shall expressly recognize any collective bargaining representatives recognized by Seller as of the Closing Date and identified on Schedule 9.1(b) and either shall assume the collective bargaining agreements existing on the Closing Date with respect to the Transferred Employees or enter into good faith negotiations with the collective bargaining representative with respect to a new collective bargaining agreement. Buyer hereby acknowledges that it is a successor employer with respect to those Transferred Employees who are members of a collective bargaining unit and Buyer hereby assumes all obligations of Seller under the collective bargaining agreements listed on Schedule 9.1(b). 

  

  

 9.2 _ Employee Benefit Plans._ 

  

  

 (a) Effective as of the Closing Date, Transferred Employees shall cease accruing any benefits under any Seller Plan, and MagneTek shall take, or cause to be taken, all such action, if any, as may be necessary to effect such cessation of participation. Effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer shall establish employee benefit plans providing benefits which in the aggregate are substantially the same as the benefits provided to Transferred Employees under Seller Plans (the "Buyer\'s Benefit Plans"). With respect to Buyer\'s Benefit Plans that provide medical or dental benefits after the Closing Date, such plans shall waive any exclusions or limitations with respect to pre-existing conditions and actively-at-work exclusions to the extent required by Applicable Law or already satisfied by the Transferred Employee under Seller Plan, whichever is more favorable to the Transferred Employee, and shall provide that any expenses incurred on or before the Closing Date by a Transferred Employee or his covered dependents shall be taken into account under such Buyer\'s Benefit Plans for purposes of satisfying applicable deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions. Buyer shall also cause its health plan(s) to be responsible for all health benefit claims by Transferred Employees and their covered dependents for services rendered after the Closing Date. 

  

 (b) On the Closing Date, Seller shall spin-off to Buyer, and Buyer shall become the sponsor of, that portion of the MagneTek, Inc. Cafeteria Plan that is applicable to Transferred Employees, as provided in the spin-off/transfer of sponsorship agreement attached as Schedule 9.2(b) hereof. 

  

 (c) Effective on the Closing Date, Buyer shall adopt or designate a defined contribution plan qualified under Section 401(a) and Section 401(k) of the Code in which the Transferred Employees shall be eligible to participate after the Closing Date (if Buyer elects, it may establish or designate separate Buyer 401(k) Plans for bargaining unit and non-bargaining unit Transferred Employees) (the "Buyer 401(k) Plan(s)") to the same extent such bargaining unit and non-bargaining unit Transferred Employees were eligible to participate, respectively, in the separate 401(k) plans of 

  

    

 Seller (the "Seller 401(k) Plan(s)") on or immediately prior to the Closing
Date. Effective on the Closing Date, the applicable Seller 401(k) Plan shall
spin-off to the applicable Buyer 401(k) Plan the accounts of the Transferred
Employees covered by such plan and as soon as practicable following the
Closing Date, but not later than sixty days after the Closing Date, the trusts
of the Seller 401(k) Plan(s) shall cause to be transferred to the trust(s) of
the Buyer 401(k) Plan(s) the assets allocated to such spun-off participant
accounts in cash or other property acceptable to Buyer (Seller 401(k) Plan(s)
shall liquidate any investment funds that will not be transferred in-kind to
the Buyer 401(k) Plan(s)). Prior to the actual transfer of assets, the
Transferred Employees shall not be permitted to make withdrawals, loans or
investment changes under the Seller 401(k) Plan(s) to the extent deemed
necessary or helpful by the recordkeeper of such plans to effectuate such
asset transfers. Any loan repayments during this period with respect to spun-
off participant notes shall be made to the trust(s) of the applicable Buyer
401(k) Plan(s). Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with each other to
facilitate the operation and administration of the Seller 401(k) Plan(s) and
the Buyer 401(k) Plan(s) with respect to the Transferred Employees. Following
such transfer of assets from the Seller 401(k) Plan(s), the sole and exclusive
responsibility for providing the benefits that are attributable to plan assets
transferred to Buyer 401(k) Plan(s) shall be that of Buyer and Buyer 401(k)
Plan(s).

  

 (d) Effective on the Closing Date, Seller shall cause the Transferred Employees to be fully vested in their accrued benefits under the MagneTek, Inc. FlexcarePlus Retirement Pension Plan. 

  

 (e) For the purposes of this Agreement, Buyer\'s provision of a non-discretionary profit-sharing contribution to the Buyer 401(k) Plan(s) equal to 3% of base pay on behalf of Transferred Employees is agreed to be an equivalent benefit on substantially the same terms and conditions as that in effect on the Closing Date. 

  

  

 9.3 _ Vacation, Holiday, Sick and Severance Pay._ As of the Closing Date, Buyer shall assume all of Seller\'s obligations for vacation (including accrued vacation), holiday, sick (including accrued sick) and severance (if any) payable to all Transferred Employees, except under any Stay and Pay Agreement, to the extent such obligations are accrued on the Closing Balance Sheet. 

  

 9.4 _ Access to Information._ Seller shall make reasonably available to Buyer such actuarial, financial, personnel and related information as may be reasonably requested by Buyer with respect to any Seller Plan as it relates to a Transferred Employee, including, but not limited to, compensation and employment histories. 

  

 9.5 _ Payroll Tax._ Seller and Buyer agree that, with respect to Transferred Employees who accept employment with Buyer upon the Closing, they will take the position that they respectively meet the definitions of "predecessor" and "successor" as defined in Revenue Procedure 96-60 and IRS Regulation Section 31.3121(a)(1)-1(b). Absent a mutual agreement to the contrary, Seller and Buyer will use "Standard Procedure" described in Section 4 of Revenue Procedure 96-60. Seller shall supply to Buyer, with respect to all Transferred Employees, all cumulative payroll information as of the Closing Date that Buyer shall reasonably request in order to comply with IRS Regulation Section 31.3121(a)(1)-1(b). 

  

 9.6 _ Third-Party Beneficiaries._ No provision of this Article IX shall create any third-party beneficiary rights in any former Division Employee (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof), including, without limitation, any right to continued employment or employment in any particular position with Buyer for any specified period of time after the Closing Date. 

       
ARTICLE X 

INDEMNIFICATION 

  

 10.1 _ Indemnification by Seller._ Subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Article X, Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Buyer Affiliate from any Losses suffered or incurred by such Indemnified Buyer Affiliate ("Buyer Losses"), to the extent any Buyer Losses arise from: (a) if the Closing occurs, any breach of any representation or warranty of Seller contained in this Agreement or in any certificate, instrument or other document delivered pursuant hereto, (b) any breach of any covenant (including, for avoidance of doubt, the covenants in Section 5.4) of Seller contained in this Agreement requiring performance after the Closing Date or (c) any Excluded Liability; _provided, however,_ that Seller shall not have any obligation to indemnify any Indemnified Buyer Affiliate from and against any remediation or abatement Liability arising as a result of the presence of asbestos in or upon any of the improvements located on any Company Property. Seller shall not have any liability under clause 10.1(a) above, excluding any Liability resulting from a breach of the representation in the second sentence of Section 3.2(a), which shall be without limitation, unless the aggregate of all Losses for which Seller would, but for this proviso, be liable pursuant to Section 10.1(a) and the analogous provisions under the Other Agreements, exceeds One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) on a cumulative basis (and then only to the extent of any such excess). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event Buyer establishes in respect of the breach of a representation and warranty that the facts or circumstances constituting such breach were Known to MagneTek, the foregoing minimum amount limitation and the maximum amount limitation set forth below will not be applicable to Seller\'s indemnification obligation with respect to the Losses resulting from such breach. Seller\'s aggregate liability under Section 10.1(a) of this Agreement, together with the analogous provisions of the Other Agreements, but excluding any Liabilities resulting from a breach of the representations in (i) the second sentence of Section 3.2(a) or (ii) Section 3.21, which shall be without limitation, shall in no event exceed 25% of the Purchase Price (as adjusted), provided that only the first Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) of Losses resulting from a breach by Seller of the representation and warranty in Section 3.21 (Absence of Certain Liabilities) will be included in determining whether this amount has been exceeded. 

   

 10.2 _ Indemnification by Buyer._ Subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Article X, Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Seller Affiliate from any Losses ("Seller Losses") suffered or incurred by such Indemnified Seller Affiliate to the extent any Seller Losses arise from: (a) if the Closing occurs, any breach of any representation or warranty of Buyer contained in this Agreement which survives the Closing or in any certificate, instrument or other document delivered pursuant hereto or in connection herewith, (b) any breach of any covenant of Buyer contained in this Agreement requiring performance after the Closing Date, (c) any Assumed Liability or (d) the ongoing operations of Buyer and the Assets after the Closing to the extent resulting from the actions or omissions of Buyer not contemplated by this Agreement, including under any Environmental Law. 

  

 10.3 _ Losses Net of Insurance, Etc._ 

  

  

 (a) The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided under this Article X shall be net of all amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Person under insurance policies with respect to such Loss and shall be net of any reserve in respect thereof reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet. 

   

 (b) If the Indemnifying Person makes any payment under this Article X in respect of any Losses, the Indemnifying Person shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment and except to the extent that such subrogation is not permitted by the terms of any insurance policy, to the rights of the Indemnified Person against any insurer or third party with respect to such Losses. 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, no party shall, in any event, be liable to any Indemnified Person for any consequential damages, including, but not 

  

    

 limited to, loss of revenue or income, cost of capital, diminution in value
or loss of business reputation or opportunity relating to the breach or
alleged breach of this Agreement. Each party agrees that it will not seek
punitive damages from any Indemnified Person as to any matter under, relating
to or arising out of the Transactions.

  

 (d) The parties hereto agree that the indemnification provisions of this Article X are intended to provide the exclusive remedy as to all Losses each may incur arising from, or relating to the transactions contemplated hereby and Buyer hereby waives any other rights or remedies that may arise under any applicable statute, rule or regulation, including no limitation of any right to contribution arising under CERCLA or otherwise. 

  

 (e) Any indemnification payment for Taxes required under this Article X shall for purposes of federal, state and local income Taxes, be treated as a purchase price adjustment. 

  

  

 10.4 _ Termination of Indemnification._ The obligations to indemnify and hold harmless a party hereto pursuant to Sections 10.1(a) and 10.2(a), shall terminate when the applicable representation or warranty terminates pursuant to Section 10.6; _provided, however_ , that such obligations to indemnify and hold harmless shall not terminate with respect to any item as to which the Person to be indemnified shall have, before the expiration of the applicable period, previously made a claim by delivering a written notice (stating in reasonable detail the basis of such claim) to the Indemnifying Person. 

  

 10.5 _ Procedures Relating to Indemnification._ In order for an Indemnified Person to be entitled to any indemnification provided for under this Agreement in respect of, arising out of or involving a claim or demand made by any Person against the Indemnified Person (a "Third-Party Claim"), such Indemnified Person must notify the Indemnifying Person in writing, and in reasonable detail, of the Third-Party Claim within 10 Business Days after receipt by such Indemnified Person of written notice of the Third-Party Claim; _provided, however_ , that failure to give such notification shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Person shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such failure. 

  

 If a Third-Party Claim is made against an Indemnified Person, the Indemnifying Person will be entitled to participate in the defense thereof and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Person and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person. Should the Indemnifying Person so elect to assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Person will not be liable to the Indemnified Person for legal fees and expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Person in connection with the defense thereof. If the Indemnifying Person assumes such defense, the Indemnified Person shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying Person, it being understood that the Indemnifying Person shall control such defense. The Indemnifying Person shall be liable for the fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Person for any period during which the Indemnifying Person has not assumed the defense thereof (other than during any period in which the Indemnified Person shall have failed to give notice of the Third-Party Claim as provided above). If the Indemnifying Person chooses to defend or prosecute any Third-Party Claim, all the parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the Indemnifying Person\'s request) the provision to the Indemnifying Person of Records and information which are reasonably relevant to such Third-Party Claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis in the manner specified in Section 7.5 to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. Whether or not the Indemnifying Person shall have assumed the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Person shall not admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such Third-Party Claim without the Indemnifying Person\'s prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). 

     10.6 _ Survival of Representations._ The representations and
warranties in this Agreement and in any other document delivered in
connection herewith shall survive the Closing solely for purposes of Sections
10.1(a) and 10.2(a) and shall terminate at the close of business on the
eighteen-month anniversary of the Closing Date, except that the
representations and warranties (a) in Section 3.15(a) (Environmental Matters)
shall expire on the first anniversary of the Closing Date, (b) in Section
3.21 (Absence of Certain Liabilities) shall not expire until the second
anniversary of the Closing Date, (c) in Section 3.15 (b)-(e) (Environmental
Matters) shall not expire until the third anniversary of the Closing Date and
(d) in Section 3.7 (Title to Assets Other Than Real Property) and in the
second sentence of Section 3.2(a) (Authority; No Conflicts; Consents) shall
not expire.
