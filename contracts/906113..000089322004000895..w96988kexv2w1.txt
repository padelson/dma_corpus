hereto as Exhibit C and, prior to the filing of the REIT Articles of Merger,
shall file such Partnership Certificate of Merger in accordance with applicable
law to effectuate the Partnership Merger.

      I. As a condition and inducement to the willingness of the ProLogis
Parties to enter into this Agreement and consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, the ProLogis Parties have required the persons set forth on

agreement, of even date herewith (the "Voting Agreements"), pursuant to which,
among other things, each Specified Holder agrees to vote all Keystone Common
Shares beneficially owned by such Specified Holder (including Keystone Common
Shares issued upon conversion of options of Keystone beneficially owned by the

Units beneficially owned by such Specified Holder in favor of the Partnership

      (c) REIT Merger Consideration. The consideration to be paid to the holders

without interest (the "REIT Merger Consideration").

            (ii) Each Keystone Preferred Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding as a preferred
security of the Surviving Company, having the same preferences, privileges,
voting powers and terms for its respective series of Preferred Shares as prior

Surviving Company, receive payment as set forth in Section 1.7(g).

            (iii) At the Effective Time, all Keystone Common Shares shall no

Time represented any such shares (each a "Certificate") shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the REIT Merger
Consideration described above and any dividends declared and unpaid thereon
payable to holders of record thereof as of a record date preceding the Effective
Time. Following the Effective Time, upon surrender of Certificates representing
Keystone Common Shares, in accordance with Section 1.8, the Surviving Company
shall pay to the holders of such Certificates as of the Effective Time, in
addition to the REIT Merger Consideration, any unpaid dividends declared in
respect of such Keystone Common Shares, with a record date prior to the
Effective Time and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time.

      (d) Stock Options and Restricted Stock.

            (i) In connection with the REIT Merger, as of the Effective Time,
each option (each a "1993 Keystone Option") to purchase Keystone Common Shares
granted under Keystone's Amended and Restated 1993 Omnibus Incentive Plan or its
predecessors (the "1993 Option Plan") which is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall vest in its entirety as of the Effective Time and each
holder of such a 1993 Keystone Option will be entitled to receive, and shall
receive, in full settlement thereof a cash payment from PARTY B in an amount
equal to the product of (A) the REIT Merger Consideration minus the exercise
price per share under the 1993 Keystone Option (it being understood that there
shall be no payment on any such shares which are "out of the money") and (B) the
number of Keystone Common Shares subject to the 1993 Keystone Option Plan held
by such holder immediately prior to the Effective Time.

            (ii) For a period of 15 days ending on the day before the Effective
Time (the "Accelerated Exercise Period"), each option (each a "1994 Keystone
Option" and, collectively, together with all 1993 Keystone Options, the
"Keystone Options") to purchase Keystone Common Shares granted under Keystone's
Amended and Restated 1994 Non-Employee Stock Incentive Plan or its predecessors
(the "1994 Option Plan" and, together with the 1993 Option Plan, the "Keystone
Option Plans") which is outstanding under the 1994 Option Plan as of the first
day of the Accelerated Exercise Period shall be exercisable (whether or not
otherwise exercisable) during the Accelerated Exercise Period and any 1994
Keystone Option which is not exercised during the Accelerated Exercise Period
shall be terminated and cancelled and no person shall thereafter have any rights
under or with respect to such 1994 Keystone Option.

            (iii) In connection with the REIT Merger, as of the Effective Time,

<PAGE>

restrictions terminate or lapse and such loans are forgiven, the shares relating
thereto shall be treated pursuant to this Agreement in the same manner as other
Keystone Common Shares.

            (iv) By virtue of the foregoing treatment of the Keystone Options
set forth above, no person shall have any right under or with respect to any
Keystone Option after the Effective Time, other than rights to payments as
specifically set forth in this Agreement, and all such Keystone Options shall
cease to exist as of the Effective Time.

            (v) As of the Effective Time, the Keystone Option Plans shall be
terminated and no further awards or grants shall be made thereunder.

            (vi) Keystone shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
ensure that the requirements of this Section 1.7(d) are satisfied.

      (e) No Appraisal Rights. The holders of Keystone Common Shares and
Keystone Preferred Shares are not entitled under applicable law to appraisal,
dissenters' or similar rights as a result of the REIT Merger.

      (f) Adjustments to REIT Merger Consideration. The REIT Merger
Consideration shall be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any
reclassification, combination, subdivision, share split, reverse split, share
dividend (including any share dividend or distribution of securities convertible
into Keystone Common Shares or Keystone Preferred Shares, as applicable),
reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect to Keystone
Common Shares (or for which a record date is established) after the date hereof
and prior to the Effective Time.

      (g) Liquidation of the Surviving Company. As promptly as practicable
following the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall deliver written notice
of its election to liquidate and terminate its existence to the holders of each
series of Keystone Preferred Shares, stating the date and place of payment of
the amount distributable to such holders of the Keystone Preferred Shares in
accordance with the terms of the Articles Supplementary classifying such series,
which notice will be delivered prior to the payment date stated in the notice in
accordance with the terms of the respective series of Keystone Preferred Shares
(the "Liquidation Payment Date"). On the Liquidation Payment Date, the holder of
each series of Keystone Preferred Shares will receive distributions from the
Surviving Company equal to the amounts payable to them upon a liquidation of the
Surviving Company in accordance with the terms of the Articles Supplementary
classifying such series. The Surviving Company will file a notice of termination
with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland in accordance
with Section 8-502 of the MRL.

      Section 1.8. Surrender of Certificates.

      (a) Paying Agent and Exchange Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, PARTY B
shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to Keystone to act
as agent for the payment of the REIT Merger Consideration, upon surrender of
Certificates evidencing Keystone Common Shares (the "Paying and Exchange
Agent"). PARTY B shall take all steps necessary to enable, and shall cause, the
Surviving Company to provide to the Paying and Exchange Agent immediately
following the Effective Time the REIT Merger Consideration payable upon
surrender of the Keystone Common Shares pursuant to Section 1.7(c), plus any
amounts payable in respect of unpaid dividends declared in respect of the
Keystone Common Shares with a record date prior to the Effective Time and which
remain unpaid at


                                      -5-
<PAGE>
the Effective Time. The funds deposited with the Paying and Exchange Agent in
respect of the REIT Merger Consideration together with earnings thereon is
hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund."

      (b) Payment Procedure. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
the Paying and Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a
Certificate (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates held
by such Person (as defined herein) shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying and Exchange Agent and shall be in customary form and
have such other provisions as PARTY B may reasonably specify) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange
for the REIT Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Paying and Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents
as may be appointed by PARTY B, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Paying and Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the REIT Merger Consideration in
respect of the shares formerly evidenced by such Certificate pursuant to Section
1.7(c), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of Keystone Common Shares that is not
registered in the share transfer books of Keystone, payment may be made therefor
to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered
is registered, if such shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form
for transfer, and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of PARTY
B that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. No interest shall be paid or
shall accrue on the REIT Merger Consideration, or unpaid dividends declared in
respect of the Keystone Common Shares and with a record date prior to the
Effective Time and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time, payable upon
surrender of any Certificate.

      (c) No Further Ownership Rights. All cash paid upon the surrender of a
Certificate in accordance with the terms of this Article I shall be deemed to
have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Keystone
Common Shares formerly evidenced by such Certificate. At the close of business
on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the share transfer books of
Keystone shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the share transfer books of the Surviving Company of the Keystone
Common Shares that were outstanding, immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Company or the Paying and Exchange Agent for transfer or any other reason, they
shall be canceled and payment of the REIT Merger Consideration shall be made
therefor as provided in this Article I.

      (d) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Keystone Common Shares one year after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to Newco I or its designated Affiliate,
upon demand, and any holder of Keystone Common Shares who has not theretofore
complied with this Article I shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Company
or its successor in interest for payment of its claim for REIT Merger
Consideration.

      (e) No Liability. None of PARTY B, Keystone OP, nor the Surviving Company
shall be liable to any person for any part of the Merger Consideration (as
defined in Section 1.9(a) below) or for dividends or distributions with respect
thereto delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law (as defined herein). Any amounts remaining
unclaimed by holders of any such shares five years after the Effective Time or
at such earlier date as is immediately prior to the time at which such amounts
would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Federal, state, local
government, or agency or any court, regulatory or administrative agency or
commission or other governmental authority or instrumentality, domestic or
foreign (a "Governmental Entity"), shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, become the property of Newco I or its designated Affiliate free


                                      -6-
<PAGE>
and clear of any claims or interest of any such holders or their successors,
assigns or personal representatives previously entitled thereto.

      (f) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Paying and Exchange Agent shall
invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by PARTY B, on a
daily basis; provided, however, that such investments shall be in (i)
obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America and backed by the
full faith and credit of the United States of America, (ii) commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard & Poor's Corporation, respectively, (iii) certificates of deposit
maturing not more than 180 days after the date of purchase issued by a bank
organized under the laws of the United States or any state thereof having a
combined capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000 or (iv) a money market
fund having assets of at least $3,000,000,000. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be the property of, and paid to, PARTY B
or its designated Affiliate.

      (g) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen,
defaced or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Company, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as the Surviving Company may direct as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying
and Exchange Agent shall pay or deliver in respect of such lost, stolen, defaced
or destroyed Certificate the applicable REIT Merger Consideration.

      (h) Withholding Rights. The Surviving Company or the Paying and Exchange
Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
Keystone Common Shares, such amounts as it is required to withhold with respect
to such payments under the Code (as defined herein) or any other provision of
state, local or foreign tax law. Any such amounts so withheld shall be paid over
to the applicable Governmental Entity in accordance with applicable Law and
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
former holder of a Certificate with respect to which such deduction and
withholding was made.

      (i) Tax Treatment. The parties intend, that, for Federal income tax
purposes, the REIT Merger shall be treated as a taxable purchase of the Keystone
Common Shares from the holders of record thereof by PARTY B in exchange for the
REIT Merger Consideration.

      Section 1.9. Conversion of Equity Securities in the Partnership Merger. At
the Effective Time, by virtue of the Partnership Merger and without any action
on the part of any Selling OP Unit Holder or holder of partnership interests of
Partnership Merger Sub:

      (a) Partnership Merger Consideration. The consideration to be paid to the
Selling OP Unit Holders in the Partnership Merger is as follows (the
"Partnership Merger Consideration" and together with the REIT Merger
Consideration, the "Merger Consideration"):

            (i) Each Keystone Common Unit outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time of the Partnership Merger (other than Keystone Common Units held
by Keystone and Keystone Common Units contributed to Newco I by the Contributing
OP Unit Holders) shall be exchanged for $23.80 in cash per Keystone Common Unit
without interest, provided that if any Keystone Common Unit Holder is an
"accredited investor" (as defined in Rule 501, promulgated under the Securities
Act (as defined herein)), and has previously submitted to Partnership Merger Sub
a Form of Election (as defined herein) in accordance with the procedures and
time periods specified in Section 4.2(e) hereof, such Keystone Common Unit
Holder shall have the right to receive for each Keystone Common Unit then held
by it Newco I Common Units with a Value of $23.80.



                                      -7-

OP (the "Keystone GP Units") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
of the Partnership Merger shall become common units of the Surviving
Partnership.

            (iii) Any Keystone Common Units outstanding and held by Keystone
immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Partnership Merger shall remain
outstanding as common units of the Surviving Partnership.

            (iv) Any Keystone Common Units contributed to Newco I by the
Contributing OP Unit Holders and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time of the Partnership Merger shall remain outstanding as common units of the
Surviving Partnership.

            (v) Each Keystone Series F Unit, Keystone Series G Unit and Keystone
Series H Unit issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of
the Partnership Merger shall remain outstanding as a preferred security of the
Surviving Partnership, having the same preferences, privileges voting powers and
terms for its respective series of preferred units as prior to the Effective
Time and shall, upon the subsequent liquidation of the Surviving Company,
receive payment in accordance with the certificates of designation classifying
such units.

            (vi) At the Effective Time of the Partnership Merger, each holder of
a Keystone Common Unit outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of
the Partnership Merger (other than Keystone Common Units held by Keystone and
Keystone Common Units contributed to Newco I by the Contributing OP Unit
Holders) shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto except the right to
receive the applicable Partnership Merger Consideration and any distributions
declared and unpaid thereon payable to holders of record thereof as of a record
date preceding the Effective Time. Following the Effective Time, upon delivery
to the Paying and Exchange Agent of such duly executed documents as may be
required by the Paying and Exchange Agent or PARTY B, the Surviving Partnership
shall pay to such former holders any unpaid distributions declared in respect of
the Keystone Common Units with a record date prior to the Effective Time and
which remain unpaid at the Effective Time.

      (b) Adjustments to Partnership Merger Consideration. The Partnership
Merger Consideration shall be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any
reclassification, combination, subdivision, split, reverse split, distribution
of securities convertible into Keystone Common Units, reorganization,
recapitalization or other like change with respect to Keystone Common Units
occurring (or for which a record date is established) after the date hereof and
prior to the Effective Time.

applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this agreement to any holder of Keystone Common
Units or Keystone Series D Units (if applicable), such amounts as it is required
to withhold with respect to such payments under the Code or any other provision
of state, local or foreign tax law. Any such amounts so withheld shall be paid
over to the applicable Governmental Entity in accordance with applicable Law and
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
former holder of Keystone Common Units or Keystone Series D Units, as the case
may be, with respect to which such deduction and withholding was made.

      (d) Tax Treatment. The parties intend that, for Federal income tax
purposes, (i) the Partnership Merger be treated as a taxable purchase of
Keystone Common Units by PARTY B from each holder of Keystone Common Units who
receives, directly or indirectly, any consideration other than Newco I Common
Units in connection with the Partnership Merger and (ii) the contribution of
Keystone Common Units to Newco I by Contributing OP Unit Holders who hold such
Keystone Common Units in exchange for Newco I Common Units be treated as a
contribution governed by Section 721 of the Code.

business, properties, condition (financial or otherwise), or results of
operations of Keystone and the Keystone Subsidiaries (as defined herein) taken
as a whole or (y) would not, or would not be reasonably likely to, prevent or
materially delay the performance by Keystone or Keystone OP of any of their
respective obligations under this Agreement or the consummation of the Mergers
or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement (a "Keystone Material
Adverse Effect"), provided that a Keystone Material Adverse Effect shall not
include any change with respect to Keystone or any Keystone Subsidiary to the
extent resulting from or attributable to (i) general national, international or
regional economic, financial or political conditions or events, including,
without limitation, the effects of terrorist acts that do not result in the
destruction or material physical damage of a material portion of Keystone's real
properties, (ii) the announcement, pendency or consummation of this Agreement or
the other Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby or (iii) conditions generally affecting the securities markets or the
industries in which Keystone and the Keystone Subsidiaries operate. Keystone has
heretofore made available to PARTY B complete and correct copies of the Keystone
Declaration of Trust, as amended and supplemented to the date hereof, and the
Keystone By-laws, as amended to the date hereof. Each jurisdiction in which
Keystone is qualified or licensed to do business and each assumed name under
which it conducts business in any jurisdiction are identified in Schedule 2.1(a)

Subsidiary that is a corporation is duly incorporated, validly existing and in

requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties
and to carry on its business as now being conducted. Each Keystone Subsidiary,
including Keystone OP, that is a partnership, limited liability company or trust
is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of its
jurisdiction of organization and has the requisite power and authority to own,
lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now being
conducted. Each Keystone Subsidiary, including Keystone OP, is duly qualified or
licensed to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which
the nature of its business or the ownership, operation or leasing of its
properties or the management of properties for others makes such qualification
or licensing necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be
so qualified or licensed, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to have a Keystone Material Adverse Effect. All

outstanding shares of capital stock of each Keystone Subsidiary that is a
corporation have been duly authorized, are validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable, and are not subject to any preemptive rights and are owned by
Keystone or another Keystone Subsidiary, except as disclosed in Schedule
2.1(b)(i) of the Keystone Disclosure Letter, and are so owned free and clear of
all pledges, claims, liens, charges, encumbrances and security interests of any
kind or nature whatsoever (each, a "Lien" and collectively, "Liens"). All equity
interests in each Keystone Subsidiary, including Keystone OP, that is a
partnership, limited liability company, trust or other entity, have been duly
authorized and are validly issued and are owned by Keystone or another Keystone
Subsidiary, except as disclosed in Schedule 2.1(b)(i) of the Keystone Disclosure
Letter, and are so owned free and clear of all Liens. Keystone has heretofore
made available to PARTY B complete and correct copies of the charter, by-laws or
other organizational documents of each of the Keystone Subsidiaries, each as
amended to the date of this Agreement. Schedule 2.1(b)(i) of the Keystone
Disclosure Letter sets forth (A) all Keystone Subsidiaries and their respective
jurisdictions of incorporation or organization, (B) each owner and the

respective amount of such owner's equity interest in each Keystone Joint Venture
and (C) a list of each jurisdiction in which each Keystone Joint Venture is

capital stock of, or other equity interests in, the Keystone Subsidiaries and
the other interests disclosed in Schedule 2.1(b)(ii) of the Keystone Disclosure
Letter (such other interests, the "Keystone Joint Ventures"), neither Keystone
nor any of the Keystone Subsidiaries owns any capital stock or other ownership
interest in any Person. Neither Keystone nor any Keystone Subsidiary is in
default under any agreement, document or contract governing its rights in, or
obligations to, the Keystone Joint Ventures which default is, or could, with the
passage of time, result in, a material breach under such agreement, document or
contract. To the Knowledge of Keystone and Keystone OP, the other parties to
such agreements, documents and contracts are not in breach of any of their
respective obligations under such agreements, documents or contracts.

Approval and with respect to the consummation of the Partnership Merger, to

the ProLogis Parties is a party constitute the valid and binding obligation of
such ProLogis Party, are enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject, as
to enforceability, to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and
other Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights
and to general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability
is considered in a proceeding in equity or at Law).

            (ii) Except as set forth in Schedule 2.1(d)(ii) of the Keystone
Disclosure Letter, the execution and delivery of the Transaction Documents by
Keystone or each applicable Keystone Subsidiary do not, and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and compliance with the
provisions hereof or thereof, will not, conflict with, or result in any
violation of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)
under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of
any material obligation, or give rise to a right of purchase under, result in
the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of Keystone or any

following the Mergers), or (C) assuming the consents, approvals, authorizations
or permits and filings or notifications referred to in Schedules 2.1(d)(ii) and
(iii) of the Keystone Disclosure Letter are duly and timely obtained or made and
the Keystone Shareholder Approval and the Keystone Partner Approval have been
obtained, any judgment, order, decree, statute, Law, ordinance, rule or
regulation applicable to Keystone or any of the Keystone Subsidiaries, or any of
their respective properties or assets, other than, in the case of clauses (B) or
(C), any such conflicts, violations, defaults, rights or Liens that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Keystone Material Adverse Effect.

            (iii) Except as set forth in Schedule 2.1(d)(iii) of the Keystone
Disclosure Letter, no consent, approval, order or authorization of, or
registration, declaration or filing with, or permit from any Governmental
Entity, is required by or with respect to Keystone or any of the Keystone
Subsidiaries in connection with the execution and delivery of the Transaction
Documents by Keystone or each of the applicable Keystone Subsidiaries or the
consummation by Keystone or the applicable Keystone Subsidiaries of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, except for: (A) the filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") of (1) (a) a proxy statement in
preliminary and definitive form relating to the Keystone Shareholder Meeting
held in connection with the Mergers (the "Proxy Statement") or (b) other
documents otherwise required in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby and (2) such reports under Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and such other compliance with the

Articles of Merger and the Partnership Articles of Merger by, the State
Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland or the Secretary of State of
Delaware, as applicable; (C) such filings and approvals as may be required by
any applicable Environmental Laws (as defined herein) as more specifically
described in Schedule 2.1(d)(iii) of the Keystone Disclosure Letter; and (D) any
such consent, approval, order, authorization, registration, declaration, filing
or permit that the failure to obtain or make individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to have a Keystone Material Adverse Effect.

      (e) SEC Documents. Keystone has made available to PARTY B (by public
filing with the SEC or otherwise) a true and complete copy of each report,
schedule, registration statement and definitive proxy statement filed by either
Keystone or any Keystone Subsidiary with the SEC since January 1, 2001 (the
"Keystone SEC Documents") which are all of the documents required to have been
filed by any of them with the SEC since that date. As of their respective dates,
the Keystone SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"),
or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the
SEC thereunder applicable to such Keystone SEC Documents and none of the
Keystone SEC Documents contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, except to the extent such statements have been modified or
superseded by later Keystone SEC Documents filed and publicly available prior to
the date of this Agreement. Neither Keystone nor any Keystone Subsidiary has any
outstanding and unresolved comments from the SEC with respect to the Keystone
SEC Documents. The consolidated financial statements of Keystone and Keystone
Subsidiaries included in the Keystone SEC Documents complied as to form in all
material respects with the applicable accounting requirements and the published
rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") applied on a
consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the
notes thereto, or, in the case of the unaudited statements, as permitted by Rule
10-01 of Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act) and fairly presented, in
accordance with applicable requirements of GAAP and the applicable rules and
regulations of the SEC (subject, in the case of the unaudited statements, to
normal, recurring adjustments, none of which are material), the consolidated
financial position of Keystone and the Keystone


                                      -14-
<PAGE>
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as of their respective dates and the
consolidated statements of income and the consolidated cash flows of Keystone
and the Keystone Subsidiaries for the periods presented therein, in each case,

by later Keystone SEC Documents filed and publicly available prior to the date
of this Agreement. No Keystone Subsidiary is required to make any filing with
the SEC.

      (f) Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except as disclosed or reflected

repurchase, redemption or other acquisition by Keystone or any Keystone
Subsidiary of any outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity securities
of, or other ownership interests in, Keystone or any Keystone Subsidiary; (D)

of Keystone or any Keystone Subsidiary; (4) material increase in any benefits
payable under any existing severance or termination pay policies or employment
agreements; or (5) increase in compensation, bonus or other benefits payable to
trustees, directors or officers of Keystone or any Keystone Subsidiary; (G) any
incurrence, assumption or guarantee by Keystone or any Keystone Subsidiary of
any indebtedness for borrowed money other than in the ordinary course of

loan, advance or capital contribution to or investment in any Person in an
amount exceeding $50,000 or (ii) except for the issuance of awards under the
Keystone Option Plans and the issuance of Keystone Common Units, any split,
combination or reclassification of any of Keystone's shares of beneficial
interest or any issuance or the authorization of any issuance of any other
securities in respect of, in lieu of, or in substitution for, or giving the
right to acquire by exchange or exercise, shares of beneficial interest or any
issuance of an ownership interest in, any Keystone Subsidiary.

      (g) No Undisclosed Material Liabilities. Except as disclosed in the
Keystone SEC Documents, as set forth in Schedule 2.1(g) of the Keystone
Disclosure Letter or as otherwise would not reasonably be expected to have a
Keystone Material Adverse Effect, there are no liabilities of Keystone or any of
the Keystone Subsidiaries or Keystone Joint Ventures, whether accrued,
contingent, absolute or determined, and, to Keystone's Knowledge, there is no
existing condition, situation or set of circumstances that would reasonably be

provided for on the balance sheet of Keystone and Keystone OP dated as of
December 31, 2003 (including the notes thereto); (ii) liabilities adequately
provided for on the balance sheets of the Keystone Joint Ventures dated as of
December 31, 2003; or (iii) liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of

Disclosure Letter sets forth a complete list of all loan or credit agreements,
notes, bonds, mortgages, indentures and other agreements and instruments
existing at the date of this Agreement pursuant to which any indebtedness of
Keystone, any Keystone Subsidiary or any Keystone Joint Venture is outstanding
or may be incurred and the respective principal amounts outstanding thereunder
as of the date of this Agreement. For purposes of this Section 2.1(g),
"indebtedness" means, with respect to any Person, without duplication (i) all

                                      -15-
<PAGE>
obligations of such Person for borrowed money or obligations with respect to
deposits or advances of any kind to such Person, (ii) all obligations of such
Person evidenced by bonds, debentures, notes or similar instruments, (iii) all
obligations of such Person upon which interest charges are customarily paid,

equipment incurred in the ordinary course of business, (vii) all obligations of
such Person under interest rate or currency hedging transactions (valued at the
termination value thereof), (viii) all letters of credit issued for the account
of such Person, and (ix) all guarantees and arrangements having the economic
effect of a guarantee of such Person of any indebtedness of any other Person.

      (h) No Default. None of Keystone, any of the Keystone Subsidiaries or, to
Keystone's Knowledge, any of the Keystone Joint Ventures is in default or
violation (and no event has occurred which, with notice or the lapse of time or
both, would constitute a default or violation) of any term, condition or
provision of (i) the Keystone Declaration of Trust or the Keystone By-laws or
the comparable charter or organizational documents of any of the Keystone
Subsidiaries or Keystone Joint Ventures, (ii) any loan or credit agreement,
note, or any bond, mortgage or indenture, to which Keystone or any of the
Keystone Subsidiaries or any Keystone Joint Venture is a party or by which
Keystone, any of the Keystone Subsidiaries or any Keystone Joint Venture or any
of their respective properties or assets is bound, or (iii) any order, writ,
injunction, decree, statute, rule or regulation applicable to Keystone, any of
the Keystone Subsidiaries or any of the Keystone Joint Ventures, except in the
case of (ii) and (iii) for defaults or violations which, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Keystone Material Adverse
Effect.

      (i) Compliance with Applicable Laws. Keystone, the Keystone Subsidiaries
and the Keystone Joint Ventures hold all permits, licenses, variances,
exemptions, orders and approvals of all Governmental Entities necessary for the
lawful conduct of their respective businesses (the "Keystone Permits"), except
where the failure so to hold such Keystone Permits, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Keystone Material Adverse
Effect. Keystone and the Keystone Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms
of the Keystone Permits, except where the failure to so comply, individually or
in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Keystone Material
Adverse Effect. Except as disclosed in the Keystone SEC Documents, the
businesses of Keystone and the Keystone Subsidiaries are not being conducted in
violation of any Law, except for violations which, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Keystone Material Adverse
Effect. No investigation or review by any Governmental Entity with respect to
Keystone, any Keystone Subsidiary or any Keystone Joint Venture is pending or,
to Keystone's Knowledge, threatened, other than those the outcome of which,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Keystone Material Adverse Effect.

      (j) Litigation. Except as disclosed in the Keystone SEC Documents or as
set forth in Schedule 2.1(j) of the Keystone Disclosure Letter and except for
routine litigation arising from the ordinary course of business of Keystone and
the Keystone Subsidiaries which are adequately covered by insurance, there is no
suit, action or proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of Keystone, threatened
against or affecting Keystone, any Keystone Subsidiary or any Keystone Joint
Venture or any of their respective properties or assets that, individually or in
the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Keystone Material Adverse
Effect or materially adversely affect the right or ability of PARTY B or its
Affiliates to own and operate the business and assets of Keystone or any
Keystone Subsidiary or to participate in any Keystone Joint Venture.

      (k) Taxes. (i) Each of Keystone and the Keystone Subsidiaries has timely
filed all material Tax Returns (as defined herein) required to be filed by it
(after giving effect to any filing extension properly granted by a Governmental
Entity having authority to do so). Each such Tax Return is accurate and complete
in all material respects. Keystone and each Keystone Subsidiary has paid (or
Keystone has paid on its behalf), all material Taxes that are shown as due and
payable on such Tax Returns. All material Taxes which Keystone or the Keystone
Subsidiaries are required by Law to withhold or collect, including Taxes
required to have been withheld in connection with amounts paid or owing to any
employee, independent contractor, creditor, shareholder or other third party and
sales, gross receipts and use taxes, have been duly withheld or collected and,
to the extent required, have been paid over to the proper Governmental Entities
within the time period prescribed by law. The most recent audited financial
statements contained in the Keystone SEC Documents filed with the SEC prior to
the date of this Agreement reflect an adequate reserve for all material Taxes
payable by Keystone and the Keystone Subsidiaries for all taxable periods and
portions thereof through the date of such financial statements. Keystone and
each Keystone Subsidiary has established (and until the Closing Date shall
continue to establish and maintain) on its books and records reserves that are
adequate for the payment of all material Taxes not yet due and payable. Since
December 31, 2003, Keystone has incurred no liability for any material Taxes
under Sections 857(b), 860(c) or 4981 of the Code, IRS Notice 88-19, Treasury
Regulation Section 1.337(d)-5, or Treasury Regulation Section 1-337(d)-6
including, without limitation, any material Tax arising from a prohibited
transaction described in Section 857(b)(6) of the Code, and neither Keystone nor
any of the Keystone Subsidiaries has incurred any material liability for Taxes
other than in the ordinary course of business and other than transfer or similar
Taxes arising in connection with the sales of property. No event has occurred,
and no condition or circumstance exists, which presents a material risk that any
material Tax described in the preceding sentences will be imposed upon Keystone
or any Keystone Subsidiary. Neither Keystone nor any Keystone Subsidiary is the
subject of any audit, examination, or other proceeding in respect of Federal
income Taxes; to the Knowledge of Keystone, no audit, examination or other
proceeding in respect of Federal income Taxes involving Keystone or any Keystone
Subsidiary is being considered by any Tax authority; and no audit, examination
or proceeding in respect of Federal income Taxes involving Keystone or any
Keystone Subsidiary has occurred since December 31, 1998. No deficiencies for
any Taxes have been asserted or assessed in writing (or to the Knowledge of
Keystone or any Keystone Subsidiary, proposed) against Keystone or any of the
Keystone Subsidiaries, including claims by any taxing authority in a
jurisdiction where Keystone or any Keystone Subsidiary does not file Tax Returns
but in which any of them is or may be subject to taxation, which individually or
in the aggregate would be material, and no requests for waivers of the time to
assess any such Taxes have been granted and remain in effect or are pending.
There are no Liens for Taxes upon the assets of Keystone or the Keystone
Subsidiaries except for statutory Liens for Taxes not yet due.

            (ii) Keystone (A) for each taxable year beginning with its taxable
year ended on December 31, 1993 and ending at the Effective Time, has been
subject to taxation as a real estate investment trust (a "REIT") within the
meaning of the Code and has satisfied the requirements to qualify as a REIT for
such years, (B) has operated, and intends to continue to operate, consistent
with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT through the
Effective Time and (C) has not taken or omitted to take any action which could
reasonably be expected to result in the loss of its status as a REIT, and no
such challenge is pending, or to Keystone's Knowledge, threatened. Each Keystone
Subsidiary which is a partnership, joint venture or limited liability company
has since its acquisition by Keystone (A) been classified for Federal income tax
purposes as a partnership or treated as a disregarded entity and not as an
association taxable as a corporation, or a "publicly traded partnership" within
the meaning of Section 7704(b) of the Code that is treated as a corporation for
Federal income tax purposes under Section 7704(a) of the Code, and (B) not owned
any assets (including, without limitation, securities) that would cause Keystone
to violate Section 856(c)(4) of the Code. Each Keystone Subsidiary which is a
corporation, and each other issuer of securities in which Keystone holds
securities (within the meaning of Section 856(c) of the Code but excluding
"straight debt" of issuers as described in Section 856(c)(7) of


                                      -17-
<PAGE>
the Code) having a value of more than 10 percent of the total value of the
outstanding securities of such issuer, has since its acquisition by Keystone
been a REIT, a qualified REIT subsidiary under Section 856(i) of the Code or a
taxable REIT subsidiary under Section 856(l) of the Code or otherwise qualified
as a "real estate asset" within the meaning of Section 856(c)(5)(B) of the Code.
Neither Keystone nor any Keystone Subsidiary holds any asset (x) the disposition
of which would be subject to rules similar to Section 1374 of the Code as
announced in IRS Notice 88-19 or Treasury Regulation Section 1.337(d)-5 or
Treasury Regulation Section 1.337(d)-6 or (y) that is subject to a consent filed
pursuant to Section 341(f) of the Code and the regulations thereunder.

            (iii) As of the date of this Agreement, Keystone does not have any
earnings and profits attributable to Keystone or any other corporation in any
non-REIT year within the meaning of Section 857 of the Code.

            (iv) Except as disclosed in Schedule 2.1(k)(iv) of the Keystone
Disclosure Letter, none of Keystone, any of the Keystone Subsidiaries or any of
the Keystone Joint Ventures is (i) subject, directly or indirectly, to any Tax
Protection Agreement or (ii) in violation of or in default under any Tax
Protection Agreement.

            (v) To Keystone's Knowledge, as of the date hereof, Keystone is a
"domestically-controlled REIT" within the meaning of Section 897(h) of the Code.

            (vi) Neither Keystone nor any Keystone Subsidiary is a party to any
Tax allocation or sharing agreement.

            (vii) Keystone does not have any liability for the Taxes of any
person other than Keystone and the Keystone Subsidiaries and the Keystone
Subsidiaries do not have any liability for the Taxes of any person other than
Keystone and the Keystone Subsidiaries (A) under Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law), (B) as a
transferee or successor, (C) by contract or (D) otherwise.

            (viii) Keystone and the Keystone Subsidiaries have disclosed to the
IRS all positions taken on its Federal income Tax Returns which could give rise
to a substantial understatement of Tax under Section 6662 of the Code.

      (l) Pension and Benefit Plans; ERISA. Except as set forth in the Keystone
SEC Documents: (i) all "employee pension benefit plans," as defined in Section
3(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
("ERISA"), maintained or contributed to by Keystone or any of the Keystone
Subsidiaries or any trade or business (whether or not incorporated) which is
under common control, or which is treated as a single employer, with Keystone
under Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code (a "Keystone ERISA Affiliate")
(the "Keystone Pension Plans") intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the
Code so qualify and have been determined by the IRS to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code (or has been timely submitted to the IRS for such
determination), no such determination has been modified, revoked or limited and
each such determination covers all amendments to such plan for which the
remedial amendment period has expired.

            (ii) Neither Keystone nor any Keystone ERISA Affiliate or Keystone
Subsidiary currently sponsors, contributes to, maintains or has liability
(whether contingent or otherwise) under (A) a "multiemployer plan" (as defined
in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) or (B) an employee benefit plan that was subject
to Part 3 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA, or Section 412 of the Code, or
Title IV of ERISA.


                                      -18-
<PAGE>
            (iii) Each Keystone Employee Benefit Plan (as defined herein),
related trust (or other funding or financing arrangement, if applicable) and all
amendments thereto are listed in Schedule 2.1(l)(iii) of the Keystone Disclosure
Letter, true and complete copies of which have been made available to PARTY B
and Merger Sub, as have the most recent summary plan descriptions, Form 5500s,
applicable trust agreements and, with respect to any Keystone Employee Benefit
Plan intended to be qualified pursuant to Section 401(a) of the Code, a current
determination letter.

            (iv) Except as set forth in the Keystone SEC Documents, all Keystone
Employee Benefit Plans and Keystone Severance Agreements comply and have been
administered in form and in operation in all material respects in accordance
with their terms and with all requirements of applicable Laws, none of Keystone
nor any of the Keystone Subsidiaries has received any claim or notice that any
such Keystone Employee Benefit Plan is not in compliance with, its terms and all
applicable Laws, regulations, rulings and other authority issued thereunder and
all other applicable governmental Laws, regulations and orders, and prohibited
transaction exemptions, including, without limitation, the requirements of ERISA
and all Tax rules for which favorable Tax treatment is intended and, to the
Knowledge of Keystone, no event has occurred which will or could cause any such
Keystone Employee Benefit Plan or Keystone Severance Agreement to fail to comply
with such requirements.

            (v) There are no actions, disputes, suits, claims, arbitration or
legal, administrative or other proceeding or governmental investigation pending
(other than routine claims for benefits) or, to the Knowledge of Keystone,
threatened alleging any breach of the terms of any Keystone Employee Benefit
Plan or of any fiduciary duties thereunder or violation of any applicable Law
with respect to any such plan.

            (vi) All contributions, premiums and other payments required by Law
or any Keystone Employee Benefit Plan or applicable collective bargaining
agreement to have been made under any such plan to any fund, trust or account
established thereunder or in connection therewith have been made by the due date
thereof.

            (vii) All individual employment, termination, severance, change in
control, retention bonus, post-employment and other compensation agreements,
arrangements and plans existing prior to the execution of this Agreement or
which will exist prior to the Closing, which are between Keystone or a Keystone
Subsidiary and any current or former trustee, officer or employee thereof,
including the name and title of such current or former trustee, officer or
employee, and the type of agreement, including the amount of payment due
thereunder upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, are listed in Schedule 2.1(l)(vii) of the Keystone Disclosure Letter
(collectively, the "Keystone Severance Agreements").

            (viii) None of the assets of any Keystone Employee Benefit Plan
(excluding the Keystone Option Plans) are invested in employer securities or
employer real property.

            (ix) There have been no acts or omissions by Keystone, any Keystone
ERISA Affiliate or Keystone Subsidiary which have given rise to or may give rise
to fines, penalties, taxes or related charges under section 502 of ERISA or
Chapters 43, 47, 68 or 100 of the Code for which any of them may be liable.

            (x) Except as set forth in the Keystone SEC Documents or as set
forth in Schedule 2.1(l)(x) of the Keystone Disclosure Letter, none of the
payments contemplated by the Keystone Employee Benefit Plans or the Keystone
Severance Agreements or any other agreements to which Keystone or any of the
Keystone Subsidiaries is a party, would, individually or in the aggregate,
constitute excess parachute payments (as defined in section 280G of the Code
(without regard to


                                      -19-
<PAGE>
subsection (b)(4) thereof)) or would exceed the amount deductible pursuant to
section 162(m) of the Code.

            (xi) Except as set forth in the Keystone SEC Documents, or as set
forth in Schedule 2.1(l)(xi) of the Keystone Disclosure Letter, none of
Keystone, any Keystone ERISA Affiliate or Keystone Subsidiary has any liability
or contingent liability for providing, under any Keystone Employee Benefit Plan,
Keystone Severance Agreement or otherwise, any post-retirement medical or life
insurance benefits, other than statutory liability for providing group health
plan continuation coverage under Part 6 of Title I of ERISA and section 4980B of
the Code or applicable state law.

            (xii) Except as set forth in Schedule 2.1(l)(xii) of the Keystone
Disclosure Letter, there have been no acts or omissions that would impair the
ability of Keystone, any Keystone Subsidiary (or any successor thereto) to
unilaterally amend or terminate any Keystone Employee Benefit Plan.

      (m) Labor and Employment Matters.

            (i) Except as set forth in the Keystone SEC Documents or as would
not be reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Keystone
Material Adverse Effect, there are no actions, disputes, suits or claims pending
or, to Keystone's Knowledge, threatened between Keystone or any Keystone
Subsidiary and any of their respective employees (collectively, the "Keystone
Employees").

            (ii) Neither Keystone nor any Keystone Subsidiary is a party to any
collective bargaining agreement or other labor union contract applicable to
Keystone Employees, nor to Keystone's Knowledge are there any activities or
proceedings of any labor union to organize any Keystone Employees.

            (iii) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Keystone Material Adverse Effect, to
Keystone's Knowledge, Keystone and each Keystone Subsidiary has complied, and is
in compliance in all material respects, with all applicable laws relating to
labor and employment practices, including all laws relating to terms and
conditions of employment, wages, hours, collective bargaining, workers'
compensation, occupational safety and health, equal employment opportunity and
immigration, and is not engaged in any unfair labor or unlawful employment
practice.

            (iv) No National Labor Relations Board unfair labor practice charge
(or litigation alleging such claim) has been filed or threatened or is presently
pending against either Keystone or any Keystone Subsidiary relating to a
Keystone Employee. There is no strike, work stoppage, walkout, slowdown,
handbilling, picketing or other "concerted action" involving any Keystone
Employees, and no grievance proceeding or other controversy is in progress,
pending or, to the Knowledge of Keystone or Keystone OP, threatened between
Keystone or any Keystone Subsidiary and any Keystone Employee or any union or
collective bargaining unit relating thereto.

      (n) Intangible Property. Keystone and the Keystone Subsidiaries own,
possess or have adequate rights to use all trademarks, trade names, patents,
service marks, brand marks, brand names, computer programs, databases,
industrial designs and copyrights necessary for the operation of the businesses
of each of Keystone and the Keystone Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Keystone
Intangible Property"), except where the failure to possess or have adequate
rights to use such properties, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be


                                      -20-
<PAGE>
expected to have a Keystone Material Adverse Effect. All of the Keystone
Intangible Property is owned or licensed by Keystone or the Keystone
Subsidiaries free and clear of any and all Liens, except those that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Keystone Material Adverse Effect, and neither Keystone nor any such Keystone
Subsidiary has forfeited or otherwise relinquished any Keystone Intangible
Property which forfeiture has resulted in, individually or in the aggregate, or
would reasonably be expected to result in a Keystone Material Adverse Effect. To
the Knowledge of Keystone, the use of Keystone Intangible Property by Keystone
or the Keystone Subsidiaries does not in any material respect, conflict with,
infringe upon, violate or interfere with or constitute an appropriation of any
right, title, interest or goodwill, including, without limitation, any
intellectual property right, trademark, trade name, patent, service mark, brand
mark, brand name, computer program, database, industrial design, copyright or
any pending application therefor, of any other Person, and there have been no
claims made, and neither Keystone nor any of the Keystone Subsidiaries has
received any notice of any claim or otherwise knows that any of the Keystone
Intangible Property is invalid or conflicts with the asserted rights of any
other Person or has not been used or enforced or has failed to have been used or
enforced in a manner that would result in the abandonment, cancellation or
unenforceability of any of the Keystone Intangible Property, except for any such
conflict, infringement, violation, interference, claim, invalidity, abandonment,
cancellation or unenforceability that, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to have a Keystone Material Adverse Effect.

      (o) Environmental Matters. For purposes of this Agreement, (x)
"Environmental Law" means any Law of any Governmental Entity relating to human
health, safety or protection of the environment, including, but not limited to,
the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
of 1980, as amended ("CERCLA") and (y) "Hazardous Material" means (A) any
petroleum or petroleum products, radioactive materials, asbestos-containing
materials, urea formaldehyde foam insulation, and transformers and other
equipment that contain dielectric fluid containing greater than 50 parts per
million polychlorinated biphenyls ("PCBs"); or (B) any chemicals, materials,
substances or wastes which are defined as or included in the definition of
"hazardous substances," "hazardous wastes," "hazardous materials," "extremely
hazardous wastes," "restricted hazardous wastes," "toxic substances," "toxic
pollutants" or words of similar import, under any applicable Environmental Law.
Except as disclosed in Schedule 2.1(o) of the Keystone Disclosure Letter or in
the environmental audits/reports listed thereon, and except as would not
reasonably be expected to have a Keystone Material Adverse Effect:

Joint Ventures has received written notice that any administrative or compliance
order has been issued that is still in effect, any complaint has been filed that

investigation or review is pending or threatened by any Governmental Entity with
respect to any alleged failure by Keystone, any Keystone Subsidiary or any
Keystone Joint Venture to have any permit required under any applicable
Environmental Law or with respect to any treatment, storage, recycling,
transportation, disposal or "release" (as defined in 42 U.S.C. (S) 9601(22)
("Release")) by Keystone, any Keystone Subsidiary or any Keystone Joint Venture
of any Hazardous Material in material violation of any Environmental Law.

            (ii) To the Knowledge of Keystone, (A) except in material compliance
with applicable Environmental Laws, there are no asbestos-containing materials
present on any property owned or operated by Keystone, any Keystone Subsidiary
or any Keystone Joint Venture, (B) there are no regulated levels of PCBs present
on any property owned or operated by Keystone, any Keystone Subsidiary or any
Keystone Joint Venture, and (C) there are no underground storage tanks, active
or abandoned, used for the storage of Hazardous Materials currently present on
any property owned or operated by Keystone, any Keystone Subsidiary or any
Keystone Joint Venture.

            (iii) None of Keystone, any Keystone Subsidiary or any Keystone
Joint Venture has received written notice of a claim, that has not been
resolved, to the effect that it is liable to a third party,


                                      -21-
<PAGE>
including a Governmental Entity, as a result of a Release of a Hazardous
Material into the environment in material violation of any Environmental Law at
any property currently or formerly owned or operated by Keystone, a Keystone
Subsidiary or a Keystone Joint Venture.

            (iv) None of Keystone, any Keystone Subsidiary or any Keystone Joint
Venture has received written notice of (A) any Liens arising under or pursuant
to any applicable Environmental Law on any Keystone Property or (B) any action
taken which could subject any Keystone Property to such Liens. To the Knowledge
of Keystone, no such action is in process. Keystone, the Keystone Subsidiaries
and the Keystone Joint Ventures currently do not have any duty under any
applicable Environmental Law to place any restriction relating to the presence
of Hazardous Material at any Keystone Property.

            (v) None of Keystone, the Keystone Subsidiaries or the Keystone
Joint Ventures has transported or arranged for the transportation of any
Hazardous Material to any location which, to the Knowledge of Keystone, is the
subject of any action, suit or proceeding that could be reasonably expected to
result in claims against Keystone, the Keystone Subsidiaries, or the Keystone
Joint Ventures related to such Hazardous Material for clean-up costs, remedial
work, damages to natural resources or personal injury claims, including but not
limited to claims under CERCLA and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder.

            (vi) Keystone, the Keystone Subsidiaries and the Keystone Joint
Ventures have made notification of Releases of a Hazardous Material where
required by applicable Environmental Law, and no property now or, to the
Knowledge of Keystone, previously owned or operated by Keystone, the Keystone
Subsidiaries, or the Keystone Joint Ventures is listed or, to the Knowledge of
Keystone, proposed for listing on the National Priorities List promulgated
pursuant to CERCLA or on any similar list of sites under any Environmental Law
of any other Governmental Entity where such listing requires active
investigation or clean-up.

            (vii) Keystone, the Keystone Subsidiaries and the Keystone Joint
Ventures have not entered into any agreements to provide indemnification to any
third party purchaser pursuant to Environmental Laws in relation to any property
or facility previously owned or operated by Keystone, the Keystone Subsidiaries,
and the Keystone Joint Ventures.

            (viii) None of Keystone, the Keystone Subsidiaries or the Keystone
Joint Ventures has in its possession or control any environmental assessment or
investigation reports prepared within the last four years that (A) have not been
provided to PARTY B prior to the execution of this Agreement or (B) that
disclose a material environmental condition which has not been addressed or
remediated with respect to the Keystone Properties which has not been addressed
or remediated or been made the subject of an environmental insurance policy
listed in Schedule 2.1(q) of the Keystone Disclosure Letter, except for such
reports that (1) contain information regarding the environmental condition of
any such property that has been provided to PARTY B or (2) reflect the results

ownership, operation or leasing of its properties makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so
qualified or licensed individually or in the aggregate, (x) would not have, or
would not reasonably be likely to have, a material adverse effect on the
business, properties, condition (financial or otherwise) or results of
operations of ProLogis and the ProLogis Subsidiaries (as defined herein), taken
as a whole, or on ProLogis and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (y) would
not, or would not reasonably be likely to, prevent or materially delay the
performance by the ProLogis Parties of any of their respective obligations under
this Agreement or the consummation of the Mergers or any other transaction
contemplated by the Agreement, (a "ProLogis Material Adverse Effect"), provided
that a ProLogis Material Adverse Effect shall not include any change with
respect to ProLogis or any of its Subsidiaries, to the extent resulting from or
attributable to (i) general national, international or regional economic,
financial or political conditions or events, including, without limitation, the
effects of terrorist acts that do not result in the destruction or material
physical damage of a material portion of ProLogis' real properties, (ii) the

obligation of Keystone or the Keystone Subsidiary, as the case may be,
constitute a valid and binding obligation of such ProLogis Party, enforceable in
accordance with its terms, subject as to enforceability, to bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other Laws of general applicability
relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general principles of equity
(regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in
equity or at Law).

            (iii) The execution and delivery of the Transaction Documents to
which it is a party do not, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, and compliance with the provisions hereof or
thereof, will not, conflict with, or result in any violation of, or default
(with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a
right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any material obligation,
or give rise to a right of purchase under, result in the creation of any Lien
upon any of the properties or assets of any of the ProLogis Parties under, or
require the consent or approval of any third-party lender under any provision of
(A) the organizational documents of any of the ProLogis Parties or, (B) any
Material Contract applicable to any of the ProLogis Parties, the respective
properties or assets of any of the ProLogis Parties, or any guarantee by any of

decree or Law applicable to any of the ProLogis Parties or any of their
respective properties or assets, other than, in the case of clauses (B), (C) and
(D), any such conflicts, violations, defaults, rights or Liens that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result in
a ProLogis Material Adverse Effect.

            (iv) No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or
registration, declaration or filing with, or permit from any Governmental Entity
is required by or with respect to any of the ProLogis Parties in connection with

any of the ProLogis Parties of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,
except for: (A) the filing with the SEC of such reports under Section 13(a) of

of any of the ProLogis Parties to perform its obligations hereunder or prevent
the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or
result in a ProLogis Material Adverse Effect and (E) such filings as may be
required under applicable Federal and state securities laws.

      (c) Litigation. There is no suit, action or proceeding pending, or, to the
knowledge of any of the ProLogis Parties, threatened against or affecting any of
the ProLogis Parties that would be reasonably likely to prevent the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

      (d) Interim Operations of Merger Sub, Partnership Merger Sub and Newco I.
Each of Merger Sub, Partnership Merger Sub and Newco I was formed solely for the
purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated hereby and, as of the
Closing Date and as of the Effective Time, except for obligations or liabilities
incurred in connection with its organization and the transactions, agreements
and arrangements contemplated by this Agreement, has engaged in no other

ProLogis or any ProLogis Subsidiary, with the SEC since January 1, 2001 (the

Documents and none of the ProLogis SEC Documents contained any untrue statement

therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except to the extent

filed and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement. Neither
ProLogis nor any ProLogis Subsidiary has any outstanding and unresolved comments
from the SEC with respect to the ProLogis SEC Documents. The consolidated
financial statements of ProLogis included in the ProLogis SEC Documents complied
as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements
and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have
been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the

      (f) Transaction Financing. In the aggregate, the ProLogis Parties have
access to sufficient Financing (as defined herein) through existing financing
sources to complete the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                              ADDITIONAL COVENANTS

      Section 4.1. Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Shareholders' Meeting.

      (a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, Keystone
shall prepare and file with the SEC a preliminary Proxy Statement for the
purpose of calling the Keystone Shareholder Meeting to obtain the Keystone
Shareholder Approval. The parties shall reasonably cooperate with each other in
the preparation of the Proxy Statement and to have such document cleared by the
SEC as promptly as practicable after such filing. Keystone will notify PARTY B
promptly following the receipt of any comments from the SEC and of any request
by the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for
additional information and will supply PARTY B with copies of all correspondence
with the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement. The Proxy Statement shall
comply in all material respects with all applicable requirements of Law and each
of Keystone, Keystone OP and the ProLogis Parties agrees that the information
provided by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement and each amendment thereto, at the time of mailing thereof and at the
time of the Keystone Shareholder Meeting, will not include an untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a


                                      -34-
<PAGE>
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. Keystone shall date the Proxy Statement as of the approximate date
of mailing to its shareholders and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to its shareholders at the earliest
practicable date. Whenever any event occurs which is required to be set forth in
an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, (i) PARTY B or Keystone, as
the case may be, shall promptly inform the other of such occurrences, (ii)
Keystone shall prepare and file with the SEC any such amendment or supplement to
the Proxy Statement; provided, however, that no amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement will be made without prior consultation of ProLogis and
providing ProLogis a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such
amendment or supplement, (iii) Keystone shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to have any such amendment or supplement cleared for mailing, to the
extent necessary, to Keystone shareholders as promptly as practicable after such
filing and (iv) Keystone shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to have
any such amendment or supplement mailed to its shareholders at the earliest
practicable date.

      (b) Keystone will, as soon as practicable following the date on which the
Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC, duly call, give notice of, convene and
hold the Keystone Shareholder Meeting (but in no event shall such meeting be
held sooner than ten days, or except as provided in Section 4.1(c) later than 45
days, following the date the Proxy Statement is mailed to its shareholders), for
the purpose of obtaining the Keystone Shareholder Approval. Keystone covenants
that, subject to Section 6.1, Keystone will, through its Board of Trustees,
recommend to its shareholders approval of the REIT Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents and further covenants
that the Proxy Statement will include such recommendation.

      (c) If on the date for the Keystone Shareholders Meeting or any subsequent
adjournment thereof pursuant to this Section 4.1(c), Keystone has not received
proxies representing a sufficient number of Keystone Common Shares to approve
the REIT Merger (but less than a majority of the outstanding Keystone Common
Shares have been voted against approval of the REIT Merger), Keystone shall
adjourn the Keystone Shareholder Meeting until such date as shall be mutually
agreed upon by Keystone and Merger Sub, which date shall not be less than ten
days nor more than 20 days after the date of adjournment, and shall continue to
use its commercially reasonable efforts, together with its proxy solicitor, to
assist in the solicitation of proxies from shareholders relating to the Keystone
Shareholder Approval.

      Section 4.2. Partner Solicitation Materials.

      (a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the ProLogis Parties shall prepare solicitation materials (the
"Partner Solicitation Materials"), which will be used by Newco I as a private
placement memorandum to offer the Newco I Common Units to the Keystone Common
Unit Holders and by Keystone and Keystone OP to solicit the Keystone Partner
Approval. The Partner Solicitation Materials shall be prepared by the ProLogis
Parties in compliance with applicable Law and shall include information about
PARTY B, Newco I and Partnership Merger Sub, a description of the transaction,
the Federal income tax consequences of the transaction and other matters that
the parties reasonably determine are to be specified therein. The parties shall
cooperate in a commercially reasonable manner with each other in the preparation
of the Partner Solicitation Materials.

      (b) None of Keystone or PARTY B or any of their respective Affiliates
shall supply information for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Partner Solicitation Materials that will, at the date mailed to Keystone Common
Unit Holders or at the Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. If


                                      -35-
<PAGE>
at any time prior to the Effective Time any event with respect to Keystone or
PARTY B or any of their respective Affiliates, or with respect to other
information supplied by Keystone or PARTY B or any of their respective
Affiliates for inclusion in the Partner Solicitation Materials shall occur which
is required to be described in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Partner
Solicitation Materials, Keystone or PARTY B, as the case may be, shall promptly
(but, in any event, within 24 hours of gaining Knowledge of such event) notify
the other of them in writing, which writing shall describe such event in
reasonable detail.

      (c) Unless and until Keystone's Board of Trustees has withdrawn its
recommendation in accordance with Section 6.1(e), Keystone shall (i) use its
reasonable best efforts, as the general partner of Keystone OP, to seek the
written consents and approvals of the Keystone Common Unit Holders to the
Keystone Partner Approval and (ii) recommend to the Keystone Common Unit Holders
approval of such matters, and include such recommendation in the Partnership
Solicitation Materials.

      (d) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, PARTY B shall prepare a form of election in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Keystone and Keystone OP (the "Form of Election"),
pursuant to which each Keystone Common Unit Holder will specify (A) the number
of Keystone Units which it desires to have converted into the right to receive
Newco I Common Units and (B) the number of Keystone Common Units which it
desires to have converted into the right to receive cash in the Partnership
Merger. In order to be eligible to elect to receive the Newco I Common Units, a
Keystone Common Unit Holder must qualify as an "accredited investor" under the
Securities Act. Any Keystone Common Unit Holder electing option (A) must also
agree to become a party to Newco I's OP Agreement and deliver a signature page
to the Newco I Partnership Agreement therewith, which agreement shall become
effective immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Partnership Merger.

      (e) Concurrently with the mailing of the Proxy Statement to Keystone
shareholders, Newco I shall mail Forms of Election to Keystone Common Unit
Holders, together with the Partner Solicitation Materials. An election to
subscribe for the Newco I Common Units shall be effective only if a properly
executed Form of Election is received by Newco I prior to 5:00 p.m., Eastern
Standard Time, on the business day preceding the Keystone Shareholders Meeting.
If a Keystone Common Unit Holder fails to return a duly completed Form of
Election within the time period specified above, such Keystone Common Unit
Holder shall be deemed to have elected to receive cash upon the conversion of
its Keystone Common Units in the Partnership Merger. Newco I and Keystone by
mutual agreement shall have the right to make rules, not inconsistent with the
terms of this Agreement, governing the validity of Forms of Election and the
issuance and delivery of Newco I Common Units, as applicable, in the Partnership
Merger.

      (f) Newco I shall reasonably cooperate with each Keystone Common Unit
Holder who validly elects to receive Newco I Common Units to take all other
reasonable and necessary steps so that such Keystone Common Unit Holders shall
become limited partners of Newco I and enjoy the full rights and benefits of the
Newco I Common Units.

      (g) The parties shall reasonably cooperate with each other with respect to
the matters set forth in this Section 4.2, and intend that the offer of the
Newco I Common Units shall be conducted as a private placement, exempt from the
registration requirements of the Securities Act.

      Section 4.3. Access to Information; Confidentiality. Keystone shall, and
shall cause each of the Keystone Subsidiaries and, to the extent permitted by
applicable contracts and Law, the Keystone Joint Ventures, to, afford to PARTY B
and its officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other
representatives, reasonable access upon reasonable prior notice and during
normal


                                      -36-
<PAGE>
business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time to all its
properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records but only to the
extent that such access does not unreasonably interfere with business or
operations of Keystone, the Keystone Subsidiaries (including Keystone OP) and
the Keystone Joint Ventures and, during such period, Keystone shall, and shall
cause each of the Keystone Subsidiaries and the Keystone Joint Ventures, to
furnish promptly to PARTY B (a) a copy of each report, schedule, registration
statement and other document filed by it during such period pursuant to the
requirements of Federal or state securities Laws and (b) all other information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as PARTY B may reasonably
request. Upon PARTY B's reasonable request, the officers of Keystone shall
confer with representatives of PARTY B as promptly as practicable concerning
operational matters, and in any event, shall promptly advise PARTY B orally and
in writing of any Keystone Material Adverse Effect. Each of Keystone and PARTY B
will hold, and will cause its respective officers, employees, accountants,
counsel, financial advisors and other representatives and Affiliates to hold,
any nonpublic information in confidence to the extent required by, and in
accordance with, and will comply with the provisions of the letter agreement
between Keystone and PARTY B dated as of March 19, 2004, as amended to date (as
so amended, the "Confidentiality Agreement"). Keystone shall also cause its and
its Subsidiaries' and the Keystone Joint Ventures' (to the extent permitted by
applicable contracts and Law) employees, counsel and financial advisors to
cooperate reasonably with PARTY B in its investigation of the business of
Keystone, the Keystone Subsidiaries and the Keystone Joint Ventures.

      Section 4.4. Reasonable Best Efforts.

      (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, each of PARTY B and Keystone agrees to use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, and to assist and cooperate with the other in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to fulfill all conditions applicable to such party pursuant
to this Agreement and to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious
manner practicable, the REIT Merger, the Partnership Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents, including (i) the
obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and
approvals from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary
registrations and filings and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be
necessary to obtain an approval, waiver or exemption from any Governmental
Entity, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals, waivers or
exemption from non-governmental third parties; and (iii) the execution and
delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement. In
addition, each of PARTY B and Keystone agrees to use their reasonable best
efforts to defend any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging the REIT Merger, the Partnership Merger, this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents,
including seeking to have any stay, temporary restraining order, injunction, or
restraining order or other order adversely affecting the ability of the parties
to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents entered
by any court or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed. If, at any time
after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry
out the purpose of this Agreement, the proper officers and directors of Keystone
and PARTY B shall take all such necessary action. From the date of this
Agreement through the Effective Time, Keystone shall timely file, or cause to be
filed, with the SEC all Keystone SEC Documents required to be so filed.

      (b) Keystone shall give prompt notice to PARTY B, and PARTY B shall give
prompt notice to Keystone, if (i) any representation or warranty made by it
contained in this Agreement that is qualified as to materiality becomes untrue
or inaccurate in any respect or any such representation or warranty that is not
so qualified becomes untrue or inaccurate in any material respect or (ii) it
fails to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition
or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement;
provided that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section shall not
limit or


                                      -37-
<PAGE>
otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such
notice; and, provided further, that failure to give such notice shall not be
treated as a breach of covenant for the purposes of Sections 5.2(b) or 5.3(b),
as the case may be.

      Section 4.5. Tax Treatment.

      (a) Tax Treatment of the REIT Merger. The parties shall treat the REIT
Merger for all Federal income tax purposes as a taxable purchase of the Keystone
Common Shares from the holders of record thereof by PARTY B in exchange for the
REIT Merger Consideration, and no party shall take any position inconsistent
with such treatment.

      (b) Tax Treatment of the Partnership Merger and Contribution to Newco I.
The parties shall treat for all Federal income tax purposes (i) the Partnership
Merger as a taxable purchase of the Keystone Common Units by PARTY B from each
holder of Keystone Common Units who receives, directly or indirectly, any cash
or consideration other than Newco I Common Units in connection with the
Partnership Merger and (ii) the contribution of Keystone Common Units to Newco I
by Contributing OP Unit Holders in exchange for Newco I Common Units as a
contribution governed by Section 721 of the Code; no party shall take any
position inconsistent with the foregoing treatment.

      (c) Subject to any action contemplated in Section 1.7(f), neither PARTY B
nor Keystone will take (or permit its Affiliates to take) any action following
the Closing that is inconsistent with Keystone's status as a REIT for any
period.

      (d) On or prior to the Closing Date, the ProLogis Parties shall, with the
consent of Keystone and Keystone OP, reach an agreement as to the manner in
which the consideration to be paid pursuant to this Agreement, together with any
assumed liabilities (the "Allocable Consideration"), shall be allocated among
the assets of Keystone and Keystone OP. Such allocation shall be made in the
manner required by Section 1060 of the Code and the regulation promulgated
thereunder. In making such allocation, the fair market values as reasonably
determined by the parties shall apply.

      Section 4.6. No Solicitation of Transactions.

      (a) Subject to Section 6.1, none of Keystone or any Keystone Subsidiary
shall, nor shall it authorize or permit, directly or indirectly, any officer,
trustee, director, employee, agent, investment banker, financial advisor,
attorney, accountant, broker, finder or other agent, representative or Affiliate
of Keystone or any Keystone Subsidiary to initiate, solicit, encourage or
facilitate (including by way of furnishing nonpublic information or assistance)
any inquiries or the making of any proposal or other action that constitutes, or
may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Competing Transaction (as defined
herein), or enter into discussions or negotiate with any Person in furtherance
of such inquiries or to obtain a Competing Transaction. Keystone shall, and
shall cause the Keystone Subsidiaries and, to the extent within Keystone's and
Keystone OP's control, the Keystone Joint Ventures to, and Keystone and the
Keystone Subsidiaries shall, take all actions reasonably necessary to cause
their respective officers, trustees, directors, employees, investment bankers,
financial advisors, attorneys, accountants, brokers, finders and any other
agents, representatives or Affiliates to, immediately cease any discussions,
negotiations or communications with any party or parties with respect to any
Competing Transaction. Keystone and Keystone OP shall be responsible for any
failure on the part of their respective officers, trustees, directors,
employees, investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants,
brokers, finders and any other agents, representatives or Affiliates to comply
with this Section 4.6(a). Keystone shall promptly request each person that has
heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with its
consideration of acquiring (whether by merger, acquisition, stock sale, asset
sale or otherwise) Keystone or any Keystone Subsidiary or any Keystone Joint
Venture, if any, to return all confidential


                                      -38-
<PAGE>
information heretofore furnished to such person by or on behalf of Keystone or
any Keystone Subsidiary or any Keystone Joint Venture.

      (b) Keystone shall notify PARTY B in writing (as promptly as practicable
but in any event within 24 hours of receipt) of the relevant details relating to
all inquiries and proposals (including the identity of the parties, price and
other terms thereof) which it or any of the Keystone Subsidiaries or Keystone
Joint Ventures or any such officer, trustee, director, employee, agent,
investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant, broker, finder or
other representative or Affiliate may receive after the date hereof relating to
any of such matters and shall promptly inform PARTY B in writing with respect to
any such inquiry or proposal that becomes reasonably likely to lead to a
proposal for a Competing Transaction (as defined herein), regardless of whether
or not such proposal is likely to lead to a Superior Competing Transaction.

      (c) For purposes of this Agreement, a "Competing Transaction" shall mean
any of the following (other than the transactions expressly provided for in this
Agreement): (i) any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination
or similar transaction involving Keystone (or any of the Keystone Subsidiaries,
including Keystone OP, or Keystone Joint Ventures); (ii) any sale, lease,
exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other disposition of 50% or more of the
assets of Keystone and the Keystone Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in a single
transaction or series of related transactions, excluding any bona fide financing
transactions which do not, individually or in the aggregate, have as a purpose
or effect the sale or transfer of control of such assets; or (iii) any tender
offer or exchange offer for 50% or more of the voting power in the election of
trustees exercisable by the holders of outstanding equity securities of Keystone
(or any of the Keystone Subsidiaries, including Keystone OP).

      (d) For purposes of this Agreement, a "Superior Competing Transaction"
means a bona fide proposal for a Competing Transaction made by a third party
which the Board of Trustees of Keystone determines (after taking into account
any amendment of the terms of the Mergers by PARTY B or Merger Sub and/or any
proposal by PARTY B or Merger Sub to amend the terms of the Transaction
Documents or the Mergers), in good faith and after consultation with its
financial and legal advisors, (i) is on terms which are more favorable from a
financial point of view to the Keystone shareholders and the Keystone Common
Unit holders than the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) would result in such third party owning, directly or indirectly,
all or substantially all of the Keystone Shares and Keystone Common Units then
outstanding (or all or substantially all of the equity of the surviving entity
in a merger) or all or substantially all of the assets of Keystone and the
Keystone Subsidiaries, (iii) is not subject to any material contingency,
including any contingency relating to financing, unless the Keystone Board of
Trustees affirmatively determines such contingency may likely be overcome or
addressed or the other party thereto has reasonably demonstrated in its written
offer its ability to overcome or address, including the receipt of government
consents or approvals, (iv) is reasonably capable of being consummated and (v)
was not solicited, encouraged or facilitated by Keystone or its Affiliates or
any of their respective advisors in breach of this Section 4.6.

      Section 4.7. Public Announcements. Keystone, ProLogis and the ProLogis
Parties shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or
otherwise making any public statements with respect to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents and shall not issue
any such press release or make any such public statement without the prior
consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed; provided, however, that a party may, without the prior consent of the
other party, issue such press release or make such public statement as may be
required by Law or the rules of any applicable stock exchange if it has used its
reasonable best efforts to consult with the other party and to obtain such
party's consent but has been unable to do so in a reasonably timely manner in
light of such requirements of Law or the rules of any applicable stock exchange.
In this regard, the parties shall make a joint public announcement of the
transactions


                                      -39-
<PAGE>
contemplated by the Transaction Documents no later than (i) the close of trading
on the New York Stock Exchange on the day this Agreement is signed, if such
signing occurs during a business day and before the close of trading, or (ii)
the opening of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the business day
following the date on which this Agreement is signed, if such signing does not
occur during a business day or occurs after the close of trading.

      Section 4.8. Transfer and Gains Taxes. PARTY B shall, with Keystone's good
faith cooperation and assistance, prepare, execute and file, or cause to be
prepared, executed and filed, all returns, questionnaires, applications or other
documents regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer,
value added stock transfer and stamp Taxes, any transfer, recording,
registration and other fees and any similar Taxes which become payable in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (together, with
any related interest, penalties or additions to Tax, "Transfer and Gains
Taxes"). From and after the Effective Time, PARTY B shall pay or cause to be
paid all Transfer and Gains Taxes without deductions withheld from any amounts
payable to the holders of the Keystone Common Shares or the Keystone Common
Units.

      Section 4.9. Employee Arrangements.

      (a) Employees. Within 45 days of the date of this Agreement, ProLogis will
notify Keystone of those Keystone Employees to whom ProLogis, in its sole
discretion, will make offers of employment in connection with the REIT Merger
(the "Offered Employees"). Subject to the following provisions of this Section
4.9, ProLogis' offers of employment to the Offered Employees shall be on such
terms and conditions as ProLogis determines in its sole discretion and shall be
effective as of and conditioned upon the Closing. Any Offered Employee who
accepts ProLogis' offer of employment and becomes an employee of ProLogis
effective as of the Closing shall be referred to herein as a "Transferred
Employee." The employment of any employee of Keystone or the Keystone
Subsidiaries who is not a Transferred Employee shall be terminated by Keystone
or the Keystone Subsidiaries, as applicable, prior to the Closing.

      (b) Keystone Severance Agreements. Following the Closing Date, ProLogis
shall honor in accordance with their terms all Keystone Severance Agreements
with respect to any employee of Keystone or the Keystone Subsidiaries (whether
or not a Transferred Employee) and ProLogis will not challenge the validity of
any obligation of Keystone or any Keystone Subsidiary under any such Keystone
Severance Agreement (whether or not arising before the Closing Date). Without
limiting the foregoing, ProLogis expressly agrees that, with respect to any
employee of Keystone or the Keystone Subsidiaries (whether or not a Transferred
Employee) who is a party to or covered by a Keystone Severance Agreement, the
Mergers shall constitute a change of control for purposes of their respective
Keystone Severance Agreements.

      (c) Benefit Plans. Following the Closing Date, ProLogis shall provide
Transferred Employees with the same benefits that are provided to other
similarly situated employees of ProLogis from time to time. With respect to any
benefit plan of ProLogis which is an "employee benefit plan" as defined in
Section 3(3) of ERISA and any other service based benefits (including vacations)
in which Transferred Employees participate, solely for purposes of determining
eligibility to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits but not for
purposes of accrual of benefits (except in the case of accrued vacation, sick or
personal time), service with Keystone or any Keystone Subsidiary immediately
prior to the Closing shall be treated for similar purposes as service with
ProLogis; provided, however, that such service shall not be recognized to the
extent that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits.

      Section 4.10. Indemnification; Trustees' and Officers' Insurance.


                                      -40-
<PAGE>
      (a) It is understood and agreed that Keystone shall indemnify and hold
harmless, and, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company and PARTY B shall
indemnify and hold harmless, each trustee, director and officer of Keystone or
any of the Keystone Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties"), as and to the same
extent as such Indemnified Parties are indemnified by Keystone or the Keystone
Subsidiaries as of the date hereof. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim
indemnification under this Section 4.10, upon learning of any such claim,
action, suit, demand, proceeding or investigation, shall notify Keystone and,
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company and PARTY B, promptly thereof;
provided that the failure to so notify shall not affect the obligations of
Keystone, the Surviving Company and PARTY B except to the extent such failure to
notify materially prejudices such party.

      (b) PARTY B and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification
existing in favor of, and all limitations of the personal liability of, the
trustees, directors and officers of Keystone and the Keystone Subsidiaries
provided for in the Keystone Declaration of Trust or Keystone Bylaws or Keystone
OP Agreement, as in effect as of the date hereof, with respect to matters
occurring prior to the Effective Time, including the Mergers, shall continue in
full force and effect for a period of six years from the Effective Time;
provided, however, that all rights to indemnification in respect of any claims
(each a "Claim") asserted or made within such period shall continue until the
disposition of such Claim. Prior to the Effective Time, Keystone shall purchase
an extended reporting period endorsement under Keystone's existing directors'
and officers' liability insurance coverage for Keystone's directors and
officers, in a form reasonably acceptable to Keystone, which shall provide such
directors and officers with coverage for six years following the Effective Time
of not less than the existing coverage under, and have other terms not
materially less favorable on the whole to the insured persons than, the
directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage presently maintained by
Keystone, so long as such endorsement is available for no more than $550,000;
provided that if such endorsement is not available for no more than $550,000
then Keystone shall purchase an endorsement in an amount and scope as great as
can be obtained for $550,000.

      (c) This Section 4.10 is intended for the irrevocable benefit of, and to
grant third party rights to, the Indemnified Parties and shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of PARTY B, Keystone and the Surviving Company. Each of
the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to enforce the covenants contained in
this Section 4.10.

      (d) In the event that PARTY B or the Surviving Company or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person or
entity and shall not be the continuing or Surviving Company or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any person or entity, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of PARTY B and
the Surviving Company, as the case may be, assume the obligations set forth in
this Section 4.10.

      Section 4.11. Assistance. From and after the date of this Agreement, if
PARTY B requests, Keystone and the Keystone Subsidiaries shall cooperate, and
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause Keystone's attorneys,
accountants, investment bankers and financial advisors and other representatives
to cooperate, in all reasonable respects in connection with any financing
efforts (including, without limitation, the refinancing or assumption of
existing indebtedness) of PARTY B or its Affiliates (including providing
reasonable assistance in the preparation of one or more offering circulars,
private placement memoranda, registration statements or other offering documents
relating to debt or equity financing) and any other filings that may be made by
PARTY B or its Affiliates, including, if applicable, with the SEC, all at the
sole expense of PARTY B (or its Affiliates). Keystone shall reasonably cooperate
with PARTY B and the Merger Sub in obtaining surveys, title commitments or
policies, engineering reports, environmental reports and appraisals with respect
to the Keystone Properties (it being understood that such activities shall be
conducted at PARTY B's expense).


                                      -41-
<PAGE>
      Section 4.12. Proxy Solicitor. Keystone shall engage a nationally
recognized proxy solicitor to assist in the solicitation of proxies from
shareholders relating to the Keystone Shareholder Approval and the approval of
the Common Unit Holders in connection with the Keystone Partner Approval.

      Section 4.13. Resignations. Upon the written request of PARTY B, (i)
Keystone shall cause any or all of the directors (or persons occupying similar
positions in any limited liability company or other entity) and/or officers of
each Keystone Subsidiary to resign or be removed or, as to officers, to resign
or be terminated, effective as of the Closing, and (ii) if Keystone or any of
its affiliated entities has the right to appoint any director (or person
occupying a similar position in any limited liability company or other entity)
or to cause the resignation or termination of any officer of any other entity in
which Keystone (directly or indirectly) owns an equity interest, Keystone shall
cause, effective as of the Closing, such director to resign or to be removed
and/or such officer to resign or be terminated.

      Section 4.14. Keystone Series D Unit Redemption. Unless the consent of the
holders of the Series D Units to the Partnership Merger has been obtained,
Keystone OP shall provide written notice of redemption of the Keystone Series D
Units to the holders of such units 30 days prior to the earliest date upon which
the Keystone Series D Units may be redeemed in accordance with the terms of the
Partnership Unit Designation of the Series D Units (the "Redemption Date") and
shall redeem the Keystone Series D Units on the Redemption Date.

      Section 4.15. Appointment to ProLogis' Board of Trustees. ProLogis will
offer Jeffrey E. Kelter a seat on the ProLogis Board of Trustees as a Class III
Trustee at the later to occur of the first regularly scheduled board meeting
after the Effective Time of the final Merger and September 23, 2004, subject to
Mr. Kelter entering into a mutually acceptable agreement with ProLogis that will
require his resignation upon terms and conditions to be mutually agreed upon by
the parties thereto. ProLogis will cause Mr. Kelter to be nominated as a Class
III trustee at the next annual meeting of the ProLogis Shareholders.

      Section 4.16. Registration Rights Agreements. Immediately following the
Effective Time, ProLogis shall cause ProLogis to be substituted for Keystone or
the Surviving Company with respect to each agreement listed on Schedule
2.1(c)(iii)(C) of the Keystone Disclosure Letter.

      Section 4.17. Indemnification.

      (a) Each ProLogis Party, jointly and severally, hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally agrees to pay, reimburse, indemnify and hold harmless Keystone
and its Affiliates, and its and their officers, directors, agents and employees
(collectively, the "Indemnified Parties"), from and against any and all claims,
demands, actions and causes of action based on any assertion by a holder of
Keystone Preferred Shares that the proposed plan to cause, or the consummation
of, the liquidation contemplated by Section 1.7(g) is contrary to the rights of
such holder of Keystone Preferred Shares under the Keystone Declaration of Trust
(each, a "Claim"), and any losses, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses and
disbursements (including legal fees and expenses), payable as incurred by the
Indemnified Party, reasonably incurred in defending or settling any such Claim
or in paying any judgment with respect to any such Claim.

      (b) Any Indemnified Party against whom any Claim is asserted shall give
the ProLogis Parties written notice promptly after learning thereof. The
Indemnified Party shall conduct and control the defense of the Claim for the
account and the risk, and at the expense, of the ProLogis Parties; provided,
that the ProLogis Parties shall, subject to the approval of Keystone (such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), select the legal counsel
(which shall have a national reputation) to


                                      -42-
<PAGE>
represent the Indemnified Parties in connection with such Claim; and provided
further, that the ProLogis Parties shall be kept informed of and allowed to
participate in the defense of the Claim. Failure to give prompt notice of a
Claim shall not affect the ProLogis Parties' obligations hereunder, except to
the extent that the ProLogis Parties are materially prejudiced by such failure
to give prompt notice. If the Indemnified Party fails to initiate the defense of
such Claim on a timely basis, or thereafter fails after reasonable notice to
defend the Claim with commercially reasonable vigor and effectiveness, the
ProLogis Parties will (upon notice to the Indemnified Party) have the right to
undertake the defense, compromise or settlement of such claim on their own
behalf and for their own account and risk, and at their own expense.

      (c) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, no
Indemnified Party shall settle any Claim without the prior written consent of
the ProLogis Parties, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

      (d) The parties agree that the existence of any Claim or order, legal
restraint or prohibition resulting from or arising out of any Claim shall not
constitute or contribute to a breach or failure of any representation or
warranty, covenant, agreement or condition in this Agreement.

      Section 4.18. Sarbanes-Oxley Act Compliance. Mexico shall continue its
existing and planned efforts to comply with all applicable provisions of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act"), and the rules and
regulations adopted by the SEC thereunder, including preparing appropriate
controls, procedures and documentation to comply with Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and Item 308 of Regulation S-K promulgated thereunder.

                              CONDITIONS PRECEDENT

      Section 5.1. Conditions to Each Party's Obligation to Effect the Mergers.
The respective obligations of the parties to this Agreement to effect the
Mergers and to consummate the other transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Documents on the Closing Date are subject to the satisfaction or waiver on or
prior to the Closing Date of the following conditions:

      (a) Shareholder Approval. The Keystone Shareholder Approval shall have
been obtained.

      (b) Partner Approval. The Keystone Partner Approval shall have been
obtained.

      (c) Series D Unit Approval. Either (i) the consent or vote in favor of the
Partnership Merger by the holders of the Series D Units shall have been obtained
or (ii) the Series D Units shall have been redeemed in accordance with Section
4.14.

      (d) No Injunctions or Restraints. No temporary restraining order,
preliminary or permanent injunction or other order issued by any court of
competent jurisdiction or other legal restraint or prohibition preventing the
consummation of the Mergers or any of the other transactions or agreements
contemplated by the Transaction Documents shall be in effect.

      (e) Other Approvals. All consents, approvals, permits and authorizations
required to be obtained from any Governmental Entity as indicated in Schedule
2.1(d)(iii) of the Keystone Disclosure Letter in connection with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall have been
made or obtained (as the case may be).


                                      -43-
<PAGE>

      Section 5.2. Conditions to Obligations of ProLogis Parties. The
obligations of the ProLogis Parties to effect the Mergers and to consummate the
other transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents on the Closing Date
are further subject to the following conditions, any one or more of which may be
waived by PARTY B, Merger Sub and Partnership Merger Sub:

      (a) Representations and Warranties. The representations and warranties of
Keystone and Keystone OP set forth in this Agreement shall be true and correct
on and as of the Closing Date, as though made on and as of the Closing Date
(except (x) for such changes resulting from actions permitted under Section 3.1
and (y) to the extent any representation or warranty is expressly limited by its
terms to another date), except where the failure of such representations and
warranties to be true and correct (without giving effect to any materiality,
Keystone Material Adverse Effect or any similar qualification or limitation), in
the aggregate, would not or would not reasonably be likely to have a Keystone
Material Adverse Effect, and PARTY B shall have received a certificate signed on
behalf of Keystone by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial
Officer of Keystone to such effect.

      (b) Performance of Covenants and Obligations of Keystone. Keystone OP and
Keystone shall have performed in all material respects all covenants and
obligations required to be performed by them under this Agreement at or prior to
the Effective Time, and PARTY B shall have received a certificate signed on
behalf of Keystone by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial
Officer of Keystone to such effect.

      (c) Material Adverse Change. Since the date of this Agreement, there shall
have occurred no changes, events or circumstances which, individually or in the
aggregate, constitute a Keystone Material Adverse Effect. PARTY B shall have
received a certificate signed on behalf of Keystone by the Chief Executive
Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of Keystone to such effect.

      (d) Opinion Relating to REIT and Partnership Status. PARTY B shall have
received an opinion dated as of the Closing Date of Clifford Chance US LLP, in a
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to PARTY B, regarding the
qualification of Keystone as a REIT under the Code through the Effective Date
and the classification of Keystone OP as a partnership and not as an association
taxable as a corporation for Federal income tax purposes. For purposes of such
opinion, Clifford Chance US LLP may rely on (in addition to customary
exceptions, qualifications, assumptions and representations for opinions of this
type) assumptions to the effect that (A) the REIT Merger will be treated for
Federal income tax purposes in the manner described in Section 4.5(b) hereof,
(B) Keystone will satisfy its REIT distribution requirements for its final
taxable year and (C) no action will be taken following the REIT Merger that is
inconsistent with Keystone's status as a REIT for any period prior to the
Mergers. Counsel to ProLogis may rely on the foregoing opinion in rendering
opinions as to the REIT status of ProLogis if ProLogis owns greater than 10% of
the shares of Keystone as of 30 days after the end of any calendar quarter.

      (e) Consents. All necessary consents and waivers from third parties set
forth in Schedule 5.2(e) of the Keystone Disclosure Letter in connection with
the consummation of the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Documents shall have been obtained, other than such consents and
waivers from third parties, which, if not obtained, would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Keystone Material Adverse
Effect.

      (f) Purchase of Keystone Realty Services' Capital Interests. PARTY B or an
Affiliate of PARTY B shall have consummated its purchase of at least 70% of the
voting power of Keystone Realty Services, Inc.



                                      -44-

      Section 5.3. Conditions to Obligations of Keystone or Keystone OP. The
obligations of Keystone OP and Keystone to effect the Mergers and to consummate
the other transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents on the Closing
Date are further subject to the following conditions, any one or more of which
may be waived by Keystone or Keystone OP:

      (a) Representations and Warranties. The representations and warranties of
PARTY B, Merger Sub and Partnership Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement shall
be true and correct on and as of the Closing Date, as though made on and as of
the Closing Date (except (x) for such changes resulting from actions permitted
under Section 3.2 and (y) to the extent any representation or warranty is
expressly limited by its terms to another date), except where the failure of
such representations and warranties to be true and correct (without giving
effect to any materiality, PARTY B Material Adverse Effect or any similar
qualification or limitation), in the aggregate, would not or would not
reasonably be likely to have a PARTY B Material Adverse Effect, and Keystone
shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of PARTY B by the Chief
Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of PARTY B to such effect.

      (b) Performance of Covenants or Obligations of PARTY B, PARTY B OP, Merger
Sub and Partnership Merger Sub. PARTY B, Merger Sub and Partnership Merger Sub
shall have performed in all material respects all covenants and obligations
required to be performed by them under this Agreement at or prior to the
Effective Time, and Keystone shall have received a certificate signed on behalf
of ProLogis by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of
ProLogis to such effect.

      (c) Material Adverse Change. Since the date of this Agreement, there shall
have occurred no change, events or circumstances which, individually or in the
aggregate, would have a ProLogis Material Adverse Effect. Keystone shall have
received a certificate signed on behalf of ProLogis by the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer of ProLogis to such effect.

      (d) Opinion Relating to REIT and Partnership Status. The Contributing OP
Unit Holders shall have received an opinion addressed to the Continuing OP Unit
Holders and the holders of Keystone Preferred Shares, dated as of the Closing
Date, of Mayer, Brown, Rowe & Maw LLP, in a form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Keystone, regarding the qualification of ProLogis as a REIT
under the Code and the classification of Newco I as a partnership and not as an
association taxable as a corporation for Federal income tax purposes. For
purposes of such opinion, Mayer, Brown, Rowe & Maw LLP may rely on customary
exceptions, qualifications, assumptions and representations for opinions of this
type.

      (e) Newco I Partnership Agreement. The Agreement of Limited Partnership of
Newco I, with only such changes from the form attached as Exhibit A hereto as
(1) have been approved by Keystone and the Contributing OP Unit Holders or (2)
that do not, and would not reasonably be expected to, adversely affect the
Contributing OP Unit Holders shall be in effect as the partnership agreement of
Newco I.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                                  BOARD ACTIONS

      Section 6.1. Board Actions. Notwithstanding Section 4.6 or any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent the Board of Trustees
of Keystone determines that its fiduciary duties under Law so require, as
determined by such Board in good faith after consultation with outside counsel,
Keystone may:



                                      -45-
<PAGE>
      (a) disclose to its shareholders any information required to be disclosed
under applicable Law;

      (b) to the extent applicable, comply with Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under
the Exchange Act with respect to a Competing Transaction; provided, however,
that neither Keystone nor its Board of Trustees shall be permitted to approve or
recommend a Competing Transaction which is not a Superior Competing Transaction;

      (c) if it receives a proposal for a Competing Transaction (that was not
solicited, encouraged or facilitated in violation of Section 4.6), (x) furnish
non-public information with respect to Keystone, Keystone OP and the Keystone
Subsidiaries to the Person who made such proposal (provided that Keystone (i)
has previously or concurrently furnished such information to PARTY B and (ii)
shall furnish such information pursuant to a confidentiality agreement which is
at least as favorable to Keystone as the Confidentiality Agreement) and (y)
contact such third party and its advisors solely for the purpose of clarifying
the proposal and any material contingencies and the capability of consummation,
so as to determine whether the proposal for a Competing Transaction is
reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Competing Transaction;

      (d) if its Board of Trustees determines in good faith (after consulting
with its outside counsel and financial advisors) that a proposal for a Competing
Transaction (which proposal was not solicited, encouraged or facilitated in
violation of Section 4.6) is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Competing
Transaction, continue to furnish non-public information and participate in
negotiations regarding such proposal; provided, however, that not fewer than 24
hours prior to any determination by Keystone's Board of Trustees that the
proposal for a Competing Transaction is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior
Competing Transaction, PARTY B shall be notified orally and in writing of
Keystone's Board's intention to take such action and Keystone shall negotiate in
good faith with PARTY B concerning any such new proposal by PARTY B prior to the
expiration of such 24-hour period; provided further that Keystone shall promptly
notify PARTY B if the Keystone Board of Trustees determines that a Competing
Proposal is not, and is unlikely to become, a Superior Competing Transaction;
and

      (e) approve or recommend (and in connection therewith withdraw or modify
its approval or recommendation of this Agreement and the Mergers) a Superior
Competing Transaction or enter into an agreement with respect to such Superior
Competing Transaction.

                                   ARTICLE VII

                        TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

      Section 7.1. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the Effective Time of the Partnership Merger whether before or after
the Keystone Shareholder Approval is obtained:

      (a) by mutual written consent duly authorized by the Boards of Trustees of
Keystone and the sole General Partner of PARTY B;

      (b) by PARTY B, upon a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement on the part of Keystone or Keystone OP set forth in this Agreement, or
if any representation or warranty of Keystone shall have become untrue, in
either case such that the conditions set forth in Section 5.2(a) or (b), as the
case may be, would be incapable of being satisfied by October 31, 2004 (the
"Termination Date");



                                      -46-
<PAGE>
      (c) by Keystone, upon a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement on the part of the ProLogis Parties set forth in this Agreement, or
if any representation or warranty of the ProLogis Parties shall have become
untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth in Section 5.3(a) or
(b), as the case may be, would be incapable of being satisfied by the
Termination Date;

      (d) by either PARTY B or Keystone, if any judgment, injunction, order,
decree or action by any Governmental Entity of competent authority preventing
the consummation of the Mergers shall have become final and nonappealable;

      (e) by either PARTY B or Keystone, if the Mergers shall not have been
consummated before the Termination Date; provided, however, that a party that
has materially breached a representation, warranty or covenant of such party set
forth in this Agreement shall not be entitled to exercise its right to terminate
under this Section 7.1(e);

      (f) by PARTY B or Keystone if, upon a vote at a duly held Keystone
Shareholder Meeting or any adjournment thereof, the Keystone Shareholder
Approval shall not have been obtained, as contemplated by Section 4.1(a), or if
the Keystone Partner Approval shall not have been obtained, as contemplated by
Section 4.2;

      (g) by Keystone, if the Board of Trustees of Keystone or any committee
thereof shall have withdrawn its recommendation of the Mergers or this Agreement
in connection with, or approved or recommended, a Superior Competing Transaction
in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.1 and has paid, or has agreed in
writing to pay, the PARTY B Break-Up Fee and PARTY B Expenses in accordance with
this Agreement; or

      (h) by PARTY B, if (i) prior to the Keystone Shareholder Meeting the Board
of Trustees of Keystone or any committee thereof shall have withdrawn or
modified in any manner adverse to PARTY B its approval or recommendation of the
Mergers or this Agreement in connection with, or approved or recommended, any
Superior Competing Transaction, (ii) Keystone or Keystone OP shall have entered
into any agreement with respect to any Superior Competing Transaction or (iii)
the Board of Trustees of Keystone or any committee thereof shall have resolved
to do any of the foregoing.

      The right of any party hereto to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 7.1 shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of
any investigation made by or on behalf of any party hereto, any Affiliate of any
such party or any of their respective officers, directors or trustees, whether
prior to or after the execution of this Agreement. A terminating party shall
provide written notice of termination to the other parties specifying with
particularity the reason for such termination. If more than one provision in
this Section 7.1 is available to a terminating party in connection with a
termination, a terminating party may rely on any and all available provisions in
this Section 7.1 for any such termination.

      Section 7.2. Expenses.

      (a) Except as otherwise specified in this Section 7.2 or agreed in writing
by the parties, all out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement, the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby shall
be paid by the party incurring such cost or expense.

      (b) Keystone agrees that if this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to
(A) Section 7.1(b), then Keystone will pay to PARTY B, or as directed by PARTY
B, an amount equal to the PARTY B Break-Up Expenses (as defined herein) or (B)
Section 7.1(g) or 7.1(h), then Keystone will pay to PARTY B, or as directed by
PARTY B, an amount equal to the PARTY B Break-Up Fee (as defined


                                      -47-
<PAGE>
herein); provided, that in either case, such amount shall be paid promptly, but
in no event later than two business days after such termination. Keystone also
agrees that if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(b) or 7.1(f)
and (A) after the date hereof and prior to such termination, a Person (or any
representative of such Person) has made any inquiry or proposal relating to a
Competing Transaction and (B) within one year of any such termination Keystone
or Keystone OP shall consummate a Competing Transaction, in the case of a
termination pursuant to Section 7.1(b), with any Person, and in the case of a
termination pursuant to Section 7.1(f), with such Person or its Affiliates,
then, Keystone shall pay to ProLogis, or as directed by ProLogis, an amount
equal to the PARTY B Break-Up Fee less any PARTY B Break-Up Expenses previously
paid. Payment of any of such amounts shall be made, as directed by ProLogis, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds promptly, but in no event later
than two business days after the amount is due as provided herein. For purposes
of this Agreement, the "PARTY B Break-Up Fee" shall be an amount equal to
$27,000,000. For purposes of this Agreement, the "PARTY B Break-Up Expenses"
shall be an amount equal to PARTY B's out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the other transactions contemplated hereby
(including, without limitation, all attorneys', accountants' and investment
bankers' fees and expenses) but in no event in an amount greater than
$2,500,000.

      (c) If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(c), then
PARTY B thereupon shall be liable to pay to Keystone in an amount equal to
Keystone out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby (including, without limitation, all
attorneys', accountants' and investment bankers' fees and expenses), but in no
event in an amount greater than $2,500,000.

      (d) The foregoing provisions of this Section 7.2 have been agreed to by
each of the parties hereto in order to induce the other parties to enter into
this Agreement and to consummate the Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, it being agreed and acknowledged by each of them
that the execution of this Agreement by them constitutes full and reasonable
consideration for such provisions.

      (e) In the event that either PARTY B or Keystone is required to file suit
to seek all or a portion of the amounts payable under this Section 7.2, and such
party prevails in such litigation, such party shall be entitled to all expenses,
including attorneys' fees and expenses, which it has incurred in enforcing its
rights under this Section 7.2.

      Section 7.3. Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either Keystone or PARTY B as provided in Section 7.1, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any liability
or obligation on the part of PARTY B or Keystone, other than the penultimate

party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or
otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.
