ii AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of March 28, 2006 (this "Agreement"),
by and among LANDAMERICA FINANCIAL GROUP, INC., a Virginia corporation
("Parent"), CTG ACQUISITION CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation and a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub") and CAPITAL TITLE GROUP, INC., a
Delaware corporation ("Company").

_RECITALS_

A. The Proposed Transaction. The parties hereto intend to effect a strategic
business combination through a reverse triangular merger of Merger Sub with
and into Company (the "Merger"), with Company being the Surviving Corporation
and, thereafter, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent.

B. Board Determinations. The respective boards of directors of Parent, Merger
Sub and Company have each determined that the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby are consistent with, and will further, their
respective business strategies and goals, and are in the best interests of
their respective shareholders and, therefore, have approved the Merger, this
Agreement, the plan of merger contained in this Agreement and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, as applicable, and Parent has approved the
Merger, this Agreement and the plan of merger contained in this Agreement as
the sole shareholder of Merger Sub.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement, the parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE 1

THE MERGER

Section 1.1  _Consummation of Merger; Closing Date_.

(a) Subject to the provisions hereof, Merger Sub shall be merged with
and into Company pursuant to the laws of the State of Delaware, and Company
shall be the surviving corporation (sometimes hereinafter referred to as
"Surviving Corporation" when reference is made to it after the Effective Time
of the Merger). Subject to the provisions hereof, Merger Sub and Company
shall file with the Delaware Secretary of State a Certificate of Merger in
accordance with all applicable legal requirements. The Merger shall become
effective on the date and at the time the Certificate of Merger has been
accepted for filing with said Secretary of State (such time is hereinafter
referred to as the "Effective Time of the Merger" or the "Effective Time").
Unless otherwise agreed upon by Parent and Company, the Effective Time of the
Merger shall occur no later than the third Business Day following the later to
occur of (i) the effective date (including expiration of any applicable
waiting period) of the last required Consent of any Regulatory Authority
having authority over the transactions contemplated under the  



 

1  Merger Agreement and (ii) the date on which the shareholders of Company
approve the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) The Closing shall take place at the offices of Williams Mullen at 1021
East Cary Street, Richmond, Virginia, at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) on the day
that the Effective Time of the Merger occurs, or such other date, time and
place as the parties hereto may agree (the "Closing Date" or "Closing"). At
the Closing there shall be delivered to each of the parties hereto the
opinions, certificates and other documents and instruments required to be so
delivered pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 1.2 _Effect of Merger_. At the Effective Time of the Merger, Merger
Sub shall be merged with and into Company and the separate existence of Merger
Sub shall cease. The Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of Merger
Sub, as in effect on the date hereof and as otherwise amended prior to the
Effective Time of the Merger, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation and
the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until further amended as provided
therein and in accordance with applicable law. The Merger shall have the
effects set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL.

Section 1.3 _Further Assurances_. From and after the Effective Time of the
Merger, as and when requested by the Surviving Corporation, the officers and
directors of Company last in office shall execute and deliver or cause to be
executed and delivered in the name of Company, or any of its Subsidiaries,
such deeds and other instruments and take or cause to be taken such further or
other actions as shall be necessary in order to vest or perfect in or confirm
of record or otherwise to the Surviving Corporation title to and possession
of all of the property, interests, assets, rights, privileges, immunities,
powers, franchises and authority of Company and its Subsidiaries.

Section 1.4 _Directors_. From and after the Effective Time of the Merger, the
directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be those Persons serving as
directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time of the
Merger.

ARTICLE 2

BASIS AND MANNER OF CONVERSION; MANNER OF EXCHANGE

Section 2.1 _Conversion of Company Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of a holder of Company
Shares:

(a) Each Parent Share that is issued and outstanding at the Effective Time
shall remain issued and outstanding and shall remain unchanged by the Merger.
Each Company Share held by Company as treasury stock or by any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled, and no payment
shall be made in respect thereof.

(b) Subject to Sections 2.1(a), 2.1(c), 2.1(e), 2.2, 2.3, 2.5 and 2.6, each
Company Share issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time
shall be  



 

2  converted into, and shall be canceled in exchange for, the right to receive,
at the election of the holder thereof:

(i) a fraction, rounded to the nearest one thousandth, of a Parent Share equal
to "A" divided by "B" where "A" shall equal $8.00 and where "B" shall equal
the Parent Average Price as of the date of this Agreement (the "Exchange
Ratio"); provided, however, if the Parent Average Price as of the Effective
Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (the "Effective Time Stock Value") is:
(A) more than $8.25, then the Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted so that the
Effective Time Stock Value shall equal $8.25; or (B) less than $7.75, then the
Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted so that the Effective Time Stock Value shall
equal $7.75 (the "Per Share Stock Consideration"); or

(ii) cash in the amount of $8.00 (the "Per Share Cash Consideration").

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the aggregate
Merger Consideration shall be composed of 20% Parent Shares and 80% cash (the
"Consideration Mix"); provided, however, (x) Company may terminate this
Agreement if the Parent Average Price as of the Effective Time is equal to or
less than 85% of the Parent Average Price as of the date of this Agreement,
unless (i) Parent and Company mutually agree to alter the Consideration Mix or
(ii) Parent elects to pay 100% of the Merger Consideration in cash, and (y)
Parent may elect to pay 100% of the Merger Consideration in cash if the Parent
Average Price as of the Effective Time is equal to or less than 85% of the
Parent Average Price as of the date of this Agreement. 

(d) After determining the aggregate amount of Merger Consideration in
accordance with Sections 2(b) and (c), a determination shall be made as to
the total amount of cash to be paid as Merger Consideration, excluding amounts
deposited for Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 2.4(a) (the "Aggregate
Cash Consideration") and the total number of Parent Shares to be paid as
Merger Consideration (the "Aggregate Stock Consideration").

(e) In the event the number of outstanding Company Shares on a fully-diluted
basis immediately before the Effective Time exceeds the number of outstanding
Company Shares on a fully-diluted basis specified in Section 3.2, then the
dollar amounts specified in Section 2.1(b)(i) and (ii) shall be adjusted by
multiplying such dollar amounts by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be
the number of outstanding Company Shares on a fully-diluted basis specified in
Section 3.2 and the denominator of which shall be the number of outstanding
Company Shares on a fully-diluted basis immediately before the Effective Time.

Section 2.2 _Election and Allocation Procedures_.

(a) Subject to the allocation and election procedures set forth in this
Section 2.2, each record holder (or beneficial owner through appropriate and
customary documentation and instructions) of Company Shares immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be entitled (i) to elect to receive the Merger
Consideration in respect of each such Company Share entirely in cash (a "Cash
Election"), (ii) to elect to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of
each such Company Share entirely in Parent Shares (a "Stock Election"), or
(iii) to indicate that such record  



 

3  holder has no preference as to the receipt of cash or Parent Shares with
respect to such holders Company Shares (a "Non-Election"; and any Cash
Election, Stock Election or Non-Election shall be referred to herein as an
"Election"); provided, however, that no holder of Dissenting Shares shall be
entitled to make an Election. All such Elections shall be made on a form
furnished by Parent for that purpose (a "Form of Election") and reasonably
satisfactory to Company. If more than one certificate which immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented outstanding Company Shares (a "Certificate")
shall be surrendered in accordance with Section 2.2(f) hereof for the account
of the same holder, the number of Parent Shares, if any, to be issued to such
holder in exchange for the Certificates which have been surrendered in
accordance with Section 2.2(f) hereof shall be computed on the basis of the
aggregate number of Company Shares represented by all of the Certificates
surrendered for the account of such holder. Holders of record of Company
Shares who hold such Company Shares as nominees, trustees or in other
representative capacities may submit multiple Forms of Election, provided that
such nominee, trustee or representative certifies that each such Form of
Election covers all Company Shares held for a particular beneficial owner.

(b) If the aggregate number of Company Shares with respect to which Cash
Elections have been made exceeds the aggregate number of Company Shares that
may be converted into the right to receive the Aggregate Cash Consideration
(the "Aggregate Cash Shares"), then:

(i) each Company Share with respect to which a Stock Election shall have been
made shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock
Consideration;

(ii) each Company Share with respect to which a Non-Election shall have been
made (or deemed to have been made) shall be converted into the right to
receive the Per Share Stock Consideration; and

(iii) each Company Share with respect to which a Cash Election shall have
been made shall be converted into the right to receive: (x) the amount in
cash, without interest, equal to the product of (A) the Per Share Cash
Consideration and (B) a fraction (the "Cash Fraction"), the numerator of
which shall be the Aggregate Cash Shares, and the denominator of which shall
be the aggregate number of Company Shares with respect to which Cash Elections
shall have been made, and (y) the number of Parent Shares equal to the
product of (A) the Per Share Stock Consideration and (B) a fraction equal to
one minus the Cash Fraction.

(c) If the aggregate number of Company Shares with respect to which Stock
Elections have been made exceeds the aggregate number of Company Shares that
may be converted into the right to receive the Aggregate Stock Consideration
(the "Aggregate Stock Shares"), then:

(i) each Company Share with respect to which a Cash Election shall have been
made shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash
Consideration;



 

4 (ii) each Company Share with respect to which a Non-Election shall have been
made (or deemed to have been made) shall be converted into the right to
receive the Per Share Cash Consideration; and

(iii) each Company Share with respect to which a Stock Election shall have
been made shall be converted into the right to receive: (x) the number of
Parent Shares equal to the product of (A) the Per Share Stock Consideration
and (B) a fraction (the "Stock Fraction"), the numerator of which shall be
the Aggregate Stock Shares, and the denominator of which shall be the
aggregate number of Company Shares with respect to which Stock Elections shall
have been made, and (y) the amount in cash, without interest, equal to the
product of (A) the Per Share Cash Consideration and (B) a fraction equal to
one minus the Stock Fraction.

(d) In the event that neither Section 2.2(b) nor Section 2.2(c) is applicable,
then:

(i) each Company Share with respect to which a Cash Election shall have been
made shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash
Consideration;

(ii) each Company Common Share with respect to which a Stock Election shall
have been made shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Stock Consideration; and

(iii) each Company Common Share with respect to which a Non-Election shall
have been made (or deemed to have been made) (the "Non-Electing Shares"), if
any, shall be converted into the right to receive: (x) an amount in cash,
without interest, equal to the product of (A) the Per Share Cash
Consideration and (B) a fraction (the "Non-Election Fraction"), the numerator
of which shall be the excess of (1) the Aggregate Cash Shares over (2) the sum
of the aggregate number of Company Shares with respect to which a Cash
Election shall have been made, and the denominator of which shall be the
excess of (1) the aggregate number of shares of Company Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares and
shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(a)) over (2) the sum of
the aggregate number of Company Shares with respect to which a Cash Election
and a Stock Election shall have been made; and (y) the number of Parent
Shares equal to the product of (A) the Per Share Stock Consideration and (B) a
fraction equal to one minus the Non-Election Fraction.

(e) A Form of Election and a letter of transmittal shall be included with or
mailed contemporaneously with each copy of the Proxy Statement mailed to
stockholders of Company in connection with the Company Shareholders Meeting
(as hereinafter defined). Parent and Company shall each use its reasonable
best efforts to mail or otherwise make available the Form of Election and a
letter of transmittal to all persons who become holders of Company Shares
during the period between the record date for Company Shareholders Meeting
and the Effective Time.

(f) Elections shall be made by holders of Company Shares by delivering the
Form of Election to the Exchange Agent (as hereinafter defined). To be
effective, a Form of Election must be properly completed, signed and submitted
to and received by the Exchange  



 

5  Agent by no later than 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Standard) on the date that is five
(5) Business Days following the Effective Time (the "Election Deadline"), and
accompanied by (1)(x) the Certificates representing Company Shares as to which
the election is being made or (y) an appropriate guarantee of delivery of such
Certificates as set forth in such Form of Election from a firm which is a
member of a registered national securities exchange or of the NASDAQ or a
commercial bank or trust company having an office or correspondent in the
United States, provided such Certificates are in fact delivered to the
Exchange Agent within three NYSE trading days after the date of execution of
such guarantee of delivery (a "Guarantee of Delivery"), (2) a properly
completed and signed letter of transmittal and (3) if applicable, a properly
completed and signed affiliate letter in the form of _Exhibit 5.7_. Failure
to deliver Certificates covered by any Guarantee of Delivery within three NYSE
trading days after the date of execution of such Guarantee of Delivery shall
be deemed to invalidate any otherwise properly made Cash Election or Stock
Election. Parent will have the discretion, which it may delegate in whole or
in part to the Exchange Agent, to determine whether Forms of Election have
been properly completed, signed and submitted or revoked and to disregard
immaterial defects in Forms of Election. The good faith decision of Parent (or
the Exchange Agent) in such matters shall be conclusive and binding. Neither
Parent nor the Exchange Agent will be under any obligation to notify any
person of any defect in a Form of Election submitted to the Exchange Agent. A
Form of Election with respect to Dissenting Shares shall not be valid. The
Exchange Agent shall also make all computations contemplated by Sections
2.2(b), 2.2(c) and 2.2(d) above and all such computations shall be conclusive
and binding on the holders of Company Shares in the absence of manifest error.
Any Form of Election may be changed or revoked prior to the Election Deadline.
In the event a Form of Election is revoked prior to the Election Deadline,
Parent shall, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to, cause the Certificates
representing Company Shares covered by such Form of Election to be promptly
returned without charge to the Person submitting the Form of Election upon
written request to that effect from such Person.

(g) For the purposes hereof, a holder of Company Shares who does not submit a
Form of Election which is received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election
Deadline (including a holder who submits and then revokes his or her Form of
Election and does not resubmit a Form of Election which is timely received by
the Exchange Agent), or who submits a Form of Election without the other
documents required by Section 2.2(f), shall be deemed to have made a Non-
Election. Holders of Dissenting Shares shall not be entitled to make an
Election and shall not be deemed to have made a Non-Election; the rights of
such holders of Dissenting Shares shall be determined in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL and as provided in Section 2.6 hereof. If any Form of
Election is defective in any manner such that the Exchange Agent cannot
reasonably determine the election preference of the stockholder submitting
such Form of Election, the purported Cash Election or Stock Election set forth
therein shall be deemed to be of no force and effect and the stockholder
making such purported Cash Election or Stock Election shall, for purposes
hereof, be deemed to have made a Non-Election.

Section 2.3 _Fractional Shares; Adjustment_.

(a) No certificate or scrip representing fractional Parent Shares shall be
issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, and such fractional
share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other
rights of a stockholder of Parent.  



 

6  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of
Company Shares exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been
entitled to receive a fraction of a Parent Share (after taking into account
all Certificates delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof,
cash (without interest) in an amount equal to such fractional part of a Parent
Share multiplied by the Parent Average Price at the Effective Time.

(b) If at any time during the period between the date hereof and the
Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of
Parent or securities convertible, exercisable or exchangeable into capital
stock of Parent shall occur, including by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of
shares, or any dividend or distribution thereon (other than regular quarterly
cash dividends, the grant of capital stock or securities convertible,
exercisable or exchangeable into capital stock of Parent pursuant to any
equity compensation plan or arrangement of Parent, or the conversion, exercise
or exchange of securities in the capital stock of Parent pursuant to the terms
and conditions of any security of Parent issued and outstanding as set forth
Parents most recent 10-K) or a record date with respect to any of the
foregoing shall occur during such period, the number of Parent Shares
constituting part of the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted
to provide to the holders of the Parent Shares and Company Shares the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to the consummation of
such event.

Section 2.4 _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) Exchange Agent. Parent shall designate Computershare Trust Company, N.A.
(formerly EquiServe Trust Company, N.A.), or such other company as Parent and
Company may mutually agree, to act as the exchange agent (the "Exchange
Agent") for purposes of conducting the election procedure and the
exchange procedure described in this Article 2. At or immediately prior to
the Effective Time, (i) Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for
exchange or payment in accordance with this Section 2.4, through the Exchange
Agent, (A) certificates evidencing the total number of Parent Shares to be
issued in the Merger, (B) the Aggregate Cash Consideration, less the amount
deposited pursuant to Section 2.4(a)(ii), (C) any cash necessary to pay
amounts due pursuant to Section 2.3(a) and (D) the Per Share Cash
Consideration amount for each Dissenting Share and (ii) Company shall deposit
with the Exchange Agent all monies received by it after the date of this
Agreement and prior to the Effective Time due to the exercise of the Company
Options and the Company Warrants (such certificates for Parent Shares and such
cash being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Agent
shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions in accordance with this Article
II, deliver the Parent Shares and cash contemplated to be issued pursuant to
this Article II out of the Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated by Section
2.4(e), Section 2.4(f) or Section 2.7 hereof, the Exchange Fund shall not be
used for any other purpose.

(b) Exchange Procedures. Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Exchange
Agent together with a duly executed letter of transmittal prior to the
Election Deadline, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive
promptly, but in no event later than fifteen (15) Business Days following the
Effective Time in exchange therefor a certificate representing that number of
whole Parent Shares and/or cash which such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to the provisions of this Article II (after giving effect to
any required withholding tax).  



 

7  Until surrendered as contemplated by Section 2.2(f), each Certificate shall
be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration and unpaid dividends and distributions
thereon, if any, as provided in this Article II. If any portion of the Merger
Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that
the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall pay
to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a result of
such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate
or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been
paid or is not payable. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent,
the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will deliver, in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the proper amount of the
Merger Consideration as if such Certificates were properly surrendered in
accordance herewith, together with any unpaid dividends and distributions on
any such Parent Shares, as contemplated by this Article II and such
Certificate shall thereafter be deemed to have been properly surrendered for
all purposes hereunder.

(c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. Whenever a dividend or
other distribution is declared by Parent in respect of the Parent Shares, the
record date for which is at or after the Effective Time, that declaration
shall include dividends or other distributions in respect of all
Parent Shares issuable pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends or other
distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to Parent
Shares constituting part of the Merger Consideration shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Certificate, and no cash payment in lieu of
fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder, until such Certificate is
surrendered as provided in this Section 2.4. Following such surrender, there
shall be paid, without interest, to the Person in whose name the Parent
Shares have been registered (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date at or after the Effective
Time previously paid or payable on the date of such surrender with respect to
such whole Parent Shares, less the amount of any withholding taxes that may be
required thereon, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date subsequent to
surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
at or after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date
subsequent to surrender payable with respect to such whole Parent Shares, less
the amount of any withholding taxes which may be required thereon.

(d) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares. As of the Effective Time,
all Company Shares shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall
cease to exist, and each holder of a Certificate representing any such Company
Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive, upon surrender of such Certificate, the Merger
Consideration subject, however, to Companys obligation to pay any dividends
set forth on Disclosure Schedule 3.9(a) that are declared in accordance
therewith before the Effective Time. As of the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of Company shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on Companys stock transfer books of Company Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time,  



 

8  Certificates are presented to the Parent for any reason, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Section 2.4.

(e) Return of Merger Consideration. Upon demand by Parent, the Exchange Agent
shall deliver to Parent any portion of the Merger Consideration deposited
with the Exchange Agent pursuant to this Section 2.4 that remains
undistributed to holders of Company Shares one year after the Effective Time.
Holders of Certificates who have not complied with this Section 2.4 prior to
such demand shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of any claim to
the Merger Consideration and dividends or distributions, if any, in respect
thereof.

(f) Withholding Rights. Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the Merger Consideration and amounts payable pursuant to the Company Options
and the Company Warrants (and any dividends or distributions thereon)
otherwise payable hereunder to any Person such amounts as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any
provision of federal, state, local or foreign income tax law. To the extent
that Parent so withholds those amounts and pays such amounts over to the
applicable taxing authorities, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company
Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent.

Section 2.5  _Company Stock Options and Warrants_.

(a) As of the Effective Time, all rights with respect to Company Shares
issuable pursuant to the exercise of the Company Options and the Company
Warrants, which are outstanding and not exercised immediately prior to the
Effective Time of the Merger, shall expire and be canceled as of the Effective
Time without any action on the part of the holder thereof and no
consideration paid therefor.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all reasonable
actions that are necessary or appropriate to give effect to the transactions
contemplated by Section 2.5(a). Without in any manner limiting the foregoing
sentence, prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall procure from
each holder of Company Options and Company Warrants, and shall deliver to
Parent at the Closing, to the extent required by the terms of the applicable
Company Options and Company Warrants to give effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, an executed acknowledgment of the treatment
and disposition of such holders Company Options and Company Warrants and that
each such holder of Company Options and Company Warrants no longer has any
rights under any such Company Option or Company Warrant.

Section 2.6 _Shares of Dissenting Shareholders_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any Company
Shares that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that
are held by stockholders who shall not have voted in favor of the Merger and
who shall have demanded properly in writing appraisal of such shares in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and who object to the Merger and
comply with all provisions of the DGCL concerning the right of  



 

9  such person to dissent from the Merger and demand appraisal of such shares
(collectively, the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into
or represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration. Such stockholders
shall be entitled to receive the amounts determined in accordance with the
provisions of such Section 262\. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder
effectively withdraws the demand for appraisal or fails to preserve such
right to appraisal, in either case pursuant to the DGCL, such Dissenting
Shares shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have
become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive,
without any interest thereon, the Per Share Cash Consideration.

(b) Any payments relating to Dissenting Shares shall be made solely by the
Surviving Corporation from amounts set aside pursuant to Section 2.4(a)(i)(D)
or from other sources, and Company shall not make any payment with respect to,
or settle or offer to settle with, the holders of Dissenting Shares without
the prior consent of Parent. Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any
demands received by Company for the payment of fair value for Dissenting
Shares, and Parent shall have the right to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to Dissenting Shares.

Section 2.7 _Laws of Escheat_. If any of the consideration due or other
payments to be paid or delivered to the holders of Company Shares is not paid
or delivered within the time period specified by any applicable laws
concerning abandoned property, escheat or similar laws, and if such failure to
pay or deliver such consideration occurs or arises out of the fact that such
property is not claimed by the proper owner thereof, Parent shall be entitled
to dispose of any such consideration or other payments in accordance with
applicable laws concerning abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any
other provision of this Agreement notwithstanding, none of Company, Parent,
Merger Sub, the Exchange Agent, nor any other Person acting on their behalf
shall be liable to a holder of Company Shares for any amount paid or property
delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to and in accordance
with any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

of deposits, statutory premium reserve requirements and statutory pledges
with state regulatory authorities disclosed in the Financial Statements of the

contemplated. This Agreement, when duly and validly executed by Company and
delivered by Company (and assuming due authorization, execution and  



 

14  delivery by Parent and Merger Sub), will constitute a valid and binding
obligation of Company and will be enforceable against Company in accordance
with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting
the enforcement of creditors rights generally and except that the

Company or any of its Subsidiaries under, any of the terms, conditions or
provisions of any material note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust,
license, permit, lease, agreement or other instrument or obligation to which

(a) Disclosure Schedule 3.13(a) contains a true and complete list of each
pension, retirement, savings and profit-sharing, bonus, incentive deferred
compensation, severance pay or any other employee benefit plan, fund or
program with the meaning of the  



 

18  Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), and
any stock purchase agreement or arrangement, supplemental savings and profit
sharing plan, bonus retention plan, non-qualified deferred compensation plan,
change in control agreement, and all other plans contributed to, maintained or
sponsored by, any of, or on behalf of, Company, or any of its Subsidiaries,
whether written or unwritten, whether or not subject to ERISA and a general
description of Company incentive and/or commission plans typically used by
Company (each, "Employee Benefit Plans") covering present and former employees
of Company, or any of its Subsidiaries. Except for the Employee Benefit
Plans, Company and its Subsidiaries do not sponsor, maintain or administer any
other employee benefit plan, program, contract, policy or arrangement covering
current or former employees or directors of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. Company has, with respect to each such Employee Benefits Plan,
delivered to Parent true and complete copies of: (i) all current plan texts
and agreements and related trust agreements or annuity contracts and any

(b) Neither Company or any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any liability under,
arising out of or by operation of Title IV or ERISA (other than liability for
premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the "PBGC") arising in
the ordinary course of business), including, without limitation, any
liability in connection with (i) the termination or reorganization of any
Employee Benefit Plan subject to Title IV or ERISA; or (ii) the withdrawal
from any multiemployer plan (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA) or a
defined benefit pension plan that is subject to Section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA,
and no fact or event exists which could give rise to any such liability. There
has been no "reportable event" (as that term is defined in Section 4043 of
ERISA and the regulations thereunder) with respect to any Employee Benefit
Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA which would require the giving of notice to
the PBGC, and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement would not
trigger such a reportable event or withdrawal liability under Title IV of
ERISA.

(c) All contributions and premiums required by law or by the terms of any
Employee Benefit Plan or any agreement relating thereto have been timely made
(without regard to any waivers granted with respect thereto) and no
accumulated funding deficiencies exist in any of the Employee Benefit Plans
subject to section 412 or section 302 of ERISA.

(d) All Employee Benefit Plans, that are maintained by Company or any of its
Subsidiaries comply, in all material respects, and are being administered and
operated in material compliance with the applicable provisions of ERISA and
the Code that are applicable, or intended to be applicable, including, but
not limited to, COBRA, HIPAA and any applicable, similar state law, all
applicable regulations thereunder and the terms of the Employee Benefit  



 

19  Plans. Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any material
liability under any Employee Benefit Plan that is not reflected in the
Financial Statements of Company.

For purposes of this Agreement, "COBRA" means the provision of Section 4980B
of the Code and the regulations thereunder, and Part 6 of the Subtitle B of
title I of ERISA and any regulations thereunder, and "HIPAA" means the
provisions of the Code and ERISA as enacted by the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.

(e) No prohibited transaction (which shall mean any transaction prohibited by
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code and not exempt under Section
408 of ERISA) has occurred with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan.

(f) No Employee Benefit Plan which is a pension plan (as such term is
described in Section 3(2) of ERISA) has an "unfunded current liability," as
that term is defined in Section 302(d)(8)(A) of ERISA, or an "unfunded
benefit liability" and the present fair market value of the assets of any such
plan exceeds the plans "benefit liabilities," as that term is defined in
Section 4001(a)(18) of ERISA.

 

(g) Except as described in Disclosure Schedule 3.13(g), neither the execution
and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby will (i) limit Surviving Companys right to administer,
amend or terminate any of its Employee Benefit Plans, (ii) result in any
material payment (including, without limitation, severance, unemployment
compensation, golden parachute or otherwise) becoming due to any director or
any officer or employee of Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any
benefit plan or otherwise, (iii) materially increase any benefits
otherwise payable under any benefit plan or (iv) result in any acceleration
of the time of payment or vesting of any such benefits to any material extent.

(h) No Employee Benefit Plan is a multiemployer plan as defined in Section
414(f) of the Code or Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(31) of ERISA. Neither Company
nor any ERISA Affiliate has been a party to or participant in a multiemployer
plan or has a current or contingent obligation to contribute to any
multiemployer plan.

(i) There are no actions, liens, suits or claims pending or threatened (other
than routine claims for benefits) by or on behalf of any Employee Benefit
Plan, or by or on behalf of any individual participants or beneficiaries of
any Employee Benefit Plan, or against the assets of any Employee Benefit
Plan; and no assets of Company or any ERISA Affiliate are subject to any lien
under Section 302(f) of ERISA or Section 412(n) of the Code.

(j) Each Employee Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code has been determined by the Internal Revenue Service to be
so qualified, and such determination remains in effect and has not been
revoked; and no event has occurred or circumstance exists that will or could
give rise to a disqualification or loss of tax-exempt status of any such
plan or trust or result in the imposition of excise taxes or income taxes or
unrelated business income under the Code or ERISA with respect to any Employee
Benefit Plan.



 

20 (k) Except as described in Disclosure Schedule 3.13(k), no employee benefit
plan is a multiple employer plan within the meaning of Section 413(c) of the
Code or Section 4063, 4064 or 4066 of ERISA, and no Employee Benefit Plan is a
multiple employer welfare arrangement as defined in Section 3(40) of ERISA.

 

(l) Except as described in Disclosure Schedule 3.13(l), each employee pension
benefit plan, as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA, that is not qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code is exempt from Part 2, 3 and 4 of Title I of
ERISA as an unfunded plan that is maintained primarily for the purpose of
providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly
compensated employees, pursuant to Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3) and 401(a)(1) of
ERISA. Except as set forth in Disclosure Schedule 3.13(l), no assets of
Company or any of its Subsidiaries are allocated to or held in a "rabbi trust"
or similar funding vehicle. Except as described in Disclosure Schedule
3.13(l), each Employee Benefit Plan providing nonqualified deferred
compensation (as such term is defined in Code section 409A) complies in form
and operation with such Code section or is subject to an exception under
proposed Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, and no action has been
taken by Company or any of its Subsidiaries which would cause a stock right to
be subject to the requirements of Code section 409A. 

(m) No Employee Benefit Plan provides benefits to any current or former
employee of Company or any of its Subsidiaries beyond retirement or other
termination of service (other than coverage mandated by COBRA, the cost of
which is fully paid by the current or former employee or his or her
dependents).

and its Subsidiaries have all right, title and interest as a lessee under the
terms of each lease or sublease, free and clear of all liens, claims or

Statement and any amendments or supplements thereto, and at the time of the
Company Shareholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading. The Form S-4 will comply as to

statements of Parent in its 2005 Form 10-K or reflected in the notes thereto

required to be reflected in the consolidated financial statements of Parent
and its Subsidiaries prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting

Adverse Effect on Parent.

Section 4.15 _Contracts_.

(a) As of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any contract, arrangement, commitment
or understanding (whether written or oral) (i) which is a "material
contract" (as such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of
the SEC) to be performed after the date of this Agreement that has not been
filed or incorporated by reference in the Parent SEC Documents, or (ii) which
materially restricts the ability of Parent or the surviving corporation to
engage in any line of business. Each contract, arrangement, commitment or
understanding of the type described in clause (i) of this Section 4.15(a) is
referred to herein as a "Parent Contract" (for purposes of clarification,
each "material contract" (as such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of
Regulation S-K of the SEC) to be performed after the date of this Agreement,
whether or not filed with the SEC, is a Parent Contract).

(b) (i) Each Parent Contract is valid and binding on Parent and any of
its Subsidiaries that is a party thereto, as applicable, and in full force
and effect (subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or
affecting creditors rights generally, and general equitable principles
(whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law)), (ii) Parent and
each of its Subsidiaries has in all material respects performed all
obligations required to be performed by it to date under each Parent
Contract, except where such noncompliance, either individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on Parent, and (iii) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has Knowledge
of, or has received notice of, the existence of any event or condition which
constitutes, or, after notice or lapse of time or both, will constitute, a
material default on the part of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries under any

notification of Parent within 24 hours after Company has committed itself to
such purchase.



 

40 Section 5.2 _Current Information_. During the period from the date of this
Agreement to the Effective Time of the Merger or the time of termination or
abandonment of this Agreement, Company will cause one or more of its
designated representatives to confer on a regular and frequent basis with
representatives of Parent and to report the general status of the ongoing
operations of Company. Company will promptly notify Parent if it discovers
that any of its, or its Subsidiaries, representations or warranties in
Article 3 were untrue on the date hereof or become untrue as the result of
subsequent events and of any material change in the normal course of business
or the operations or the properties of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any
governmental complaints, investigations or hearings (or communications
indicating that the same may be contemplated) affecting Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, the institution or the threat of material litigation, claims,
threats or causes of action involving Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and
will keep Parent fully informed of such events. Company will furnish to
Parent, promptly after the preparation and/or receipt by Company thereof,
copies of its unaudited periodic financial statements for the applicable
periods then ended, and such financial statements, upon delivery to Parent,
be treated, for purposes of Section 3.3 hereof, as among the Financial
Statements of Company.

Section 5.3 _Access to Properties; Personnel and Records_.

(a) For so long as this Agreement shall remain in effect, Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, permit Parent or its agents full access,
during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, to the properties of
Company and its Subsidiaries and shall disclose and make available, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to disclose and make available, (together with the
right to copy) to Parent and to its internal auditors, loan review officers,
attorneys, accountants and other representatives, all books, papers
and records relating to the assets, stock, properties, operations,
obligations and liabilities of Company and its Subsidiaries, including all
books of account (including the general ledger), tax records, minute books of
directors and shareholders meetings, organizational documents, bylaws,
contracts and agreements, filings with any regulatory agency, examination
reports, correspondence with regulatory or taxing authorities, documents
relating to assets, titles, abstracts, appraisals, consultants reports,
plans affecting employees, securities transfer records and shareholder lists,
and any other assets, business activities or prospects in which Parent may
have a reasonable interest, and Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to provide Parent and its representatives access to the work papers of
Companys accountants.

(b) All information furnished by the parties hereto pursuant to this Agreement
shall be treated as the sole property of the party providing such information
until the consummation of the Merger contemplated hereby and, if such
transaction shall not occur, the party receiving the information shall return
to the party which furnished such information, all documents or other
materials containing, reflecting or referring to such information, shall use
its best efforts to keep confidential all such information, and shall not
directly or indirectly use such information for any competitive or other
commercial purposes. The obligation to keep such information confidential
shall continue for five years from the date the proposed transactions are
abandoned but shall not apply to (i) any information which (A) the party
receiving the information was already in possession of prior to disclosure
thereof by the party furnishing the information, (B) was then available to
the public, or (C) became available to the public through  



 

41  no fault of the party receiving the information; or (ii) disclosures
pursuant to a legal requirement or in accordance with an order of a court
of competent jurisdiction or regulatory agency; provided, however, the party
which is the subject of any such legal requirement or order shall use its best
efforts to give the other party at least ten Business Days prior notice
thereof so that such other party may seek a protective order or other
appropriate remedy, and provided further, in the event such other party is
unable to obtain a protective order or such other remedy, the party that is
subject to such legal requirement shall furnish only that portion of such
information which it is advised by counsel is legally required and shall use
best efforts to insure that confidential treatment will be accorded such
information. Each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that a breach of any
of their respective obligations under this Section 5.3 would cause the other
irreparable harm for which there is no adequate remedy at law, and that,
accordingly, each is entitled to injunctive and other equitable relief for the
enforcement thereof in addition to damages or any other relief available at
law. In addition, that certain Confidentiality Agreement between Parent and
Company, dated February 1, 2006 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), shall
remain in full force and effect (unless any terms therein conflict with this
Agreement, in which case the terms of this Agreement shall prevail) until the
Termination of this Agreement or the Effective Time, whichever shall occur
first.

Section 5.4 _Shareholder Approval_.

(a) Company shall take all steps necessary to duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders (the "Company Shareholders
Meeting"), to be held as soon as practicable after the date on which the Form
S-4 becomes effective, for the purpose of voting upon the approval of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Except
as permitted by Section 5.4(b) below, the Board of Directors of Company shall
recommend approval and adoption of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (the "Company Recommendation"), shall include
such recommendation in the Proxy Statement and shall use all reasonable
efforts to obtain the approval of this Agreement by the affirmative vote of
the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Shares entitled
to vote thereon at the Company Shareholders Meeting (the
"Company Shareholder Approval"). Unless permitted by Section 5.4(b) below,
neither the Board of Directors of Company nor any committee thereof shall (i)
withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose publicly to withdraw, modify or
qualify, in any manner adverse to Parent, the approval of this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated hereby or the Company Recommendation (any of the
foregoing, a "Change in the Company Recommendation"), or (ii) approve or
recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Alternative
Transaction. For purposes of this Agreement, a Change in the Company
Recommendation shall include any approval or recommendation (or public
proposal to approve or recommend) by the Board of Directors of Company or any
committee thereof of an Alternative Transaction, or any failure by the Board
of Directors of Company to recommend against an Alternative Transaction within
the ten (10) Business Day period specified in Rule 14e-2(a) under
the Exchange Act. In the event that Parent determines that additional time
may be required in order to seek the vote of Company shareholders required to
obtain the Company Shareholder Approval, Company will delay, postpone or
adjourn the Company Shareholders Meeting as requested by Parent.



 

42 (b) Prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, if the Board of
Directors of Company has not breached the provisions of Section 5.5, the
Board of Directors of Company may effect a Change in the Company
Recommendation, if and only to the extent that the Board of Directors of
Company determines in good faith (after consulting with outside legal
counsel) that failure to effect such Change in the Company Recommendation
would violate the fiduciary duties of Company Board of Directors under
Delaware corporation law; provided, that, prior to taking any such
action, Company has given Parent (orally and in writing) notice at least ten
(10) Business Days prior to such change, which notice advises Parent of the
decision of the Board of Directors of Company to take such action, including
the reasons therefor. 

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Board of Directors
of Company from complying with Rules 14d-9 or 14e-2 under the Exchange Act
with regard to an Alternative Transaction; provided, however, that any such
disclosure that relates to a Alternative Transaction (other than a "stop, look
and listen" letter or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be a Change in Company
Recommendation (and, for the avoidance of doubt, any such Change in Company
Recommendation shall be subject to the provisions of Section 5.4(b)) unless
the Board of Directors of Company reaffirms the Company Recommendation in such
disclosure.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, unless this Agreement
has been terminated in accordance with its terms, (i) this Agreement shall be
submitted to the shareholders of Company for the purpose of voting on the
approval and adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve Company of
such obligation, and (ii) Company shall not submit to the vote of its
shareholders any Alternative Proposal, shall not enter into any contract or
agreement providing for any Alternative Transaction and shall not permit the
consummation of any Alternative Transaction.

Section 5.5 _No Solicitation_.

(a) None of Company, or any of its Subsidiaries, or any officer, director,
employee, agent or representative (including any financial advisor, attorney
or other representative) of Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall directly
or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate, encourage, facilitate (including by way
of furnishing information) or take any other action designed to facilitate
any inquiries or proposals regarding any merger, share exchange,
consolidation, sale of assets, sale of shares of capital stock (including by
way of a tender offer) or similar transactions involving Company or any of
its Subsidiaries that, if consummated, would constitute an Alternative
Transaction (any of the foregoing inquiries or proposals being referred to
herein as an "Alternative Proposal"), (ii) participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding an Alternative Transaction or (iii) enter into any
agreement regarding any Alternative Transaction. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Board of Directors of Company shall be permitted, prior to the
meeting of Company shareholders to be held pursuant to Section 5.4, and
following at least 24 hours prior notice to Parent, and subject to compliance
with the other terms of this Section 5.5 and to first entering into a
confidentiality agreement with the Person proposing such Alternative Proposal
on terms substantially similar to, and no less favorable to Company than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, to consider and participate in  



 

43  discussions and negotiations with respect to a bona fide Alternative
Proposal received by Company, if and only to the extent that and so long as
the Board of Directors of Company reasonably determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel) that failure to do so would cause it
to violate its fiduciary duties.

(b) As used in this Agreement, "Alternative Transaction" means any of (i) a
transaction pursuant to which any Person (or group of Persons) (other than
Parent or its Affiliates), directly or indirectly, acquires or would acquire
more than 25% of the outstanding shares of Company common stock, Series A
Cumulative Preferred Stock or outstanding voting power or of any new series
or new class of preferred stock that would be entitled to a class or series
vote with respect to the Merger, whether from Company or pursuant to a tender
offer or exchange offer or otherwise, (ii) a merger, share exchange,
consolidation or other business combination involving Company (other than the
Merger), (iii) any transaction pursuant to which any Person (or group of
Persons) (other than Parent or its Affiliates) acquires or would acquire
control of assets (including for this purpose the outstanding equity
securities of Subsidiaries of Company and securities of the entity surviving
any merger or business combination including any of Companys Subsidiaries) of
Company representing more than 25% of the fair market value of all the
assets, net revenues or net income of Company, taken as a whole, immediately
prior to such transaction, or (iv) any other consolidation, business
combination, recapitalization or similar transaction involving Company, other
than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as a result of which the
holders of shares of Company immediately prior to such transactions do not, in
the aggregate, own at least 75% of the outstanding shares of common stock and
the outstanding voting power of the surviving or resulting entity in such
transaction immediately after the consummation thereof in substantially the
same proportion as such holders held the shares of Company common stock
immediately prior to the consummation thereof.

(c) Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours)
after receipt of any Alternative Proposal, or any material modification of or
material amendment to any Alternative Proposal, or any request for nonpublic
information relating to Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to
the properties, books or records of Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any
Person or entity that informs Company that it is considering making, or has
made, an Alternative Proposal. Such notice to Parent shall be made orally and
in writing, and shall indicate the identity of the Person making the
Alternative Proposal or intending to make or considering making an Alternative
Proposal or requesting nonpublic information or access to the books and
records of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and the material terms of
any such Alternative Proposal or modification or amendment to an Alternative
Proposal. Company shall keep Parent fully informed, on a current basis, of any
material changes in the status and any material changes or modifications in
the terms of any such Alternative Proposal, indication or request. Company
shall also promptly, and in any event within 24 hours, notify Parent, orally
and in writing, if it enters into discussions or negotiations concerning any
Alternative Proposal in accordance with this Section 5.5.

(d) Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
discussions or negotiations with any Persons (other than Parent) conducted
heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing. Company agrees not to release
any third party from the confidentiality and standstill provisions of any
agreement to which Company is or may become a  



 

44  party, and shall immediately take all steps necessary to terminate any
approval that may have been heretofore given under any such provisions
authorizing any Person to make an Alternative Proposal.

(e) Company shall ensure that the officers, directors and all employees,
agents and representatives (including any financial advisors, attorneys or
other representatives) of Company and its Subsidiaries are aware of the
restrictions described in this Section 5.5 as reasonably necessary to avoid
violations thereof. It is understood that any violation of the restrictions
set forth in this Section 5.5 by any officer, director, employee, agent or
representative (including any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney,
accountant or other retained representative) of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, at the direction or with the consent of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or otherwise as a result of the failure of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to meet their respective obligations hereunder, shall be deemed
to be a breach of this Section 5.5 by Company.

Section 5.6 _Notice of Deadlines_. Disclosure Schedule 5.6 lists the
deadlines for extensions or terminations of any material leases, agreements or
licenses (including specifically real property leases and data processing
agreements) to which Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party. 

Section 5.7 _Affiliates_. No later than thirty days following the execution of
this Agreement, Company shall deliver to Parent a letter identifying all
Persons who are, at the time this Agreement is submitted for approval to the
shareholders of Company, "affiliates" of Company for purposes of Rule 145
under the Securities Act. In addition, Company shall use commercially
reasonable best efforts to cause each Person who is identified as an
"affiliate" in the letter referred to above to deliver to Parent not later
than thirty days prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, a written
agreement substantially in the form of _Exhibit 5.7_ providing that such
Person will not sell, pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose of Company Shares
held by such Person, except as contemplated by such agreement or this
Agreement, and will not sell, pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose of the
Parent Shares to be received by such Person upon consummation of the Merger
except in compliance with applicable provisions of the Securities Act, and the
rules and regulations thereunder. Parent shall not be required to maintain
the effectiveness of any registration statement under the Securities Act for
the purposes of resale of Parent Shares by such Persons.

Section 5.8 _Maintenance of Properties_. Company will, and will cause each of
its Subsidiaries to, maintain its properties and assets in satisfactory
condition and repair for the purposes for which they are intended, ordinary
wear and tear excepted.

Section 5.9 _Consents to Assign and Use Leased Premises; Extensions_.

(a) With respect to the leases disclosed in Disclosure Schedule 3.15(b),
Company will obtain all Consents necessary to transfer and assign all right,
title and interest of Company to Merger Sub and to permit the use and
operation of the leased premises by Merger Sub on such terms as are reasonably
acceptable to Parent.



 

45 (b) At the election of Parent, with respect to each lease disclosed in
Disclosure Schedule 3.15(b) that expires on or prior to December 31, 2006,
Company shall take, or shall cause to be taken, all steps reasonably requested
by Parent to negotiate extensions of such leases on such terms as are
reasonably acceptable to Parent.

Section 5.10 _Conforming Accounting and Reserve Policies_. At the request of
Parent, Company shall immediately prior to Closing establish and take such
reserves and accruals as Parent reasonably shall request to conform Companys
accounting policies to the policies of Parent, provided however, such
requested conforming adjustment shall not be taken into account as having a
Material Adverse Effect on Company and further provided that no adjustment
will be made that does not conform to generally accepted accounting
principles. No adjustment shall violate any law, rule or regulation applicable
to Company. 

Section 5.11 _Publicity_. Except as otherwise required by law or the rules of
the NYSE or the NASDAQ, so long as this Agreement is in effect, neither
Parent nor Company shall, or shall permit any of their respective Subsidiaries
or Affiliates to, issue or cause the publication of any press release or other
public announcement with respect to, or otherwise make any public statement
concerning, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the
consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
In the event such press release, public statement or public announcement is
required by law, the announcing party will give the other party advance

Effective Time for a period of not more than six years after the Effective
Time at a cost not to exceed $290,000.

delivered hereunder in whole or in part by any Person other than Parent,
Merger Sub, Company (or directors and officers thereof in their capacities as
such) shall survive the Effective Time of Merger; provided that no
representation or warranty of Parent, Merger Sub or Company contained herein
shall be deemed to be terminated or extinguished so as to deprive Parent or
Merger Sub, on the one hand, and Company, on the other hand, of any defense
at law or in equity which any of them otherwise would have to any claim

Parent terminates due to Company or Company Subsidiary breach) or 10.1(g), and
such Alternative Proposal (whether or not modified after it was first made) is
consummated within one year after such termination, or (ii) this Agreement is
terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 10.1(e) (other than as a result of a
Change in Company Recommendation resulting from the occurrence of a Parent
Material Adverse Effect and the election of Parent not to pay 100% of the
Merger Consideration in cash) then Company shall pay to Parent on the date of
such termination, or in the case of sub clause (i) upon the earlier of
entering into an agreement providing for an Alternative Transaction and
consummation of an Alternative Transaction, a termination fee in the amount of
$15,000,000 (the "Termination Fee"). Company acknowledges that the agreements
contained in this Section 10.6(b) are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these agreements, Parent and
