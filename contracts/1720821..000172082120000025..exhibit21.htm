the Sellers' good faith estimate of (i) Closing Cash, and (ii) the Working
Capital as of the close of business on the Closing Date, in each case,
including the components thereof and reasonable back-up information with
respect thereto, and (iii) the calculation of the Closing Purchase Price based
on the foregoing. In the event that Purchaser

15

![image311.jpg](image311.jpg) notifies the Company of any objection to the Preliminary Statement no later
than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser and the
Company shall discuss such objections in good faith and the Company will, in
good faith and after taking into account the discussion between the Company
and Purchaser, revise and re-deliver the Preliminary Statement no later than
two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date to reflect the results of such
discussion (which revised and redelivered Preliminary Statement shall serve as
the Preliminary Statement for all purposes under this Agreement). At the
Closing, the Closing Purchase Price shall be (i) increased or decreased by the
amount that Closing Cash reflected on the Preliminary Statement exceeds or is
less than $0, respectively, and (ii) adjusted by the difference between the
Working Capital reflected on the Preliminary Statement and Twenty Four Million
Dollars ($24,000,000) (the "Targeted Working Capital"). If the Working Capital
reflected on the Preliminary Statement exceeds the Targeted Working Capital,
the amount of the Closing Purchase Price shall be increased dollar-for-dollar
by the amount of such excess, and if the Working Capital reflected on the
Preliminary Statement is less than the Targeted Working Capital, the amount of
the Closing Purchase Price shall be decreased dollar-for-dollar by such
shortfall.

(b) As soon as practicable, and in any event within ninety (90) calendar days
after the Closing, Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared and
delivered to the Sellers Representative a statement as of the close of
business on the Closing Date (the "Closing Statement") setting forth the
actual Closing Cash and the actual Working Capital of the Company. The Closing
Statement shall entirely disregard (i) any and all effects on the assets or
liabilities of the Company as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby
or of any financing or refinancing arrangements entered into at any time by
Purchaser or any other transaction entered into by Purchaser in connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) any of
the plans, transactions or changes which Purchaser intends to initiate or make
or cause to be initiated or made after the Closing with respect to the Company
or its business or assets, or any facts or circumstances that are unique or
particular to Purchaser or any of its assets or liabilities.

(c) Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company to, grant the Sellers
Representative and its authorized representatives reasonable access to all
such papers and documents and all such personnel as it or its representatives
may reasonably request, and the Sellers Representative shall have up to forty-
five (45) days after receiving the Closing Statement to review the Closing
Statement (the "Review Period"); provided, however, that, in the event
Purchaser or the Company does not provide any papers or documents or access to
personnel reasonably requested by the Sellers Representative or any of its
representatives within five (5) Business Days after request therefor (or such
shorter period as may remain in the Review Period), the Review Period shall be
extended by five (5) Business Days plus one (1) Business Day for each
additional day required for Purchaser or the Company to fully respond to such
request. The Sellers Representative shall deliver notice to Purchaser on or
prior to the expiration of the Review Period specifying in reasonable detail
all disputed items and the basis therefor. If the Sellers Representative fails
to deliver such notice by such date, the Sellers Representative and the
Sellers shall have waived their right to contest the Closing Statement. If the
Sellers Representative timely notifies Purchaser of any objections to the
Closing Statement, the parties shall, within twenty (20) Business Days
following the date of such notice (the "Resolution Period"), attempt to
resolve their differences and any written resolution by them as to any
disputed amount shall be final and binding for all purposes under this
Agreement.

16

![image311.jpg](image311.jpg) (d) If at the conclusion of the Resolution Period the parties have not reached
an agreement on any objections with respect to the Closing Statement, then all
amounts and issues remaining in dispute shall be submitted by the Sellers
Representative and Purchaser to the Independent Accountants for a
determination resolving such amounts and issues. All fees and expenses
relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the Independent Accountants
shall be borne by Purchaser and the Sellers Representative in the proportion
that the aggregate dollar amount of the disputed items submitted to the
Independent Accountants by such party that are unsuccessfully disputed by such
party (as finally determined by the Independent Accountants) bears to the
aggregate dollar amount of disputed items submitted by Purchaser and the
Sellers Representative. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, all
other costs and expenses incurred by the parties in connection with resolving
any dispute hereunder before the Independent Accountants shall be borne by the
party incurring such cost and expense. The Independent Accountants shall
determine only those issues still in dispute at the end of the Resolution
Period and the Independent Accountants' determination shall be based upon and
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The determination
by the Independent Accountants shall be based solely on presentations with
respect to such disputed items by Purchaser and the Sellers Representative to
the Independent Accountants and not on the Independent Accountants'
independent review. Each of Purchaser and the Sellers Representative shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to make its presentation as promptly as
practicable following submission to the Independent Accountants of the
disputed items, and each such party shall be entitled, as part of its
presentation, to respond to the presentation of the other party and any
questions and requests of the Independent Accountants. In deciding any matter,
the Independent Accountants (i) shall be bound by the provisions of this
Section 2.06(d) and (ii) may not assign a value to any item greater than the
greatest value for such item claimed by either Purchaser or the Sellers
Representative or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by
Purchaser or the Sellers Representative. The Independent Accountants'
determination shall be made within forty-five (45) calendar days after its
engagement (which engagement shall be made no later than five (5) Business
Days after the end of the Resolution Period), or as soon thereafter as
possible, shall be set forth in a written statement delivered to Purchaser and
the Sellers Representative and shall be final, conclusive, non-appealable and
binding for all purposes hereunder. It is the intent of the parties hereto
that the process set forth in this Section 2.06(d) and the activities of the
Independent Accountants in connection herewith are not (and should not be
considered to be or treated as) an arbitration proceeding or similar arbitral
process and that no formal arbitration rules should be followed (including
rules with respect to procedures and discovery). The term "Final Closing
Statement" shall mean the definitive Closing Statement agreed to by the
Sellers Representative and Purchaser if no items are disputed in accordance
with Section 2.06(c) or the definitive Closing Statement resulting from the
determination made by the Independent Accountants in accordance with this
Section 2.06(d).

(e) In the event that the sum of the Working Capital and Closing Cash as
reflected on the Final Closing Statement equals or exceeds the sum of the
Working Capital and Closing Cash as reflected on the Preliminary Statement,
then (i) Purchaser shall pay the Sellers the amount of such excess, if any, on
a pro rata basis in accordance with the Sellers' respective Pro Rata Shares,
in immediately available funds to such account or accounts as may be
designated by the Sellers Representative, and (ii) the Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Amount and any earnings thereon will be disbursed by the
Escrow Agent to the Sellers in the same manner as the payments in the
preceding clause (i).

17

![image311.jpg](image311.jpg) (f) In the event that the sum of the Working Capital and Closing Cash as
reflected on the Final Closing Statement is less than the sum of the Working
Capital and Closing Cash as reflected on the Preliminary Statement, then the
Escrow Agent shall pay the amount of such difference to Purchaser from the
Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount; provided, however, if such difference
exceeds the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount, the Sellers shall pay the
amount of such excess, on a pro rata basis in accordance with their respective
Pro Rata Shares, to Purchaser in immediately available funds to such account
or accounts as may be designated by Purchaser; provided further, however, that
if such difference is less than the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount,
the remaining balance of the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount shall be
disbursed by the Escrow Agent to the Sellers on a pro rata basis in accordance
with their respective Pro Rata Shares, in immediately available funds to such
account or accounts as may be designated by the Sellers Representative.

(g) If the Escrow Agent is required to pay or disburse an amount to the
Sellers pursuant to clauses Section 2.06(e) or Section 2.06(f), then Purchaser
shall direct the Escrow Agent to make such payment or disbursement from the
Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement within five (5) Business Days after the Final Closing Statement is
agreed to by the Sellers Representative and Purchaser or is finally determined
by the Independent Accountants in accordance with Section 2.06(d). If the
Escrow Agent is required to pay or disburse an amount to Purchaser pursuant to
Section 2.06(f), then the Sellers Representative shall direct the Escrow Agent
to make such payment or disbursement from the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow
Amount in accordance with the Escrow Agreement within five (5) Business Days
after the Final Closing Statement is agreed to by the Sellers Representative
and Purchaser or is determined by the Independent Accountants in accordance
with Section 2.06(d).

proposal or offer, or any inquiry or other contact with any Person with
respect thereto, is made.

(a) Each Seller (other than the ESOT) agrees that, for the three (3) year
period commencing on the Closing Date (the "Restricted Period"), such Person
shall not (i) directly or indirectly provide, to any Governmental Authority or
Person, any product or service that is directly competitive with the products
or services sold by the Company or any Company Subsidiary as of the Closing
Date; provided, however, that, for the purposes of this Section 6.06,

material respect with the business relationships (whether formed prior to or
after the date of this Agreement) between the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries and their respective customers or suppliers.

49

![image311.jpg](image311.jpg) (b) As a separate and independent covenant, each Seller agrees that during the
Restricted Period such Person will not directly or indirectly hire or induce
or attempt to induce any officers, employees or independent contractors of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary to leave the employ or service of the
Company or such Company Subsidiary or violate the terms of their contracts, or
any employment arrangements, with the Company or such Company Subsidiary;
provided, however, that the foregoing will not prohibit (i) a general
solicitation to the public of general advertising or the hiring or other
retention of any person who responds to any such general solicitation, or (ii)
the hiring of any person whose employment has been terminated by the Company,
a Company Subsidiary or Purchaser at least six (6) months prior to such
hiring.

(c) Each Seller acknowledges that the covenants set forth in this Section 6.06
are an essential element of this Agreement and that, but for the agreement of
the Sellers to comply with these covenants, Purchaser would not have entered
into this Agreement. Each Seller acknowledges that this Section 6.06
constitutes an independent covenant that shall not be affected by performance
or nonperformance of any other provision of this Agreement by Purchaser.

Section 6.07 Charter Protections; Directors' and Officers' Liability
Insurance.

(a) All rights to indemnification for acts or omissions occurring through the
Closing now existing in favor of each Person who is now, or has been at any
time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Closing Date, an

its articles of incorporation/organization, bylaws or under applicable Law
shall survive the transactions contemplated in this Agreement and shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.

(b) The Company shall obtain, prior to the Closing Date, with an effective
date as of the Closing Date "tail" insurance policies with a claims period of
six (6) years from the Closing Date with at least the same coverage and

the directors and officers of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, in
each case with respect to claims arising out of or relating to events which
occurred on or prior to the Closing Date (including in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement). The cost of such tail policy
shall either be paid by the Company prior to the Closing or included in
Sellers Expenses.

(c) If Purchaser or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, in each
such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Purchaser assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 6.07.

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.07 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each Person who will have been a director or
officer of the Company or a Company Subsidiary for all periods ending on or
before the Closing and may not be changed without the consent of the Sellers
Representative.

Section 6.08 Employee Matters. Purchaser shall, for a period of one (1) year
immediately following the Closing Date, generally cause the Company to provide
employees of the Company and the

![image311.jpg](image311.jpg) Company Subsidiaries (the "Company Employees") with (i) base salaries and
bonus/commission opportunities comparable, in the aggregate, as in effect as
of the date of this Agreement (together with any changes thereto on or prior
to the Closing Date that are approved by Purchaser in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement) to the Company Employees, and (ii) employee benefit
plans and programs that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, with
the Plans provided by the Company to similarly situated employees as of the
Closing Date. The Purchaser shall recognize the service of Company Employees
with the Company and any Company Subsidiary prior to the Closing Date as
service with Purchaser and its Affiliates in connection with any tax-qualified
pension plan, 401(k) savings plan and welfare benefit plans and policies
(including vacations and leave policies) maintained by Purchaser which are
made available following the Closing Date by Purchaser to Company Employees
for purposes of any waiting period, vesting, eligibility and benefit
entitlement (but excluding benefit accruals). The parties hereto acknowledge
and agree that the terms set forth in this Section 6.08 shall not create any
right in any Company Employee or any other Person to any continued employment
with the Company, any Company Subsidiary or Purchaser or any of their
respective Affiliates or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind
whatsoever.

Section 6.09 ESOP Matters

(a) As of the Closing, the ESOP Trustee shall have received the ESOP Fairness
Opinion from its independent financial advisor.

(b) Prior to Closing, the Company shall adopt an amendment to the ESOP
terminating the ESOP and providing for final allocations thereunder effective
immediately prior to the Closing. Such amendments to the ESOP shall, among
other necessary changes to effect the termination of the ESOP, provide for
100% vesting as required by law upon plan termination and for a distribution
of the benefits due each participant thereunder as soon as reasonably
practicable after Closing (the "Plan Amendment"). The Plan Amendment will by
its terms become effective as of the Closing Date. The Plan, as amended, shall
be referred to as the "Amended Plan".

(c) The Company will continue as sponsor of the Amended Plan after the Closing
Date until all distributions are complete in accordance with the Amended Plan.
Promptly after the Closing, the Company will file an application requesting
the Internal Revenue Service to issue a final determination letter (the "ESOP
Termination Determination Letter") with respect to the ESOP. Prior to the
Closing, the Company shall secure fiduciary liability insurance with coverage
until the ESOP is fully liquidated, and shall procure and pay the premiums for
"tail" coverage thereafter, with no deductibles and on a claims made basis,
covering the Company and its agents and plan administrators (the "Fiduciary
Policy"). The Company shall cause the newly-appointed plan administrators to
promptly arrange for update of ESOP participant account balances through the
closing/plan termination date, payment of partial distributions (if any), and
final distributions under the ESOP after receipt of the ESOP Termination
Determination Letter. The Company shall pay all filing fees, costs and
expenses associated with implementing the termination of the ESOP, including
making participant distributions from the ESOP and those related to the ESOP
Termination Determination Letter.

Section 6.10 Attorney-Client Privilege; Retention of Counsel. The parties
acknowledge that Greenberg Traurig, LLP ("Counsel") has represented the
Sellers and the Company in connection

51

![image311.jpg](image311.jpg) with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Purchaser and the
Company agree that any attorney-client privilege, attorney work-product
protection, and expectation of client confidence attaching as a result of
Counsel's representation of the Company or the Sellers in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and all information and documents
covered by such privilege or protection, shall belong to and be controlled by
the Sellers and not the Company from and after the Closing, and shall not pass
to or be claimed or used by Purchaser or, from and after the Closing, the
Company. In no event will the Company or Purchaser after the Closing object to
any Seller's or the Sellers Representative retention of Counsel in connection
with defending or prosecuting any claim relating to any Seller's
indemnification obligations under this Agreement or any alleged breach of this
Agreement or any document or agreement entered into in connection with this
Agreement.

Secton 6.11 RandW Insurance Policy. Prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall
maintain the RandW Insurance Policy as bound as of the date hereof and shall
timely satisfy all conditions necessary for the continuation of coverage under
the RandW Insurance Policy. Following the Closing, Purchaser shall not, without
the written consent of the Sellers Representative, amend the subrogation
provisions of the RandW Insurance Policy in a manner that is detrimental to the
Sellers.

Section 6.12 Sellers Representative.

(a) Each Seller hereby designates and appoints the Sellers Representative as
its representative, agent and attorney-in-fact for all purposes of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. This appointment and power
of attorney shall be deemed to be coupled with an interest and all authority
conferred hereby shall be irrevocable and shall not be subject to termination
by operation of Law, whether by the death or incapacity or liquidation or
dissolution of any Seller or the occurrence of any other event or events. The
Sellers Representative is serving in the capacity as representative, agent and
attorney-in-fact of such Sellers hereunder solely for purposes of
administrative convenience.

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 6.12(a), each Seller, among
other things, hereby irrevocably agrees:

making of any decisions required or permitted to be taken by the Sellers under
this Agreement.

to, investigate, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of and file
suit, seek arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of
arbitrators with respect to such obligations and claims; (B) resolve any claim
or dispute under or made pursuant to this Agreement; and (C) take all actions
necessary in the judgment of the Sellers Representative for the accomplishment
of the foregoing, including, without limitation, execution on any Seller's
behalf of any agreement, instrument, or other document that, in the sole
discretion of Sellers Representative, is necessary, desirable, or otherwise
appropriate to effect any such settlement or compromise;

(iii) that the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall be able to rely
conclusively without further inquiry on the instructions and decisions of the
Sellers Representative as to

52

![image311.jpg](image311.jpg) the settlement of any claims for indemnification by any one or more Purchaser
Indemnified Parties pursuant to ARTICLE IX and as to any other action taken by
the Sellers Representative hereunder; and

(iv) that the Sellers Representative is authorized to receive and to accept on
each Seller's behalf any notice from any Person claiming to be a Purchaser
Indemnified Party given in accordance with this Agreement (and any notice
given to the Sellers Representative shall be deemed to have been given to each
Seller).

(c) The Sellers' representative appointed pursuant to this Section 6.12 may be
changed, or a successor appointed, by the Sellers from time to time upon not
fewer than 10 calendar days' prior written notice to the Purchaser.

(d) The Sellers Representative shall not be liable for any act done or omitted
hereunder as the Sellers' representative, while acting in good faith and in
the exercise of reasonable judgment. The Sellers Representative may, at the
expense of the Sellers, consult with legal counsel (who may be former legal
counsel for the Company) and any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of
counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith. The Sellers shall
indemnify and hold the Sellers Representative harmless on a pro rata basis in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares against any loss, liability
or expense incurred without gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the
Sellers Representative and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance
or administration of his duties hereunder.

(e) The reasonable expenses incurred by the Sellers Representative (including
legal, accounting and other professional expenses) while acting on behalf of
the Sellers under the authorization granted in this Section 6.12 shall be
borne by the Sellers on a pro rata basis in accordance with their respective
Pro Rata Shares.

Section 6.13 Stockholder Approval re Section 280G. Prior to the Closing, the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to: (a) seek a stockholder
vote pursuant to the exemption contained in Section 280G(b)(5)(A)(ii) of the

Stockholder Vote") with respect to those Plans set forth in Section 4.19(b) of
the Disclosure Schedules, and (b) cause, prior to any 280G Stockholder Vote,
the "disqualified individuals" (as defined in Section 280G of the Code) to
waive any payments in respect of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement that would not be deductible pursuant to Section 280G of the Code if
the 280G Stockholder Vote fails the approval requirements set out in Section
280G(b)(5) of the Code. At least seven (7) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, the Company or the Sellers Representative shall provide the Purchaser
for review and approval, copies of the Section 280G calculations, disclosure
documents, waiver documents and any other documents to be provided to any
Person pursuant to this Section 6.13.

The Company shall comply with, and shall satisfy all the conditions to closing

obligations or liabilities under such agreements.

53

![image311.jpg](image311.jpg) Section 6.15 Facility Security Clearance. The Company and Company Subsidiary
each have a facility security clearance (FCL). As promptly as practicable
after the date of this Agreement, the Company will make all reasonable efforts
to prepare and file with Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency
(DCSA) notification of a change in ownership pursuant to Section 1-302(g) of
the National Industry Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM). The Company
and Purchaser will make all reasonable efforts to cooperate to timely file
such notification of a change in ownership and to submit any information and
reports required by the NISPOM; for example, notification of a change in key
management personnel to DCSA or other regulations related to the Company's
Government Contracts in conjunction with the execution of this Agreement.

Section 6.16 Further Action. Each of the Sellers, the Company and Purchaser
shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all appropriate action, do or cause to be done all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Law, and to execute and deliver such documents and
other papers, as may be required to carry out the provisions of this Agreement
and consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby.

ARTICLE VII



TAX MATTERS



Section 7.01 Straddle Periods. In the case of Taxes that are payable with
respect to a Straddle Period, the portion of any such Tax that is allocable to
the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the date of the Closing shall be:

(a) in the case of Taxes that are either (x) based upon or related to income
or receipts or (y) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or
assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible) (other than
conveyances pursuant to this Agreement, as provided under Section 7.06),
deemed equal to the amount which would be payable (after giving effect to
amounts which may be deducted from or offset against such Taxes) if the Tax
Period ended on the date of the Closing; and

(b) in the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis with respect to the
assets of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (excluding Taxes related
solely to personal property), or

54

![image311.jpg](image311.jpg) otherwise measured by the level of any item, deemed to be the amount of such
Taxes for the entire Straddle Period (after giving effect to amounts which may
be deducted from or offset against such Taxes) (or, in the case of such Taxes
determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately
preceding period), multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the
number of days in the period ending on the date of the Closing and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period.

(c) Any credit or refund resulting from an overpayment of Taxes for a Straddle
Period shall be prorated based upon the method employed in this paragraph (b)
taking into account the type of Tax to which the refund relates. All
determinations necessary to effect the foregoing allocations shall be made in
a manner consistent with prior practice of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, as applicable.

Section 7.02 Tax Refunds. Any Tax refund, credit or similar benefit (including
any interest paid or credited with respect thereto) relating to Tax Periods
(or portions of taxable periods) ending on or before the date of the Closing
shall be the property of the Sellers other than the ESOT, and if received by
Purchaser, the Company or any Company Subsidiary, shall be paid over promptly
to the Sellers other than the ESOT, on a pro rata basis based on their
respective Pro Rata Shares with the payment that otherwise would have been
payable to the ESOT paid to the Rosenbaum Trust. Purchaser shall cause the
Company or other relevant entity to file for and use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain and expedite the receipt of any refund to which the Sellers
are entitled under this Section 7.02, including from the carryback of net
operating losses to the maximum extent allowable under the CARES Act to any
Tax Period ended on or prior to the Closing Date. Purchaser shall cause the
filing (at Purchaser's expense) of any refund claims from such carrybacks to
be made within one hundred eighty (180) days from the Closing Date. Purchaser
shall permit Sellers Representative to participate in (at Seller's expense)
the prosecution of any such refund claim.

Section 7.03 Contests.

(a) After the Closing, Purchaser shall promptly notify the Sellers
Representative in writing of the proposed assessment or the commencement of
any Tax audit or administrative or judicial proceeding or of any demand or
claim on Purchaser, its Affiliates, or the Company or any Company Subsidiary
which, if determined adversely to the taxpayer or after the lapse of time,
could result in any Tax liability for the Sellers or be grounds for
indemnification by the Sellers under ARTICLE IX. Such notice shall contain
factual information (to the extent known to Purchaser, its Affiliates, or the
Company) describing the asserted Tax liability in reasonable detail and shall
include copies of any notice or other document received from any taxing
authority in respect of any such asserted Tax liability. If Purchaser fails to
give the Sellers Representative prompt notice of an asserted Tax liability as
required by this Section 7.03, then the Sellers shall not have any obligation
to indemnify for any loss arising out of such asserted Tax liability, but only
to the extent that failure to give such notice results in a detriment to the
Sellers.

(b) In the case of a Tax audit or administrative or judicial proceeding (a
"Contest") that relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, Purchaser shall have the
sole right (at Seller's expense) to control the conduct of such Contest.
Purchaser shall notify Sellers Representative of any Contest, and shall keep
Sellers Representative reasonably informed of the progress of such Contest,

55

![image311.jpg](image311.jpg) including by providing Sellers Representative copies of any material
correspondence with the taxing authority. However, in such case, none of
Purchaser or the Company may settle or compromise any asserted liability that
Sellers may be obligated to indemnify without prior written consent of the
Sellers Representative; provided, however, that consent to settlement or
compromise shall not be unreasonably withheld.

(c) With respect to Straddle Periods, Purchaser shall direct and control,
through counsel of its own choosing, any Contest involving any asserted Tax
liability. If the asserted Tax liability is one with respect to which
indemnity may be sought from the Sellers pursuant to ARTICLE IX, the Sellers
Representative may participate (at the Sellers' expense) in such Contest, and
neither Purchaser nor the Company may settle or compromise any asserted
liability without the prior written consent of the Sellers Representative,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

(d) Purchaser, the Sellers Representative and the Sellers agree to cooperate,
and Purchaser agrees to cause the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to
cooperate, in the defense against or compromise of any claim in any Contest.

Section 7.04 Preparation of Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes.

(a) Subject to Section 6.16, the Purchaser shall prepare and file (at
Purchaser's expense) all income Tax Returns relating to the Company or any
Company Subsidiary for Tax Periods ending on or before the date of the Closing
that are due after the Closing Date, and shall file such Tax Returns for (i)
the Tax Period ended September 30, 2020 within one hundred fifty (150) days of
Closing and (ii) the stub Tax Period thereafter ending on the Closing Date
within one hundred eighty (180) days of the Closing. Sellers Representative
shall have no less than fifteen (15) days to review and comment on such Tax
Returns prior to filing. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, such
Tax Returns shall be prepared on a basis consistent with those prepared for
prior Tax Periods unless a different treatment of any item is required by Law.
The Sellers shall pay (i) all Taxes imposed on or payable by the Company or
any Company Subsidiary with respect to such Returns and (ii) with respect to
Straddle Periods, Taxes imposed on the Company or any Company Subsidiary which
are allocable pursuant to Section 7.01 to the portion of such period ending on
the date of Closing, other than Taxes resulting from any act, transaction or
omission of Purchaser or the Company occurring after the Closing that is not
in the ordinary course of business. The amount of Taxes payable by the Sellers
under this Section 7.04(a) shall be reduced to the extent taken into account
in the calculation of Working Capital under Section 2.06.

(b) Purchaser shall prepare and file (or cause the Company to prepare and
file) all Tax Returns that relate to the Company or any Company Subsidiary for
Tax Periods ending after the date of the Closing (including Straddle Periods);
it being understood that all Taxes shown as due and payable on such Tax
Returns shall be the responsibility of Purchaser, except for such Taxes which
are the responsibility of the Sellers which the Sellers shall pay in
accordance with this ARTICLE VII. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared on a
basis consistent with those prepared for prior Tax Periods unless a different
treatment of any item is required by Law. With respect to any Tax Return
required to be filed with respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary
after the date of the Closing and as to which Taxes are allocable to the
Sellers under Section 7.01 hereof, Purchaser shall provide the Sellers
Representative and its authorized representative(s) with a copy of such
completed Tax Return and a

56

![image311.jpg](image311.jpg) statement (with which Purchaser will make available supporting schedules and
information) certifying the amount of Tax shown on such Tax Return that is
allocable to the Sellers pursuant to Section 7.01 at least thirty (30)
calendar days prior to the due date (including any extension thereof) for
filing of such Tax Return, and the Sellers Representative and its authorized
representative(s) shall have the right to review and comment on such Tax
Return and statement prior to the filing of such Tax Return. The amount of Tax
shown on any such Tax Return that is allocable to the Sellers shall be reduced
to the extent accrued and taken into account in the calculation of Working
Capital pursuant to Section 2.06. The Sellers Representative and Purchaser
agree to consult and to attempt in good faith to resolve any issues arising as
a result of the review of such Tax Return and statement by the Sellers
Representative or its authorized representative(s).

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if the Sellers receive an
assessment or other notice of Taxes due with respect to the Company for any
taxable period, or portion of any Tax Period ending on or before the date of
the Closing for which the Sellers are not responsible, in whole or in part,
then Purchaser shall pay such Taxes, or if the Sellers pay such Taxes, then
Purchaser or the Company shall pay to the Sellers pro rata based on their
respective Pro Rata Shares the amount of such Taxes for which the Sellers are
not responsible within ten (10) calendar days following such payment. In the
case of a Tax that is contested in accordance with the provisions of Section
7.03, payment of the Tax to the appropriate taxing authority will be
considered to be due no earlier than the date a final determination to such
effect is made by the appropriate taxing authority or court.

(d) In the preparation of the federal and state income Tax Returns under this
Section 7.04 for the Tax Period ending on the Closing Date, the Sellers
Representative shall cause the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to adopt
the accrual method of tax accounting (in lieu of the cash method of accounting
previously used) and shall elect pursuant to IRS Revenue Procedure 2015-13 to
recognize the entire amount of any adjustment under Section 481 of the Code or
other taxable income resulting from such adoption in the Company's
consolidated income tax return for such Tax Period.

Section 7.05 Tax Cooperation and Exchange of Information. The Sellers and
Purchaser shall provide each other with such cooperation and information as
either of them reasonably may request of the other (and Purchaser shall cause
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to provide such cooperation and
information) in filing any Tax Return, amended Tax Return or claim for refund,
determining a liability for Taxes or a right to a refund of Taxes or
participating in or conducting any audit or other proceeding in respect of
Taxes (including a Contest). Such cooperation and information shall include
providing copies of relevant Tax Returns or portions thereof, together with
related work papers and documents relating to rulings or other determinations
by taxing authorities. The Sellers and Purchaser shall make themselves (and
their respective employees) reasonably available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide explanations of any documents or information provided under
this Section 7.05. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6.02,
the Sellers and Purchaser shall each retain all Tax Returns, work papers and
all material records or other documents in its possession (or in the
possession of its Affiliates) relating to Tax matters of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries for any Tax Period that includes the date of the Closing
and for all prior Tax Periods until the later of (i) the expiration of the
statute of limitations of the Tax Periods to which such Tax Returns and other
documents relate, without regard to extensions or (ii) six (6) years following
the due date (without extension) for such Tax Returns. After such time, before
the Sellers or Purchaser shall dispose of any

57

![image311.jpg](image311.jpg) such documents in its possession (or in the possession of its Affiliates), the
other party shall be given an opportunity, after ninety (90) calendar days
prior written notice, to remove and retain all or any part of such documents
as such other party may select (at such other party's expense). Any
information obtained under this Section 7.05 shall be kept confidential,
except as may be otherwise necessary in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns or claims for refund or in conducting an audit or other proceeding.

Section 7.06 Conveyance Taxes. Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Sellers
collectively on the other (pro rata on the basis of their respective Pro Rata
Shares), shall each be liable for 50% of any Conveyance Taxes that may be
imposed upon, or payable or collectible or incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Purchaser and the Sellers
agree to cooperate in the execution and delivery of all instruments and
certificates necessary to enable Purchaser to comply with any pre-Closing
filing requirements.

Section 7.07 Tax Covenants.

(a) Neither Purchaser nor any Affiliate of Purchaser shall take, or cause or
permit the Company to take, any action or omit to take any action which could
increase any Seller's or any of their respective Affiliates' liability for
Taxes unless such action or omission is required by law.

(b) Neither Purchaser nor any Affiliate of Purchaser shall amend, refile or
otherwise modify, or cause or permit the Company or any Company Subsidiary to
amend, refile or otherwise modify, any Tax election or Tax Return with respect
to any Pre-Closing Tax Period without the prior written consent of the Sellers
Representative.

Section 7.08 Escrow. For income tax purposes, Purchaser and the Sellers agree
to treat amounts held by the Escrow Agent as property of Sellers and to treat
the payment of the Escrow Amount to the Sellers as installment payments under
the installment obligation rules of Section 453 of the Code.

Section 7.09 Deduction of Company Transaction Expenses. All Tax Returns
prepared pursuant to this ARTICLE VII shall treat all Company Transaction
Expenses paid or accrued on or before the Closing Date as being incurred in a
Pre-Closing Tax Period. "Company Transaction Expenses" mean the collective
amount due and payable by the Company or the Sellers for all out of pocket
costs and expenses incurred by the Company or by or on behalf the Sellers (to
the extent such amount is not paid prior to the Closing) on account of the
entry into this Agreement by the Sellers or the consummation of the
transactions hereunder, including (a) Sellers Expenses and (b) any employee
retention payments, stay bonuses or severance, termination, change in control,
retention or similar payments or benefits payable to any employee of the
Company, in each case as a result of the sale of the Shares to the Purchaser,
and including related employer side payroll Taxes (the payments in this clause
(b), the "Change in Control Payments").

(a) Representations, Warranties and Covenants. (i) The representations and
warranties of Purchaser contained in ARTICLE V shall be true and correct in
all respects as of the Closing Date with the same effect as though made at and
as of such date (except those representations and warranties that address
matters only as of a specified date, which shall be true and correct in all
respects as of that specified date), except where the failure of such
representations and warranties to be true and correct would not have a
material adverse effect on Purchaser's ability to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, and (ii) the covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement to be complied with by Purchaser on or before the Closing shall have
been complied with in all material respects;

before any Governmental Authority against any of the Sellers, the Company or
Purchaser, seeking to restrain or materially and adversely alter the

modified by the Disclosure Schedules, shall be true and correct in all
respects as of the Closing Date as if made on and as of the Closing Date (or,
if given as of a specific date, at and as of such date), except where such
failures of such representations and warranties to be true and correct,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect, provided that, the representations and warranties
contained in Section 3.01 (Authorization), Section 3.02 (Execution and
Delivery; Valid and Binding Agreement), Section 3.04 (Ownership of Shares),
Section 3.06 (Brokers), Section 4.01 (Organization, Authority and

(c) No Proceeding or Litigation. No Action shall have been commenced by or
before any Governmental Authority against any of the Sellers, the Company or

unlawful to consummate such transactions or which could have a Material
Adverse Effect; provided, however, that the provisions of this Section 8.02(c)
shall not apply if the Purchaser has directly or indirectly solicited or
encouraged such Action.

of TATE;

the terms and conditions set forth herein, and (ii) determined that the sale
of the ESOP Shares is in the best interest of the ESOP participants, and the
consideration to be received by ESOT for the ESOP Shares pursuant to the

INDEMNIFICATION



Section 9.01 Survival of Representations and Warranties and Covenants.

(a) The representations and warranties of the Sellers or the Company contained
in this Agreement shall survive the Closing until the eighteen month
anniversary thereof; provided, that, for purposes of the RandW Insurance Policy,
such representations and warranties shall survive for the applicable survival
period set forth in such policy solely with respect to the available coverage
under such policy; provided, however, that (A) the representations and
warranties made pursuant to Section 3.01, Section 3.02, Section 3.04, Section
3.06, Section 4.01(a), Section 4.02, Section 4.03(a) and Section 4.25 (the
"Surviving Representations") shall survive until the fifth anniversary of the
Closing and (B) the representations and warranties in Section 4.13 shall
survive until the third anniversary of the Closing. Other covenants and
agreements of the Sellers contained herein shall survive until performed in
accordance with their terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Purchaser
provides notice of a claim to Sellers in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period set forth
in this Section 9.01, then the applicable representations and warranties,
covenants and/or agreements (as the case may be) shall survive as to such
claim only until such claim has been finally resolved or adjudicated.

(b) The representations and warranties of Purchaser contained in this
Agreement shall survive the Closing until the one-year anniversary of the
Closing; provided, however, that the representations and warranties made
pursuant to Section 5.01, Section 5.05, Section 5.06 and Section 5.07 shall
survive until the expiration of the applicable statutes of limitations. The
covenants of Purchaser contained in this Agreement that are to be performed
prior to Closing shall terminate upon the Closing, and the other covenants and
agreements of Purchaser and the Company contained herein shall survive until
performed in accordance with their terms.

(c) Except with respect to claims for indemnification with respect to breaches
of any representation or warranty referenced in Section 9.02(i) or Section
9.02(ii) that are governed by the terms of the RandW Insurance Policy, no claim
for indemnification may be asserted against any party for breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein, unless
written notice of such claim is received by such party describing in
reasonable detail the facts and circumstances with respect to the subject
matter of such claim on or prior to the date on which the representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement on which such claim is based ceases to survive
as set forth in this Section 9.01.

Section 9.02 Indemnification of Purchaser. Subject to the terms and conditions
of this ARTICLE IX, from and after the Closing, each Seller (other than the
ESOT) shall severally, and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser
and its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees and agents (each a
"Purchaser Indemnified Party") from and against any and all Liabilities,
losses, damages, claims, costs and expenses, interest, awards, judgments and
penalties (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses on claims)
actually suffered or incurred by them (hereinafter a "Loss"), arising out of
or resulting from:

61

![image311.jpg](image311.jpg) (i) the breach of any representation or warranty made by such Person contained
in ARTICLE III of this Agreement; or

(ii) the breach of any representation or warranty made by the Company
contained in ARTICLE IV of this Agreement;

(iii) the breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant or agreement by such
Person contained in this Agreement;

performed by the Company prior to the Closing contained in this Agreement; or

(v) the matters that are listed on Schedule 9.02(v) (collectively, the
"Certain Matters").

Section 9.03 Indemnification of the Sellers. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this ARTICLE IX, from and after the Closing, Purchaser shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers and their respective Affiliates,
agents, heirs and personal representatives (each a "Seller Indemnified Party")
from and against any and all Losses, arising out of or resulting from:

(i) the breach of any representation or warranty made by Purchaser contained
in this Agreement; or

(ii) the breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant or agreement by Purchaser
contained in this Agreement, or any covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement to be performed by the Company after the Closing.

Section 9.04 RandW Insurance Policy.

(a) Except as set forth in Section 9.09 with respect to Fraud and except with
respect to the Surviving Representations and the Certain Matters,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (a) the
RandW Insurance Policy shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties for any and all Losses that are sustained or incurred by
any of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties by reason of, resulting from or
arising out of any breach of or inaccuracy in any of the Company's or any
Seller's representations or warranties contained in this Agreement or in any
certificate or other instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement (other
than the Surviving Representations) and (b) the Company and the Sellers shall
not have any other direct or indirect liability (derivative or otherwise) to
any Purchaser Indemnified Party with respect to any breach of such
representations and warranties of the Company or the Sellers.

(b) Section 9.04(a) shall apply regardless of whether: (i) Purchaser continues
to maintain the RandW Insurance Policy following the Closing; (ii) the RandW
Insurance Policy is revoked, cancelled or modified in any manner after
issuance; (iii) any claim made by Purchaser under such RandW Insurance Policy is
denied by the issuer thereof or (iv) Purchaser fails or refuses to make a
claim, or fails to comply with the required claims procedures, under such RandW
Insurance Policy. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any rights
of any issuer of the RandW Insurance Policy, including any rights

62

![image311.jpg](image311.jpg) of subrogation, shall not affect, expand or increase any liability or
obligation of the Company or the Sellers to Purchaser Indemnified Parties or
any other parties in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(c) With respect to any Losses for which a Purchaser Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnification under Section 9.02(i) and Section 9.02(ii),
Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to submit a claim to
recover such Losses from the RandW Insurance Policy before seeking recovery for
such Losses from the Sellers (subject to applicable limitations set forth in
this ARTICLE IX).

Section 9.05 Limits on Liability.

(a) Except as set forth in Section 9.09 with respect to Fraud, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement:

(i) the total aggregate liability of the Sellers under or in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall not exceed an
amount equal to the Purchase Price less the aggregate RandW Insurance Policy
limit;

(ii) the maximum liability of any Seller on account of any particular
indemnifiable Loss arising under clause Section 9.02(ii) or Section 9.02(iv)
shall not exceed such Seller's Pro Rata Share of such Loss; and

(iii) the maximum amount required to be paid by any Seller pursuant to Section
9.02 is the portion of the Purchase Price actually received by such Seller.

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Seller shall have any
indemnification obligations pursuant to Section 9.02 with respect to (i) a
breach of any representation or warranty set forth in ARTICLE III made by or
with respect to any other Seller, (ii) any other Seller's individual covenants
set forth in Section 6.06, (iii) Fraud committed by any other Seller of which
such first Seller did not have actual knowledge; provided that, with respect
to any breach or Fraud described in the foregoing clauses (i) or (ii), the
indemnification obligation of the Seller who committed such breach or Fraud
shall not be limited to their Pro Rata Share.

(c) For purposes of this ARTICLE IX, other than with respect to the
representations and warranties contained in Section 4.09(ii), in determining
whether there has been a breach of any representation or warranty and the
amount of any Losses that are the subject matter of a claim for
indemnification hereunder, each representation and warranty shall be read
without regard and without giving effect to any materiality qualifications
contained therein (including the terms "material", "material adverse effect",
"Material Adverse Effect" or any similar terms).

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any liability of the ESOP
to indemnify a Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant to and in accordance with
this ARTICLE IX, but for this Section 9.05(d), shall be satisfied by the
Principal Seller.

63

![image311.jpg](image311.jpg) (e) Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, no party shall be
liable for punitive damages unless paid or payable to third parties in respect
of a Third Party Claim as contemplated under Section 9.06.

(f) Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary: (i) the Certain
Matters Escrow Amount shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties for any and all Losses that are sustained or incurred by
any of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties by reason of, resulting from or
arising out of the Certain Matters; and (ii) the maximum amount required to be
paid by Sellers pursuant to the Certain Matters is the Certain Matters Escrow
Amount.

Section 9.06 Indemnification Procedures.

(a) Third Party Claims. If any Indemnified Party receives notice of the
assertion or commencement of any action, suit, claim or other legal proceeding
made or brought by any Person who is not a party to this Agreement or an
Affiliate of a party to this Agreement or a representative of the foregoing
(each, a "Third Party Claim") against such Indemnified Party with respect to
which the Indemnifying Party is obligated to provide indemnification under
this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party prompt
written notice thereof. The failure to give such prompt written notice shall
not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification
obligations, except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party
forfeits rights or defenses by reason of such failure. Such notice by the
Indemnified Party shall describe the Third Party Claim in reasonable detail,
shall include copies of all material written evidence thereof and shall
indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has
been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party
shall have the right to participate in, or by giving written notice to the
Indemnified Party, to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim (except to
the extent the insurer under the RandW Insurance Policy assumes the defense of
such Third Party Claim pursuant to and in accordance with the RandW Insurance
Policy) at the Indemnifying Party's expense and by the Indemnifying Party's
own counsel, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith in such
defense. In the event that the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any
Third Party Claim, subject to Section 9.06(b), it shall have the right to take
such action as it deems necessary to avoid, dispute, defend, appeal or make
counterclaims pertaining to any such Third Party Claim in the name and on
behalf of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall have the right,
at its own cost and expense, to participate in the defense of any Third Party
Claim with counsel selected by it subject to the Indemnifying Party's right to
control the defense thereof. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to
compromise or defend such Third Party Claim or fails to promptly notify the
Indemnified Party in writing of its election to defend as provided in this
Agreement, the Indemnified Party may, subject to Section 9.06(b), pay,
compromise, or defend such Third Party Claim and seek indemnification for any
and all Losses based upon, arising from or relating to such Third Party Claim.
The Sellers and Purchaser shall cooperate with each other in all reasonable
respects in connection with the defense of any Third Party Claim, including
making available (subject to the provisions of Section 6.02) records relating
to such Third Party Claim and furnishing, without expense (other than
reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket expenses) to the defending party,
management employees of the non-defending party as may be reasonably necessary
for the preparation of the defense of such Third Party Claim.

64

![image311.jpg](image311.jpg) (b) Settlement of Third Party Claims. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into settlement of any
Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
except as provided in this Section 9.06(b). If a firm offer is made to settle
a Third Party Claim without leading to liability or the creation of a
financial or other obligation on the part of the Indemnified Party and
provides, in customary form, for the unconditional release of each Indemnified
Party from all liabilities and obligations in connection with such Third Party
Claim and the Indemnifying Party desires to accept and agree to such offer,
the Indemnifying Party shall give written notice to that effect to the
Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm
offer within ten days after its receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Party
may continue to contest or defend such Third Party Claim and in such event,
the maximum liability of the Indemnifying Party as to such Third Party Claim
shall not exceed the amount of such settlement offer. If the Indemnified Party
fails to consent to such firm offer and also fails to assume defense of such
Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may settle the Third Party Claim
upon the terms set forth in such firm offer to settle such Third Party Claim.
If the Indemnified Party has assumed the defense pursuant to Section 9.06(a),
it shall not agree to any settlement without the written consent of the
Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

(c) Direct Claims. Any claim by an Indemnified Party on account of a Loss
which does not result from a Third Party Claim (a "Direct Claim") shall be
asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying Party prompt written
notice thereof. The failure to give such prompt written notice shall not,
however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations,
except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or
defenses by reason of such failure. Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall
describe the Direct Claim in reasonable detail, shall include copies of all
material written evidence thereof and shall indicate the estimated amount, if
reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the
Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days after its receipt
of such notice to respond in writing to such Direct Claim. During such 30-day
period, the Indemnified Party shall allow the Indemnifying Party and its
professional advisors to investigate the matter or circumstance alleged to
give rise to the Direct Claim, and whether and to what extent any amount is
payable in respect of the Direct Claim and the Indemnified Party shall assist
the Indemnifying Party's investigation by giving such information and
assistance (including access to the Company's premises and personnel and the
right to examine and copy any accounts, documents or records) as the
Indemnifying Party or any of its professional advisors may reasonably request.
If the Indemnifying Party does not so respond within such 30-day period, the
Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have rejected such claim, in which case
the Indemnified Party shall be free to pursue such remedies as may be
available to the Indemnified Party on the terms and subject to the provisions
of this Agreement.

Section 9.07 No Double Recovery; Use of Insurance. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, no party or other Person entitled to indemnification
under this ARTICLE IX shall be entitled to indemnification or reimbursement
under any provision of this Agreement for any amount to the extent such party
or its Affiliate has been indemnified or reimbursed for such amount under any
other provision of this Agreement (including to the extent there has been a
specific liability or reserve relating to such matter included in the
calculation of the Purchase Price adjustments pursuant to Section 2.06) or any
document executed in connection with this Agreement or otherwise. The amount
of any

65

![image311.jpg](image311.jpg) indemnification payable under this ARTICLE IX will be net of the receipt of
any insurance proceeds paid to the Indemnified Party under any policies of
insurance covering the Loss giving rise to the Claim. The Indemnified Party
will use commercially reasonable efforts to collect any such insurance and
will account to the Indemnifying Party therefor. If, at any time subsequent to
the Indemnified Party receiving an indemnity payment for a Claim under this
ARTICLE IX, the Indemnified Party receives payment in respect of the Loss
underlying such Claim through recovery, settlement or otherwise under or
pursuant to any insurance coverage, or pursuant to any Claim, recovery,
settlement or payment by or against another Person, the amount of such
payment, less any costs, expenses or premiums incurred directly in connection
therewith, will promptly be repaid by the Indemnified Party to the
Indemnifying Party.

Section 9.08 Treatment of Indemnity Payments Between the Parties. Unless
otherwise required by applicable Law, all indemnification payments shall
constitute adjustments to the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes, and no
party shall take any position inconsistent with such characterization.

Section 9.09 Remedies. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that (a)
following the Closing, except as set forth in Section 2.06 and Section 6.03,
the remedies provided in this ARTICLE IX (and, with respect to Purchaser, the
RandW Insurance Policy) shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of Purchaser
and the Sellers for any breach by the other party of the representations and
warranties in this Agreement and for any failure by the other party to perform
and comply with any covenants and agreements in this Agreement, except for
claims grounded in Fraud, and (b) anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, no breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained herein shall give rise to any right on the part of
Purchaser or the Sellers, after the consummation of the purchase and sale of
the Shares contemplated by this Agreement, to rescind this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby. Each party hereto shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate its Losses.

Section 9.10 Role of Sellers Representative. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, (a) to the extent that the provisions of this
ARTICLE IX contemplate that a notice thereunder be given to the Sellers, such
notice shall instead be given to the Sellers Representative and (b) to the
extent that the provisions of this ARTICLE IX contemplate that an action or
determination shall, or may be, taken or made thereunder by a Seller, such
action or determination shall, or may be, taken or made thereunder solely by
the Sellers Representative on behalf of such Sellers (and not by such Sellers
directly).

ARTICLE X

Section 10.01 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Closing:

(a) by either the Sellers Representative or Purchaser if the Closing shall not
have occurred by the Termination Date; provided, however, that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 10.01(a) shall not be available to
any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this

66

of the Closing to occur on or prior to such date; provided further, however,
that, upon delivery of the written notice specified in Section 10.01(e)(iv),
Purchaser shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to

(c) by the Sellers Representative (if the Sellers are not then in breach of
this Agreement in any material respect) if Purchaser shall have breached any
of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement which would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in
Section 8.01, which breach cannot be or has not been cured within thirty (30)
calendar days after the giving of written notice by the Sellers Representative
to Purchaser specifying such breach;

(d) by Purchaser (if Purchaser is not then in breach of this Agreement in any
material respect) if the Sellers or the Company shall have breached any of
their representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement which would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in
Section 8.02, which breach cannot be or has not been cured within thirty (30)
calendar days after the giving of written notice by Purchaser to the Sellers
Representative specifying such breach;

(e) by the Sellers Representative if (i) the conditions set forth in Section
8.02 have been and continue to be satisfied or waived at the time the Closing
is required to have occurred pursuant to Section 2.03 (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to such conditions being capable of being satisfied on such date),
(ii) Purchaser failed to consummate the Closing on the date required pursuant
to the terms of Section 2.03, (iii) Purchaser fails to consummate the Closing

(iv) the Sellers Representative has irrevocably confirmed to Purchaser in

(f) by the mutual written consent of the Sellers Representative and Purchaser.

Section 10.02 Effect of Termination. In the event of any termination of this
Agreement as provided in Section 10.01, this Agreement shall forthwith become
wholly void and of no further force and effect and there shall be no liability
or obligation on the part of Purchaser, the Sellers or the Company or their
respective officers or directors, except (a) as set forth in Section 6.03,
Section 10.02, Section 11.01, Section 11.10, and Section 11.11, which shall
remain in full force and effect, (b) with respect to Purchaser, pursuant to,
and only in accordance with the terms of Section 10.03 and (c) except

67

![image311.jpg](image311.jpg) as provided in Section 10.03, nothing herein shall relieve either party hereto
from liability for any breach of this Agreement prior to such termination.

Section 10.03 Termination Fee.

(a) If, but only if, this Agreement is validly terminated by the Sellers
Representative pursuant to Section 10.01(e) or Section 10.01(c), then
Purchaser shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Sellers (pro rata in
accordance with their Pro Rata Shares) by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to accounts designated in writing by the Sellers
Representative the Termination Fee within five (5) Business Days following
such termination. The parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that in no
event shall any of Purchaser or its Affiliates be required to pay, or to cause
to be paid, (A) the Termination Fee on more than one occasion or (B) both the
Termination Fee and any other damages, other than any interest on the
Termination Fee; provided, nothing in this Section 10.03 shall affect or
diminish the respective rights, obligations and liability of the parties under
Sections 6.03, 11.01, 11.10 and 11.11.

(b) The parties hereby acknowledge and agree that (i) the agreements contained
in this Section 10.03 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the parties would not
enter into this Agreement, and (ii) the Termination Fee payable by Purchaser
pursuant to Section 10.03(a) (together with any amounts payable or
indemnifiable pursuant to the last sentence of this Section 10.03(b)) is not a
penalty, but is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate
the Sellers and their Affiliates for the efforts and resources expended and
the opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance
upon this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated herein, and for the loss suffered by reason of the
failure of such consummation, which amount would otherwise be uncertain and
incapable of accurate determination. If Purchaser fails promptly to pay any
amount due pursuant to this Section 10.03, it shall also pay any reasonable
costs and expenses incurred by the Company in connection with enforcing this
Agreement (including by legal action), together with interest on such unpaid
amount, at a rate per annum, compounded monthly, equal to the Prime Rate, as
reported in the print edition of The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, on
the date such amount was required to be paid (or, if unavailable, on the
latest date prior to the payment due date on which such rate is available),
calculated from the date such amount was required to be paid to (but
excluding) the payment date.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Sellers' right
to receive payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to this ARTICLE X shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and the Sellers against Purchaser
or any of its Affiliates or any of their respective stockholders, partners,
members or representatives for any and all losses that may be suffered based
upon, resulting from or arising out of the circumstances giving rise to such
termination, and (ii) upon payment of the Termination Fee to the Sellers, none
of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or any of their respective stockholders,
partners, members or representatives shall have any further liability or
obligation relating to or arising out of Purchaser's failure to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether or not the Company or the
Sellers elect to terminate this Agreement. In no event shall the Company or
the Sellers seek any (x) equitable relief or equitable remedies of any kind
whatsoever or (y) money damages or any other recovery, judgment, or damages of
any kind, including

68

![image311.jpg](image311.jpg) consequential, indirect, or punitive damages, other than damages in an amount
not in excess of the Termination Fee, in each case, relating to or arising out
of Purchaser's failure to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

Section 11.03 Public Announcements. Neither party hereto shall make, or cause
to be made, any press release or public announcement or disclosure in respect
of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise
communicate with any news media without the prior written consent of the other
party unless otherwise required by Law or applicable stock exchange regulation
or applicable regulations of the SEC, and the parties hereto shall cooperate
as to the timing and contents of any such press release, public announcement
or communication.

Section 11.04 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public
policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect for so long as the economic or legal substance
of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to

70

![image311.jpg](image311.jpg) either party hereto. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order
that the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally
contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

Section 11.05 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the Disclosure
Schedules, the other schedules and exhibits hereto), the Escrow Agreement, the
Confidentiality Agreement, and the RandW Insurance Policy constitute the entire
agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and
oral, among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof.

Section 11.06 Assignment. This Agreement may not be assigned by operation of
law or otherwise without the express written consent of the Sellers and
Purchaser (which consent may be granted or withheld in the sole discretion of
the Sellers or Purchaser); provided, however, that Purchaser may assign this
Agreement or any of its rights and obligations hereunder to one or more
Affiliates of Purchaser without the consent of Seller; provided, further, that
no such assignment by Purchaser shall release Purchaser from any liability or
obligation under this Agreement.

Section 11.07 Amendment. This Agreement may not be amended or modified except
by an instrument in writing signed by the Seller Representative, the Company
and Purchaser.

Section 11.08 Waiver. The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any
provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a further or
continuing waiver of such breach or as a waiver of any other or subsequent
breach. No failure on the part of any party to exercise, and no delay in
exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of such right, power or
remedy by such party preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or remedy.

Section 11.09 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except for the provisions of
ARTICLE IX and Section 6.07 relating to indemnified parties, this Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and permitted assigns and nothing herein,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person, any
legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever,
including any rights of employment for any specified period, under or by
reason of this Agreement.

Section 11.10 Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts executed in and to be
performed in the State of Delaware, without regard to conflicts of laws
principles.

(b) The parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction
of any federal or state court located within the State of Delaware over any
dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby and each party hereby irrevocably agrees that
all claims in respect of such dispute or any suit, action proceeding related
thereto may be

71

![image311.jpg](image311.jpg) heard and determined in such courts. The parties hereby irrevocably waive, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any objection which they may
now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such dispute brought in
such court or any defense of inconvenient forum for the maintenance of such
dispute. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a judgment in any such dispute
may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by Law.

Section 11.11 Waiver of Jury Trial. Each of the parties hereto hereby waives
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law any right it may have to a
trial by jury with respect to any litigation directly or indirectly arising
out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto hereby (a)
certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of the other party has
represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the
event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges
that it has been induced to enter into this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, as applicable, by, among other things, the
mutual waivers and certifications in this Section 11.11.

Section 11.13 Attorneys' Fees. In the event that any party hereto institutes
any Action against another party in respect of a matter arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, the prevailing party in the Action shall be
entitled to receive, in addition to all other damages to which it may be
entitled, the reasonable costs incurred by such party in connection with such
Action, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses and court costs.

Section 11.14 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile transmission or electronic communications by portable
document format (.pdf)) in one or more counterparts, and by the different
parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be
deemed to be an original, but all of which taken together shall constitute one
and the same agreement.

Section 11.14 Disclosure Schedules. The Disclosure Schedules have been
arranged for purposes of convenience only, in sections corresponding to the
Sections of ARTICLE III and ARTICLE IV. Any exception or qualification set
forth in the Disclosure Schedules with respect to a particular representation
or warranty contained in ARTICLE III or ARTICLE IV of the Agreement shall be
deemed to be an exception or qualification with respect to all other
applicable representations and warranties contained in ARTICLE III or ARTICLE
IV of the Agreement to which such exception or qualification is reasonably
apparent on its face to be applicable, whether or not such exception or
qualification is so numbered. To the extent that any representation or
warranty contained in ARTICLE III or ARTICLE IV of the Agreement is limited or
qualified by the materiality of the matters to which the representation or
warranty is given, the inclusion of any matter in the Disclosure Schedules
does not constitute a determination by the Company or the Sellers that such
matters are material. In addition, under no circumstances shall the disclosure
of any matter in the Disclosure Schedules where a representation or warranty
in ARTICLE III or ARTICLE IV of the Agreement is limited or qualified by the
materiality of the matters to which the representation or warranty is given
imply that any other undisclosed matter having a greater value or other
significance is material.
