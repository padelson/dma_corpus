LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("Purchaser"). Each of the
Equityholders, the Company and Purchaser are sometimes referred to herein as a

the Company AandR LLC Agreement provides for the "U. S. Steel Call Option",
which provides the Purchaser an option to purchase all, but not less than all,
of the outstanding Units and BRS Newco Units held by the other Members (the

the U. S. Steel Call Option Purchase Price; WHEREAS, the Purchaser has
exercised the U. S. Steel Call Option in accordance with Section 5.7 of the
Company AandR LLC Agreement; and WHEREAS, in accordance with Section 5.7 of the
Company AandR LLC Agreement, the Parties desire to enter into this Agreement to

payment shall be timely remitted to the applicable Taxing Authority and, when

6 Section 4.5 Litigation. There is no Action pending, or, to the knowledge of

rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Securities Act") or other
applicable Laws and Purchaser will not dispose of the Purchased Interests in
contravention of the Securities Act or other applicable Laws, (ii) has
received and read the Organizational Documents of the Group Companies and
(iii) has sufficient knowledge and experience, including with respect to the
industries in which the Business operates, to evaluate the merits and risks of
this investment. (b) Purchaser acknowledges that (i) the Purchased Interests
have not been registered under the Securities Act, that the Purchased
Interests have not been registered under any applicable securities laws of any
state or other jurisdiction and, therefore, cannot be sold unless they are
subsequently registered under the Securities Act and any applicable state
securities laws or are sold pursuant to an exemption from such registration
and (ii) none of the Equityholders, the Group Companies or any of their
respective Affiliates is under any obligation to register the Purchased
Interests and that no market may exist for the resale of the Purchased
Interests. (c) Purchaser is an "accredited investor" as defined in Regulation
D promulgated under the Securities Act. Purchaser understands the speculative
nature of an investment in the Purchased Interests and, accordingly, is able
to bear the economic risk of this investment and, at the present time, could
afford a complete loss of such investment. (d) Purchaser and its
Representatives have been afforded the opportunity to ask questions of
Representatives of the Equityholders and the Group Companies and have received
answers to such questions, as Purchaser deems necessary in connection with its
decision to acquire the Purchased Interests.

nothing in this Section 5.5 shall require cooperation to the extent that it
would cause any condition to the Closing set forth in Section 6.1 or Section

or default under, any material contract of any Group Company; (iii) no Group
Company or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives shall be
required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur or assume any

or any Affiliate thereof withholds access or information in reliance on this
clause (vi), such Person shall provide Purchaser with notice of such
withholding and use commercially reasonable efforts to provide such access or
information in a manner that does not jeopardize such privilege or conflict
with such requirements (including by requesting waivers thereto).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the condition set
forth in Section 6.2(b), as it applies to the Company's and the Equityholders'
obligations under this Section 5.5, shall be deemed satisfied unless the
Financing has not been obtained primarily as a result of the Company's or an
Equityholder's Willful Breach of its obligations under this Section 5.5. (c)

respect of any financial information or data or other information provided
pursuant to this Section 5.5. Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold

and Representatives from and against any and all Liabilities, losses,
interest, awards and judgments suffered or incurred by them in connection with
the Financing and the performance of their respective obligations under this

avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,

each case, any representation or warranty that by its terms addresses matters
only as of another specified date, which shall be so true and correct only as

capital leases, other similar financing arrangements and the receipt of
consents and satisfaction of other matters set forth on Schedule 6.2(d)
attached hereto. ARTICLE VII TAX MATTERS Section 7.1 Preparation of and Filing
of Tax Returns. (a) Purchaser will cause to be timely prepared (giving effect
to any validly obtained extensions) each Pass-Through Tax Return of a Group
Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or any Straddle Period (a "Company
Pass-Through Return"). All Company Pass-Through Returns shall be prepared in a
manner consistent with past practices of the applicable Group Company, except
as otherwise required by applicable Law. The U.S. federal Income Tax Return of
each of the Company and BRS Newco for its taxable year that includes the
Closing Date shall (i) include an election pursuant to Section 754 of the Code
if such election is not already in effect, (ii) with respect to Purchaser's
basis step-up under Section 743(b) of the Code (if any), include an election
pursuant to Section 168(k)(7) of the Code and Treasury Regulation Section
1.168(k)-2(f)(1) to forgo any bonus depreciation available pursuant to Section
168(k) of the Code and include an election pursuant to Section 168(g)(7) of
the Code to have the alternative depreciation system apply to the extent
permitted by Law, and (iii) allocate items of income, gain, loss and expense

"calendar day convention" pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.706-4. (b)
Whenever it is necessary to determine the liability for Taxes that are payable
with respect to a Straddle Period, the Taxes, if any, attributable to such
Straddle Period shall be allocated between the portion of such Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date and the portion of such Straddle Period beginning
after the Closing Date. Any such allocation of (i) Taxes, other than those
referred to in clause (ii) below, shall be made by means of a closing of the
books and records of the Group Companies as of the end of the Closing Date,
provided, however, that depreciation and amortization deductions shall be
allocated between the period ending on the Closing Date and the period
beginning after the Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in each
such period, and (ii) property Taxes and ad valorem Taxes attributable to a
Straddle Period shall be allocated between such two periods in proportion to
the number of days in each such period. Section 7.2 Deductions. (a) The
Parties agree that any deduction in respect of or attributable to amounts paid
pursuant to the Approved Incentive Plan (or items that would be attributable
to amounts paid pursuant to the Approved Incentive Plan but for the fact that
they are paid prior to Closing) shall accrue for U.S. federal income tax
purposes in the Pre-Closing Tax Period to the extent permitted by Law based
upon a "more likely than not" level of comfort, and, in such case, the Parties
agree not to take a contrary position on any U.S. federal Income Tax Return.  

  

 ![](ex2p1panthoptpur201215v3017.jpg) 

14 (b) Unless required by applicable Law or with the prior consent of the
Equityholders (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
Purchaser will not permit any Group Company to carry back any item of loss,
deduction or credit that arises in any taxable period ending after the Closing
Date, into any Pre-Closing Tax Period. Section 7.3 Tax Contests. (a) If
Purchaser or a Group Company receives notice that a Taxing Authority is
asserting a claim with respect to a Company Pass-Through Return after the
Closing, then Purchaser or such Group Company, as applicable, will provide
written notice thereof to the Equityholders. Such notice will specify in
reasonable detail the basis for such claim to the extent Purchaser or such
Group Company, as applicable, is aware of such basis and will include a copy
of the relevant portion of any correspondence received from the Taxing
Authority. (b) The Parties shall not permit any Group Company to make any
election pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 301.9100-22. (c) With respect
to any Tax Proceeding in respect of a Company Pass-Through Return for a
taxable year of the Company or BRS Newco beginning after December 31, 2017,
the Parties shall cause the Company's or BRS Newco's partnership
representative or designated individual to timely and properly elect the
application of Section 6226 of the Code (and any similar provision of state or
local Law) with respect to any proposed adjustment resulting from any such Tax
Proceeding, and shall not appoint any partnership representative or designated
individual whom they cannot cause to make such election. Section 7.4 Sales and
Transfer Taxes. All sales, use, value-added, goods and services, transfer,
real estate transfer, documentary, conveyance or similar Taxes or expenses
that may be imposed as a result of the transactions described in Article I,
together with any and all penalties, interest and additions to tax with
respect thereto (collectively, "Transaction Transfer Taxes") shall be borne
equally by Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Equityholders, on the other
hand. The Parties will cooperate in timely making all filings, returns,
reports and forms as may be required to comply with the provisions of such Tax
Laws. Section 7.5 Tax Certificates. Each Equityholder (or if such Equityholder
is a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes, its regarded
owner) shall provide to Purchaser (i) a non-foreign person affidavit under
Section 1445 and Section 1446(f) of the Code, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Purchaser, dated as of the Closing Date and (ii) a properly
completed IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Equityholder (or if such
Equityholder is a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes, its
regarded owner) is not subject to backup withholding. Section 7.6 Termination
of Tax Sharing Agreements. Any and all Tax allocation or Tax sharing
agreements between any Group Company, on the one hand, and any Equityholder or
any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, shall be terminated as of the
Closing Date and, from and  

  

 ![](ex2p1panthoptpur201215v3018.jpg) 

15 after the Closing Date, no Group Company shall be obligated to make any
payment pursuant to any such agreement for any past or future period. Section
7.7 Purchase Price Allocation. No later than ninety (90) days after the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall deliver to the Equityholders an allocation of
the U. S. Steel Call Option Purchase Price (and any relevant Liabilities of
the Group Companies attributable to the Purchased Interests under Section 752
of the Code and all other relevant items) as of the Closing Date among the
portion of the assets of the Group Companies attributable to the Purchased
Interests as determined in accordance with Section 755 of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations thereunder (the "Purchase Price Allocation") for the
Equityholders' review. The Equityholders shall have an opportunity to review
the proposed Purchase Price Allocation for a period of twenty (20) days after
receipt of the proposed Purchase Price Allocation. If the Equityholders
disagree with any aspect of the proposed Purchase Price Allocation, the
Equityholders shall notify Purchaser in writing prior to the end of such
20-day period (an "Allocation Objection Notice"), setting forth the
Equityholders' proposed Purchase Price Allocation and specifying, in
reasonable detail, any dispute as to Purchaser's proposed Purchase Price
Allocation. If the Allocation Objection Notice is duly delivered, Purchaser
and the Equityholders shall, during the twenty (20) days following such
delivery, use commercially reasonable efforts to jointly reach agreement on
the disputed items or amounts in order to determine the Purchase Price
Allocation. If Purchaser and the Equityholders have not resolved all
objections and agreed upon a final Purchase Price Allocation after such 20-day
period ends, Purchaser and the Equityholders shall engage an independent
accounting firm mutually agreed upon by Purchaser and the Equityholders to
resolve any outstanding disputes, and such resolution shall be final,
conclusive and binding upon each of the Parties. The fees and disbursements of
the independent accounting firm shall be shared equally by Purchaser, on the
one hand, and the Equityholders, on the other hand. Any Purchase Price
Allocation prepared by Purchaser if no Allocation Objection Notice has been
given or as adjusted pursuant to any agreement between Purchaser and the
Equityholders or by the independent accounting firm shall be conclusive and
binding on the Parties, and none of Purchaser, the Equityholders or any of
their respective Affiliates shall take any position inconsistent with such
Purchase Price Allocation on any Tax Return or in any Tax Proceeding, in each
case, except to the extent otherwise required pursuant to a change in
applicable Law or pursuant to the good faith resolution of any Tax Proceeding.
In the event of an adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement, the Equityholders and Purchaser agree to adjust the Purchase
Price Allocation in a reasonable manner to reflect such adjustment. ARTICLE
VIII TERMINATION Section 8.1 Termination. Anything herein or elsewhere to the
contrary notwithstanding, this Agreement may be terminated and the
transactions contemplated herein may be abandoned at any time prior to the
Closing: (a) by Purchaser or by the Equityholder holding of a majority of the
Class B Common Units if any Closing Legal Impediment shall be in effect and
shall have become final and nonappealable; provided, that this right of
termination shall not be available  

  

 ![](ex2p1panthoptpur201215v3019.jpg) 

16 if a Party's failure to comply with its obligations under this Agreement
was a cause of, or resulted in, such Closing Legal Impediment; (b) by the
Purchaser if the Company or any Equityholder shall have breached or failed to
perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set
forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would give
rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.1 or Section 6.2,
respectively, and (ii) cannot be cured or, if capable of being cured, shall
not have been cured by the date that is thirty (30) days following receipt of
written notice from the Purchaser stating its intention to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b) and the basis for such termination;
provided, that Purchaser shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.1(b) if Purchaser is then in material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement hereunder; or (c) by the
Equityholders holding of a majority of the Class B Common Units if Purchaser
shall have breached or failed to perform any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement, which breach
or failure to perform (i) would give rise to the failure of a condition set
forth in Section 6.1, and (ii) cannot be cured or, if capable of being cured,
shall not have been cured by the date that is thirty (30) days following
receipt of written notice from such Equityholder stating its intention to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(c) and the basis for
such termination; provided, that such Equityholder shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(c) if any Equityholder
is then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement hereunder. (d) by the Equityholder holding of a majority of the
Class B Common Units if the Closing shall not have occurred on or prior to the
end of the day on June 15, 2021 (as such date may be extended pursuant to the
immediately following proviso, the "Outside Date"); provided that if, on such
date, one or more of the conditions set forth in Section 6.1(a) (solely as a
result of a Law or Judgment imposed by a Governmental Authority with
jurisdiction over applicable Antitrust Laws) or Section 6.1(b) has not been
satisfied or waived, but all other conditions to the Closing set forth in
Article VI have been satisfied or waived, as applicable (except for those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing; provided
that such conditions shall then be capable of being satisfied if the Closing
were to take place on such date), then the Outside Date shall automatically be
extended to December 15, 2021; provided, further, that this right of
termination shall not be available to (i) Purchaser if the failure of
Purchaser to, or (ii) the Equityholders, if the failure of any Equityholder
holding Class B Common Units or the Company to, comply with its obligations
under this Agreement was a cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the
Closing to have occurred on or prior to the end of the day on the Outside
Date. Section 8.2 Procedure upon Termination. In the event that this Agreement
is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, written notice thereof shall forthwith
be given to the other Parties in accordance with Section 8.1 and Section 11.5,
and this Agreement shall terminate, and the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be abandoned, without further action by any Party.  

  

 ![](ex2p1panthoptpur201215v3020.jpg) 

17 Section 8.3 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void
and have no further force or effect, without any Liability on the part of any
Party hereto or its Affiliates, officers, directors, members, or shareholders,
other than, subject to Section 11.13, the Liability of a Party for Fraud or
any Willful Breach of this Agreement by such Party occurring prior to such
termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of Section 5.2,
Section 5.4, this Article VIII, Article X, Article XI and the Confidentiality
Agreement shall survive any termination of this Agreement and remain valid and
binding obligations of the Parties. ARTICLE IX SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION
Section 9.1 Survival. The representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements required to be performed at or prior to the Closing shall terminate
as of the Closing; provided, that each of the Equityholder Fundamental
Representations and each of the Purchaser Fundamental Representations shall
survive until the sixth anniversary of the Closing Date. Those covenants and
agreements to the extent that by their terms apply or are to be performed in
whole or in part after Closing shall survive in accordance with their
respective terms, until performed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement (and the indemnification
obligations of the Parties hereto with respect thereto) that would otherwise
terminate in accordance with this Section 9.1 will continue to survive until
such claim for indemnification as described in the Notice of Claim has been
satisfied or otherwise resolved as provided herein if in good faith a Notice
of Claim shall have been given in accordance with this Article IX on or prior
to the expiration of the applicable survival period. Section 9.2
Indemnification by each Equityholder. From and after the Closing, each
Equityholder shall, on a several and not joint (and not joint and several)
basis, indemnify, defend, save and hold the Purchaser and its Affiliates and
Representatives ("Purchaser Indemnitees") harmless from and against any and
all Losses incurred or suffered by any Purchaser Indemnitee arising out of,
based upon or resulting from any breach of any Equityholder Fundamental
Representation. No Equityholder shall have any liability for any breach or
failure to perform by any other Equityholder or for any Fraud committed by any
other Equityholder. Section 9.3 Indemnification by Purchaser and the Company.
From and after the Closing, Purchaser and the Company, jointly and severally,
shall indemnify, defend, save and hold the Equityholders, and their respective
Affiliates and Representatives (collectively, the "Equityholder Indemnitees")
harmless from and against any and all Losses incurred or suffered by the
Equityholder Indemnitees arising out of, based upon or resulting from any
breach of any Purchaser Fundamental Representation. Section 9.4 Limitations on
Indemnification. (a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the
event any Party or any other Indemnified Party is entitled to a payment or
other benefit under more than one provision of this Agreement arising out of
or resulting from the same set of facts or circumstances for which such Person
has received payment or another benefit under one of  

  

 ![](ex2p1panthoptpur201215v3021.jpg) 

18 those provisions, in no event shall such Person be entitled to receive a
subsequent payment or benefit under any other provision of this Agreement. (b)
The amount of any Losses subject to indemnification under this Article IX
shall be calculated net of any insurance proceeds and any indemnity,
contribution or other similar payment from a third party actually received by
the Indemnified Party covering such Losses that are the subject of the claim
for indemnification (net of any costs of recovery and any increase in
premiums). In the event that any insurance proceeds or third party payments
are received by the Indemnified Party with respect to a Loss for which any
Indemnified Party has been indemnified pursuant to this Article IX, then a
refund equal to the amount of such insurance proceeds (net of any costs of
recovery and any increase in premiums) or third party payment shall be made to
the Indemnifying Party that made such payments to the relevant Indemnified
Party. The Indemnified Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain recoveries from insurers and other third parties in respect of this
Article IX. The amount of any Losses subject to indemnification under this
Article IX shall be reduced by any reduction in any Taxes actually realized as
a result of such Loss equal to the positive difference, if any, between (1)
the Indemnified Party's cash liability for Taxes in the year the Loss is
incurred not taking into account such Loss or the corresponding indemnity
payment under this Agreement, and (2) the Indemnified Party's cash liability
for Taxes in such year taking into account the Loss and taking into account
any Tax cost (including taxable income) realized by the Indemnified Party as a
result of the corresponding indemnity payment under this Agreement, with the
Loss treated as the last item of expense or deduction realized for such year
(c) Each Indemnified Party shall have a duty to use commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate any Losses arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby upon becoming aware of any event that
would reasonably be expected to, or does, give rise thereto; provided, that no
Indemnified Party shall be required to take any action that would interfere in
more than a de minimis amount with the operation of its business, or the
operation of the business of the Group Companies. (d) If the Indemnified Party
receives any payment from an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Losses
pursuant to Article IX and the Indemnified Party could have recovered all or a
part of such Losses from a third party (a "Potential Contributor") based on
the underlying claim asserted against the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified
Party shall assign such of its rights to proceed against the Potential
Contributor as are necessary to permit the Indemnifying Party to recover from
the Potential Contributor the amount of such payment. Section 9.5 Terms and
Conditions Relating to Indemnification. (a) If an Indemnified Party desires to
seek indemnification under this Article IX against the Person(s) required to
provide indemnification under this Article IX (collectively, the "Indemnifying
Party"), the Indemnified Party shall assert a claim for indemnification by
providing a written notice (the "Notice of Claim") to the Indemnifying Party
or Parties stating, in reasonable detail, the nature and basis of such claim
and all supporting documentation. The Notice of Claim shall be provided to the
Indemnifying Party  

  

 ![](ex2p1panthoptpur201215v3022.jpg) 

19 as soon as practicable (and in any event not later than thirty (30) days)
after the Indemnified Party becomes aware of an indemnifiable claim.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any failure to provide the Indemnifying Party
with a Notice of Claim, or any failure to provide a Notice of Claim in a
timely manner shall not relieve any Indemnifying Party from any Liability that
it may have to the Indemnified Party under this Article IX except to the
extent that the ability of such Indemnifying Party to defend such claim is
actually and materially prejudiced by the Indemnified Party's failure to give
such Notice of Claim. If the Notice of Claim relates to a Third Party Claim,
the procedures set forth in Section 9.5(b) shall be applicable. If the Notice
of Claim does not relate to a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall
have thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of such Notice of Claim to
object to any of the subject matter and any of the amounts of the Losses set
forth in the Notice of Claim, as the case may be, by delivering written notice
of objection thereof to the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party fails
to send a notice of objection to the Notice of Claim within such thirty (30)
day period, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have agreed to the
Notice of Claim and, subject to the limitations and procedures set forth in
this Article IX, shall be obligated to pay to the Indemnified Party the
portion of the amount specified in the Notice of Claim to which the
Indemnifying Party has not objected. If the Indemnifying Party sends a timely
notice of objection and the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party do
not settle such dispute within thirty (30) days after the Indemnified Party's
receipt of such notice of objection, the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to seek enforcement of their respective
rights under this Article IX. (b) Promptly (and in any event within thirty
(30) days) after receipt by an Indemnified Party of notice of the assertion of
any claim or the commencement of any Action by a third party (a "Third Party
Claim") in respect of which the Indemnified Party shall seek indemnification
hereunder, the Indemnified Party shall so notify in writing the Indemnifying
Party and provide the Indemnifying Party with all materials delivered to it by
such third party; provided, that any failure to so notify the Indemnifying
Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any Liability that it may
have to the Indemnified Party under this Article IX except to the extent that
the ability of the Indemnifying Party to defend the Third Party Claim is
actually and materially prejudiced by the Indemnified Party's failure to give
such notice. In no event shall the Indemnified Party admit any Liability with
respect to such Third Party Claim or settle, compromise, pay or discharge such
Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party.
With respect to any such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have
the right in the name of and on behalf of the Indemnified Party to (at the
expense of the Indemnifying Party) take such action as it deems necessary to
avoid, dispute, defend, investigate, appeal or make counter-claims pertaining
to any such Third Party Claim (at the expense of the Indemnifying Party)
through counsel chosen by the Indemnifying Party by notifying the Indemnified
Party within thirty (30) days after the receipt by the Indemnifying Party of
such notice from the Indemnified Party; provided, that any such counsel shall
be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party
assumes such defense, the Indemnified Party shall have the right (but not the
duty) to participate (but not control), at its own expense, in the defense
thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel
employed by the Indemnifying Party; provided, that the Indemnified Party (at
the expense of the Indemnifying Party) shall have the right to employ counsel
to represent it at the expense of the Indemnifying Party if the Indemnified
Party has been advised by counsel that there are one or  

  

 ![](ex2p1panthoptpur201215v3023.jpg) 

20 more legal defenses available to the Indemnified Party that are different
from or additional to those available to any Indemnifying Party or if there is
otherwise a conflict between the interests of the Indemnified Party and any
Indemnifying Party, in which event the reasonable fees and expenses of such
separate counsel shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party; provided, that the
Indemnifying Party shall not be obligated to pay the reasonable fees and
expenses of more than one separate counsel for all Indemnified Parties, taken
together. Each Party agrees to render to the other parties such assistance as
may reasonably be requested in connection with, and shall cooperate fully in
all aspects of any investigation, defense, pre- trial activities, trial,
compromise, settlement or discharge of any such Third Party Claim, which
assistance shall include, to the extent reasonably requested by a party, the
retention, and the provision to such party, of records and information
reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees of the
other party available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any materials provided hereunder. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party may not settle, compromise, or offer to settle or
compromise, or otherwise dispose of any Third Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party, unless such settlement includes only
the payment of monetary damages (which are fully paid by the Indemnifying
Party), does not impose any injunctive or equitable relief upon the
Indemnified Party, does not require any admission or acknowledgment of
liability or fault of the Indemnified Party and contains an unconditional
release of the Indemnified Party in respect of such Third Party Claim. (c)
After written notice by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of the
election by the Indemnifying Party to assume control of the defense of any
such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to such
Indemnified Party hereunder for any costs or fees subsequently incurred by
such Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof, except if the
Indemnified Party has the right to employ counsel to represent it at the
expense of the Indemnifying Party as set forth in Section 9.5(b), and except
if the Indemnifying Party does not comply with its obligations pursuant to the
penultimate sentence of this Section 9.5(c) (in which case the Indemnifying
Party shall be liable for such costs and fees). If the Indemnifying Party does
not assume control of the defense of such Third Party Claim within thirty (30)
days after the receipt by the Indemnifying Party of the notice required
pursuant to Section 9.5(b) as provided above, the Indemnified Party shall have
the right to defend such Third Party Claim in such manner as it may deem
appropriate at the reasonable cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party if
such Third Party Claim is actually an indemnifiable claim hereunder. The party
controlling the defense of any Third Party Claim shall in any event defend any
such matters vigorously and in good faith. (d) To the extent of any
inconsistency between the provisions of Article IX and Article VII, the
provisions of Article VII shall control with respect to Tax Matters. Section
9.6 Payment. Upon a determination of liability under this Article IX, to the
extent, if any, that the Indemnifying Party is liable for an amount, the
Indemnifying Party shall pay or cause to be paid to the Indemnified Party the
amount so determined within five (5) Business Days after the date of such
determination. If there should be a dispute as to the amount or manner of
determination of any indemnity obligation owed under this Agreement the

to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time,
whether before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, with
respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with any such
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation. The waiver of any condition
based upon the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the
performance of or compliance with any covenant or obligation, shall not affect
the right to indemnification, reimbursement or other remedy based upon such
representations, warranties, covenants or obligations. Section 9.8 Exclusive
Remedy. From and after the Closing, the Parties' sole and exclusive remedy
with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (other than (i) claims for Fraud, (ii) claims for breaches

JURY TRIAL. Section 11.12 Recovery of Fees by Prevailing Party. In any action
at law or in equity to enforce any of the provisions or rights under this
Agreement, the Party which does not prevail in such litigation, as determined
by the court in a final Judgment, shall pay to the prevailing Party all costs,
expenses and attorneys' fees incurred by the prevailing Party, including such
costs, expenses and fees of any appeals. If the prevailing Party shall recover
Judgment in any Action, its costs, expenses and attorneys' fees shall be
included as part of such Judgment. Section 11.13 Specific Performance. Except
as otherwise expressly provided herein, any and all remedies provided herein
will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred
hereby or conferred by Law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a
Party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the
Parties do not perform their respective obligations under the provisions of
this Agreement in accordance with their specific terms or otherwise breach
such provisions. It is accordingly agreed that, prior to the valid termination
of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII, the Parties shall be entitled to
an injunction or injunctions, specific performance and other equitable relief
to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at Law or in equity. Each of the Parties agrees
that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance
and other equitable relief when expressly available pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement, and hereby waives (a) any defenses in any action for an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief, including the
defense that the other Parties have an adequate remedy at Law or an award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or
equity, and (b) any requirement under Law to post a bond, undertaking or other
security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, the Parties agree that the foregoing
provisions of this Section 11.13 shall not apply in the event of a breach of
this Agreement by the Purchaser. The Parties acknowledge and agree that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the sole and exclusive remedy
of any Party against the Purchaser in respect of this Agreement, including as
a result of any breach of any warranty, covenant or agreement in this
Agreement or any related agreement (other than the Company AandR LLC Agreement),
shall be those set forth in Section 9.3 of this Agreement if the Closing
occurs, or Sections 5.20, 4.4(c), 4.4(d) and 4.4(e) of the Company AandR LLC
Agreement, as and to the extent available pursuant to the terms and conditions
set forth therein. Section 11.14 Certain Acknowledgements of Purchaser.
