the amount equal to Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000) in same-day funds
(the " _Deposit_ ") to be held, invested, and disbursed in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement and an escrow agreement of even date herewith among
Seller, Purchaser, and Escrow Agent (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "). At Closing,
the Deposit and all interest earned thereon shall remain in the Escrow Account
and become part of the Indemnity Holdback.

Purchase Price among the Assets. The " _Allocated Value_ " for any Property

increased or decreased following the Closing pursuant to Section 8.4 by a
share of each adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price under Sections
2.3(c), (d), (e), and (f). The share of each such adjustment allocated to a
particular Property shall be obtained by allocating that adjustment among the
various Properties on a pro-rata basis in proportion to the Unadjusted
Purchase Price allocated to each such Property on _Schedule 2.2_. Seller has
accepted such Allocated Values for purposes of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, but otherwise makes no representation or

pursuant to Section 8.4(b) or 8.4(c), as applicable, the Parties shall

(plus other capitalized costs) among the Assets. For purposes of
such allocation, the Parties shall use the Allocated Values. Purchaser shall
provide a proposed allocation to Seller, and thereafter, the Parties shall act
in good faith and reasonably cooperate to agree upon the final allocation (as
finalized, the " _Tax Allocation Schedule_ "). Each of the Parties (or its
applicable Affiliate) shall file a Form 8594 (Asset Acquisition Statement
under Section 1060 of the Code) on a timely basis, reporting the allocation of
the Purchase Price (plus other capitalized costs) consistent with the Tax
Allocation Schedule. Each of the Parties (or its applicable Affiliate) shall
file, on a timely basis, any amendments required to such Form 8594 as a result
of a subsequent increase or decrease in the Purchase Price pursuant to this
Agreement. Except as required by Law, none of the Parties (or their applicable
Affiliates) shall take any position on its Tax Returns that is inconsistent
with the allocation of the Purchase Price (plus other capitalized costs) as
so agreed or as adjusted.

barrel;

 

(e) increased by the net amount of all prepaid expenses (including prepaid
insurance costs, Production Taxes; bonuses; rentals; and cash calls to third
Person operators) paid by Seller or its Affiliates and attributable to the
period of time from and after the Effective Date;

(f) adjusted for proceeds and other income attributable to the Assets,
Property Costs, and certain other costs attributable to the Assets as follows:

 

(i) decreased by an amount equal to the aggregate amount of the following
proceeds received by Seller or its Affiliates:

and to which Seller does not become entitled prior to the Cut-Off Date and
excluding the effects of any futures, options, swaps, or other derivatives);

forth in Section 1.2(u)), except in each case (A) any costs already deducted
in the determination of proceeds in Section 2.3(f)(i), and (B) Taxes (other

Closing; and

(b) Without duplication of any adjustments made pursuant to Section 2.3(f),
should a Party or its Affiliates receive after Closing any proceeds or other
income to which the other Party is entitled under Section 2.3 or Section
2.4(a), the receiving Party shall fully disclose, account for, and promptly
remit the same (unless there will be a Purchase Price adjustment therefor) to
the other Party.

in this Agreement, the term " _Title Benefit_ " means any right,
circumstance, or condition that operates to (i) increase the net revenue
interest of Seller in any Property above that shown on _Exhibit A-2_, without
causing a greater than proportionate increase in Sellers working interest

that shown in _Exhibit A-2_ without a corresponding increase in the net
revenue interest;

(b) all leases, unit agreements, pooling agreements, operating agreements,
production sales contracts, division orders, farmouts, exploration agreements,
carried interests, sales agreements, royalty or overriding royalty
agreements, and other contracts, agreements, and instruments applicable to the

contained therein, to the extent that they do not, individually or in
the aggregate, (i) reduce Sellers net revenue interest below that shown in
_Exhibit A-2_ or increase Sellers working interest above that shown in
_Exhibit A-2_ without a corresponding increase in net revenue interest,
or (ii) materially interfere with, diminish or detract from the operation,
development, ownership or value of the Properties, as currently owned and

actions by Governmental Authorities in connection with the sale or conveyance
of oil and gas leases or rights or interests therein if they are customarily

control or regulate any of the Assets in any manner or to assess Tax with
respect to the Assets, the ownership, use or operation thereof, or revenue,

value of, or materially interfere with the use or ownership of, the Assets
subject thereto or affected thereby (as currently used or owned) and (ii) are
of a type that, if they appeared as a comment, exception, or requirement in a
title opinion, would be waived by a reasonably prudent purchaser engaged in
the business of owning and operating oil and gas properties.

3.4 _Environmental Assessment; Environmental Defects_.

 

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement, and subject to the terms of
Sections 6.1 and 6.5, Purchaser shall have the right to conduct, or cause a
reputable environmental consulting or engineering firm (the " _Environmental
Consultant_ ") to conduct, an environmental review of the Assets (the "
_Environmental Review_ "). Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain permission from the operator of each Asset for Purchaser or the
Environmental Consultant to conduct the Environmental Review; _provided,
however_ , that Seller shall have no liability to Purchaser for failure to
obtain such operators permission, and Seller shall not be required to make
any payments or undertake any obligations

 



-16-   for the benefit of any other Person with respect to such access. Seller
shall have the right to have one or more representatives accompany Purchaser
and the Environmental Consultant at all times during the Environmental
Review. The Environmental Review shall not include any sampling, boring,
operation of Equipment, or other invasive activity on the Assets without the
prior written consent of Seller (which consent shall not be
unreasonably denied or conditioned) and any applicable third Person operator.
Should Seller or any such third Person operator not provide its consent to any
such invasive activity, Purchaser shall have the right, at its sole
discretion, to exclude the affected Assets from the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement in which case the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the
Allocated Value of such Assets and such Assets shall become Excluded Assets
for all purposes hereunder. In performing its Environmental Review, Purchaser
shall (and shall cause the Environmental Consultant to): (i) perform all work
in a safe and workmanlike manner; (ii) perform all work in such a way as to
not unnecessarily and unreasonably interfere with the operation of the
Assets; (iii) comply with all applicable Laws; and (iv) at its sole cost,
risk, and expense, restore the Assets to their condition prior to the
commencement of the Environmental Review.

 

(b) Purchaser shall provide copies of any final environmental reports
generated by the Environmental Consultant to Seller promptly after receipt
thereby by Purchaser. Within three (3) Business Days following the date of
this Agreement, Seller shall provide Purchaser copies of all final
environmental reports generated by Sellers or its Affiliates consultants
engaged in connection with Sellers ownership or acquisition of the Assets,
and Seller shall allow Purchaser to discuss such reports with such
consultants. Except (i) as may be required or permitted pursuant to the
exercise of the rights and fulfillment of the obligations of a Party under
this Agreement, (ii) as may be required by applicable Law, (iii) for
information which is or becomes public knowledge through no fault of the
Person against whom this sentence is sought to be enforced, or (iv) as may be
required by a Party in order to defend or prosecute any claim or cause of
action related to the Assets. Purchaser and Seller and their respective
Affiliates shall maintain, and shall cause their respective
officers, directors, employees, contractors, consultants (including the
Environmental Consultant), and other advisors to maintain, all information,
reports (whether interim, draft, final, or otherwise), data, work product, and
other matters obtained or generated from or attributable to the Environmental
Review or disclosed to Purchaser or the Environmental Consultant pursuant to
this Section 3.4(b) (the " _Environmental Information_ ") strictly
confidential, and shall not disclose all or any portion of the Environmental
Information to any third Person without the consent of Purchaser or Seller, as
applicable, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Each
Party shall be responsible for the compliance of its Affiliates, and its and
their respective officers, directors, employees, contractors, consultants
(including the Environmental Consultant), and other advisors with the
immediately preceding sentence. If this Agreement is terminated prior to the
Closing, Purchaser shall, promptly upon the receipt of a written request from
Seller, deliver, or return, as applicable, the Environmental Information to
Seller, which Environmental Information shall become the sole property of
Seller. Upon Closing, the confidentiality obligation contained in this
Section 3.4(b) shall no longer be binding on Purchaser, its Affiliates and
their respective officers, directors, employees, contractors, consultants
(including the Environmental Consultant), and other advisors.

(c) Purchaser acknowledges that the Assets have been used for the exploration,
development, and production of Hydrocarbons and that there may be petroleum,

 



-17-   produced water, wastes, or other substances or materials located in, on, or
under the Properties or associated with the Assets. Equipment and sites
included in the Assets may contain hazardous materials, including naturally
occurring radioactive material (" _NORM_ "). NORM may affix or attach itself
to the inside of wells, materials, and equipment as scale, or in other forms.
The wells, materials, and equipment located on the Properties or included in
the Assets may contain hazardous materials, including NORM. Hazardous
materials, including NORM, may have come into contact with various
environmental media, including water, soils, or sediment. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Section or elsewhere in this Agreement, but
subject to Section 11.2(g), Seller makes no, and hereby disclaims any,
representation or warranty, express or implied, with respect to the presence
or absence of NORM, asbestos, mercury, drilling fluids and chemicals, and
produced waters and Hydrocarbons in or on the Properties or Equipment in
quantities typical for oilfield operations in the areas in which the Assets
are located.

 

3.5 _Environmental Defects_. As used in this Agreement, the term "
_Environmental Defect_ " means any condition, matter, obligation,
circumstance with respect to the Assets that constitutes, or arises from, or
relates to, (a) a violation of Environmental Law, or (b) the existence of any
environmental pollution, contamination, degradation, damage or claim of
injury caused by or related to the ownership, use or operation of such Assets
(i) for which monitoring, investigation, or remedial or corrective action is
(A) required pursuant to Environmental Laws (or if known to an
applicable Governmental Authority, would be required) or (B) required as of
the date of this Agreement and/or Closing pursuant to the express terms of a
Lease or pursuant to a Contract binding on Seller or the Assets or (ii) for
which there is liability for investigatory costs, remedial or corrective
action costs, fines, or penalties under Environmental Law or any such Lease or
Contract.

3.6 _Notice of Title and Environmental Defects and Benefits; Adjustment_.

(a) To assert a claim arising out of a Title Defect, Purchaser must deliver a
defect claim notice or notices to Seller on or before 5:00 p.m. local time in
Houston, Texas, on June 20, 2012 (the " _Defect Claim Date_ "). Each such
notice shall be in writing and shall include:

(i) a description of the alleged Title Defect(s);

(ii) the Property or Properties affected;

 

(iii) the Allocated Values of the Property or Properties subject to the
alleged Title Defect(s);

 

(iv) copies of supporting documents, to the extent in Purchasers possession,
reasonably necessary for Seller (as well as any attorney or examiner hired by
Seller) to verify the existence of the alleged Title Defect(s); and

(v) the amount by which Purchaser reasonably believes the Allocated Values of
those Properties are reduced by the alleged Title Defect(s) and the
computations and information upon which Purchasers belief is based.

 



-18-  WITHOUT LIMITATION OF PURCHASERS RIGHTS PURSUANT TO THE SPECIAL WARRANTY OF
TITLE IN THE ASSIGNMENT AND BILL OF SALE, PURCHASER SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE
WAIVED ALL TITLE DEFECTS OF WHICH SELLER HAS NOT BEEN GIVEN NOTICE PURSUANT TO
SECTION 3.6(A) ON OR BEFORE THE DEFECT CLAIM DATE.

 

(b) Seller may, on or before the Defect Claim Date, deliver to Purchaser a
notice including:

 

(i) a description of the Title Benefit;

(ii) the Properties affected;

(iii) the Allocated Values of the Properties subject to such Title Benefit;
and

(iv) the amount by which Seller reasonably believes the Allocated Values of
those Properties are increased by the Title Benefit, and the computations and
information upon which Sellers belief is based.

SELLER SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE WAIVED ALL TITLE BENEFITS OF WHICH PURCHASER
HAS NOT BEEN GIVEN NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 3.6(B) ON OR BEFORE THE DEFECT
CLAIM DATE.

(c) To assert a claim for an Environmental Defect, Purchaser must, on or
before the Defect Claim Date, deliver to Seller one or more notices relating
to Environmental Defects, which notices shall be in writing and shall
include:

(i) a description of the Environmental Defect, including the specific facts
and basis under Environmental Law that substantiate such alleged
Environmental Defect;

(ii) the Assets affected;

 

(iii) such supporting documentation and Environmental Information, to the
extent in Purchasers possession, as is reasonably necessary for Seller (as
well as any consultant hired by Seller) to verify the existence of the alleged
Environmental Defects; and

(iv) an estimate of the Environmental Defect Amount (as calculated pursuant to
Section 3.9(c)) associated with the alleged Environmental Defect, and the
information and computations on which such estimate is based.

EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 11.2(G), PURCHASER SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE
WAIVED ALL ENVIRONMENTAL DEFECTS OF WHICH SELLER HAS NOT BEEN GIVEN NOTICE
PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION 3.6(C) ON OR BEFORE THE DEFECT CLAIM DATE.

 



-19-  3.7 _Cure_.

 

(a) Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at
Sellers sole cost, risk, and expense, to cure, on or before one hundred
twenty (120) days after the Closing Date, any alleged Title Defects of which
Seller has been advised by Purchaser pursuant to Section 3.6(a) if Seller
provides written notice to Purchaser of its intent to cure such alleged Title
Defects on or before the Closing Date. The election by Seller to cure one or
more such alleged Title Defects shall not affect the Title Defect Amounts and
Title Benefit Amounts used to determine the Closing Payment pursuant
to Section 3.10(a) or the rights and obligations of the Parties under Section
3.10 with respect to dispute resolution. Sellers election to cure an alleged
Title Defect shall not constitute a waiver of any of the rights of
Seller pursuant to this Article 3, including Sellers right to dispute the
existence, nature, or value of such Title Defect.

 

(b) Subject to the determination by the Title Arbitrator of the existence or
Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect which Seller has elected
to cure, to the extent any such Title Defect is not cured on or before one
hundred twenty (120) days after the Closing Date, the adjustment required
under Section 3.8 shall be made pursuant to Section 8.4(b). 

(c) Any dispute relating to whether and to what extent a Title Defect has been
cured shall be resolved as set forth in Section 3.10, except that any such
matter shall be submitted to the Title Arbitrator on or before ten (10)
Business Days after the date described in Section 3.7(a); _provided, however_
, that any prior or concurrent determination by a Title Arbitrator with
respect to Title Defects (or factual or legal matters relating thereto, even
if determined in connection with the resolution of an otherwise unrelated
dispute) which Seller has elected to cure pursuant to this Section 3.7 shall
be binding on the Parties with respect to such Title Defect (or factual or
legal matters relating thereto, even if determined in connection with the
resolution of an otherwise unrelated dispute).

 

3.8 _Adjustment for Title Defects and Benefits and Environmental Defects_.

 

(a) With respect to each Asset affected by Title Defects or Environmental
Defects reported under Section 3.6(a) or 3.6(c), such Asset shall be assigned
at Closing subject to all uncured Title Defects and Environmental Defects, and
the Purchase Price shall be reduced by (i) in the case of Title Defects, an
amount determined pursuant to Section 3.9(a) (the " _Title Defect Amount_ "),
and (ii) in the case of an Environmental Defect, an amount determined pursuant
to Section 3.9(c) (the " _Environmental Defect Amount_ "). If (A) the
Environmental Defect Amount for an Asset exceeds the Allocated Value of the
Asset, or (B) Purchaser claims an Environmental Defect with respect to the
issue disclosed on _Schedule 3.8_, then, in each case, either Party may
elect, prior to the Closing, to exclude such Asset from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in which case the Purchase Price shall be
reduced by the Allocated Value of such Asset and such Asset shall become an
Excluded Asset for all purposes hereunder; _provided, however_  that the
removal of any such Asset pursuant to Section 3.8(a)(A) shall not be taken
into account in determining whether the Aggregate Deductible has been met or
exceeded.

 



-20-  (b) With respect to each Property affected by Title Benefits reported
under Section 3.6(b), there shall be an offset to Title Defects by an amount
determined pursuant to Section 3.9(b) (the " _Title Benefit Amount_ ").

(c) EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN THE SPECIAL WARRANTY OF TITLE IN THE ASSIGNMENT AND
BILL OF SALE OR IN SECTION 11.2(g), SECTION 3.8(A) SHALL, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, BE THE EXCLUSIVE RIGHT AND REMEDY OF
PURCHASER WITH RESPECT TO TITLE DEFECTS AND OTHER DEFICIENCIES IN TITLE TO THE
ASSETS AND ANY ENVIRONMENTAL DEFECTS AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION OF THE
PROPERTIES. EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SECTION 3.6(A) AND SECTION 3.6(C) AND THE
SPECIAL WARRANTY OF TITLE CONTAINED IN THE ASSIGNMENT AND BILL OF SALE, IF
CLOSING OCCURS, PURCHASER RELEASES, REMISES, AND FOREVER DISCHARGES SELLER,
ITS AFFILIATES, AND EACH OF THEIR RESPECTIVE MEMBERS, SHAREHOLDERS,
INTEREST OWNERS, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, MANAGERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, ADVISORS,
AND REPRESENTATIVES FROM ANY AND ALL SUITS, LEGAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE
PROCEEDINGS, CLAIMS, DEMANDS, DAMAGES, LOSSES, COSTS, LIABILITIES, INTEREST,
OR CAUSES OF ACTION WHATSOEVER, IN LAW OR IN EQUITY, KNOWN OR UNKNOWN, WHICH
PURCHASER MIGHT NOW OR SUBSEQUENTLY MAY HAVE, BASED ON, RELATING TO, OR
ARISING OUT OF, ANY TITLE DEFECT, ENVIRONMENTAL DEFECT, OR OTHER DEFICIENCY IN
TITLE TO, OR THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION OF, ANY ASSET.

3.9 _Calculation of Title Defect Amounts, Title Benefit Amounts, and
Environmental Defect Amounts_  .

(a) The Title Defect Amount resulting from a Title Defect shall be determined
as follows:

 

(i) if Purchaser and Seller agree in writing upon the Title Defect Amount,
that amount shall be the Title Defect Amount;

 

(ii) if the Title Defect is a lien, encumbrance, or other charge which is
liquidated in amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the amount
necessary to be paid to remove the Title Defect from Sellers interest in the
affected Property;

(iii) if the Title Defect represents a discrepancy between (A) the net
revenue interest for any Property and (B) the net revenue interest or
percentage stated on _Exhibit A-2_, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the
product of the Allocated Value of such Property multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the decrease in Sellers net revenue interest and the
denominator of which is Sellers net revenue interest stated on _Exhibit
A-2_;  _provided, however_ , that if the Title Defect does not affect the
Property throughout its entire productive life, the Title Defect Amount
determined under this Section 3.9(a)(iii) shall be reduced to take into
account the applicable time period only;

 



-21-  (iv) if the Title Defect represents an obligation, encumbrance, burden, or
charge upon, or other defect in title to, the affected Property of a type not
described in subsections (i), (ii), or (iii), above, the Title Defect Amount
shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of the Property
so affected, the portion of Sellers interest in the Property affected by the
Title Defect, the legal effect of the Title Defect, the potential discounted
economic effect of the Title Defect over the productive life of the affected
Property, the values placed upon the Title Defect by Purchaser and Seller,
the age of the factual matters causing or constituting the alleged Title
Defect, and such other factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation;

 

(v) the Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect shall be determined
without duplication of any costs or losses included in another Title Defect
Amount hereunder or for which Purchaser otherwise receives credit in the
calculation of the Purchase Price; and

(vi) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 3:

(A) the aggregate of all Title Defect Amounts shall be reduced by the
aggregate of all Title Benefit Amounts prior to determination of whether there
will be an adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price pursuant to Section
3.9(a)(vi)(D).

 

(B) an individual claim for a Title Defect for which a claim notice is given
prior to the Defect Claim Date shall only generate an adjustment to the
Unadjusted Purchase Price under this Article 3 if the Title Defect Amount with
respect thereto exceeds Forty Thousand Dollars ($40,000);

(C) the aggregate Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all
Title Defects upon any given Property shall not exceed the Allocated Value of
such Property; and

 

(D) there shall be no adjustment to the Purchase Price for Title Defects
unless and until (x) the aggregate of all Title Defect Amounts which would
generate an adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price pursuant to Section
3.9(a)(vi)(B), less (y) the aggregate of all Title Benefit Amounts that would
generate an offset to Title Defects pursuant to Section 3.9(b)(iv), plus (z)
the aggregate of all Environmental Defect Amounts which would generate an
adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price pursuant to Section 3.9(c)(iv)(A),
exceeds two and one half percent (2.5%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price (the
" _Aggregate Deductible_ "), and then only to the extent that such aggregate
amount exceeds the Aggregate Deductible.

(b) The Title Benefit Amount resulting from a Title Benefit shall be
determined as follows:

(i) if Purchaser and Seller agree in writing upon the Title Benefit Amount,
that amount shall be the Title Benefit Amount;

(ii) if the Title Benefit represents a discrepancy between (A) the net revenue
interest for any Property and (B) the net revenue interest or percentage
stated with 

 



-22-   respect to such Property on _Exhibit A-2_, the Title Benefit Amount shall
be the product of the Allocated Value of the affected Property multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the net revenue interest increase and the
denominator of which is the net revenue interest stated on _Exhibit A-2_;
_provided, however_ , that if the Title Benefit does not affect a Property
throughout the entire productive life of the Property, the Title Benefit
Amount determined under this Section 3.9(b)(ii) shall be reduced to take into
account the applicable time period only;

(iii) if a Title Benefit represents a right, circumstance, or condition of a
type not described in subsections (i) or (ii), the Title Benefit Amount shall
be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of the Property so
affected, the portion of Sellers interest in the Property so affected, the
legal effect of the Title Benefit, the potential discounted economic effect of
the Title Benefit over the productive life of any affected Property, the
values placed upon the Title Benefit by Purchaser and Seller, and such other
factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation; and

(iv) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 3, (x) an
individual claim for a Title Benefit shall only generate an offset to Title
Defects if the Title Benefit Amount with respect thereto exceeds Forty
Thousand Dollars ($40,000) and (y) such Title Benefits shall only serve to
offset Title Defects as provided in this Agreement.

(c) The Environmental Defect Amount resulting from an Environmental Defect
shall be determined as follows:

(i) if Purchaser and Seller agree on the Environmental Defect Amount, that
amount shall be the Environmental Defect Amount;

(ii) the Environmental Defect Amount shall include, but shall not exceed, the
reasonable and necessary cost of the response that addresses the applicable
Environmental Defect to the extent required by applicable Environmental Laws,
Leases and/or Contracts, as applicable (considered as a whole taking into
consideration any material negative impact such response may have on the
operations of the relevant Assets and any potential material additional costs
or liabilities that may likely arise as a result of such response);

(iii) the Environmental Defect Amount with respect to an Environmental Defect
shall be determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in
another Environmental Defect Amount or adjustment to the Purchase Price
hereunder; and

 

(iv) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 3:

 

(A) an individual claim for an Environmental Defect shall only generate an
adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price if the Environmental Defect
Amount with respect thereto exceeds Forty Thousand Dollars ($40,000); and

(B) there shall be no adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price for
Environmental Defects unless and until the aggregate of (x) the aggregate of
all Environmental Defect Amounts which would generate an adjustment to the
Unadjusted Purchase Price pursuant to Section 3.9(c)(iv)(A), plus (y) the
aggregate of all Title Defect Amounts which would generate an adjustment to
the Unadjusted Purchase Price pursuant to

 



-23-   Section 3.9(a)(vi)(B), less (z) the aggregate of all Title Benefit Amounts
that would generate an offset to Title Defects pursuant to Section 3.9(b)(iv),
exceeds the Aggregate Deductible, and then only to the extent that such
aggregate amount exceeds the Aggregate Deductible.

3.10 _Dispute Resolution_.

(a) Seller and Purchaser shall attempt to agree upon all Title Defect Amounts,
Title Benefit Amounts, and Environmental Defect Amounts on or before the
Closing Date. If Seller and Purchaser are unable to agree by that date, then
the Parties shall use the average of Sellers reasonable estimate and
Purchasers reasonable estimate to determine the Closing Payment pursuant to
Section 8.4, and the Title Defect Amounts, Title Benefit Amounts, and
Environmental Defect Amounts in dispute shall be exclusively and finally
resolved by arbitration pursuant to Sections 3.10(b) and 3.10(d) with respect
to Title Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts, and Sections 3.10(c) and
3.10(d) with respect to Environmental Defect Amounts.

(b) With respect to disputed Title Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts,
on or before a date that is ten (10) Business Days following the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall submit all Title Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts in
dispute to a title attorney with at least ten (10) years experience in oil
and gas titles in the state in which the applicable Property or Properties are
located, as selected by mutual agreement of Purchaser and Seller (the "
_Title Arbitrator_ "). If Purchaser and Seller have not agreed upon an
alternate Person to serve as Title Arbitrator during such ten (10) Business
Day period, Purchaser shall, within ten (10) Business Days after the end of
such initial ten (10) Business Day period, formally apply to the Houston,
Texas office of the American Arbitration Association to choose the Title
Arbitrator. The Title Arbitrator shall not have worked as an employee or
outside counsel for any Party or its Affiliates during the five (5) year
period preceding the arbitration or have any financial interest in the
dispute. If Purchaser has not submitted such disputed Title Defect Amounts
and Title Benefit Amounts in dispute to the Title Arbitrator or the Houston,
Texas office of the American Arbitration Association, as applicable, within
the relevant time periods set forth above, Purchaser shall be deemed to have
waived its dispute of such Title Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts.

(c) With respect to disputed Environmental Defect Amounts, on or before a
date that is ten (10) Business Days following the Closing Date, Purchaser
shall submit all Environmental Defect Amounts in dispute to a reputable
environmental consultant or engineer with at least ten (10) years experience
in corrective environmental action regarding oil and gas properties in the
state in which the applicable Asset or Assets are located, as selected by
mutual agreement of Purchaser and Seller (the " _Environmental Arbitrator_ ").
If Purchaser and Seller have not agreed upon a Person to serve as
Environmental Arbitrator during such ten (10) Business Day period, Purchaser
shall, within ten (10) Business Days after the end of such initial ten (10)
Business Day period, formally apply to the Houston, Texas office of the
American Arbitration Association to choose the Environmental Arbitrator. The
Environmental Arbitrator shall not have worked as an employee or outside
counsel for any Party or its Affiliates during the five (5) year period
preceding the arbitration or have any financial interest in the dispute. If
Purchaser has not submitted such disputed Environmental Defect Amounts in
dispute to the Environmental Arbitrator or the Houston, Texas office of the
American Arbitration Association, as applicable, within the relevant time
period set forth above, Purchaser shall be deemed to have waived its dispute
of such Environmental Defect Amounts.

 



-24-  (d) In each case above, the arbitration proceeding shall be held in Houston,
Texas and shall be conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration
Rules of the American Arbitration Association, to the extent such rules do not
conflict with the terms of this Section 3.10. The Title Arbitrators or
Environmental Arbitrators determination, as applicable, shall be made within
forty-five (45) days after submission of the matters in dispute and shall be
final and binding upon the Parties, without right of appeal. In making their
respective determinations, the Title Arbitrator and the Environmental
Arbitrator shall be bound by the provisions of this Article 3 and may consider
such other matters as, in the opinion of the Title Arbitrator or Environmental
Arbitrator (as applicable), are necessary or helpful to make a proper
determination. The Title Arbitrator and Environmental Arbitrator may consult
with and engage disinterested third Persons to advise the arbitrator,
including petroleum engineers. The Title Arbitrator and Environmental
Arbitrator shall act as experts for the limited purpose of determining the
specific disputed Title Defect Amounts, Title Benefit Amounts, and
Environmental Defect Amounts submitted by any Party and may not award damages,
interest, or penalties to any Party with respect to any matter. Seller and
Purchaser shall each bear their own legal fees and other costs of presenting
their respective cases. Purchaser shall bear one-half of the costs and
expenses of the Title Arbitrator and Environmental Arbitrator, and Seller
shall be responsible for the remaining one-half of the costs and expenses.

3.11  _Notice to Holders of Consent and Preferential Purchase Rights_.
Promptly after the date hereof, but in any event within ten (10) days after
the date hereof, Seller shall prepare and send (a) notices to the holders of
any required consents to assignment that are set forth on _Schedule 4.8_
requesting consents to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b)
notices to the holders of any applicable preferential rights to purchase or
similar rights that are set forth on _Schedule 4.8_ in compliance with the
terms of such rights and requesting waivers of such rights. Seller shall not
be required to make any payments or undertake any obligations for the benefit
of the holders of such rights in order to obtain the required consents and
waivers. Purchaser shall cooperate with Seller in seeking to obtain such
consents, approvals, permissions, and waivers.

3.12 _Consent Requirements_.

(a) In no event shall there be transferred at Closing any Asset for which a
consent requirement, the express terms of which (i) provide that any transfer
of the Asset without the consent (or the payment of a fee which has not been
paid, or agreed to be paid, by Purchaser) (A) will result in a termination of
any material rights in relation to the Asset, or (B) is void or voidable, or
(ii) do not provide that the counterparty shall be reasonable when granting or
withholding its consent (a " _Material Consent_ "), has not been satisfied,
other than Material Consents and approvals of Governmental Authorities
customarily obtained after Closing. Seller shall deliver a written notice to
Purchaser on or before ten (10) Business Days prior to the Target Closing
Date setting forth each Material Consent requirement which, as of such date,
has not been satisfied or waived.

 



-25-  (b) In cases in which the Asset subject to such an unobtained Material Consent
is an Asset other than a Property, and Purchaser is assigned the Property or
Properties to which such Asset relates, but such Asset is not transferred to
Purchaser due to the unwaived Material Consent requirement, the Parties shall
continue after Closing to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
Material Consent so that such Asset can be transferred to Purchaser upon
receipt of the Material Consent, and, if permitted pursuant to applicable Law
and agreement, such Asset shall be held by Seller for the benefit of
Purchaser, Purchaser shall pay all amounts due thereunder or with respect
thereto, and Purchaser shall be responsible for the performance of any
obligations under or with respect to such Asset to the extent that Purchaser
has been transferred the Assets necessary to such performance until the
applicable Material Consent is obtained.

(c) In cases in which the Asset subject to such a Material Consent
requirement is a Property and the third Person consent to the transfer of such
Property is not obtained by Closing, Purchaser may elect to (i) treat the
unsatisfied consent requirements as a Title Defect and receive an adjustment
to the Unadjusted Purchase Price under Section 2.3(b) for the Allocated Value
attributable to such Property by giving Seller written notice thereof in
accordance with Section 3.6(a), except that such notice may be given on or
before five (5) Business Days prior to the Target Closing Date, and the
provisions of Sections 3.9(a)(vi)(B) and 3.9(a)(vi)(D) shall not apply and
(ii) exclude such Property from the Assets conveyed to Purchaser at Closing,
in which case such Property shall be deemed to be an Excluded Asset for all
purposes hereunder. If any such Material Consent requirement (with respect to
which an adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price is made under Section
2.3(b) and the applicable Property is excluded from the Assets at Closing) is
subsequently satisfied prior to the date of the final adjustment to the
Unadjusted Purchase Price under Section 8.4(b) or Section 8.4(c), as
applicable, (i) Seller shall, promptly after such Material Consent
requirement is satisfied, convey the applicable Property to Purchaser, (ii)
Purchaser shall, simultaneously with the conveyance of the applicable
Property, pay the amount of any previous deduction from the Unadjusted
Purchase Price to Seller, (iii) the provisions of this Section 3.12 shall no
longer apply to such Material Consent requirement or the applicable Property,
and (iv) such Property shall no longer be deemed to be an Excluded Asset
hereunder.

3.13 _Preferential Purchase Rights_

 

(a) Any preferential purchase right must be exercised subject to all terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement, including the successful Closing of
this Agreement pursuant to Article 8 on the dates set forth herein. The
consideration payable under this Agreement for any particular Asset for
purposes of preferential purchase right notices shall be the Allocated
Value for such Asset, adjusted as set forth herein.

(b) If any preferential right to purchase any Asset (or portion thereof)
is validly exercised prior to Closing (i) the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall
be decreased by the Allocated Value of such Asset (or portion thereof), as
though the affected Asset (or portion thereof) was subject to a complete Title
Defect (excluding, however, the application of Sections 3.9(a)(vi)(B) and
3.9(a)(vi)(D)), (ii) the affected Asset (or portion thereof) shall not be
transferred at Closing, (iii) the affected Asset (or portion thereof) shall be
deemed to be deleted from _Exhibits A-1_ through _A-3_ to this Agreement, as
applicable, for purposes of Closing, and

 



-26-   (iv) upon the consummation of the sale of the affected Asset (or portion
thereof) to the preferential right holder, the affected Asset (or portion
thereof) shall be deemed to be an Excluded Asset for all purposes hereunder.

(c) Should a third Person fail to validly exercise or waive its preferential
right to purchase as to any portion of the Assets (or portions thereof) prior
to Closing, and the time for exercise or waiver has not yet expired as of
Closing, then (i) such Assets (or portions thereof) shall not be conveyed to
Purchaser at Closing, (ii) the Purchase Price shall be decreased by the
Allocated Value of such Assets (or portions thereof) as though the affected
Assets (or portions thereof) were subject to a complete Title Defect
(excluding, however, the application of Sections 3.9(a)(vi)(B) and
3.9(a)(vi)(D)); (iii) the affected Assets (or portions thereof) shall be
deemed to be deleted from _Exhibits A-1_ through _A-3_ to this Agreement, as
applicable, for purposes of Closing, (iv) the affected Assets (or portions
thereof) shall be subject to this Section 3.13(c) and Section 3.13(d), and (v)
Seller shall, at its sole expense, continue to use reasonable efforts to
obtain the waiver of the preferential purchase right and shall continue to be
responsible for the compliance therewith. Should the holder of the
preferential purchase right validly exercise the same after Closing (and
consummate the sale of such affected Assets (or portions thereof)), the
Assets (or portions thereof) affected by such preferential right shall
constitute Excluded Assets for all purposes hereunder, Seller shall convey the
affected Assets to the holder on the terms and provisions set out in the
applicable preferential right provision and Seller shall be entitled to the
consideration paid by such holder.

(d) In the event that a preferential purchase right with respect to an Asset
excluded at Closing from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
pursuant to Section 3.13(c) is waived following Closing or the time for
exercise of such right expires pursuant to its terms following Closing, (i)
Purchaser shall purchase, for the amount of any previous deduction from the
Unadjusted Purchase Price pursuant to Section 3.13(c) with respect to such
Asset (plus adjustments in accordance with Section 2.3 from the Effective
Date until the date of transfer), from Seller the affected Asset on the terms
set forth in this Agreement at a delayed closing which shall occur within ten
(10) Business Days following the date on which Seller obtains such waiver, or
the time period for exercising the applicable preferential right has expired
(which date shall, with respect to such Asset, or portion thereof, be
considered to be the Closing Date), and (ii) such Asset shall not be deemed to
be an Excluded Asset hereunder.

3.14 _Limitations on Applicability_. Subject to the special warranty of title
contained in the Assignment and Bill of Sale, Purchasers rights with respect
to Title Defects and Environmental Defects shall terminate as of the Defect
Claim Date and shall have no further force and effect thereafter, provided
there shall be no termination of Purchasers or Sellers rights under Section
3.8 with respect to any Environmental Defect, Title Defect, or Title Benefit
claim properly reported on or before the Defect Claim Date.

exercise of any premature termination, price redetermination, market-out, or
curtailment of any Material Contract.

 

4.6 _Payments for Production_. Seller is not obligated by virtue of a take-or-
pay payment, advance payment, or other similar payment (other than royalties,
overriding royalties, similar arrangements established in the Leases or
reflected on _Exhibit A-1_ or _Exhibit A-2_, imbalances covered by Section
4.7, and gas balancing agreements), to deliver Hydrocarbons, or proceeds from
the sale thereof, attributable to Sellers interest in the Properties at some
future time without receiving payment therefor at or after the time of
delivery.

 

4.7 _Imbalances_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.7_, as of the Effective
Date, Seller does not have production, transportation, plant, or other
imbalances with respect to production from the Properties.

-30-  (b) all currently producing Wells (and related Equipment) are, in all material
respects, in an operable state of repair adequate to maintain normal
operations in accordance with past practices, ordinary wear and tear excepted.

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties agree that the fact that the number
of wells required to be plugged and abandoned by or on behalf of
Purchaser under New Mexico Law, combined with the number of Wells required to
be plugged and abandoned by or on behalf of Seller under New Mexico Law,
causes increased plugging and abandonment obligations on Purchaser under New
Mexico Law after Closing shall not be the sole basis for a claim for breach
of the representations and warranties contained in this Section 4.11.

 

4.12 _Non-Consent Operations_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.12_ or
_Exhibit A-2_, Seller has not elected not to participate in any operation or
activity proposed with respect to the Properties which could result in any of
Sellers interest in such Properties becoming subject to a penalty or
forfeiture as a result of such election not to participate in such operation
or activity. _Schedule 4.12_ accurately reflects all payout balances
associated with the Wells as of the date set forth with respect to each payout

binding on the Assets or will be binding on the Assets after Closing.

Affiliates are and have been at all times for the duration of such Available

compliance with all applicable Laws respecting employment and
employment practices, employment Tax and social security, terms and
conditions of employment and wages and hours except, in any such case, for
such non-compliance or violation as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect; 

(b) Seller and each of its Applicable Affiliates have made available to
Purchaser accurate and complete copies of all material employment contracts,
agreements and offer letters for Available Employees and all material policies
relating to the employment of the Available Employees;

 



-31-  (c) with respect to the Available Employees, neither Seller nor any of its
Applicable Affiliates is a party to or is bound by any union contract or
collective bargaining agreement, nor is any such contract or agreement
currently in effect or being negotiated by or on behalf of Seller or any of
its Applicable Affiliates; and 

(d) neither Seller nor any of its Applicable Affiliates has caused any
termination or layoff of employees who were primarily engaged in the business
conducted by Seller with respect to the Assets during the ninety (90) day
period prior to the date hereof.

(a) _Schedule 4.16_ includes a true and complete list of each material Plan
which is sponsored, maintained or contributed to by Seller or any of its
Applicable Affiliates for the benefit of the Available Employees. Prior to the
date hereof, Seller has provided Purchaser with a description of each Plan
listed on such Schedule.

(b) There does not now exist, nor do any circumstances exist that
could result in, any Controlled Group Liability of Seller or any ERISA
Affiliate that would be, or could become, a liability following the Closing
Date of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates. As used in the preceding sentence,
(i) the term " _Controlled Group Liability_ " means any and all liabilities
(A) under Title IV of ERISA, (B) under sections 206(g), 302 or 303 of ERISA,
(C) under sections 412, 430, 431, 436 or 4971 of the Code, (D) as a result of
the failure to comply with the continuation of coverage requirements of
section 601 et seq. of ERISA and section 4980B of the Code, and (E) under
corresponding or similar provisions of any foreign Law, rule, regulation,
statute, ordinance or order, and (ii) the term " _ERISA Affiliate_ " means
any entity, trade or business that is a member of a group described in section
414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code or section 4001(b)(1) of ERISA that
includes either 3RAC or 3ROC, or that is a member of the same "controlled
group" as 3RAC or 3ROC pursuant to section 4001(a)(14) of ERISA.

4.17 _Royalties; Payments_. All royalties, overriding royalties, compensatory
royalties and other payments due from or in respect of Hydrocarbon production
from the Assets have been, or will be (or, with respect to Properties
operated by a third Person, to Sellers knowledge, have been, or will be)
prior to the Closing Date, as applicable, properly and correctly paid or
provided for, except for those payments which Seller has a right to suspend
pursuant to applicable Law.

4.18 _Access_. Seller has, and, following the Closing, Purchaser will have,
such legal right of access to the Leases and the Wells as will allow the
conduct of business therewith (as currently contemplated by Seller) in the
ordinary course, in all material respects. For the avoidance of doubt, the
representations and warranties of Seller set forth in this Section 4.18 do
not address the quality or type of such access (i.e. pursuant to a right of
way, road, etc.), but only Sellers (and following Closing, Purchasers) legal
right of access.

knowledge" is limited to matters within the actual knowledge of the
individuals identified on _Schedule 4.19 _

 



-33-   after a reasonable inquiry of the relevant employees, files, and records of,

employees, files, and records of any third Person, including any operator of,
or joint interest owner in, a Property.

(d) Inclusion of a matter on a schedule attached hereto with respect to a
representation or warranty that addresses matters having a Material Adverse
Effect shall not be deemed an indication that such matter does, or may, have a
Material Adverse Effect. Schedules may include matters not required by the
terms of the Agreement to be listed on the Schedule, which additional matters
are disclosed for purposes of information only, and inclusion of any such
matter does not mean that all such matters are included. A matter scheduled as
an exception for any representation shall be deemed to be an exception to all
representations for which it is relevant.

(e) In the event that a schedule, annex, or exhibit to this Agreement is
amended or supplemented prior to Closing, any reference to such schedule,
annex, or exhibit in this Agreement shall be deemed to be a reference to such

5.6 _Litigation_. There are no actions, suits, or proceedings pending, or, to

are reasonably likely to impair or delay materially Purchasers ability to
perform its obligations under this Agreement. 

5.7 _Financing_. Purchaser has sufficient cash, available lines of credit, or
other sources of immediately available funds to enable it to pay the Closing
Payment to Seller at the Closing.

applicable state blue sky Laws, or any other applicable securities Laws.

5.9 _Independent Investigation_. Purchaser is (or its advisors are)
experienced and knowledgeable in the oil and gas business and aware of the
risks of that business. Purchaser acknowledges and affirms that (a) it has
completed such independent investigation, verification, analysis, and
evaluation of the Assets and has made all such reviews and inspections of the
Assets as it has deemed necessary or appropriate to enter into this Agreement,
and (b) prior to Closing, it will have completed its independent
investigation, verification, analysis, and evaluation of the Assets and made

or made any finding or determination as to the fairness of an investment in
the Assets or the accuracy or adequacy of the disclosures made to Purchaser,
and, except as set forth in Article 10, Purchaser is not entitled to cancel,
terminate, or revoke this Agreement.

 



-35-  5.10 _Information_. Except as expressly represented otherwise in Article

have any responsibility, liability, or expense as a result of undertakings or

6.1 _Access_. Subject to the limitations expressly set forth in this
Agreement, Seller shall provide Purchaser and its representatives access to
the Assets and access to and the right to copy, at Purchasers sole expense,
the Records in Sellers or its Affiliates possession for the purpose of
conducting a confirmatory review of the Assets, but only to the extent that
Seller may do so without (a) violating applicable Laws, or (b) violating any
obligations to any third Person. Such access by Purchaser shall be limited to
Sellers normal business hours, and Purchasers investigation shall be
conducted in a manner that minimizes interference with the operation of the

the date of execution of this Agreement and the Closing Date, or if any of
Purchasers or Sellers covenants or agreements to be performed or observed
prior to or on the Closing Date shall not have been so performed or observed
in any material respect, but if such breach of representation, warranty,
covenant, or agreement shall (if curable) be cured on or before the Closing or
if the Closing otherwise occurs notwithstanding such breach, then such breach
shall be considered not to have occurred for all purposes of this Agreement.

 



-36-  6.3 _Press Releases_. Until the Closing, neither Seller nor Purchaser, nor

to terminate or expire;

 

(e) operate the Assets operated and administered by Seller or its Affiliates,
and use its reasonable efforts to cause the Assets operated and administered

overriding royalties and other obligations attributable to the Assets;

not take) any action, which request was delivered by Seller in accordance with
this Section 6.4;

 

(h) give prompt written notice to Purchaser (including copies thereof) of any
(i) notice of asserted default or violation received or given by Seller under
any Lease, Contract, Law or Permit that affects any Asset, (ii) authorities

authorizations for expenditure for cost overruns) relating to operations in
which Seller has agreed to participate in writing as of the date hereof or in
which Seller agrees to participate after the date hereof in compliance with
this Section 6.4;

-38-  Requests for approval of any action restricted by this Section 6.4 shall be
delivered to either of the following individuals, each of whom shall have
full authority to grant or deny such requests for approval on behalf of
Purchaser:



      |  | 
---|---|--- 
    PRIMARY CONTACT: |  | ALTERNATE CONTACT: 
  Steve Guthrie |  | Steve Pruett

  Email: _Sguthrie@concho.com_  |  | Email: _Spruett@concho.com_ 
 

Purchasers approval of any action restricted by this Section 6.4 shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed and shall be considered granted in full
within ten (10) days (unless a shorter time is reasonably required by the
circumstances and such shorter time is specified in Sellers notice) of
Sellers notice to Purchaser requesting such consent unless Purchaser
notifies Seller to the contrary during that period. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this Section 6.4, in the event of an emergency, Seller
may take such action as is reasonably necessary in response to such emergency
and shall notify Purchaser of such action promptly thereafter. Purchaser
acknowledges that Seller owns undivided interests in the Assets and is not the
operator of all of the Assets, and Purchaser agrees that the acts
or omissions of third Persons (including the applicable operators of the
Assets) who are not Affiliates of Seller shall not constitute a violation of
the provisions of this Section 6.4, nor shall any action required by a vote of
working interest owners constitute such a violation so long as Seller and its
Affiliates have voted their respective interests in a manner consistent with
the provisions of this Section 6.4. Any matter approved (or deemed approved)
by Purchaser pursuant to this Section 6.4 that would otherwise constitute a
breach of one or more of Sellers representations and warranties in Article 4
shall be deemed to be an exclusion from all representations and warranties for
which it is relevant. 

6.5 _Indemnity Regarding Access_. Purchasers access to the Assets and its
(and its Affiliates and representatives) examinations and inspections,
whether under Section 6.1, 3.4, or otherwise, shall be at Purchasers sole
risk, cost, and expense, and Purchaser WAIVES AND RELEASES ALL CLAIMS AGAINST
SELLER, ITS AFFILIATES, AND EACH OF THEIR RESPECTIVE PARTNERS, MEMBERS,
OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, ATTORNEYS, CONTACTORS, AGENTS, OR OTHER
REPRESENTATIVES, ARISING IN ANY WAY THEREFROM, OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED
THEREWITH, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT CAUSED BY THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL
MISCONDUCT OF SUCH PERSONS. Purchaser agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold
harmless Seller and its Affiliates, the other owners of interests in the
Properties, and all such Persons directors, officers, employees, agents,
and representatives from and against any and all claims, liabilities, losses,
costs, and expenses (including court costs and reasonable attorneys fees),
including claims, liabilities, losses, costs, and expenses attributable to
personal injury, death, or property damage, arising out of, or relating to,
access to the Assets prior to the Closing by Purchaser, its Affiliates, or its
or their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, or
representatives, EVEN IF CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY

 



-39-   THE NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER SOLE, JOINT, OR CONCURRENT), STRICT LIABILITY, OR
OTHER LEGAL FAULT OF ANY INDEMNIFIED PERSON, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT CAUSED BY
THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF SUCH PERSONS. PURCHASER
RECOGNIZES AND AGREES THAT ALL MATERIALS, DOCUMENTS, SAMPLES, REPORTS, AND
OTHER INFORMATION OF ANY TYPE AND NATURE MADE AVAILABLE TO IT, ITS AFFILIATES
OR REPRESENTATIVES, IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY,
WHETHER MADE AVAILABLE PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 6 OR OTHERWISE, ARE MADE AVAILABLE
TO IT AS AN ACCOMMODATION, AND WITHOUT REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, AS TO THE ACCURACY AND COMPLETENESS
OF SUCH MATERIALS, DOCUMENTS, SAMPLES, REPORTS, AND OTHER INFORMATION. NO
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND IS MADE BY SELLER AS TO THE INFORMATION SUPPLIED TO
PURCHASER OR ITS AFFILIATES OR REPRESENTATIVES OR WITH RESPECT TO PROPERTIES
TO WHICH THE INFORMATION RELATES. PURCHASER EXPRESSLY AGREES THAT ANY
RELIANCE UPON SUCH INFORMATION, OR CONCLUSIONS DRAWN THEREFROM, SHALL BE THE
RESULT OF ITS OWN INDEPENDENT REVIEW AND JUDGMENT.

 

6.6 _Governmental Reviews_.

(a) Seller and Purchaser shall each in a timely manner make (or cause their
applicable Affiliates to make) (i) all required filings, and prepare
applications to, and conduct negotiations with, each Governmental Authority
as to which such filings, applications or negotiations are necessary or
appropriate in the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and
(ii) provide such information as the other may reasonably request in order to
make such filings, prepare such applications and conduct such negotiations.
Each Party shall cooperate with and use all reasonable efforts to assist the
other with respect to such filings, applications and negotiations. Purchaser
and Seller shall each bear one-half of the cost of all filing or application
fees payable to any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, regardless of whether Purchaser, Seller, or
any Affiliate of any of them is required to make the payment.

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 6.6(a), as soon as practicable
following the date of this Agreement (or at such other time as may be
mutually agreed between the Parties), the Parties shall make such filings as
may be required by the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, which filings shall include a request for early
termination of any applicable waiting period. Thereafter, the Parties shall
file as promptly as practicable all reports or other documents required or
requested by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission or the U.S. Department of
Justice pursuant to the HSR Act or otherwise including requests for additional
information concerning such transactions, so that the waiting period specified
in the HSR Act will expire or be terminated as soon as reasonably
possible after the date of this Agreement. Each Party shall cause its counsel
to furnish each of the other Parties such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as such other Parties may reasonably request in connection with the
Parties preparation of necessary filings or submissions under the provisions
of the HSR Act. Each Party shall cause its counsel to supply to each other
Party

 



-40-   copies of the date stamped receipt copy of the cover letters delivering the
filings or submissions required under the HSR Act to any Governmental
Authority. Purchaser and Seller shall each bear one-half the cost of all
filing or application fees associated with the HSR Act.

(c) On or before the Closing Date, Purchaser shall have posted or obtained
such bonds, letters of credit, and guarantees, and provided such evidence of
financial responsibility, as may be required for the ownership of the
Properties.

 

(d) Promptly after Closing, Purchaser (with the assistance of Seller, subject
to Section 12.5) shall make all filings with any applicable Governmental
Authority (including in each applicable county), as may be required to
properly assign and transfer the Assets from Seller to Purchaser.

6.7 _Employment Matters_.

(a) _Schedule 6.7_ lists all employees of Seller or its Applicable
Affiliates who are available for hire by Purchaser (the " _Available
Employees_ "). Seller shall provide written notice to Purchaser of (i) the
termination of employment of any Available Employee or (ii) the hiring or
change in duties of any other employee of Seller or its Applicable Affiliates
that causes such employee to become an employee of Seller or its Applicable
Affiliate at the field foreman level or below, in each case within five (5)
Business Days after the date of such termination, hiring or change (and any
individual described in clause (i) of this sentence shall cease to be an
Available Employee and any individual described in clause (ii) of this
sentence shall also be considered an Available Employee for purposes of this
Agreement). From and after the date hereof, and continuing until the Closing
Date, Purchaser shall be permitted to interview any such Available Employee in
connection with prospective employment with Purchaser or its Affiliates. On
or prior to five (5) Business Days prior to the Target Closing Date, Purchaser
shall provide to Seller a list of those Available Employees to whom Purchaser
or its Affiliate will offer employment. Any such offers shall be contingent
on the occurrence of Closing. Available Employees who accept such offers of
employment and become employees of Purchaser or its Affiliate are referred to
herein as " _Transferred Employees_." An Available Employee who accepts an
offer of employment from Purchaser or its Affiliate shall become a Transferred
Employee on the later of the Closing Date or the date upon which such
Available Employee reports for active duty with Purchaser or its Affiliate
(such later date being referred to herein as such Available Employees " _Hire
Date_ ").

(b) Seller shall be responsible for all costs, expenses, damages, liabilities,
and obligations arising from, or relating to, all employees of Seller and its
Applicable Affiliates: (i) who are not Transferred Employees for all periods
prior to, on and after the Closing Date; and (ii) who is a Transferred
Employee for periods prior to such Transferred Employees Hire Date,
including, in each case, termination pay, severance pay, and other
liabilities and obligations under applicable Law, agreement and any Plan
maintained by Seller or its Applicable Affiliates (" _Seller Plan_ "),
including entitlement to wages, benefit coverage, stock options, or
incentive compensation under any Seller Plan. After a Transferred Employees
Hire Date, Purchaser shall be responsible for all notices of termination,
termination pay, severance pay, and other liabilities and obligations under
any Law or otherwise relating to such Transferred Employee and shall be
responsible for entitlement to wages, benefit coverage, bonuses or sales
commissions to such

 



-41-   Transferred Employee, in each case in this sentence, solely in respect of
such Transferred Employees employment with Purchaser or its Affiliate in and
attributable to periods from and after the Hire Date.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a plant closing or a mass layoff occurs
or is deemed to occur with respect to Purchaser and any Transferred Employees
at any time after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall be solely responsible for
providing all notices required under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act, 29 U.S.C. §2109 _et seq_. or the regulations promulgated
thereunder (" _WARN Act_ ") and for taking all remedial measures, including
the payment of all amounts, penalties, liabilities, costs, and expenses if
such notices are not provided. If a plant closing or a mass layoff occurs or
is deemed to occur with respect to Seller or any of its Applicable Affiliates
and: (i) any employees who are not Transferred Employees at any time prior to,
on or after the Closing Date; or (ii) any Available Employees at any time on
or prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall, in each case, be solely
responsible for providing all notices required under the WARN Act and for
taking all remedial measures, including the payment of all
amounts, penalties, liabilities, costs, and expenses if such notices are not
provided.

(d) Effective as of each Transferred Employees Hire Date, Purchaser or its
Affiliate shall make available to such Transferred Employee employee benefits
that shall be the same as the benefits made available to substantially
similarly situated employees of Purchaser and its Affiliates. Purchaser shall
credit each Transferred Employee for the number of years of prior service
credited to such Transferred Employee by Seller under a Seller Plan for all
purposes (including vesting, eligibility, benefit accrual, and level
of benefits) in the corresponding Plan sponsored, maintained, or contributed
to by Purchaser or its Affiliates (" _Purchaser Plans_ "), including, to the
extent applicable, fringe benefit plans, vacation and sick leave policies,
severance plans or policies, and matching contributions under defined
contribution plans, other than for benefit accrual under defined benefit
pension plans subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, which
may be prorated for benefit allocations during the fiscal year in which the
Transferred Employees Hire Date occurs. With respect to each Transferred
Employee and such Transferred Employees dependents, Purchaser or its
Affiliates shall waive, to the extent possible under Purchasers abilities
within any Purchaser Plan that is a welfare benefit plan, any pre-existing
condition exclusions to coverage, any evidence of insurability provisions, any
active at work requirement, and any waiting period or service requirements
that did not exist or had been waived or otherwise satisfied under the
corresponding Seller Plan that is a welfare benefit plan. For each Transferred
Employee, Purchaser or its Affiliates shall also apply towards any
deductible requirements and out-of-pocket maximum limits applicable to the
year of Closing under any Purchaser Plan that is a health plan, any amounts
paid by such Transferred Employee during such year toward such requirements
and limits under the corresponding Seller Plan that is a health plan, with
the exception of any Purchaser Health Savings Account contributions that would
have been made to the applicable Purchaser Plan on a monthly basis during the
months before the Transferred Employees Hire Date. As soon as reasonably
practicable after each Transferred Employees Hire Date, Seller shall provide
to Purchaser the information necessary for Purchaser to comply with its
obligations under this Section 6.7(d) with respect to such Transferred
Employee.

 



-42-  (e) From the date hereof through a date that is twelve (12) months after the
Closing Date (or, if the Closing does not occur, the date hereof), neither
(i) Purchaser nor its Affiliates, (ii) Seller nor its Applicable Affiliates,
nor (iii) any Affiliate of Seller in which a Specified Individual has an
interest, participates, or serves as an officer, director, or employee,
shall, directly or indirectly, (A) solicit or offer employment to any other
officer, director, manager, or employee of the other Party or its Affiliates,
(B) otherwise divert or induce any such Person to terminate or materially
alter its employment or contractual relationship with the other Party or its
Affiliates; or (C) agree to do any of the foregoing, in each case, while such
Person remains employed by, or under contract with, the other Party or its
Affiliates, or within six (6) months after the termination of such Persons
employment (or contract) with the other Party or its Affiliates; _provided,
however_ , that neither Party shall be considered to have breached the terms
of this Section 6.7(e) if any such Person responds to a general advertisement
or a third Person recruiting firm that has not been specifically instructed to
contact such Person. Additionally, from the date hereof through a date that
is twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, neither Seller nor any of its
Affiliates shall solicit, encourage, or induce any Available Employee to
reject an employment offer from Purchaser or its Affiliates or solicit,
encourage or induce any Available Employee to continue in the employment of
Seller or any of its Affiliates from and after the Closing Date. Each Party
shall be liable for the compliance of its Affiliates with the terms of
this Section 6.7(e). Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the other Party
will not have an adequate remedy at law if such first Party or any of its
Affiliates violates (or threatens to violate) any of the terms of this Section
6.7(e). In such event, the other Party shall have the right, in addition to
any other it may have, to obtain injunctive relief to restrain any breach or
threatened breach of the terms of this Section 6.7(e). If either Party or its
respective Affiliate is found to have violated this Section 6.7(e), the
twelve (12) month period referred to herein shall be extended by one month for
each month during which such Party or its Affiliate was in violation so that
the other Party is provided the benefit of the full twelve (12) month period.

(f) On or before the Hire Date of each Transferred Employee, Seller
shall take any necessary action to fully vest as of such date the Transferred
Employees account balances and other benefits under all Seller Plans that (i)
are intended to be qualified under section 401(a) of the Code, (ii)
provide nonqualified deferred compensation benefits or (iii) provide equity
based awards.

(g) Seller shall provide (or cause to be provided) COBRA continuation
coverage (within the meaning of section 4980B of the Code and the Treasury
regulations thereunder) to all individuals who are M and A qualified
beneficiaries (within the meaning assigned to such term under QandA-4 of
Treasury regulation section 54.4980B-9) with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement for the duration of the period to which such
individuals are entitled to such coverage. Seller shall take any and all
necessary actions to ensure that Purchaser and its Affiliates are not
required to provide such continuation coverage to any such individual at any
time.

(h) The provisions of this Section 6.7 are solely for the benefit of the
Parties and nothing in this Section 6.7, express or implied, shall confer upon
any Available Employee, or legal representative or beneficiary thereof, any
rights or remedies, including any right to employment or continued employment
for any specified period, or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind
whatsoever under this Agreement. Nothing in this Section 6.7, express or

 



-43-   implied, shall be (i) deemed an amendment of any Plan providing benefits to
any Available Employee, or (ii) construed to prevent Purchaser or its
Affiliates from terminating or modifying to any extent or in any respect any
Plan that Purchaser or its Affiliates may establish or maintain.

6.8  _Audits and Filings_.

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement, Seller shall, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its Applicable Affiliates and their
respective partners, members, shareholders, owners, officers, directors,
managers, employees, agents and representatives (other than Persons that are
not Applicable Affiliates or partners, members, shareholders, owners,
officers, directors, managers, employees, agents and representatives of
Applicable Affiliates) to, cooperate with Purchaser, its Affiliates and their
respective agents and representatives in connection with compliance with
Purchasers and its Affiliates Tax, financial, or other reporting
requirements and audits, including (i) any filings with any Governmental
Authority and (ii) any filings that may be required by the United States
Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ "), under securities Laws
applicable to Purchaser and its Affiliates, including the filing by Purchaser
with the SEC of one or more registration statements to register any securities
of Purchaser under the Securities Act of 1933 (the " _Securities Act_ ") or
of any report required to be filed by Purchaser under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (together with the Securities Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated under such acts, the " _Securities Laws_ ") (collectively, the "
_Filings_ "). Further, from and after the date of this Agreement, Seller
shall, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its Applicable
Affiliates to, make available to Purchaser and its Affiliates and their
agents and representatives any and all books, records, information and
documents that are attributable to the Assets in Sellers or its Applicable
Affiliates possession or control reasonably required by Purchaser, its
Affiliates and their agents and representatives in order to prepare for
Purchaser or its Affiliates, if required, in connection with such Filings,
financial statements relating to the Assets or to Seller or its Applicable
Affiliates meeting the requirements of Regulation S-X under the Securities
Act, along with any documentation attributable to the Assets or otherwise
relating to Seller or its Applicable Affiliates required to complete any audit
associated with such financial statements.

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 6.8(a), from and after the date
of this Agreement, Seller shall, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause its Applicable Affiliates to, cooperate with the independent auditors
chosen by Purchaser (" _Purchaser s Auditor_") in connection with any audit
by Purchasers Auditor of any financial statements of the Assets or of Seller
or its Applicable Affiliates that Purchaser or any of its Affiliates requires
to comply with the requirements of the Securities Laws or other Tax, financial
or reporting requirements. Such cooperation will include (i) reasonable
access to Sellers officers, managers, employees, agents and representatives
who were responsible for preparing or maintaining the financial records and
work papers and other supporting documents used in the preparation of such
financial statements as may be required by Purchasers Auditor to perform an
audit or conduct a review in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards or to otherwise verify such financial statements, (ii) delivery of

opinion acceptable to Purchasers Auditor with respect to an audit or review
of those financial records required pursuant to this Section 6.8(b) and (iii)
using reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of the

 



-44-   independent auditor of Seller that conducted any audit of such financial
statements to be named as an expert in any report filed by Purchaser with the
SEC. Purchaser will reimburse Seller, within ten (10) Business Days after
demand in writing therefor, for any reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by
Seller or its Applicable Affiliates in complying with the provisions of this
Section 6.8(b). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall expand
Sellers representations, warranties, covenants, or agreements set forth in
this Agreement or give Purchaser, its Affiliates, or any third Person any
rights to which it is not entitled hereunder.

 

(c) Without limiting the generality of Section 12.7(c), for a period of three
(3) years following the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its Applicable
Affiliates to, retain all books, records, information and documents in its or
its Applicable Affiliates possession that are necessary to prepare and audit
financial statements with respect to the Assets or otherwise relating to
Seller or its Applicable Affiliates, except to the extent originals or copies
thereof are transferred to Purchaser in connection with Closing.

6.9 _Further Assurances_. After Closing, Seller and Purchaser each agrees to
take such further actions and to execute, acknowledge and deliver all such
further documents as are reasonably requested by the other for carrying out
the purposes of this Agreement or of any document delivered pursuant to this
Agreement.

shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser, using and based upon the best
information available to Seller, a preliminary settlement statement estimating
the Purchase Price for the Assets after giving effect to all adjustments set
forth in Section 2.3. The estimate delivered in accordance with this Section
8.4(a), less the Deposit and the Holdback Deposit, shall constitute the dollar
amount to be payable by Purchaser to Seller at the Closing (the " _Closing
Payment_ ").

 

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing but not later than the
one hundred and twentieth (120th) day following the Closing Date, Seller
shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser a draft statement setting forth the
final calculation of the Purchase Price and showing the calculation of each
adjustment under Section 2.3, based on the most recent actual figures for
each adjustment. Seller shall, at Purchasers request, make such reasonable
documentation as is in Sellers possession available to support the final
figures. As soon as reasonably practicable, but not later than the
thirtieth (30th) day following receipt of such statement from Seller,
Purchaser shall deliver to Seller a written report containing any changes that
Purchaser proposes be made to such statement. Seller may deliver a written
report to 

 



-49-   Purchaser during this same period reflecting any changes that Seller
proposes to be made to such statement as a result of additional information
received after the statement was prepared. If Purchaser does not deliver such
report to Seller on or before the end of such thirty (30) day period,
Purchaser shall be deemed to have agreed with Sellers statement, and such
statement shall become final and binding upon the Parties. 

(c) The Parties shall undertake to agree on the final statement of the
Purchase Price no later than ninety (90) days after delivery of Sellers
statement. In the event that the Parties cannot reach agreement within such
period of time, any Party may refer the items of adjustment which are in
dispute to the Houston, Texas office of KPMG LLP, or, if such firm is not
able or willing to serve, a nationally-recognized independent accounting firm
or consulting firm mutually acceptable to both Purchaser and Seller (the "
_Accounting Arbitrator_ "), for review and final determination
by arbitration. The Accounting Arbitrator shall conduct the arbitration
proceedings in Houston, Texas in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration
Rules of the American Arbitration Association, to the extent such rules do not
conflict with the terms of this Section 8.4(c). The Accounting Arbitrators
determination shall be made within forty-five (45) days after submission of
the matters in dispute and shall be final and binding on all Parties, without
right of appeal. In determining the proper amount of any adjustment to the
Purchase Price, the Accounting Arbitrator shall be bound by the terms of
Article 2 and may not increase the Purchase Price more than the increase
proposed by Seller nor decrease the Purchase Price more than the decrease
proposed by Purchaser, as applicable. The Accounting Arbitrator shall act as
an expert for the limited purpose of determining the specific disputed aspects
of Purchase Price adjustments submitted by any Party and may not award
damages, interest (except as expressly provided for in this Section) or
penalties to any Party with respect to any matter. Seller and Purchaser shall
each bear their own legal fees and other costs of presenting its case. Seller
shall bear one half and Purchaser shall bear one half of the costs and
expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator. Within ten (10) days after the earlier
of (i) the expiration of Purchasers thirty (30) day review period without
delivery of any written report or (ii) the date on which the Parties or the
Accounting Arbitrator finally determine the Purchase Price (the " _Final
Purchase Price_ "), (x) Purchaser shall pay to Seller the amount by which the
Final Purchase Price (less the Deposit and Holdback Deposit) exceeds the
Closing Payment or (y) Seller shall pay to Purchaser the amount by which the
Closing Payment exceeds the Final Purchase Price (less the Deposit and
Holdback Deposit), as applicable. 

(d) Purchaser shall assist Seller in preparation of the final statement of the
Purchase Price under Section 8.4(b) by furnishing invoices, receipts,
reasonable access to personnel, and such other assistance as may be requested
by Seller to facilitate such process post-Closing.

(e) All payments made or to be made under this Agreement to Seller shall be
made by electronic transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account
as may be specified by Seller in writing. All payments made or to be made
hereunder to Purchaser shall be by electronic transfer or immediately
available funds to a bank and account specified by Purchaser in writing.

 



-50-  8.5 _Indemnity Holdback_.

 

(a) On the Closing Date, Purchaser shall deposit into the Escrow Account an
additional amount equal to (i) ten percent (10%) of the Unadjusted Purchase
Price (as adjusted at Closing for Assets excluded at Closing pursuant to
Section 3.13(b) only), minus (ii) Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000) (such
amount, the " _Holdback Deposit_ " and, together with the Deposit, the "
_Indemnity Holdback_ ") for the purpose of securing the satisfaction and
discharge of indemnity claims of Purchaser against Seller under this Agreement
and special warranty claims of Purchaser under the Assignment and Bill of
Sale. For the avoidance of doubt, the Indemnity Holdback represents a
deduction from, and is not in addition to, the Purchase Price paid by
Purchaser to Seller on the Closing Date and does not represent a part of the
Closing Payment. The Indemnity Holdback shall be governed by the provisions
of this Section 8.5 and the Escrow Agreement. The joint, written authorization
of representatives of both Purchaser and Seller pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement shall be required for the disbursement of any portion of the
Indemnity Holdback.

(b) With respect to each claim for indemnification asserted by Purchaser
against Seller pursuant to Article 11 or special warranty claim pursuant to
the Assignment and Bill of Sale during the period from and after the Closing
Date up to the date that is twelve (12) months following the Closing Date
(the " _Holdback Period_ "), upon final resolution or determination of such
an indemnity or warranty claim by the Parties or in accordance with Section
12.9, as applicable, Purchaser and Seller shall jointly instruct the Escrow
Agent to disburse to Purchaser the amount set forth in such joint
instruction, which will be that portion of the Indemnity Holdback being held
in the Escrow Account as would satisfy such finally resolved or determined
indemnity or warranty claim, together with a pro rata portion of the then-
accrued interest on the Indemnity Holdback. If, upon the resolution or
determination of any such indemnity or warranty claim, Purchaser and Seller
fail to deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent in accordance
with the foregoing sentence, then the Escrow Agent shall, upon delivery by
Purchaser or Seller to the Escrow Agent of a written court order from a court
of competent jurisdiction, pay to Purchaser the amounts set forth in such
court order.

(c) Purchaser and Seller shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to release to
Seller any amounts then-remaining in the Escrow Account on the first Business
Day after the expiration of the Holdback Period, except for the aggregate
amount of all outstanding claims for indemnification or warranty which
Purchaser has provided to Seller in accordance with Article 11 that have not
been previously satisfied (which monies shall remain part of the Escrow
Account until final resolution of such outstanding indemnity and/or warranty
claims). If Purchaser and Seller fail to deliver a joint written instruction
to the Escrow Agent in accordance with the foregoing sentence, then the Escrow
Agent shall, upon delivery by Purchaser or Seller to the Escrow Agent of a
written court order from a court of competent jurisdiction, pay to Seller
the amounts set forth in such court order, together with all interest or
income on or with respect to the Indemnity Holdback.

 

8.6 Transition Services. At the Closing, Seller and Purchaser will enter, and
Seller shall cause the Specified Individuals to enter into, a transition
services agreement in the form of _Exhibit C_ (the " _Transition Services
Agreement_ ").

 



-51-  ARTICLE 9

TAX MATTERS

9.1 _Tax Returns; Liability for Taxes_. 

(a) Except with respect to Production Taxes and Property Taxes, or as provided
otherwise in this Agreement:

 

(i) for any Tax period or the portion of any Tax period ending on or before
the Closing Date, Seller shall be responsible for preparing and timely filing
all Tax Returns required by applicable Law to be filed and for the payment of
all Taxes levied or imposed that are attributable to the Assets;

(ii) for any Tax period or portion of any Tax period beginning after the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall be responsible for preparing and the timely
filing of all Tax Returns required by applicable Law to be filed and for the
payment of all Taxes levied or imposed that are attributable to the Assets;
and

(iii) control of any legal or administrative proceedings concerning any Taxes
with respect to the Assets, and entitlement to any refunds or awards
concerning any such Taxes with respect to such Assets, shall rest with the
Party responsible for payment therefor under this Section 9.1.

(b) With respect to Property Taxes:

 

(i) any Property Taxes assessed on any of the Assets for a Tax period that
begins before and ends after the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "),
liability for such Property Taxes shall be prorated on a daily basis between
Purchaser and Seller, with Seller being liable for the portion of such
Property Taxes equal to the product of (A) the amount of such Property Taxes
for the entirety of the Straddle Period, multiplied by (B) a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period ending prior
to the Effective Date and the denominator of which is the total number of
days in the Straddle Period, and with Purchaser being liable for the remainder
of such Property Taxes;

(ii) After the Closing, the Party (the " _Paying Party_ ") receiving a
Property Tax bill or notice applicable to the Assets for a Straddle Period
shall promptly notify the other Party or Parties that may be responsible for a
portion of such Property Taxes pursuant to this Section 9.1(b)(ii) (the "
_Reimbursing Party_ ") in writing, and the Paying Party shall pay such
Property Tax bill prior to the last day such Property Taxes may be paid
without penalty or interest. Upon receipt of the written notice from the
Paying Party, which shall include appropriate supporting documentation, the
Reimbursing Party shall promptly pay the Paying Party any amount equal to the
portion of the Taxes for which the Reimbursing Party is liable under this
Agreement. The Parties shall reasonably cooperate with each other after
Closing with respect to any Property Tax assessment or valuation (or protest
in connection therewith) by any Governmental Authority with respect to a
Straddle Period; and

(iii) If any Party receives a refund of any Property Taxes with respect to the
Assets that is attributable to a Straddle Period, the Party receiving such
refund, whether

 



-52-   received in cash, or as a credit against another state and/or local Tax,
shall, within thirty (30) days after the receipt of such refund, pay to the
other Party who was responsible for a portion of such Property Taxes an
amount equal to the product of (A) the amount of the refund, multiplied by (B)
a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the Straddle
Period that such other Party was responsible for such Property Taxes and the
denominator of which is the total number of days in the Straddle Period.

(c) Production Taxes incurred in connection with production occurring prior
to the Effective Date shall be the responsibility of the Seller and the Seller
shall indemnify the Purchaser against all such Taxes to the extent such Taxes
are not taken into account by Sections 2.3 and 2.4, as applicable.

9.2 _Contest Provisions_.

 

(a) Each of Purchaser, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand (the "
_Tax Indemnified Person_ "), shall notify Seller or Purchaser, as the case
may be (the " _Tax Indemnifying Person_ "), in writing within ten (10)
Business Days of receipt by the Tax Indemnified Person of written notice of
any pending or threatened audits, adjustments, claims, examinations,
assessments, or other proceedings (a " _Tax Audit_ ") which may affect the
liability for Taxes of such other Party. If the Tax Indemnified Person fails
to give such timely notice to the other Party, it shall not be entitled to
indemnification for any Taxes arising in connection with such Tax Audit to the
extent that such failure to give notice adversely affects the other Partys
right to participate in the Tax Audit.

 

(b) If such Tax Audit relates to any Taxes for which only Seller would be
liable to indemnify Purchaser under this Agreement, Seller shall have the
option, at their expense, to control the defense and settlement of such Tax
Audit. If such Tax Audit relates to any Taxes for which Purchaser would be
liable to any extent under this Agreement, Purchaser shall, at its expense,
control the defense and settlement of such Tax Audit to the extent that such
Tax Audit relates to Tax Items for which Purchaser is liable to indemnify
Seller under Section 9.1 or 11.3(a)(i) (with respect to Section 11.1(f)).

 

(c) If such Tax Audit relates to Taxes for which both Seller and Purchaser
could be liable under this Agreement, to the extent practicable, such Tax
Items will be distinguished and each Party will have the option to control the
defense and settlement of those Taxes for which it is so liable.

(d) Any Party whose liability for Taxes may be affected by a Tax Audit shall
be entitled to participate at its expense in such defense and to employ
counsel of its choice at its expense and shall have the right to consent to
any settlement of such Tax Audit (not to be unreasonably withheld) to the
extent that such settlement would have an adverse effect with respect to a
period for which that party is liable for Taxes, under this Agreement
or otherwise.

9.3 _Post-Closing Actions Which Affect Tax Liability_. Purchaser shall not,
and shall not permit its Affiliates to, take any action (including the
amendment of any Tax Return, other than as required by applicable Laws) on or
after the Closing Date which could increase Sellers liability for Taxes
(including any liability of Seller to indemnify Purchaser for Taxes

 



-53-   under this Agreement). Seller shall not, and shall not permit its Applicable
Affiliates to, take any action (including the amendment of any Tax Return,
other than as required by applicable Laws) on or after the Closing Date which
could increase Purchasers liability for Taxes (including any liability of
Purchaser to indemnify Seller for Taxes under this Agreement).

 

9.4 _Refunds_. Each of Seller and Purchaser agrees to pay to the other Party
any refund received (whether by payment, credit, offset, or otherwise, and
together with any interest thereon) after the Closing by such Party or its
Affiliates in respect of any Taxes for which the other Party is responsible
pursuant to Section 9.1. Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate in order to
take all necessary steps to claim any such refund. Any such refund received by
Seller or Purchaser, or any of their respective Affiliates, shall be paid to
Seller or Purchaser, as applicable, within thirty (30) days after such
refund is received. Each Party shall notify the other Party within ten (10)
days following the discovery of a right to claim any such refund and upon the
receipt of any such refund. In the event that a Party receives written
notification from the other Party that such Party has the right to claim a
refund to which such other Party is entitled hereunder, such Party shall, at
the sole expense of such other Party, take any actions that are reasonably
required to claim such refund as promptly as practicable after receipt of
such notification and shall furnish to such other Party, if requested in
writing by such other Party, all information, records, and assistance
reasonably necessary to verify the amount of such refund.

 

9.5 _Access to Information_.

(a) From and after Closing, each Party shall grant to the other Party (or its
designees) access at all reasonable times to all of the information, books,
and records relating to the Assets within the possession of such Party
(including work papers and correspondence with any Governmental Authority, but
excluding work product of and attorney-client communications with such Partys
legal counsel and personnel files), and shall afford the other Party (or its
designees) the right (at such Partys sole expense) to take extracts therefrom
and to make copies thereof, to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the
other Party (or its designees) to prepare Tax Returns, to
conduct negotiations with any Governmental Authority, and to implement the
provisions of, or to investigate or defend any claims between the Parties
arising under, this Agreement.

(b) In the case of any Taxes with respect to the Assets for which the other
Party may be liable hereunder, each of the Parties will preserve and retain
all schedules, work papers and other documents relating to any Tax Returns or
to any Tax claims, audits, or other proceedings until the expiration of the
statute of limitations (including extensions) applicable to the taxable period
to which such documents relate or until the final determination of any
controversy with respect to such taxable period, and until the final
determination of any payments that may be required with respect to such
taxable period under this Agreement.

 

(c) Each Party shall provide reasonable access to its Affiliates (or, with
respect to Seller, its Applicable Affiliates) personnel who have knowledge
of the information described in this Section 9.5.

9.6 _Conflict_. In the event of a conflict between the provisions of this
Article 9 and any other provision of this Agreement, except Section 12.3
hereof, this Article 9 shall control.

Closing: (a) by the mutual prior written consent of Seller and Purchaser, or
(b) by either Seller or Purchaser if the Closing has not occurred on or
before August 31, 2012; _provided, however_ , that no Party shall be entitled

for any willful failure to perform or observe in any material respect any of
its agreements or covenants contained herein that are to be performed
or observed at or prior to Closing. In the event that (a) Seller has
willfully failed to perform or observe in any material respect any of its
agreements or covenants contained herein which are to be performed or observed
at or prior to Closing, and (b) Purchaser is, as a result, entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1, then Purchaser, subject to
Section 12.20, shall be entitled to (i) obtain all remedies available at law
or in equity, including specific performance, and recover court costs and
attorneys fees in addition to any other relief to which the other Party may
be entitled, or (ii) terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1 and
recover any damages incurred by Purchaser in connection with such termination
(including court costs and reasonable attorneys fees).

10.3  _Distribution of Deposit Upon Termination_.

(a) If Seller terminates this Agreement under Section 10.1(b), and Purchaser
has willfully failed to perform or observe in any material respect its
covenants and agreements or willfully breaches in any material respect its
representations and warranties hereunder, Seller shall be entitled, as its
sole remedy under this Agreement or pursuant to applicable Law, to retain the
Deposit as liquidated damages, free of any claims by Purchaser or any other
Person. In such event, Seller and Purchaser shall execute and deliver joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent to disburse the Deposit together
with any income thereon to Seller. It is expressly stipulated by the Parties
that the actual amount of damages resulting from such a termination would be
extremely difficult or impossible to determine accurately because of (among
other things) the unique nature of the Assets and the uncertainties of
applicable commodity markets, and the amount of the Deposit is a fair and
reasonable estimate by the Parties of such damages.

 

(b) If this Agreement is terminated for any reason other than the reasons set
forth in Section 10.3(a), Seller shall deliver to Purchaser the Deposit, free
of any claims by Seller or any other Person with respect thereto. In such
event, Seller and Purchaser shall execute and deliver joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent to disburse the Deposit together with
any income thereon to Purchaser.

defects, deficiencies, or other title matters;

-57-  EVEN IF SUCH DAMAGES ARE CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER
SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL FAULT OF ANY

PRE-EXISTING CONDITION, BUT EXCLUDING THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL

Section 11.3(b) at the time the claim notice is presented by Purchaser.

 

(b) From and after Closing, Seller shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, from
and after Closing, Sellers and Purchasers sole and exclusive remedy against
each other with respect to breaches of the representations, warranties,
covenants, and agreements of the Parties contained in Article 4, Article 5,
Article 6 (excluding Sections 6.5, 6.7(e), 6.8, and 6.9, which shall be
separately enforceable pursuant to whatever rights and remedies are available
to the Parties thereunder outside of this Article 11 and Section 4.7, the sole
and exclusive remedy for which shall be pursuant to Section 2.3), and the
affirmations of such representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements
contained in the certificates delivered by each Party at Closing pursuant to
Sections 8.2(e) and 8.3(d), as applicable, is set forth in this Section 11.3
(and, with respect to the representation and warranty in Section 4.7, Section
2.3) and if no such

 



-58-   right of indemnification is expressly provided, then such claims are hereby
waived to the fullest extent permitted by Law. Except for the remedies
contained in this Section 11.3 (and, with respect to the representation and
warranty in Section 4.7, Section 2.3) and any other remedies available to the
Parties at law or in equity for breaches of this Agreement other than Article
4, Article 5, and Article 6 (excluding Sections 6.5, 6.7(e), 6.8, and 6.9),
upon Closing each Party releases, remises, and forever discharges the other
and its and their respective Affiliates and all such Persons shareholders,
officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors, and representatives from
any and all suits, legal or administrative proceedings, claims, demands,
Damages, losses, costs, liabilities, interest, or causes of action whatsoever,
in law or in equity, known or unknown, which such Parties might now or
subsequently may have, based on, relating to, or arising out of this Agreement
or Sellers ownership, use, or operation of the Assets, or the condition,
quality, status, or nature of the Assets, INCLUDING RIGHTS TO
CONTRIBUTION UNDER THE COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION AND
LIABILITY ACT OF 1980, AS AMENDED, THE OIL POLLUTION ACT OF 1990, AS AMENDED,
BREACHES OF STATUTORY AND IMPLIED WARRANTIES, NUISANCE OR OTHER TORT ACTIONS,
RIGHTS TO PUNITIVE DAMAGES, COMMON LAW RIGHTS OF CONTRIBUTION, ANY RIGHTS
UNDER INSURANCE POLICIES ISSUED OR UNDERWRITTEN BY THE OTHER PARTY OR ANY OF
ITS AFFILIATES, EVEN IF CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER
SOLE, JOINT, OR CONCURRENT), STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHER LEGAL FAULT OF ANY
RELEASED PERSON INVITEE, OR THIRD PARTY, AND WHETHER OR NOT CAUSED BY A PRE-
EXISTING CONDITION.

 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Section 11.3(c) shall not apply in respect
of Tax matters (other than with respect to Section 4.3), which are covered by
Article 2 and Article 9 and Section 12.3 or claims for Property Costs, which
are covered by Sections 2.3, 2.4, and 8.4 (except as set forth in Section 11.2
and Section 11.3(b)(i)).

(e) The Parties shall treat, for Tax purposes, any amounts paid pursuant to
this Article 11 as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

11.4 _Indemnification Actions_. All claims for indemnification under Sections
6.5 or 11.3 shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

(a) For purposes of this Article 11, the term " _Indemnifying Person_ " when
used in connection with particular Damages shall mean the Person having an
obligation to indemnify another Person or Persons with respect to such Damages
pursuant to this Article 11, and the term " _Indemnified Person_ " when used
in connection with particular Damages shall mean a Person having the right to
be indemnified with respect to such Damages pursuant to this Article 11
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, those Persons identified in Section
11.4(h)).

(b) To make a claim for indemnification under Sections 6.5 or 11.3,
an Indemnified Person shall notify the Indemnifying Person of its claim,
including the specific details of and specific basis under this Agreement for
its claim (the " _Claim Notice_ "). In the event that the claim for
indemnification is based upon a claim by a third Person against the
Indemnified Person (a " _Claim_ "), the Indemnified Person shall provide its
Claim Notice promptly after the Indemnified Person has actual knowledge of the
Claim and shall enclose a complete

 



-59-   copy of all papers (if any) served with respect to the Claim; provided that
the failure of any Indemnified Person to give notice of a Claim as provided in
this Section 11.4 shall not relieve the Indemnifying Person of its
obligations under Sections 6.5 or 11.3, except to the extent such failure
results in insufficient time being available to permit the Indemnifying Person
to effectively defend against the Claim or otherwise prejudices the
Indemnifying Persons ability to defend against the Claim. In the event that
the claim for indemnification is based upon an inaccuracy or breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement, the Claim Notice
shall specify the representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement that was
inaccurate or breached.

(c) In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon a Claim, the
Indemnifying Person shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of the Claim
Notice to notify the Indemnified Person whether it admits or denies its
obligation to defend the Indemnified Person against such Claim under Section
6.5 or this Article 11, as applicable. If the Indemnifying Person does not
notify the Indemnified Person within such thirty (30) day period regarding
whether the Indemnifying Person admits or denies its obligation to defend the
Indemnified Person, it shall be conclusively deemed obligated to provide such
indemnification hereunder. The Indemnified Person is authorized, prior to and
during such thirty (30) day period, to file any motion, answer, or other
pleading that it shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect its interests
or those of the Indemnifying Person and that is not prejudicial to the
Indemnifying Person.

 

(d) If the Indemnifying Person admits its obligation, it shall have the right
and obligation to diligently defend, at its sole cost and expense, the Claim.
Except as set forth in this Section 11.4(d), the Indemnifying Person shall
have full control of such defense and proceedings, including any compromise or
settlement thereof. If requested by the Indemnifying Person, the Indemnified
Person agrees to cooperate in contesting any Claim which the Indemnifying
Person elects to contest ( _provided, however_ , that the Indemnified Person
shall not be required to bring any counterclaim or cross-complaint against
any Person). The Indemnified Person may participate in, but not control, any
defense or settlement of any Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Person
pursuant to this Section 11.4(d). An Indemnifying Person shall not, without
the written consent of the Indemnified Person, settle any Claim or consent to
the entry of any judgment with respect thereto that (i) does not result in a
final, non-appealable, resolution of the Indemnified Persons liability with
respect to the Claim (including, in the case of a settlement, an
unconditional written release of the Indemnified Person from all further
liability in respect of such Claim) or (ii) may materially and adversely
affect the Indemnified Person (other than as a result of money damages
covered by the indemnity).

(e) If the Indemnifying Person does not admit its obligation or admits
its obligation but fails to diligently defend or settle the Claim, then the
Indemnified Person shall have the right to defend against the Claim (at the
sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Person, if the Indemnified Person is
entitled to indemnification hereunder), with counsel of the Indemnified
Persons choosing, subject to the right of the Indemnifying Person to admit
its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Person and assume the defense of
the Claim at any time prior to settlement or final, non-appealable
determination thereof. If the Indemnifying Person has not yet admitted its
obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Person, the Indemnified Person shall
send written notice to the Indemnifying Person of any proposed settlement and
the

 



-60-   Indemnifying Person shall have the option for ten (10) days following
receipt of such notice to (i) admit in writing its obligation for
indemnification with respect to such Claim and (ii) if its obligation is so
admitted, assume the defense of the Claim, including the power to reject the
proposed settlement. If the Indemnified Person settles any Claim over the
objection of the Indemnifying Person after the Indemnifying Person has timely
admitted its obligation for indemnification in writing and assumed the defense
of the Claim, the Indemnified Person shall be deemed to have waived any right
to indemnity therefor.

 

(f) If a Party would be required to defend a Claim as provided in this Section
11.4, which Claim is unliquidated in amount, but for the assertion that the
other Party would not be entitled to indemnification for any Damages incurred
or suffered by such Party due solely to the limitations set forth in Section
11.6(c) with respect to the amount of such Claim, such Party
shall nevertheless have the right and obligation to defend against such Claim
as set forth in Section 11.4(d), subject to the indemnification obligations of
such Party set forth in Section 6.5 or this Article 11, as applicable;
_provided, however_ , that if, upon final, non-appealable liquidation of the
amount of such Claim, the Party defending such Claim pursuant to this Section
11.4(f) would not have had the obligation to defend such Claim under Section
11.6(c) due solely to the limitations set forth in Section 11.6(c) with
respect to the amount of such Claim, the Party defending such Claim shall be
entitled to reimbursement of all reasonable costs and expenses incurred with
respect to the defense of such Claim.

(g) In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a Claim, the
Indemnifying Person shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of the Claim
Notice to (i) cure the Damages complained of, (ii) admit its obligation to
provide indemnification with respect to such Damages, or (iii) dispute the
claim for such Damages. If the Indemnifying Person does not notify the
Indemnified Person within such thirty (30) day period that it has cured the
Damages or that it disputes the claim for such Damages, the Indemnifying
Person shall be conclusively deemed obligated to provide indemnification
hereunder.

(h) Any claim for indemnity under Sections 6.5 or 11.3 by any Affiliate,
director, officer, employee or agent must be brought and administered by the
applicable Party to this Agreement. No Indemnified Person other than Seller
and Purchaser shall have any rights against Seller or Purchaser under the
terms of Section 6.5 or Section 11.3 except as may be exercised on its behalf
by Purchaser or Seller, as applicable, pursuant to this Section 11.4(h).
Seller and Purchaser may elect to exercise or not exercise indemnification
rights under this Section 11.4 on behalf of the other Indemnified Persons
affiliated with it in its sole discretion and shall have no liability to any
such other Indemnified Person for any action or inaction under this Section
11.4.

 

(i) _Schedule 11.1_ sets forth certain procedures relating to Schedule 11.1
Matters.

 

11.5 _Casualty and Condemnation_. If, after the date of this Agreement but
prior to Closing Date, any portion of the Assets is destroyed by fire or
other casualty or is expropriated or taken in condemnation or under right of
eminent domain (a " _Casualty Loss_ "), this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect, and Purchaser shall nevertheless be required to close. In
the event that the aggregate amount of the costs and expenses associated with
repairing or restoring

 



-61-   the Assets affected by such Casualty Losses exceeds One Million Dollars
($1,000,000), Seller must elect by written notice to Purchaser prior to
Closing either (a) to cause the Assets affected by any Casualty Loss to be
repaired or restored, at Sellers sole cost, as promptly as reasonably
practicable (which work may extend after the Closing Date), or (b) to
indemnify Purchaser through a document reasonably acceptable to Seller and
Purchaser against any costs or expenses that Purchaser reasonably incurs to
repair or restore the Assets subject to such Casualty Loss; provided that
Seller may only elect the option set forth in clause (a) above
with Purchasers prior written consent. In each case, Seller shall retain all
rights to insurance and other claims against third Persons with respect to the
casualty or taking except to the extent the Parties otherwise agree in
writing.

 

11.6 _Limitation on Actions_.

(a) The representations and warranties of Seller and Purchaser in Article 4
(excluding Sections 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.9, 4.10, 4.15, and 4.16) and the
covenants and agreements of the Parties in Article 6, (excluding Sections
6.5, 6.7, 6.9, and 12.4), and the corresponding representations, warranties,
and affirmations given in the certificates delivered at Closing pursuant to
Sections 8.2(e) and 8.3(d), as applicable, shall survive the Closing for a
period of twelve (12) months. The representations and warranties of Seller set
forth in Sections 4.3, 4.15, and 4.16 shall survive the Closing for the
applicable statute of limitations period, and the representation and warranty
of Seller set forth in Section 4.7 shall survive the Closing until the Cut-Off
Date. The covenants of Seller in Section 12.4 shall survive the Closing until
the expiration of the Restricted Period. The remainder of this Agreement
shall survive the Closing without time limit except as may otherwise be
expressly provided herein. Representations, warranties, covenants, and
agreements shall be of no further force and effect after the date of their
expiration, provided that there shall be no termination of any bona fide
claim asserted pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such a
representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement prior to its expiration date.

 

(b) The indemnities in Sections 11.3(a)(ii), 11.3(a)(iii), 11.3(b)(ii), and
11.3(b)(iii) shall terminate as of the termination date of each respective
representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement that is subject to
indemnification, except in each case as to matters for which a specific
written claim for indemnity has been delivered to the Indemnifying Person on
or before such termination date. The indemnity in Section 11.3(b)(iv) shall
automatically terminate at the end of the Restricted Period, except as to
matters for which a specific written claim for indemnity has been delivered to
the Indemnifying Person on or before such termination date. The indemnity in
Section 11.3(b)(i) shall survive the Closing as set forth in Sections 2.3 and
2.4 with respect to Section 11.2(b) and without time limit with respect to
Sections 11.2(a), 11.2(c), 11.2(d), 11.2(e), 11.2(f), 11.2(g), and 11.2(h).
The indemnities in Section 11.3(a)(i) and 11.3(a)(iv), any indemnity given
pursuant to Section 11.5, and the special procedures for Schedule 11.1 Matters
set forth on _Schedule 11.1_ shall continue without time limit.

(c) No Party shall have any liability for any indemnification under Sections
11.3(a)(iii), 11.3(b)(i) (but only with respect to Section 11.2(f)),
11.3(b)(ii) (but only with respect to Sections 6.4(b) and 6.4(e)), or
11.3(b)(iii) for an individual matter until and unless the amount of the
liability for Damages with respect to which such Party admits (or it is
otherwise finally determined that such Party has) an obligation to indemnify
the other Party

 



-62-   pursuant to the terms of Sections 11.3(a)(iii), 11.3(b)(i) (but only with
respect to Section 11.2(f)), or 11.3(b)(iii), as applicable exceeds One
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) (the " _Individual Indemnity Threshold_
"). Without limiting the foregoing, Seller shall not have any liability for
any indemnification under Sections 11.3(b)(i) (but only with respect to
Section 11.2(f)), 11.3(b)(ii) (but only with respect to Sections 6.4(b) and
6.4(e)), or 11.3(b)(iii) until and unless the aggregate amount of the
liability for all Damages (i) for which Claim Notices are delivered by
Purchaser, (ii) with respect to which Seller admits (or it is otherwise
finally determined) that Seller has an obligation to indemnify Purchaser
pursuant to the terms of Section 11.3, and (iii) which exceed the Individual
Indemnity Threshold exceeds two percent (2%) of the Unadjusted Purchase
Price, and then only to the extent such Damages exceed two percent (2%) of the
Unadjusted Purchase Price. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 11.6(c)
shall not limit indemnification for breach of the representations
and warranties in Sections 4.1, 4.3, 4.9, 4.10, 4.14, 4.15, or 4.16, or
Purchasers representations and warranties in Article 5\.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere in this
Agreement, Seller shall not be required to indemnify Purchaser under this
Article 11 (other than pursuant to Section 11.3(b)(i) with respect to Section
11.2(c)) for aggregate Damages in excess of fifteen percent (15%) of the
Unadjusted Purchase Price; _provided, however_ , that this Section 11.6(d)
shall not limit indemnification for (i) breach of the representations and
warranties in Sections 4.1, 4.3 , 4.9, 4.10, 4.14, 4.15, or 4.16, (ii) breach
of the covenants and agreements set forth in Sections 6.3, 6.7, 6.9, or 12.4;
or (iii) Sellers obligations under the special warranty of title in the
Assignment and Bill of Sale.

(e) The amount of any Damages for which an Indemnified Person is entitled to
indemnity under this Article 11 shall be reduced by the amount of insurance
proceeds realized by the Indemnified Person or its Affiliates with respect to
such Damages (net of any collection costs, and excluding the proceeds of any
insurance policy issued or underwritten by the Indemnified Person or its
Affiliates); _provided, however_ , that no Party shall be required to seek
recovery under any policy of insurance as a condition to indemnification
hereunder.

(f) Seller shall not have any obligation or liability under this Agreement or
in connection with or with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement for any breach, misrepresentation, or noncompliance with respect to
any representation, warranty, covenant, indemnity, or obligation if such
breach, misrepresentation, or noncompliance shall have been waived in writing
by Purchaser.

(g) As used in this Agreement, the term " _Damages_ " means the amount of any
actual liability, loss, cost, expense, claim, award, or judgment incurred or
suffered by any Person, whether attributable to personal injury or death,
property damage, contract claims, torts, or otherwise, including reasonable
fees and expenses of attorneys, consultants, accountants, or other agents and
experts reasonably incident to matters indemnified against, and the costs of
investigation and/or monitoring of such matters, and the costs of enforcement
of the indemnity; _provided, however_ , that "Damages" shall not include any
adjustment for Taxes that may be assessed on payments under Section 6.5 or
this Article 11 or for Tax benefits received by the Indemnified Person as a
consequence of any Damages. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Purchaser
nor Seller shall be entitled to indemnification under Section 6.5 or this
Article 11 for, and Damages shall not include, (i) loss of profits, whether
actual or consequential, or other

 



-63-   consequential damages suffered by the Party claiming indemnification, or any
punitive damages (other than loss of profits, consequential damages, or
punitive damages suffered by third Persons for which responsibility is
allocated among the Parties), and (ii) any increase in liability, loss, cost,
expense, claim, award or judgment to the extent such increase is caused by the
actions or omissions of any Indemnified Person after the Closing Date.

-64-  Either Party may change its address for notice by notice to the other in the
manner set forth above. All notices shall be deemed to have been duly given
at the time of receipt by the Party to which such notice is addressed.

 

12.3 _Sales or Use Tax, Recording Fees and Similar Taxes and Fees_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Article 9, Purchaser shall bear
any sales, use, excise, real property transfer or gain, gross receipts, goods
and services, registration, capital, documentary, stamp or transfer Taxes,
recording fees, and similar Taxes and fees incurred and imposed upon, or with
respect to, the property transfers or other transactions contemplated hereby.
Should Seller or any Affiliate of Seller pay any amount for which Purchaser is
liable under this Section 12.3, Purchaser shall, promptly following receipt
of Sellers invoice, describing the amount in reasonable detail, reimburse the
amount paid. If such transfers are exempt from any such Taxes or fees upon the
filing of an appropriate certificate or other evidence of
exemption, Purchaser shall timely furnish to Seller such certificate or
evidence.

12.4 _Post-Closing Non-Competition_. From and during the period commencing on
the date of this Agreement and continuing until the date that is three (3)
months following the Closing Date (the " _Restricted Period_ "), Seller shall
not, and shall cause Sellers Applicable Affiliates not to, directly or
indirectly (including by the acquisition of stock or a merger or other
corporate transaction or otherwise), acquire, explore for, drill, operate,
develop, produce or market any interest in any oil, gas and mineral leases,
mineral fee interests or any other mineral interests in or covering lands
located within the Restricted Area; provided that Seller and its Applicable
Affiliates shall be permitted to visit data rooms associated with, and
otherwise participate in, auction processes broadly marketed by third Person
brokers, bid on assets marketed in such processes, and consummate the
transactions contemplated by any agreements entered into pursuant thereto.
Seller agrees that this covenant is reasonable with respect to its duration,
geographical area, and scope. Seller acknowledges and recognizes that a breach
of any of the covenants set forth in this Section 12.4 would result in serious
harm to Purchaser for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy
and that the amount of such damages may be difficult to determine; therefore,
if a breach of the covenants set forth in this Section 12.4 occurs, Purchaser
will be entitled, in addition to any other rights it may have, to obtain
injunctive or other equitable relief in addition to any other available legal
or equitable remedies, without the necessity of posting a bond, to restrain
any breach or threatened breach or otherwise to specifically enforce
the provisions of this Section 12.4, it being agreed that monetary damages
alone would be inadequate to compensate Purchaser and would be an inadequate
remedy for such breach.

 

12.5 _Expenses_. Except as provided in Section 6.6 and in Section 11.4, all
expenses incurred by Seller in connection with or related to the
authorization, preparation or execution of this Agreement, and the Exhibits,
Annexes, and Schedules hereto and thereto, and all other matters related to
the Closing, including all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, and
financial advisers employed by Seller, shall be borne solely and entirely by
Seller, and all such expenses incurred by Purchaser shall be borne solely and
entirely by Purchaser.

 

12.6 _Replacement of Bonds, Letters of Credit and Guarantees_. The Parties
understand that none of the bonds, supplemental bonds, third Person
indemnities, letters of credit, and guarantees, if any, posted by Seller or
any Affiliate thereof with or for the benefit of

 



-65-   any Governmental Authority or third Person and relating to the Assets will
be transferred to Purchaser. On or before Closing, Purchaser shall obtain, or
cause to be obtained in the name of Purchaser, replacements for such bonds,
supplemental bonds, third Person indemnities, letters of credit, and
guarantees, and shall request, effective as of the Closing, the cancellation
or return to Seller of the bonds, supplemental bonds, third Person
indemnities, letters of credit, and guarantees posted by Seller or its
Affiliates.

12.7 _Records_. 

(a) As soon as practicable, but in no event later than thirty (30) days after
the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Purchaser
the original Records that are in the possession of Seller or its Affiliates,
subject to Section 12.7(b). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall
deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Purchaser any original Records within
five (5) days of Purchasers request therefor following Closing.

(b) Seller may retain the originals of those Records relating to Tax and
accounting matters and provide Purchaser, at its request, with copies of such
Records other than Records that pertain solely to income Tax matters related
to the Assets. Seller may retain copies of any geological, geophysical, or
similar Records. Additionally, Seller may retain copies of any other Records
for the sole purpose of providing the Services (as defined in the Transition
Services Agreement) pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement. 

(c) Purchaser, for a period of seven (7) years after the Closing shall: (i)
retain the Records and (ii) provide Seller, its Affiliates, and their
respective officers, employees, and representatives with access to the Records
during normal business hours for review and copying at Sellers sole expense.

 

12.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and the legal relations between the
Parties shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the
State of Texas, without regard to principles of conflicts of Laws that would
direct the application of the Laws of another jurisdiction.

12.9 _Dispute Resolution_. Each Party consents to personal jurisdiction in any
action brought in the United States federal courts located in the State of
Texas with respect to any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of, in
relation to, or in connection with, this Agreement, and each of the Parties
agrees that any action instituted by it against the other with respect to any
such dispute, controversy, or claim (except to the extent a dispute,
controversy, or claim arising out of, in relation to, or in connection with,
title or environmental matters pursuant to Section 3.10 or the determination
of Purchase Price adjustments pursuant to Section 8.4(c) is referred to an
expert pursuant to those Sections) will be instituted exclusively in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston
Division. Each Party (a) irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of
such courts, (b) waives any objection to laying venue in any such action or
proceeding in such courts, (c) waives any objection that such courts are an
inconvenient forum or do not have jurisdiction over it, and (d) agrees that
service of process upon it may be effected by mailing a copy thereof by
registered mail (or any substantially similar form of mail), postage prepaid,
to it at its address specified in Section 12.2. The foregoing consents to
jurisdiction and service of process shall not constitute general

 



-66-   consents to service of process in the State of Texas for any purpose except
as provided herein and shall not be deemed to confer any rights on any Person
other than the Parties to this Agreement. The Parties hereby waive trial by
jury in any action, proceeding, or counterclaim brought by any Party against
another in any matter whatsoever arising out of, in relation to, or in
connection with, this Agreement.

 

12.10 _Captions_. The captions in this Agreement are for convenience only and
shall not be considered a part of or affect the construction or
interpretation of any provision of this Agreement.

12.11 _Waivers_. Any failure by any Party to comply with any of its
obligations, agreements, or conditions herein contained may be waived by the
Party to whom such compliance is owed by an instrument signed by the Party to
whom compliance is owed and expressly identified as a waiver, but not in any
other manner. No waiver of, or consent to a change in, any of the provisions
of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of, or consent
to a change in, other provisions hereof (whether or not similar), nor shall
such waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly
provided.

12.12 _Assignment_. No Party shall assign (including by change of control,
merger, consolidation, or stock purchase) or otherwise transfer all or any
part of this Agreement to any third Person, nor shall any Party delegate any
of its rights or duties hereunder (including by change of control, merger,
consolidation, or stock purchase) to any third Person, without the prior
written consent of the other Party and any transfer or delegation made without
such consent shall be void. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective
successors and assigns.

12.13 _Entire Agreement_. The Confidentiality Agreement, this Agreement, and
the documents to be executed hereunder and the Annexes, Exhibits, and
Schedules attached hereto constitute the entire agreement among the Parties
pertaining to the subject matter hereof, and supersede all prior agreements,
understandings, negotiations, and discussions, whether oral or written, of the
Parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof.

12.14 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended or modified only by an
agreement in writing signed by Seller and Purchaser and expressly identified
as an amendment or modification. 

12.15 _No Third-Person Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement shall entitle
any Person other than Purchaser and Seller to any claim, cause of action,
remedy or right of any kind, except the rights expressly provided to the
Persons described in Section 11.4(h).

12.16 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement, or any application
thereof, is held invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect under any
Law, this Agreement shall be reformed to the extent necessary to conform, in
each case consistent with the intention of the Parties, to such Law, and, to
the extent such provision cannot be so reformed, then such provision (or the
invalid, illegal, or unenforceable application thereof) shall be deemed
deleted from (or prohibited under) this Agreement, as the case may be, and the
validity, legality, and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained
herein (and any other application of such provision) shall not in any way
be affected or impaired thereby.

 



-67-  12.17 _Time of the Essence_. Time is of the essence in this Agreement; 
_provided, however_ , that a Party shall not be considered to be in "material
breach" of this Agreement for its breach of any timing specific requirement
contained herein. If the date specified in this Agreement for giving any
notice or taking any action is not a Business Day (or if the period during
which any notice is required to be given or any action taken expires on a date
which is not a Business Day), then the date for giving such notice or taking
such action (and the expiration of such period during which notice is
required to be given or action taken) shall be the next day which is a
Business Day.

12.18 _References_. In this Agreement, unless the context requires otherwise:
(a) references to any gender includes a reference to all other genders; (b)
references to the singular includes the plural, and vice versa; (c) reference
to any Article or Section means an Article or Section of this Agreement; (d)
reference to any Annex, Exhibit, or Schedule means an Exhibit, Annex, or
Schedule to this Agreement, all of which are incorporated into, and made a
part of, this Agreement; (e) unless expressly provided to the contrary,
"hereunder", "hereof", "herein", and words of similar import are references to
this Agreement as a whole and not any particular Section or other provision
of this Agreement; (f) references to "$" or "Dollars" means United States
Dollars; and (g) "include" and "including" mean include or including without
limiting the generality of the description preceding such term.

12.19 _Construction_. Purchaser is capable of making such investigation,
inspection, review and evaluation of the Assets as a prudent purchaser would
deem appropriate under the circumstances, including with respect to all
matters relating to the Assets, their value, operation, and suitability.
Seller and Purchaser have had the opportunity to exercise business discretion
in relation to the negotiation of the details of the transaction contemplated
hereby. This Agreement is the result of arms-length negotiations from equal
bargaining positions. It is expressly agreed that this Agreement shall not be
construed against any Party, and no consideration shall be given or
presumption made, on the basis of who drafted this Agreement or any particular
provision hereof. 

12.20 _Limitation on Damages_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, neither Purchaser nor Seller, nor any of their respective
Affiliates shall be entitled to consequential, special, or punitive damages in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (other
than consequential, special, or punitive damages suffered by third Persons
for which responsibility is allocated between the Parties) and Purchaser and
Seller, for themselves and on behalf of their respective Affiliates, hereby
expressly waive any right to consequential, special, or punitive damages in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (other
than consequential, special, or punitive damages suffered by third Persons for
which responsibility is allocated between the Parties); _provided, however_ ,
that, for the purposes of this Section 12.20, the damages described in Section
10.3(a) shall not be considered consequential, special, or punitive damages.

 

12.21 _Joint and Several Liability_. Seller agrees and acknowledges that each
of 3RAC and 3ROC shall be jointly and severally liable for the obligations of
Seller under this Agreement.

 



-68-  12.22 _Confidentiality Agreement_. Notwithstanding the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement, Purchaser and 3ROC agree that, effective as of
Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate and be of no further
force and effect.
