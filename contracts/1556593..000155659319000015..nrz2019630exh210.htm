 ![](nrz2019630exh210034.jpg) 

assignment or transfer (in whole or, to the extent relevant, in part) thereof,
without the consent of a third party, would, after giving effect to the
Confirmation Order and the Bankruptcy Code, constitute a breach or other
contravention thereof or a violation of Law to which any Seller is bound, or
in any way adversely affect the rights of Sellers or, upon transfer, Buyer
under such Transferred Contract, claim or right, in each case, that cannot be
excused or rendered ineffective by operation of the Bankruptcy Code, the
Confirmation Order, or applicable non-bankruptcy Law. Subject to Article VII,
Sections 6.11 and 6.12, with respect to any Transferred Contract, if such
consent is not obtained or such assignment (in whole or, to the extent
relevant, in part) is not attainable pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code or the
Confirmation Order, then such Transferred Contract shall not be transferred
hereunder, and the Closing shall proceed with respect to the remaining
Acquired Assets for the full Purchase Price and Sellers shall use their

cooperate with Sellers, to obtain any such consent after the Closing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 2.6 shall be deemed to
require a Party to pay any consideration to any third party for the purpose of
obtaining any consents. (b) If (i) notwithstanding the applicable provisions
of the Bankruptcy Code and the Confirmation Order and the commercially
reasonable efforts of Sellers, any consent is not obtained prior to the
Closing and as a result thereof Buyer shall be prevented by a third party from
receiving the rights and benefits with respect to a Transferred Contract
intended to be transferred hereunder, or (ii) any Transferred Contract is not
otherwise capable of sale and/or assignment (after giving effect to the
Confirmation Order and the Bankruptcy Code), then, in each such case, Sellers
shall (at Buyer's expense), subject to any approval of the Bankruptcy Court
that may be required, at the request of Buyer, hold such Transferred Contract
in trust for the use and benefit of Buyer and reasonably cooperate with Buyer
in any lawful and commercially reasonable arrangement under which Buyer would,
to the extent practicable, obtain the economic claims, rights and benefits
under such asset and assume the economic burdens and obligations with respect
thereto in accordance with this Agreement, including by subcontracting,
sublicensing or subleasing to Buyer. Sellers shall promptly pay to Buyer when
received all monies received by Sellers under such Transferred Contract or any
claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder and Buyer shall promptly pay
Sellers for all Liabilities of Sellers associated with such arrangement, if
requested; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 2.6 shall entitle
Buyer to reduce the Purchase Price. Section 2.7 Allocation. Buyer and Sellers
agree to allocate, for Tax purposes, the Purchase Price (as finally determined
hereunder) and the Assumed Liabilities which are treated as liabilities for
U.S. federal income Tax purposes (the "Allocation Consideration") in
accordance with section 1060 of the IRC and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder (the "Allocation Principles"). No later than thirty (30) days after
the Purchase Price is determined pursuant to the Final Statement, Buyer shall
deliver to the Sellers an allocation of the Allocation Consideration as of the
Closing Date among the Acquired Assets determined in a manner consistent with
the Allocation Principles (the "Purchase Price Allocation") for Sellers'
review and comment. Any reasonable comments provided by Sellers to Buyer under
this Section 2.7 shall be considered by Buyer in good faith. If, within forty-
five (45) days following delivery of the preliminary Purchase Price
Allocation, Sellers do not notify Buyer in writing of their disagreement with
the preliminary Purchase Price Allocation, the preliminary Purchase Price
Allocation shall be final and binding. If within such forty-five (45) day
period Sellers so notify 30  

  

 ![](nrz2019630exh210035.jpg) 

Buyer, Sellers and Buyer shall endeavor to resolve such disagreement and, if
they are able to do so, shall make such revisions to the preliminary Purchase
Price Allocation to reflect such resolution, which shall be final and binding.
If, within sixty (60) days following delivery of the preliminary Purchase
Price Allocation by Buyer to Sellers, Sellers and Buyer are unable to resolve
such disagreement, Sellers and Buyer shall each be entitled to adopt their own
positions regarding the allocation of the Allocation Consideration among the
Acquired Assets for federal income tax purposes. If the Parties agree on the
Purchase Price Allocation (or such is deemed accepted or rendered final),
Buyer and Sellers agree that neither it nor any of its Affiliates shall file
any federal, state, local and foreign Tax Returns in a manner that is
inconsistent with the Purchase Price Allocation; provided, however, that
neither Party shall be unreasonably impeded in its ability and discretion to
negotiate, compromise and/or settle any Tax audit, claim or similar
proceedings in connection with such allocation. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, the terms and provisions of this Section 2.7
shall survive the Closing without limitation. Section 2.8 Withholding. Buyer
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from all payments made pursuant to
this Agreement such amounts as required to deduct and withhold under the IRC
or any provision of state, local or foreign Law; provided, that in the event
Buyer determines such withholding is required, Buyer shall promptly notify
Sellers of such determination no less than five (5) days prior to the Closing
Date, and shall reasonably cooperate with Sellers to claim any benefits or
reduce and/or eliminate any such withholding Taxes. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority, such
withheld and paid over amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made. Section 2.9 Purchase Price Adjustments. (a) Not
fewer than one (1) Business Day prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
provide Buyer with a statement (the "Estimated Closing Statement"), prepared
in accordance with the Transaction Accounting Principles and in a manner
consistent with the Illustrative Purchase Price Calculation, setting forth:
(i) the Company's good faith estimate of the value attributable to the
Mortgage Loans, manufactured housing installment sales contracts and
installment loan agreements and certain other loans (including fixed or
adjustable-rate mortgage loans) (A) with respect to which Fannie Mae or Ginnie
Mae owns the beneficial interest therein or (B) that serve as collateral for
mortgage-backed securities on which the payment of principal and interest is
guaranteed by Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae, and, in each case, the Servicing
Rights related to any such loans (but limited to the Servicing Rights that are
accounted for at fair value on the books and records of the Sellers), together
with the Assumed Liabilities related thereto (the "Adjustment MSRs") in
accordance with the Illustrative Purchase Price Calculation and the
Transaction Accounting Principles and based on the unpaid principal balance of
such Adjustment MSRs as reflected on the books and records of the Sellers as
of the last day of the calendar month prior to the Closing Date, amortized by
one percent (1%) (the "MSR Estimated Amount"), including reasonable support

Accounting Firm. (a) As promptly as reasonably practicable, but in no event
later than fifteen (15) Business Days of the date of this Agreement, Buyer and
the Company shall appoint an independent certified public accounting firm in
the United States of international recognition reasonably acceptable to Buyer
and the Company and agreed to by them in writing (the "Independent Accounting
Firm"). Buyer and the Company shall thereafter promptly negotiate, in good
faith and acting reasonably, a customary initial engagement letter with such
Independent Accounting Firm, so as to ensure that such Independent Accounting
Firm is prepared to assist in determining the MSR Final Statement, the
Advances Final Statement, the Residential Loans Final Statement or the
Remaining Assets Final Statement in accordance with Section 2.10(c), Section
2.11(c), Section 2.12(c) or Section 2.13(d), as applicable, in the event of a
dispute. In the event that such Independent Accounting Firm has a conflict or
is unable or unwilling to serve in such role, then Buyer and the Company shall
appoint a different independent certified public accounting firm in the United
States of international recognition reasonably acceptable to Buyer and the
Company and agreed to by them in writing, and proceed to negotiate, in good
faith and acting reasonably, a customary engagement letter with such firm
(such firm thereafter being referred to herein as the "Independent Accounting
Firm"). (b) Buyer and the Company will execute a customary engagement letter
and will cooperate with the Independent Accounting Firm during the term of its
engagement. Buyer and the Company shall instruct the Independent Accounting
Firm to make a final determination as promptly as practicable, and in any
event within thirty (30) Business Days after its engagement, of (x) the proper
amount (determined in accordance with the terms of this Agreement) of each of
the line items in the Initial Statements as to which Buyer and the Company
disagree as set out in the Notice of Disagreement and (y) the Party or Parties
that should bear the cost of the Independent Accounting Firm's review and
determination. (c) In making its determination pursuant to this Section 2.14,
the Independent Accounting Firm shall act as an expert and not as an
arbitrator, base its determination solely on written presentations of Buyer
and the Company and not by independent review, and limit its scope of
determination to those items that are identified as items and amounts to which
the Parties have been unable to agree, and whether there were mathematical
errors in the Initial Statements and whether the calculations set forth
therein were performed in accordance with the 40  

  

 ![](nrz2019630exh210045.jpg) 

Transaction Accounting Principles and in a manner consistent with the
Illustrative Purchase Price Calculation and Section 2.9, Section 2.10, Section
2.11, Section 2.12, Section 2.13 and this Section 2.14. Such determination
shall be final and binding on, and non-appealable by, the Parties absent
manifest mathematical error. A copy of all materials submitted to the
Independent Accounting Firm pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence
shall be provided by Buyer or the Company, as applicable, to the other party
concurrently with the submission thereof to the Independent Accounting Firm.
In resolving each disputed line item, the Independent Accounting Firm shall be
bound by the provisions of this Agreement and may not assign a value to any
disputed line item greater than the greatest value for such line item (or less
than the smallest value for such line item) claimed by Sellers in the Initial
Statements or Buyer in the Notices of Disagreement, respectively. (d) The cost
of the Independent Accounting Firm's review and determination shall be
allocated to and borne by Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other
hand, in proportion to the final allocation made by the Independent Accounting
Firm of the disputed items weighted in relation to the claims made by Sellers
and Buyer, such that the prevailing Party pays the lesser proportion of such
fees, costs and expenses, as directed in the Independent Accounting Firm's
report. For example, if Sellers claim that the appropriate adjustments are
$1,000 greater than the amount determined by Buyer and if the Independent
Accounting Firm ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding to Sellers $300 of
the $1,000 contested, then the fees, costs and expenses of the Independent
Accounting Firm will be allocated 30% (i.e., 300 ÷ 1,000) to Buyer and 70%
(i.e., 700 ÷ 1,000) to Sellers. During the review by the Independent
Accounting Firm, Buyer and the Company and their accountants will each make
available to the Independent Accounting Firm interviews with such individuals,
and such information, books and records and work papers, as may be reasonably
required by the Independent Accounting Firm to fulfill its obligations under
this Agreement; provided, however, that the accountants of Buyer or the
Company shall not be obliged to make any work papers available to the
Independent Accounting Firm except in accordance with such accountants' normal
disclosure procedures and then only after such firm has signed a customary
non-disclosure agreement relating to such access to work papers in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to such accountants. SELLERS' REPRESENTATIONS
AND WARRANTIES Sellers represent and warrant to Buyer that the statements
contained in this Article III are true and correct as of the date of this
Agreement, and as of the Closing Date (except to the extent any such
representations and warranties have been made as of a particular date), except
as set forth in the disclosure schedule accompanying this Agreement (the
"Disclosure Schedule"). Section 3.1 Organization of Sellers; Good Standing.
Each Seller is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and, to the
extent legally applicable, in good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction
of incorporation or organization and has, subject to the necessary authority
from the Bankruptcy Court, all requisite organizational power and authority to
own, lease and operate its assets and to carry on its business as now being
conducted, except where the failure to be so organized, existing, or in good
standing or have such power and authority would not reasonably be likely to

Date, to the Knowledge of Sellers, no complaints from any source regarding a
material violation of accounting procedures, internal accounting controls or
auditing matters, including from Company Employees regarding questionable
accounting or auditing matters, have been received by the Company. 43

no pending or, to the Knowledge of any Seller, threatened Litigation against
or involving any Company Benefit Plan (except routine claims for benefits

subject to Section 412 of the IRC, Section 302 of ERISA or Title IV of ERISA
or (ii) a multiemployer plan (within the meaning of Section 3(37) or
4001(a)(3) of ERISA). No Company Benefit Plan provides, or has any obligation

and circumstances do not exist that are likely to result in the loss of the
qualification of such plan under Section 401(a) of the IRC. (e) Neither the
execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the

prerequisite to any payment or benefit to any Company Employee, (ii)
materially increase any benefits under any Company Benefit Plan, or (iii)
result in the acceleration of the time of payment, vesting or funding of any
such benefits. No amount paid or payable to any Company Employee (whether in

transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or in combination
with another event) will be, or would reasonably be likely to be, an "excess
parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the IRC. No Company
Employee has any right to a "gross-up" or similar payment in respect of any
Taxes that may become payable under Section 4999 or 409A of the IRC. Except as
would not reasonably be likely to result in Liability to the Buyer or any of
its Affiliates or any Company Employee, each Company Benefit Plan that is

infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate the Intellectual Property rights

that the operation of the Business infringes, misappropriates or otherwise
violates the Intellectual Property rights of any third party. (d) Sellers take

resulted in any Liability to Sellers. (e) To the Knowledge of Sellers, (A) the
Information Technology used in the Business operates and performs in all
material respects as required to permit Sellers to conduct the Business as
currently conducted, (B) such Information Technology has not suffered a
material malfunction or failure during the one (1) year period prior to the

investigation by any Governmental Authority or Mortgage Agency with respect to
a Seller is pending or, as of the date of this Agreement and to the Knowledge
of Sellers, threatened in writing, nor has any Governmental Authority
indicated an intention to conduct the same, except for such investigations the
outcome of which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. (b) Sellers have all Permits which
are required for the operation of the Business as presently conducted, except
where the absence of which would not reasonably be likely to be material to
the Business. Sellers are not in default or violation (and no event has
occurred which, with notice or the lapse of time or both, would constitute a
default or violation) of any term, condition or provision of any Permit to
which they are parties, except where such default or violation has been waived
or excepted by the applicable Governmental Authority or Mortgage Agency or
would not reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. (c)

under any Environmental Law; and (d) to the Knowledge of the Sellers, there
are no pending or threatened investigations of the Sellers or their
Subsidiaries, or currently or previously owned, operated or leased property of
the Sellers or their Subsidiaries, which would reasonably be likely to result

decision making authority with respect to the appropriate course of action
with respect to, and shall cooperate with each other in connection with,
obtaining the consents, approvals, permits, waiting period expirations or
authorizations of any insurer, investor, Mortgage Agency or applicable
Governmental Authority required to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, in each case, for the avoidance of doubt, other than in

Party or its counsel shall independently participate in any substantive call
or meeting with any insurer, investor, Mortgage Agency or Governmental
Authority in connection with obtaining any approvals required to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and each Party shall provide
the other Parties with the opportunity to attend and/or participate in any
meetings with such insurer, investor, Mortgage Agency or Governmental
Authority, as the case may be. In furtherance of the foregoing and to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, (A) each Party shall notify the others, as
far in advance as practicable, of any filing or material or substantive
written communication or inquiry it or any of its Subsidiaries intends to make
with any insurer, investor, Mortgage Agency or applicable Governmental

transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (B) as necessary to comply with
any Contract, (C) as necessary to address reasonable privilege concerns or (D)
as otherwise required by Law. Section 5.4 Bankruptcy Court Matters. (a)
Approval of Break-Up Fee and Expense Reimbursement. (i) In accordance with the
terms hereof (including Section 8.1 and Section 8.2) and subject to compliance
with and advance Bankruptcy Court approval in accordance with the Bidding
Procedures Order, in consideration for Buyer having expended considerable time
and expense in connection with this Agreement and the negotiation thereof and
the identification and quantification of the Acquired Assets, in the event
that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to (w) Section 8.1(b)(iii), Sellers
shall (A) on the first (1st) Business Day following such termination, pay
Buyer an initial break-up fee in an amount equal to $10,000,000 (the "Initial
Termination Payment"), plus an amount equal to the reasonable and documented
expenses of Buyer and Buyer's Affiliates incurred in connection with their
investigation (including due diligence), preparation, negotiation and
attempted consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including performance of the obligations hereunder), up to an aggregate
amount of $6,000,000 (the "Expense Reimbursement") and (B) on the first (1st)
Business Day following Sellers' consummation of an Alternative Transaction,
pay Buyer a subsequent termination payment in an amount equal to $20,000,000
(the "Remaining Termination Payment" and together with the Initial Termination
Payment, the "Termination Payment") upon consummation of an Alternative
Transaction, (x) Section 8.1(c)(i), Sellers shall (A) on the first (1st)
Business Day following such termination, pay Buyer the Initial Termination
Payment and the Expense Reimbursement and (B) on the first (1st) Business Day
following Sellers' consummation of an Alternative Transaction, pay Buyer the
Remaining Termination Payment upon consummation of an Alternative Transaction
only if Sellers consummate an Alternative Transaction within three hundred and
sixty-five (365) days following such termination (the "Tail Period");
provided, however, that if consummation of an Alternative Transaction does not
occur within the Tail Period, the Remaining Termination Payment shall not be
payable by Sellers; provided, however, that to the extent that this Agreement
is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(i) on the grounds that the breach by
any Seller that gave rise to such termination right resulted in or is
reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect caused by any
condition, circumstance, event, effect or change related to the departure or
threatened departure of any employees of any Seller, or any adverse change or
threatened adverse change in the relationship of any Seller with its
employees, Buyer will not be entitled to any Termination Payment (but will be
entitled to receive the Expense Reimbursement) or (y) Section 8.1(b)(v),
Sellers shall, on the first (1st) Business Day following such termination, pay
Buyer the Expense Reimbursement. (ii) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event
shall more than $36,000,000 be payable by Sellers as a Termination Payment and
Expense Reimbursement, and only one Termination Payment, if any, or portion
thereof, and only one Expense Reimbursement, if any, or portion thereof, may
be payable hereunder. (iii) Nothing in this Section 5.4 shall relieve Buyer or
Sellers of any Liability for a breach of this Agreement prior to the date of
termination; provided, that Sellers' 62  

  

 ![](nrz2019630exh210067.jpg) 

Liability under this Agreement for any and all such breaches, other than for
willful misconduct, shall be capped at an amount equal to the Termination
Payment. Upon payment of the Termination Payment or the Expense Reimbursement,
as applicable, to Buyer in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
Sellers and their respective Representatives and Affiliates, on the one hand,
and Buyer and its Representatives and Affiliates, on the other, will be deemed
to have fully released and discharged each other from any Liability resulting
from the termination of this Agreement and neither Sellers, their
Representatives or Affiliates, on the one hand, nor Buyer, its Representatives
or Affiliates, on the other hand, or any other Person will have any other
remedy or cause of action under or relating to this Agreement or any
applicable Law, including for reimbursement of expenses, other than, in the
case of payment of any Expense Reimbursement, any right granted to Buyer
pursuant to this Section 5.4(a) to subsequently receive the Termination
Payment in the event of the subsequent consummation of the Alternative
Transaction. (iv) Without limiting the foregoing, and without limiting Section
10.10, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that, except in the case of willful
misconduct, termination of this Agreement in accordance with the applicable
provisions of Article VIII and payment and delivery of the Termination Payment
and/or Expense Reimbursement (if any) in accordance with this Section 5.4 will
be the sole and exclusive remedy of Buyer, and its Representatives and
Affiliates, whether at Law or in equity, with respect to any termination of
this Agreement or any breach hereof, and upon the payment and delivery of the
Termination Payment and/or Expense Reimbursement (if any) in accordance with
this Section 5.4 (which will constitute liquidated damages) to Buyer, Buyer
and its Representatives and Affiliates will be deemed to have fully released
and discharged Sellers and their respective Representatives and Affiliates
from any Liabilities resulting from the termination of this Agreement or any
breach hereof. For the avoidance of doubt, no release obtained pursuant to
this Section 5.4(a) shall constitute a release of any Liabilities of Buyer or
the Sellers related to any prepetition conduct or Contract. (v) Sellers
acknowledge and agree that (i) the payment of the Termination Payment and
Expense Reimbursement is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (ii) in the absence of Sellers' obligations to pay the
Termination Payment and Expense Reimbursement to Buyer, Buyer would not have
entered into this Agreement, and (iii) the Termination Payment and Expense
Reimbursement shall constitute administrative expenses of Sellers' bankruptcy
estates under Section 503(b)(1)(A) and 507(a)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code. (b)
Approval of Overbid Requirement. In accordance with, and without limiting or
otherwise modifying any provisions of, the Bidding Procedures Order, the
purchase price in a competing bid for the Acquired Assets shall not be
considered a Qualified Bid (as defined in the Bidding Procedures Order) unless
such bid (a) provides for consideration to the estates of the debtors-in
possession in the Bankruptcy Cases of at least $30,000,000 for payment of the
Termination Payment and up to $6,000,000 for payment of the Expense
Reimbursement, and (b) otherwise constitutes a higher or better bid taking
into account all of the consideration provided to the estates of the debtors-
in possession in the Bankruptcy Cases under this Agreement, including the
Purchase Price, as determined by the Sellers (in the due exercise of their
fiduciary duties and applicable Law). 63  

  

 ![](nrz2019630exh210068.jpg) 

(c) Alternative Transaction and Alternative PLS Transaction. (i) This
Agreement is subject to approval by the Bankruptcy Court and the consideration
by Sellers of Alternative Transactions. Until the Confirmation Order is
entered by the Bankruptcy Court, Sellers are permitted to and permitted to
cause their Representatives and Affiliates to, initiate contact with, solicit
or encourage submission of any inquiries, proposals or offers by, any Person
(in addition to Buyer and its Affiliates and Representatives) in connection
with any sale or other disposition of the Acquired Assets. In addition,
Sellers shall have the authority to respond to any inquiries or offers to
purchase all or any part of the Acquired Assets (whether in combination with
other assets of Sellers or their Affiliates or otherwise) and perform any and
all other acts related thereto, including supplying information relating to
the Business and the assets of Sellers to prospective purchasers. (ii) In
accordance with the terms hereof and subject to compliance with the Bidding
Procedures Order, in consideration for Buyer having expended considerable time
and expense in connection with this Agreement and the negotiation thereof and
the identification and quantification of the Acquired Assets, in the event
that an Alternative PLS Transaction is consummated prior to the Outside Date,
Sellers shall, on the first (1st) Business Day following such consummation,
pay Buyer a break-up fee in an amount equal to $3,800,000. For the avoidance
of doubt, nothing contained herein shall (x) limit Sellers' ability to
consummate an Alternative PLS Transaction in accordance with this Section
5.4(c)(ii) or (y) provide Buyer with any rights upon the consummation of an
Alternative PLS Transaction other than to receive the break-up fee as set
forth in this Section 5.4(c)(ii). For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer will not
be entitled to receive the Expense Reimbursement or Termination Payment solely
based upon the entry into or consummation of an Alternative PLS Transaction.
(d) Bankruptcy Court Filings. (i) As soon as reasonably practicable following
the execution of this Agreement, in accordance with the Bidding Procedures
Order, Sellers shall file with the Bankruptcy Court a Notice of Stalking Horse
Bidder (as defined in the Bidding Procedures Order) setting forth the material
terms of this Agreement, including the Termination Payment and Expense
Reimbursement, together with a form of order approving the bid protections for
Buyer set forth in Section 5.4(a), Section 5.4(b), and Section 5.4(c), each in
form and substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer and the Company. Buyer
agrees that it will promptly take such actions as are reasonably requested by
Sellers to assist in obtaining approval of the Termination Payment and Expense
Reimbursement, including by furnishing affidavits or other documents or
information for filing with the Bankruptcy Court. In the event the entry of
the determination of approval of the Termination Payment and Expense
Reimbursement shall be appealed, Sellers and Buyer shall use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to defend such appeal. (ii) Sellers shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to (A) timely file all pleadings with the
Bankruptcy Court as are necessary or appropriate to secure entry of the
Confirmation Order and (B) cause notice of the hearing to consider entry of
the Confirmation Order to be served on the parties entitled to notice thereof
pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code, the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure and
any applicable local rules, and shall diligently 64  

  

 ![](nrz2019630exh210069.jpg) 

pursue the entry of the Confirmation Order and approval of this Agreement and
the Related Agreements by the Bankruptcy Court. (iii) Sellers shall use
reasonable best efforts to (A) obtain bifurcation of the servicing and
origination Liabilities associated with the PLS Assets and (B) include such
bifurcation in the Sale Provisions included in the Confirmation Order approved
by the Bankruptcy Court. (iv) Sellers and Buyer acknowledge that this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are subject to
entry of the Confirmation Order. In the event of any discrepancy between this
Agreement, the Bidding Procedures Order, and the Confirmation Order, the
Confirmation Order shall govern, except with respect to Section 2.3(b),
Section 5.4(a), Section 7.1, Section 7.2, Section 7.3 and Section 8.1, in
which case this Agreement shall govern in all respects. (v) Buyer agrees that
it will promptly take such actions as are reasonably requested by Sellers to
assist in obtaining entry of the Confirmation Order and a finding of adequate
assurance of future performance by Buyer, including by furnishing affidavits
or other documents or information for filing with the Bankruptcy Court for the
purposes, among others, of providing necessary assurances of performance by
Buyer under this Agreement. Buyer shall not, without the prior written consent
of Sellers, file, join in, or otherwise support in any manner whatsoever any
motion or other pleading relating to the sale of the Acquired Assets
hereunder. (vi) In the event an appeal is taken, or a stay pending appeal is
requested, from the Confirmation Order, Sellers shall promptly notify Buyer of
such appeal or stay request. Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to defend any such appeal. (e) Back-Up Bidder. Sellers and Buyer agree that,
in the event that Buyer is not the winning bidder at the Auction, if and only
if (i) Buyer submits the second-highest or otherwise second-best bid at the
Auction or the terms of this Agreement constitute the second- highest or
otherwise second-best bid, and (ii) Sellers give written notice to Buyer on or
before the Back-Up Termination Date, stating that Sellers (A) failed to
consummate the sale of the Acquired Assets with the winning bidder, and (B)
terminated the purchase agreement with the winning bidder, Buyer shall
promptly consummate the transactions contemplated hereby upon the terms and
conditions as set forth herein, including the Purchase Price, as the same may
be increased by Buyer at the Auction. (f) Milestones. The Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to satisfy the following milestones (collectively,
the "Bankruptcy Milestones"): (i) Within one (1) Business Day after entry into
this Agreement, the Company shall file with the Bankruptcy Court a notice (the
"Notice of Stalking Horse Bidder"), in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Buyer and the Company, designating Buyer as the "stalking horse
bidder" for the Acquired Assets setting forth the material terms of this
Agreement, including the Termination Payment and Expense Reimbursement, and
indicating the Company's support for the Termination Payment and Expense
Reimbursement. 65  

  

 ![](nrz2019630exh210070.jpg) 

(ii) No later than August 16, 2019, the Bankruptcy Court shall have entered
the Confirmation Order. The Bankruptcy Milestones may be extended upon mutual
agreement between the Company (on behalf of itself and the other Sellers) and
Buyer, and shall be extended as necessary to accommodate the availability of
the Bankruptcy Court. Section 5.5 Notices and Consents. (a) Prior to the
Closing, Sellers will give, or will cause to be given, any notices to third
parties, and each of the Parties will use its reasonable best efforts to
cooperate with the other Party and to obtain any third party consents or
sublicenses, in connection with the matters referred to in Section 5.5(a) of
the Disclosure Schedule or as are otherwise necessary and appropriate to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however,
that (i) Sellers shall control all correspondence and negotiations with third
parties regarding any such matters, (ii) no Seller, nor any Subsidiary of a
Seller or Buyer shall be required to pay any consideration therefor or incur
any expenses in connection therewith and (iii) Sellers shall not be obligated
to initiate any Litigation to obtain such consent or approval; provided that
there shall be no adjustment to the Purchase Price on account of the exclusion
of any Acquired Asset as a result of not obtaining any such consent. The
Parties agree that, subject to Sellers' compliance with the terms of this
Agreement, including Section 2.6 and this Section 5.5, any failure to receive
such consents shall not be deemed a breach of this Agreement or constitute a
failure of a condition to Closing. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that from and
after the Closing no Seller shall have any Liability to Buyer (and Buyer will
not be entitled to assert any claims against the Sellers) arising out of or
relating to the failure to obtain any such consents and waivers or because of
the default, acceleration or termination of or loss of right under any such
Contract; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply to any
remedies Buyer may otherwise have for any breach of this Agreement. (b)
Without limiting Section 5.3, each of the Parties will give any notices to,
make any filings with, and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any
authorizations, consents, and approvals of Governmental Authorities or
Mortgage Agencies as are necessary and appropriate to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Section 5.6 Notice of
Developments. Each Seller and Buyer will give prompt written notice to the
other Parties of (a) the existence of any fact or circumstance, or the
occurrence of any event, of which it has Knowledge, that would reasonably be
likely to cause a condition to a Party's obligations to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement set forth in Article VII not to be
satisfied as of a reasonably foreseeable Closing Date, or (b) the receipt of
any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority or Mortgage
Agency in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
provided, however, that the delivery of any such notice pursuant to this
Section 5.6 shall not be deemed to amend or supplement this Agreement. Section
5.7 Access; No Contact. (a) Upon the reasonable request of Buyer, Sellers will
permit Buyer and its Representatives to have, upon reasonable advance written
notice, reasonable access to all premises, properties, books and records and
Transferred Contracts 66  

  

 ![](nrz2019630exh210071.jpg) 

included in the Acquired Assets or Assumed Liabilities during normal business
hours, and (b) promptly following the Company's preparation of its monthly
financial reports (such reports to be provided to Buyer as soon as reasonably
practicable), including the amount of reserves and related liabilities
reflected therein, Buyer shall be entitled to receive, and Sellers shall
provide to Buyer and any third party consultant or other Representative
engaged by Buyer at its own expense, such back-up and supporting data
regarding such monthly financial statements, including reserves and
liabilities, as Buyer may reasonably request, and Sellers shall make the
accounting and finance personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries
reasonably available to Buyer and such Representatives during normal business
hours to discuss such monthly financial statements and reserves and
liabilities, in the case of each of clause (a) and (b), in a manner so as not
to interfere unreasonably with the normal business operations of any Seller;
provided, however, that, for the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall not
require any Person to (i) waive, or take any action with the effect of
waiving, its attorney-client privilege with respect thereto, (ii) take any
action that would conflict with confidentiality obligations to which any
Seller is bound,(iii) take any action that involves any sampling or analysis
of soil, groundwater, building materials or other environmental media,
including such investigations of the sort generally referred to as a Phase II
environmental assessment or (iv) with respect to clause (b), there shall be no
obligation of any Seller to prepare any reports or other information or
documents other than such reports and collateral reports prepared by the
Company in the Ordinary Course of Business or as contemplated by the
Illustrative Purchase Price Calculation. Prior to the Closing, Buyer shall
not, and shall cause its Representatives not to, contact any employees,
vendors, suppliers, landlords, or licensors of any Seller in connection with
or pertaining to any subject matter of this Agreement except with the prior
written consent of each Seller. Section 5.8 Bulk Transfer Laws. Buyer
acknowledges that Sellers will not comply with the provisions of any bulk
transfer Laws or similar Laws (other than bulk sale tax notice provisions) of
any jurisdiction in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the United Nations Convention on the Sale of Goods, and
hereby waives all claims related to the non-compliance therewith. Section 5.9
Replacement Bonding Requirements. Sellers shall provide Buyer with a list, as
of the Closing Date, of all Bonding Requirements related to the MSRPA Assets.
Prior to each MSR Transfer Date, Sellers shall provide Buyer with an updated
list, as of the applicable MSR Transfer Date, of all Bonding Requirements
related to the MSRPA Assets which will transfer on the applicable MSR Transfer
Date. Within forty-five (45) days after each applicable MSR Transfer Date,
Buyer shall provide replacement Bonding Requirements for each item listed on
the updated list of Bonding Requirements provided by Sellers prior to such MSR
Transfer Date. Buyer and Sellers shall cooperate to obtain a release in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and Sellers with respect to
such Bonding Requirements. To the extent Buyer is unable to make such
arrangements with respect to such Bonding Requirements within forty-five (45)
days after the applicable MSR Transfer Date, Buyer shall deliver to Sellers an
irrevocable, unconditional standby letter of credit in favor of Sellers in an
amount equal to the amount of such Bonding Requirements, issued by a bank
rated "A" or better by Standard and Poor's, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Sellers. Section 5.10 Ordinary Course Servicing. Prior to the
Closing Date, Financial shall continue to service (or, as applicable, shall
continue to cause to have serviced) the MSRPA 67  

  

 ![](nrz2019630exh210072.jpg) 

Assets pursuant to the terms and conditions of the applicable Servicing
Agreement and all MSRPA Applicable Requirements and Accepted Servicing
Practices. Section 5.11 Preliminary Data. No later than ten (10) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, Financial shall provide Buyer with the Data Tapes
containing preliminary loan level data as of the most recent date for which
all such data is available, as indicated in such data. Section 5.12 Disclosure

prior to the Closing Date, Sellers may supplement or amend and deliver written
updates to Section 3.6, Section 3.7, Section 3.11 and Section 3.16 of the
Disclosure Schedule to reflect any change, event or condition that first
arises following the execution and delivery of this Agreement; provided,
however, that any such supplement or amendment shall only be deemed to cure
any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made in this Agreement or any
Related Agreement for purposes of determining whether the conditions set forth
in Section 7.1(a) have been satisfied and shall not be deemed to cure any
inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made in this Agreement or any
Related Agreement for purposes of the indemnities in Article IX. Section 5.13
Advance Documentation. (a) Prior to Closing, Sellers agree to use commercially
reasonable efforts to continue to pursue recovery and reconciliation of all
outstanding servicing advances on both active loans and liquidated loans. In
addition, for the loans listed on Section 5.13 of the Disclosure Schedule and
any other loans mutually agreed upon by the Parties after the date hereof, the
Company will assess the likelihood of recovery based on characteristics
including age of the advance, type of the advance and recoverability under the
applicable Guides. For any advances the Company reasonably determines are
potentially non-recoverable, the Company agrees to pursue all reasonable means
to resolve such advances, including filing claims with the Mortgage Agencies
and/or writing-off such advances. Buyer understands and agrees that any write-
offs of advances could potentially result in a reduction of reserves for non-
recoverable advances. (b) In addition, as soon as practicable after the date
hereof, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Buyer
with supporting documentation sufficient to obtain reimbursement from Fannie
Mae, Ginnie Mae or the related Securitization Trust, as applicable, for
advances outstanding as of May 31, 2019. For such advances, prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide
advance documentation or system transaction support required to file a claim
for counterparty advance reimbursement. Where an image of an actual invoice is
required by any of the counterparties for reimbursement, the Company will use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide Buyer with such image. In addition,
for any advances made subsequent to May 31, 2019, the Company will use
commercially reasonable efforts to deliver advance documentation sufficient to
obtain reimbursement from Fannie Mae, Ginnie Mae or the related Securitization
Trust, as applicable, for the month in which Closing occurs as soon as
reasonably practicable (but in no event later than 30 days after Closing). (c)
If the Company is unable to meet its obligations pursuant to this Section 5.13
as a result of internal resource constraints, Buyer may direct the Company to
engage a third 68  

  

 ![](nrz2019630exh210073.jpg) 

party provider (at Buyer's cost and expense) to assist the Company with the
tasks described in this Section 5.13. OTHER COVENANTS The Parties agree as
follows with respect to the period from and after the Closing: Section 6.1
Further Assurances. (a) In case at any time after the Closing any further
action is necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, each of the
Parties will, at the requesting Party's sole cost and expense, take such
further action (including (i) the execution and delivery of such other
reasonable instruments of sale, transfer, conveyance, assignment, assumption
and confirmation, and providing materials and information as the other Party
may reasonably request to the extent reasonably necessary to transfer, convey
or assign to Buyer all of the Acquired Assets, to confirm Buyer's assumption
of the Assumed Liabilities and (ii) transferring to the Company or its
designated Affiliates any asset or Liability contemplated by this Agreement to
be an Excluded Asset or Excluded Liability, respectively, that was
inadvertently transferred to Buyer). (b) If Sellers or any of their Affiliates
receive any payment related to any Acquired Assets after the Closing, Sellers
shall promptly remit (or cause to be promptly remitted) such funds to Buyer to
the extent related to such Acquired Asset, and Buyer shall reimburse Sellers
for their reasonable expenses incurred in connection therewith. If Buyer or
any Affiliate of Buyer receives any payment related to any Excluded Asset
after the Closing, Buyer agrees to promptly remit (or cause to be promptly
remitted) such funds to Sellers to the extent related to such Excluded Asset,
and Sellers shall reimburse Buyer for its reasonable expenses incurred in
connection therewith. (c) For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties acknowledge
and agree that, except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, (i) Sellers
shall not have any Liability with respect to the ownership, operation or use
by Buyer of the Acquired Assets from and after the Closing, including related
to Buyer's or its Affiliates' application for, or receipt of, any approvals of
any Governmental Authority or Mortgage Agency and (ii) Buyer and its
Affiliates shall not have any Liability with respect to the ownership,
operation or use by Sellers or any of their Affiliates of the Excluded Assets
or Excluded Liabilities from and after the Closing. Section 6.2 Access;
Enforcement; Record Retention. From and after the Closing, upon request by any
Party, each of Sellers or Buyer shall permit the other Party and its
Representatives to have reasonable access during normal business hours, and in
a manner so as not to interfere unreasonably with the normal business
operations of such Party, to all premises, properties, personnel, books and
records, and Contracts of or related to the Business, the Acquired Assets or
the Assumed Liabilities relating to the periods prior to the Closing for the
purposes of (a) preparing Tax Returns, (b) monitoring or enforcing rights or
obligations under this Agreement or any of the Related Agreements, (c)
complying with any audit request, subpoena or other investigative demand by
any Governmental Authority or Mortgage Agency or (d) any other legitimate
business purpose; provided, however, that, for avoidance of doubt, the 69  

  

 ![](nrz2019630exh210074.jpg) 

foregoing shall not require such Party to take any such action if (i) such
action may result in a waiver or breach of any attorney/client privilege, (ii)
such action could reasonably be likely to result in a violation of applicable
Law or Contract regarding confidentiality (including any Law, Decree or
Contract relating to the collection, transfer, storage, disposal, use,
processing and disclosure of personally identifiable information), or (iii)
providing such access or information would be reasonably likely to be
disruptive to its normal business operations. Buyer agrees to maintain the
files or records which are contemplated by the first sentence of this Section
6.2 in a manner consistent in all material respects with its document
retention and destruction policies, as in effect from time to time, for seven
(7) years following the Closing. In the event that Buyer wishes to destroy
such records after such time, it shall give Sellers ninety (90) days' prior
written notice, and Sellers shall have the right, at their option and expense,
upon written notice to Buyer, to take possession of such records within one
hundred and eighty (180) days after the date of such notice. Section 6.3
Employee Matters. (a) Employment of Company Employees. Each Company Employee
set forth on a list provided by Buyer to Sellers at least thirty (30) days
prior to Closing (the "Employee List") shall be provided with an offer of
employment by Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer effective as of the Employee
Transfer Date (as defined below) on terms consistent with Section 6.3(c) no
later than twenty (20) days prior to the Closing Date; provided that, if
Sellers indicate that the services of any Company Employee on the Employee
List are necessary or desirable in connection with the then-current operations
of the Sellers, Buyer will work in good faith and cooperate with Sellers to
provide a portion of such Company Employee's time to continue such services
(at Sellers' expense), including by modifying or amending the Transition
Services Agreement to allow for such arrangements. For the purposes of this
Agreement, any individual who becomes employed by Buyer or an Affiliate of
Buyer in accordance with this Section 6.3(a) is referred to as a "Transferred
Employee" and the date any such Transferred Employee commences employment with
the Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer shall be referred to as the "Employee
Transfer Date". For each employee identified on the Employee List as primarily
dedicated to the MSRPA Servicing Rights, such employee's Employee Transfer
Date shall be the MSR Transfer Date applicable to such MSRPA Servicing Rights.
For each other employee, the Parties shall cooperate in good faith to
accommodate the transfer effective on an appropriate date taking into account
the transition of the Acquired Assets and the needs of Buyer to transition the
Business and Sellers' then-current operations. (b) Employees and Employee
Benefit Plans. (i) Liabilities. Effective as of the Employee Transfer Date,
Buyer shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, assume or retain, as the
case may be, any and all Liabilities relating to, arising out of, or resulting
from the employment or services, or termination of employment or services, of
any Transferred Employee, to the extent such Liabilities arise out of or
relate to such employee's employment with Buyer or its Affiliates, with
respect to each Company Employee who is a Transferred Employee. The Company or
the applicable Subsidiary shall retain as Excluded Liabilities any and all
Liabilities relating to, arising out of, or resulting from the employment or
services, or termination of employment or services, of (x) any Company
Employee who is a Transferred Employee to the extent such Liabilities arise
out of or relate to 70  

  

 ![](nrz2019630exh210075.jpg) 

such employee's employment with the Sellers or their Affiliates, (y) any
Company Employee who is not a Transferred Employee, and (z) any current or
former employee of any Seller or any of its Affiliates who is not a Company
Employee. (ii) Employee Benefit Plans. Effective as of the Employee Transfer
Date, the Company shall terminate the participation of each Transferred
Employee and such Transferred Employee's eligible dependents in each Company
Benefit Plan. (c) Transferred Employees - Additional Employment Terms. (i)
Terms and Conditions of Employment. Each Transferred Employee shall be offered
aggregate compensation, including base salary and incentives, and employee
benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate to those provided to
similarly situated employees of Buyer and its Affiliates. (ii) Credit for
Service. Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, credit Transferred
Employees for service earned on and prior to the Employee Transfer Date with
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, (A) to the extent that
service is relevant for purposes of eligibility, vesting, paid-leave
entitlement or the calculation of benefits under any employee benefit plan,
program or arrangement of Buyer or any of its Affiliates (other than with
respect to benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan or retiree
health plan) for the benefit of the Transferred Employees on or after the
Employee Transfer Date to the same extent and for the same purpose as such
service was credited to such Transferred Employee under the applicable Company
Benefit Plan as of the Employee Transfer Date and (B) for such additional
purposes as may be required by applicable Law; provided, however, that nothing
herein shall result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the
Transferred Employees. (d) Pre-existing Conditions; Coordination. Buyer shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to
waive any pre-existing condition or actively at work limitations, evidence of
insurability and waiting periods for the Transferred Employees and their
eligible spouses and dependents under any group health plan of Buyer or any of
its Affiliates for the benefit of the Transferred Employees on or after the
Employee Transfer Date to the same extent waived for such person under the
corresponding Benefit Plan as of the Employee Transfer Date. Buyer shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to credit
for purposes of determining and satisfying annual deductibles, co-insurance,
co-pays, out-of-pocket limits and other applicable limits under the comparable
health plans and arrangements offered to Transferred Employees, deductibles,
co-insurance, co-pays and out-of- pocket expenses paid by Transferred
Employees and their respective spouses and dependents under Sellers' or any of
their respective Affiliates' health plans in the calendar year in which the
Employee Transfer Date occurs. (e) 401(k) Plan. Each Transferred Employee
shall, to the extent they meet the applicable eligibility requirements, be
eligible to participate in a defined contribution plan sponsored by Buyer or
an Affiliate of Buyer that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of
the IRC (a "Buyer 401(k) Plan"). Effective as of the Employee Transfer Date,
the Sellers shall cause the account balances (including any outstanding loan
balances) in the tax-qualified defined contribution plan maintained by the
Sellers' or any of their respective Affiliates' (the "Seller 71  

  

 ![](nrz2019630exh210076.jpg) 

401(k) Plan") that are attributable to the Transferred Employees who were
participants in the Seller 401(k) Plan immediately prior to the Employee
Transfer Date to be transferred to the Buyer 401(k) Plan, and Buyer shall
cause the Buyer 401(k) Plan to accept the transfer of such amount in
accordance with Section 414(l) of the IRC, Treasury Regulation Section
414(l)-(1) and Section 208 of ERISA. (f) Flexible Spending Accounts. Effective
as of the Employee Transfer Date, Sellers shall transfer, or cause to be
transferred, to Buyer an amount, in cash, representing the aggregate 2019
contributions of each Transferred Employee then participating in a Company
Benefit Plan that is a flexible benefits plan (the "Company Flexible Benefits
Plan"), net of reimbursements (but not less than zero). Buyer shall cause such
amounts to be credited to each such employee's accounts under Buyer's (or one
of its Affiliate's) corresponding health care spending account plan (the
"Buyer Flexible Benefits Plan") in effect for such employees as of the
Employee Transfer Date, and all claims for reimbursement which have not been
paid as of the date of the transfer to Buyer and credited under the Buyer
Flexible Benefits Plan shall be paid pursuant to and under the terms of the
Buyer Flexible Benefits Plan. In connection with such transfer, Buyer shall
deem that such employees' deferral elections made under the Company Flexible
Benefits Plan for the 2019 calendar year shall continue in effect under the
Buyer Flexible Benefits Plan for the remainder of the 2019 calendar year
following the Employee Transfer Date. (g) Accrued Vacation and Sick Leave.
Effective as of the Employee Transfer Date, to the extent consented to by the
applicable Transferred Employee or otherwise permitted by applicable Law,
Buyer shall, and shall cause its applicable Affiliates to, recognize, assume
the Liability with respect to, and honor each Transferred Employee's vacation,
paid time off and sick leave (including personal leave) accrued but unused
through the Employee Transfer Date (as assumed by Buyer and its applicable
Affiliates, the "Assumed PTO") to the extent reflected in the Final Statement.
Transferred Employees shall be permitted to use their Assumed PTO in a manner
consistent with Buyer policies applicable to similarly situated employees of
Buyer and to accrue additional vacation and other paid-time-off in accordance
with Buyer's policies and procedures, as in effect from time to time. Buyer
and its Affiliates shall recognize the Transferred Employees' service with
Sellers and their Affiliates (and their predecessors) prior to the Employee
Transfer Date for the purposes of accruals and usage of vacation and paid-
time-off following the Employee Transfer Date. (h) Accrued Bonuses. Each
Seller shall continue to accrue bonuses under the Sellers' bonus plans for the
portion of the applicable bonus period through the Employee Transfer Date. To
the extent reflected in the Final Statement, Buyer shall assume and pay to the
Transferred Employees any accrued bonuses under Sellers' bonus plans for the
portion of the applicable bonus period through the Employee Transfer Date (the
"Accrued Bonus Amount"). The Accrued Bonus Amount shall be paid to the
applicable Transferred Employee at such time as such bonuses are traditionally
paid under such plan, in accordance with the terms and conditions of such
plan. Notwithstanding the above, Buyer shall reimburse Sellers for any portion
of the Accrued Bonus Amount that is not paid to any Transferred Employee
within ten (10) Business Days of the date that any portion of the Accrued
Bonus Amount is paid to Transferred Employees. 72  

  

 ![](nrz2019630exh210077.jpg) 

(i) W-2 Matters. Pursuant to IRS Revenue Procedure 2004-53, the Company and
Buyer shall apply the "alternative" method for purposes of employee payroll
reporting with respect to Transferred Employees. (j) No Third Party
Beneficiaries. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6.3 or any
provision of the Agreement, nothing in this Section 6.3 or the Agreement is
intended to and shall not (i) create any third party rights, (ii) amend any
Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement,
(iii) require Buyer or any of its Affiliates or Sellers or any of their
Affiliates to continue any employee benefit plan, program, policy or
arrangement beyond the time when it otherwise lawfully could be terminated or
modified or as otherwise required herein or (iv) provide any Company Employee
or any Transferred Employee with any rights to continued employment. Section
6.4 Certain Tax Matters. (a) Transfer Taxes. Any stamp, documentary, filing,
recording, registration, sales, use, transfer, added-value or other similar
Tax imposed under applicable Law in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (a "Transfer Tax") shall be borne fifty percent
(50%) by Buyer, on the one hand, and fifty percent (50%) by Sellers, on the
other hand; provided, that Sellers shall include in the Confirmation Order a
provision that provides that the transfer of the Acquired Assets shall be free
and clear of any stamp or similar taxes under Bankruptcy Code Section 1146(a)
to the extent permitted. The Person primarily responsible as a matter of Law
for filing any Tax Returns with respect to Transfer Taxes shall, at its
expense, timely prepare and file such Tax Returns and other documents required
to be filed with respect to such Transfer Taxes, and the other Party shall
promptly reimburse such Party for the amount of such Transfer Taxes actually
paid by such Party (including any additional Transfer Taxes resulting from
such reimbursement). Each of Seller and Buyer shall, upon the other party's
reasonable request and at such requesting party's sole expense, provide such
requesting party with any non-confidential documentation in its possession (as
reasonably determined by the providing party) in connection with such
requesting party's claim of exemption from any Transfer Taxes. (b) Tax
Adjustments. Taxes (other than Transfer Taxes) imposed upon or assessed
directly against the Acquired Assets (including real estate Taxes, personal
property Taxes and similar Taxes) for a taxable period which includes (but
does not end on) the Closing Date (the "Proration Period") will be apportioned
and prorated between Sellers and Buyer as of the Closing Date: (i) in the case
of real property, business personal property and ad valorem Taxes, by
apportioning such Taxes on a per diem basis and (ii) in the case of all other
Taxes, on a closing of the books basis. The Sellers shall be liable for the
proportionate amount of Taxes that are attributable to the portion of the
Proration Period ending on or before the Closing Date, and Buyer shall be
liable for the proportionate amount of Taxes that are attributable to the
portion of the Proration Period beginning after the Closing Date. If the
precise amount of any such Tax cannot be ascertained on the Closing Date,
apportionment and proration shall be computed on the basis of the amount
payable for each respective item during the Tax period immediately preceding
the Proration Period. Section 6.5 Insurance Matters. 73  

  

 ![](nrz2019630exh210078.jpg) 

(a) Buyer acknowledges that, upon Closing, all insurance coverage provided in
relation to Sellers and the Acquired Assets that is maintained by any Seller
or its Affiliates (whether such policies are maintained with third party
insurers or with such Seller or its Affiliates) shall cease to provide any
coverage to Buyer and Acquired Assets and no further coverage shall be
available to Buyer, or the Acquired Assets under any such policies. (b) To the
extent that there is any insurable claim related to the Business, any Acquired
Asset or Assumed Liability based on any act, omission or circumstance existing
or occurring at or prior to the Closing (an "Insurable Claim") under any
occurrence based insurance policy or program of any Seller or any of their
Affiliates that was issued by any third-party insurance carrier that was in
effect as of the Closing (a "Third-Party Insurance Policy") then, from and
after the Closing, such Seller shall (or shall cause its Affiliates to), at
Buyer's request and sole cost and expense, reasonably cooperate with Buyer to
make a claim on Buyer's behalf, after the Closing Date, under such Third-Party
Insurance Policy with respect to such Insurable Claim and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to pursue such claim (which shall not include
the commencement or prosecution of any Litigation by Seller or any Affiliate
against an insurer or any other Person). Such Seller shall (or shall cause its
Affiliates to), at Buyer's sole cost and expense, use commercially reasonable
efforts to file such claims with the applicable insurance carriers of such
Third-Party Insurance Policy. Buyer and Sellers shall keep each other
reasonably advised of the status of (and any developments regarding) any
Insurable Claim, and cooperate with each other and any insurance carrier in
connection with such Insurable Claims. Sellers shall as soon as reasonably
practicable following receipt thereof by a Seller or any of its Affiliates,
deliver to Buyer all proceeds received under the Third-Party Insurance
Policies with respect to such Insurable Claim. Buyer shall bear and be
responsible and indemnify Sellers for (and neither any Seller nor any of its
Affiliates shall have any obligation to repay or reimburse Buyer for) (A) the
amount of any and all deductibles, retentions or self- insurance associated
with claims under the foregoing Third Party Insurance Policies, (B) all
uninsured, uncovered, unavailable or uncollectible amounts of such claims and
(C) any other costs or expenses incurred by Sellers or their Affiliates in
compliance with this Section 6.5(b). Section 6.6 Acknowledgements. (a) Buyer
acknowledges that it has received from Sellers certain projections, forecasts,
and prospective or third party information relating to Sellers, the Acquired
Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, and other related topics. Buyer acknowledges
that (i) there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such
projections and forecasts and in such information; (ii) Buyer is familiar with
such uncertainties and is taking full responsibility for making its own
evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of such projections and forecasts in
such information so furnished; (iii) Buyer has not relied upon, and to the
Knowledge of Buyer none of its Representatives have relied upon, such
projections, forecasts and information; and (iv) neither Buyer nor any other
Person shall have any claim against any Seller or any of their Affiliates or
any of their respective directors, officers, employees, stockholders, members,
managers, partners, Affiliates, agents, or other Representatives with respect
thereto. Accordingly, without limiting the generality of Section 3.17 or
Section 9.1, Buyer acknowledges that none of the Sellers nor any other Person
makes any representations or warranties with respect to such projections,
forecasts, or information, except as may be expressly set forth in Article  

  

 ![](nrz2019630exh210079.jpg) 

(b) Buyer acknowledges that, except for the representations and warranties
expressly set forth in Article III, as modified by the Disclosure Schedule, or
expressly contained in any Related Agreement and without limiting the
generality of Section 3.17, (i) none of the Sellers nor any other Person has
made, or shall be deemed to have made, and none of Buyer or its
Representatives is relying on, any representation or warranty, express or
implied, including as to the accuracy or completeness of any information
regarding any of the Sellers, any Acquired Assets, any Assumed Liabilities or
any other matter, and no Seller nor any other Person will be subject to any
Liability to Buyer or any other Person resulting from such matters or the
distribution to Buyer, or the use of, any such information and (ii) SHOULD THE
CLOSING OCCUR, BUYER WILL ACQUIRE THE ACQUIRED ASSETS AND ASSUME THE ASSUMED
LIABILITIES IN AN "AS IS" CONDITION AND ON A "WHERE IS" BASIS, WITHOUT ANY
REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED (INCLUDING ANY WITH
RESPECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH OR SAFETY MATTERS). Further, without limiting
any representation, warranty, or covenant of any Seller expressly set forth
herein or in a Related Agreement, Buyer acknowledges that it has waived and
hereby waives, as a condition to the Closing, any further due diligence
reviews, inspections, or examinations with respect to any Seller, the Acquired
Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, or any other matter, including with respect
to engineering, environmental, title, survey, financial, operational,
regulatory, and legal compliance matters. Section 6.7 Press Releases and
Public Announcements. No Party shall issue any press release or make any
public announcement relating to the existence or subject matter of this
Agreement without the prior written approval of the other Parties (which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless a
press release or public announcement is required by applicable Law or a
Decree, including a Decree of the Bankruptcy Court. If any such announcement
or other disclosure is required by applicable Law or a Decree, including a
Decree of the Bankruptcy Court, to the extent practical or permitted, the
disclosing Party shall give the nondisclosing Parties prior notice of, and an
opportunity to comment on, the proposed disclosure. The Parties acknowledge
that Sellers shall file this Agreement with the Bankruptcy Court in connection
with filing the Notice of Stalking Horse Bidder (and to the extent that any
such other filings are required pursuant to any listing exchange or other
applicable Law). Section 6.8 Release of MSR Escrow Amount. Within two (2)
Business Days following each MSR Transfer Date, the Parties shall deliver a
joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent directing the Escrow Agent to
release from the MSR Escrow Account the proportion of the MSR Escrow Amount
that equals the ratio of (x) the MSRPA Servicing Rights transferred to Buyer
on the applicable MSR Transfer Date, to (y) all MSRPA Servicing Rights that
Sellers agreed to transfer to Buyer under the MSRPA; provided, however, that
if the transfer of MSRPA Servicing Rights is not able to occur as a result of
Buyer's failure to act in good faith to complete the transfer of the MSRPA
Servicing Rights in a timely manner, and such failure to act in good faith is
not remedied within ten (10) Business Days of Sellers' written notice to Buyer
notifying Buyer of such failure to act in good faith, then Sellers will be
entitled to receive the applicable portion of the MSR Escrow Amount that would
otherwise have been released to Sellers in accordance with this Section 6.8.
Section 6.9 Confidentiality. From and after the Closing, (a) Sellers shall,
and shall cause their respective Affiliates and Representatives to, keep
confidential and not disclose or use 75  

  

 ![](nrz2019630exh210080.jpg) 

in any manner any and all non-public information (including customer or other
personally identifiable information), whether written or oral, relating to the
Business, the Acquired Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or Buyer and its
Affiliates and (b) Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and
Representatives to, keep confidential and not disclose or use in any manner
any and all non-public information, whether written or oral, relating to the
Excluded Assets, the Excluded Liabilities or the Sellers; provided, however,
that, subject to compliance with the immediately following sentence, the
Parties shall not be liable hereunder with respect to any disclosure to the
extent such disclosure is required by any applicable Law or Decree, including
applicable rules of any securities exchange, or requested or required by any
Governmental Authority or Mortgage Agency. In the event that any Party is
requested or required by any applicable Law or Decree to disclose any such
non-public information, such Party shall, (i) to the extent permissible by
such applicable Law or Decree and practicable, provide the other Parties with
prompt written notice of such requirement, (ii) disclose only that information
that is required by such applicable Law or Decree and (iii) use commercially
reasonable efforts to preserve the confidentiality of such non-public
information, including by reasonably cooperating with the other Parties to
obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that
confidential treatment will be accorded such non-public information (at such
other Party's sole cost and expense). Section 6.10 Required Financial
Information; Cooperation. (a) Required Financial Information. At Buyer's
reasonable request and Buyer's sole cost and expense, Sellers shall reasonably
cooperate with Buyer in connection with Buyer's preparation of historical
financial statements and pro forma financial information in respect of the
Business as required by Regulation S-X under the Securities Act and the filing
of the necessary financial statements and pro forma financial information with
the SEC under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act and for securities
offerings by Buyer and its Affiliates in which such financial information is
reasonably necessary or advisable including (i) permitting Buyer to use any
audited or unaudited financial statements available, (ii) facilitating the
delivery from Seller's independent public accountants relevant consent letters
necessary in connection with the foregoing and (iii) if any requested
financial statements are not available, assisting in the preparation of such
audited or unaudited financial statements; provided, however, that in no event
will the Sellers be required to take any action in accordance with this
Section 6.10(a) that would be reasonably likely to be disruptive to the normal
business operations of the Sellers or require the preparation of any
information (or formatting of any information) that is not prepared by Sellers
in the Ordinary Course of Business, and failure to comply with this Section
6.10(a) will not cause a failure of the condition to Closing set forth in
Section 7.1(b) unless such breach is knowing and intentional and prevents or
materially impairs Buyer's ability to consummate the Closing; provided
further, however, that in no event will the Sellers have any Liability to
Buyer or any other Person for any information that is prepared by the Sellers
or provided by the Sellers to Buyer, in each case in accordance with this
Section 6.10(a). (b) Cooperation. (i) Until the earlier of (x) the Closing
Date and (y) the date this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its
terms, subject to Section 6.10(b)(ii), Sellers shall use reasonable best
efforts to provide, and Sellers shall use reasonable best efforts to cause

laundering rules and regulations, including U.S.A. Patriot Act of 2001, as
amended, that has been requested in writing by the Buyer or any financing
source for the Financing at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing.
The Company hereby consents to the reasonable use of its logo in connection
with the Financing in a manner that is customary for financing transactions of
the type; it being understood that such logo will not be used in a manner that
is intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or its
Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or its Subsidiaries.
All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding the Company
obtained by Buyer or its Representatives pursuant to this Section 6.10(b)
shall be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement,
except that such information may be disclosed to potential syndicate members,
other potential lenders, other potential financing sources or potential
participants and parties and their respective Representatives, subject to
customary confidentiality undertakings consistent with the requirements of the
Confidentiality Agreement by such potential syndicate members, other potential
lenders or potential participants and parties. (ii) Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in Section 6.10(b)(i), (i) none of the Sellers, their
Subsidiaries nor any of their respective Representatives shall be 77  

  

 ![](nrz2019630exh210082.jpg) 

required to take any action that (A) would reasonably be expected to conflict
with, violate, breach or otherwise contravene their respective organizational
documents or any applicable Law or material contracts, (B) would, in the good
faith determination of such Sellers or their Subsidiaries, as applicable,

none of the Sellers, their Subsidiaries nor any of their respective
Representatives shall be required to take or commit to take any action
(including the payment of commitment fees or other fees or have any Liability
or obligation, including any indemnification obligation) in connection with
the Financing that is not contingent upon the Closing (including the approval
of or entry into any agreement). Promptly following the request of any Seller,
Buyer will reimburse the Sellers for any reasonable, documented out-of-pocket
expenses (including reasonable, documented attorneys' fees) incurred by the
Sellers, their Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives in
connection with the assistance required by this Section 6.10. Buyer shall
indemnify and hold harmless each of the Sellers, their Subsidiaries and any of
their respective Representatives from and against any and all Liabilities or
losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with the cooperation
provided pursuant to this Section 6.10 or any information provided in
connection therewith, except to the extent (x) such Liabilities arise from the
Fraud or willful misconduct of any Seller or its Subsidiaries or their
respective Representatives, or (y) such Liabilities are directly and primarily
the result of a material breach of this Agreement by any Seller. Nothing
contained in this Section 6.10 or otherwise shall require any Seller or any
Subsidiary thereof to be an issuer or other obligor with respect to the
Financing. (iii) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the obtaining of any
Financing is not a condition to the Closing and reaffirms its obligation to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (subject to the
terms and conditions included herein) irrespective and independently of the
availability of any Financing, as, if and when required by the terms of this
Agreement. Section 6.11 Ginnie Mae Approval. (a) In the event that (i) the
Ginnie Mae Approval is not received on or prior to August 15, 2019 and (ii)
all of the conditions to the obligations of Sellers and Buyer to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement set forth in Article VII
(other than the PLS Approval, the condition set forth in Section 7.3(b)(ii)
and conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing itself,
but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) have been
satisfied or waived, then Buyer shall have the option to proceed to Closing
but defer the acquisition of the Ginnie Mae Assets until receipt of the Ginnie
Mae Approval. Subject to Section 6.12, in such case, at the Closing, Buyer
shall acquire the remainder of the 78  

  

 ![](nrz2019630exh210083.jpg) 

Acquired Assets and Assumed Liabilities, in accordance with the terms of this
Section 6.11 (the "Ginnie Mae Option"), Section 2.4, Section 2.5 and Section
6.12. (b) Upon the exercise by Buyer of the Ginnie Mae Option, the term
"Acquired Assets" shall be deemed to exclude the Ginnie Mae Assets, the term
"Assumed Liabilities" shall be deemed to exclude all Liabilities related to
the Ginnie Mae Assets and the Purchase Price to be paid at the Closing shall
be reduced by the Ginnie Mae Amount (calculated as of the Closing Date). (c)
In the event Buyer exercises the Ginnie Mae Option, the Parties hereby agree
that, following the Closing, they shall use their reasonable best efforts to
obtain the Ginnie Mae Approval as promptly as practicable. If the Ginnie Mae
Approval is obtained on or prior to the Outside Date, then the transfer of the
Ginnie Mae Assets to Buyer from the Sellers, along with assumption by Buyer of
any Liabilities that would have otherwise constituted Assumed Liabilities,
shall occur as soon as practicable following the Ginnie Mae Approval and in
accordance with applicable investor and regulatory guidelines, and there shall
be no further requirements or conditions to such transfer (the "Ginnie Mae
Closing"). At the Ginnie Mae Closing, the Company and Buyer shall provide a
joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent to release the Ginnie Mae
Deposit Amount, together with all accrued investment income thereon, if any,
to the Company, and the Buyer shall pay the remaining Ginnie Mae Amount
(calculated as of the Ginnie Mae Closing) to Sellers by wire transfer of
immediately available funds into an account designated by Sellers. If,
however, despite the Parties' utilizing their respective reasonable best
efforts, the Ginnie Mae Approval is not obtained on or prior to the Outside
Date, then the Company and Buyer shall provide a joint written instruction to
the Escrow Agent to release the Ginnie Mae Deposit Amount to Buyer, and Buyer
shall have no claim, right or interest in or to the Ginnie Mae Assets. Section
6.12 PLS Approval. (a) If (i) the Sale Provisions included in the Confirmation
Order approved by the Bankruptcy Court do not contain provisions relating to
the acquisition by Buyer of the PLS Assets acceptable to Buyer in its sole
discretion and (ii) the Confirmation Order does not provide that the approval
of each Securitization Trustee is unnecessary, the approval of each
Securitization Trustee under each Private Investor Servicing Agreement with
respect to the acquisition by Buyer of the applicable PLS Assets related to
each such Private Investor Servicing Agreement in a form acceptable to Buyer
in its sole discretion (clauses (i) and (ii) collectively, as applicable, the
"PLS Approval") is not received on or prior to the date on which all of the
conditions to the obligations of Sellers and Buyer to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement set forth in Article VII (other
than the Ginnie Mae Approval, if applicable under Section 6.11, and other than
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing itself, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) have been satisfied
or waived, then Buyer shall proceed to Closing and will not acquire the
applicable PLS Assets at Closing. Subject to Section 6.11, in such case, at
the Closing, Buyer shall acquire the remainder of the Acquired Assets and
Assumed Liabilities, in accordance with the terms of this Section 6.12 (the
"PLS Holdback"), Section 2.4, Section 2.5 and Section 6.11. 79  

  

 ![](nrz2019630exh210084.jpg) 

(b) In the event that the PLS Holdback occurs, the term "Acquired Assets"
shall be deemed to exclude the applicable PLS Assets, the term "Assumed
Liabilities" shall be deemed to exclude all Liabilities related to the
applicable PLS Assets and the Purchase Price to be paid at the Closing shall
be reduced by the PLS Amount. (c) In the event that the PLS Holdback occurs,
the Parties hereby agree that, following the Closing, they shall use their
reasonable best efforts to obtain the PLS Approval as promptly as practicable;
provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall limit Sellers' ability
to enter into or consummate an Alternative PLS Transaction in accordance with
Section 5.4(c)(ii). If, prior to the Outside Date (i) a definitive agreement
with respect to an Alternative PLS Transaction has not been entered into (or,
if such agreement has been entered into but is no longer in effect) or an
Alternative PLS Transaction has not been consummated and (ii) the PLS Approval
is obtained, then the transfer of the applicable PLS Assets to Buyer from the
Sellers, along with assumption by Buyer of any Liabilities that would have
otherwise constituted Assumed Liabilities, shall occur as soon as practicable
following the PLS Approval and in accordance with applicable investor and
regulatory guidelines, and there shall be no further requirements or
conditions to such transfer (the "PLS Closing"); provided, that,
notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Buyer and Sellers hereby acknowledge and agree that, in the event that the
Bankruptcy Court determines (including as part of the Confirmation Order) that
the Side Letters, or any rights or Liabilities of Sellers thereunder, must be
assumed by Buyer in order for Buyer to purchase, acquire and accept the
Servicing Agreements (as defined in each Side Letter), then Buyer, in its sole
discretion, shall be entitled (but not obligated) to determine that such
Servicing Agreements and Side Letters shall not be PLS Assets or Private
Investor Servicing Agreements for purposes of the PLS Closing and Buyer shall
not acquire such Servicing Agreements or Side Letters as part of the PLS
Assets (such Servicing Agreements or Side Letters thereafter constituting
Excluded Assets) or assume the Liabilities related thereto (such Liabilities
thereafter constituting Excluded Liabilities), it being acknowledged and
agreed by the Parties that (A) such determination shall not constitute the PLS
Holdback and (B) the sale of any such Servicing Agreements or Side Letters by
the Sellers to a party other than the Buyer following such determination by
Buyer shall not be prohibited by this Agreement and shall not result in the
payment of, or entitle the Buyer to, the payment of any fee, including the

the contrary contained in this Agreement, Sellers shall not be obligated to
indemnify any Buyer Indemnities with respect to any claim for indemnification
unless and until (i) first, with respect to any claim for Damages incurred, or
reasonably likely to be incurred, related to any specific asset type listed on
Section 9.4(a) of the Disclosure Schedule, the amount of the reserve
corresponding to such asset type reflected on such Disclosure Schedule is
applied to offset the amount of such Damages, and (ii) second, the aggregate
amount of other Damages incurred, or reasonably likely to be incurred (after
giving effect to clause (i) above), with respect to all such claims exceeds
$7,500,000 (the "Deductible"). In addition, the following limitations shall
apply to the rights of the Parties to seek indemnification under Section 9.2
and Section 9.3 (but for the avoidance of doubt shall not apply to Damages
incurred by Buyer Indemnities up to and including the amount of the
Deductible): (i) neither Buyer, on the one hand, nor any Seller, on the other
hand, shall be obligated to indemnify the other Party with respect to any
individual claim (or groups of claims arising from the same (A) facts and
circumstances, (B) type of breach, act or omission, or 91  

  

 ![](nrz2019630exh210096.jpg) 

(C) underlying cause ("Related Claims")) for indemnification hereunder if the
Damages with respect to such claim (or related claims) are less than $15,000
(the "De Minimis Amount"); (ii) neither Buyer, on the one hand, nor any
Seller, on the other hand, shall be obligated to indemnify the other Party
with respect to any claim for indemnification hereunder if the Damages with
respect to all such claims are less than $1,000,000 (the "Basket"),
disregarding any individual claims (or Related Claims) that do not exceed the
De Minimis Amount, in the aggregate, provided, that when the aggregate amount
of such indemnification claims exceeds the amount of the Basket, such
indemnified party shall be indemnified for (and receive from the indemnifying
party) the entire amount of such aggregate Damages, including the amount of
the Basket; and (iii) the maximum aggregate indemnifiable Damages that Buyer
shall be required to pay to the Seller Indemnitees, and that Sellers shall be
required to pay to the Buyer Indemnitees, for indemnification hereunder shall,
in each case, be limited in the aggregate to $25,000,000.00 (the "Cap");
provided, that, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to Sellers'
indemnification of the Buyer Indemnitees hereunder, the aggregate amount of
indemnification payments that Sellers shall be required to pay hereunder shall
be the aggregate amount then remaining in the Indemnification Escrow Account.
(b) Other than in the case of Fraud, the release of the Deposit Escrow Amount
to Sellers in accordance with Section 2.3(b)(iv) and except for equitable
remedies (including pursuant to Section 10.10), the indemnification rights
provided under this Article IX shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the
Buyer Indemnitees or Seller Indemnitees, as applicable, for any inaccuracy in
or breach of any representations, warranties or covenants of Sellers or Buyer,
respectively, contained in this Agreement, the MSRPA or any other Related
Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Parties hereby waive, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any and all other rights, claims
and causes of action (including rights of contributions, if any) known or
unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, which exist or may arise in the future, that
it may have against Sellers or any of their Affiliates, or Buyer or any of its
Affiliates, as the case may be, arising under or based upon any federal, state
or local Law (including any such Law relating to environmental matters or
arising under or based upon any securities Law, common Law or otherwise).
Section 9.5 Indemnification Claims Procedures. (a) A claim for indemnification
for any matter not involving a third party claim may be asserted by notice to
the Party from whom indemnification is sought. (b) In the event that a claim
or other Litigation shall be instituted, or that any claim or demand shall be
asserted, by any third party (including any Governmental Authority or Mortgage
Agency) in respect of which indemnification may be sought under this Article
IX (an "Indemnification Claim"), the indemnified party shall promptly provide
written notice of the assertion of any Indemnification Claim of which it has
knowledge that is covered by this Article IX to the indemnifying party. The
failure of the indemnified party to give reasonably prompt written notice of
any Indemnification Claim shall not release, waive or otherwise affect the
indemnifying party's obligations with respect thereto except to the extent
that the indemnifying 92  

  

 ![](nrz2019630exh210097.jpg) 

party is materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. If the
indemnifying party gives notice (the "Notice of Assumption") to the
indemnified party within fifteen (15) days (or sooner, if the nature of the
Indemnification Claim so requires) after the indemnified party has given
notice to the indemnifying party of the Indemnification Claim that the
indemnifying party elects to assume the defense of the Indemnification Claim,
the indemnifying party shall have the right, at its sole option and expense,
to be represented by counsel of its choice and who is reasonably acceptable to
the indemnified party and, subject to Section 9.5(c) and Section 9.5(d), to
defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such Indemnification
Claim, which relates to any Damages indemnifiable by it hereunder. If the
indemnifying party shall assume the defense of any Indemnification Claim, the
indemnified party may participate, at his, her or its own expense, in the
defense of such Indemnification Claim; provided, however, that such
indemnified party shall be entitled to participate in any such defense with
separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party if (i) so requested
by the indemnifying party to participate or (ii) in the reasonable opinion of
counsel to the indemnified party, a conflict or potential conflict exists
between the indemnified party and the indemnifying party that would make such
separate representation advisable; and provided, further, that the
indemnifying party shall not be required to pay for more than one such counsel
(plus any appropriate local counsel if applicable) for all indemnified parties
in connection with any Indemnification Claim. Buyer and Sellers agree to
cooperate fully, and to cause the respective Buyer Indemnitees and Seller
Indemnitees to cooperate fully, with each other in connection with the
defense, negotiation or settlement of any such Indemnification Claim. The
Parties acknowledge and agree that Sellers shall have the right to enforce the
Confirmation Order in defending any indemnifiable claims pursuant to this
Article IX. (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
but subject to Section 9.5(d), no Party (including in their capacity as an
indemnifying party or an indemnified party) shall, without the written consent
of the other Party, (i) take any action on an Indemnification Claim, enter
into any settlement regarding, or compromise, modify or limit, any assets,
rights or claims of the other Party, including with respect to an
Indemnification Claim, or (ii) permit a default or consent to entry of any
judgment with respect thereto; provided, that the indemnifying party may
settle the Indemnification Claim without the written consent of the
indemnified party if the terms of the settlement (i) provide solely for
monetary damages which are to be paid entirely by the indemnifying party, (ii)
do not provide for any finding or admission, directly or indirectly, of any
violation of Law by the indemnified party, and (iii) do not contain any Decree
which in any manner affects, restrains or interferes with the business of the
indemnified party or its Affiliates. (d) Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, an indemnified party shall have the full right to control the
defense, compromise and settlement of any third-party claims at the reasonable
expense of the indemnifying party if (i) the claim seeks an injunction or
other equitable relief with respect to the Acquired Assets or Assumed
Liabilities, (ii) the claim involves criminal allegations related to Buyer or
any of its Affiliates, officers, managers or employees, (iii) the claim
involves claims for Damages that exceed the remaining portion of the Cap by an
amount greater than such portion of the Cap remaining after application of all
Damages sought to be recovered by the indemnified parties, or (iv) the
indemnifying party fails to use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue the
prosecution and/or settlement of such Indemnification Claim or fails to notify
the indemnified party of its assumption of the defense of 93  

  

 ![](nrz2019630exh210098.jpg) 

such Indemnification Claim within fifteen (15) days as provided in Section
9.5(b). Assumption by the indemnified party of control of any such defense,
compromise, or settlement in accordance with this Section 9.5(d) shall not be
deemed a waiver by it of its right to indemnification hereunder. However, the
consent requirements and their exclusions contained in Section 9.5(c) above
shall apply to any defense, compromise or settlement undertaking by an
indemnified party pursuant to this Section 9.5(d) if any such defense,
compromise or settlement involves a claim for indemnification under this
Article IX pursuant to which the indemnifying party would be required to make
all or substantially all of any cash payment pursuant to any such compromise
or settlement. The indemnifying party may participate in, but not control, any
defense or settlement controlled by the indemnified party pursuant to this
Section 9.5(d), and the indemnifying party shall bear its own costs and
expenses with respect to such participation. Section 9.6 Calculation of
Indemnity Payments. (a) The amount of any Damages for which indemnification is
provided under this Article IX shall be net of any amounts actually recovered
by the indemnified party (including under insurance policies) with respect to
such Damages (net of any applicable deductibles, co-payments, premium
increases, "retro premium" adjustments and similar costs or expenses incurred
in obtaining such benefit or recovery), and the indemnified party will use
commercially reasonable efforts to pursue such amounts. (b) If an indemnified
party recovers an amount from a third party in respect of Damages that are the
subject of indemnification hereunder (after all or a portion of such Damages
have been paid by an indemnifying party pursuant to this Article IX) and the
indemnified party seeks recovery from such third party (i) prior to the three
(3) year anniversary of the Closing Date or (ii) within one (1) year of the
resolution of the claim for indemnification made hereunder, in the event that
such claim remained unresolved (and, therefore, outstanding), following the
two (2) year anniversary of the Closing Date, then, in each case, the
indemnified party shall promptly remit to the Escrow Agent (or, to the extent
that the Escrow Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, to
the indemnifying party) the excess (if any) of (x) (A) the amount paid by such
third party in respect of such Damages (net of any applicable deductibles, co-
payments, premium increases, "retro premium" adjustments and similar costs or
expenses incurred in obtaining such benefit or recovery) plus (B) the amount
received by the indemnified party from the indemnifying party in respect
thereof pursuant to this Article IX minus (y) the full amount of the Damages,
and the indemnified party will use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue
such amounts. Section 9.7 Additional Indemnification Considerations. (a)
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or any Related Agreement to the
contrary and other than with respect to the representations, warranties and
covenants in Section 3.4 and Section 6.10 of this Agreement, and Section 6.12
of the MSRPA, for purposes of establishing whether any matter is indemnifiable
(including with respect to the determination of whether there is an inaccuracy
or breach of any representation, warranty or covenant in this Agreement or any
Related Agreement) under this Article IX, and for purposes of determining the
amount of any indemnifiable Damages under this Article IX, such
representations, warranties and covenants in this Agreement and any Related
Agreement shall be determined without giving 94  

  

 ![](nrz2019630exh210099.jpg) 

effect to any materiality or Material Adverse Effect qualifications to such
representations, warranties or covenants. (b) No information or knowledge of
any Party, nor the results of any due diligence or investigation by any Party
(including in relation to the other Party, Acquired Assets, Assumed
Liabilities, the Mortgage Loans, the Servicing Rights (as defined in the
MSRPA) or other assets), shall affect, waive, modify, limit, or diminish: (i)
any representation or warranty of any Party contained in this Agreement or any
Related Agreement; or (ii) any other Party's right to rely upon such
representations and warranties, including with respect to any claims for
indemnification hereunder. (c) All indemnification payments made pursuant to
this Article IX shall be treated by all Parties as adjustments to the Purchase
Price. (d) Each party that is eligible for indemnification under this Article
IX, as the case may be, in respect of a Damage or cost and expense shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with requirements of Applicable
Requirements with respect to mitigation of damages to mitigate such Damage in
a commercially reasonable manner; provided, however, that such mitigation will
not cause such indemnified party to incur any costs and expenses without being
reimbursed therefor; and, provided further, the failure to mitigate by a party
shall not affect the indemnifying Party's obligation to indemnify the
indemnified party or parties except to the extent such failure to mitigate
results in any material prejudice to the indemnifying Party and then only to
the extent of such material prejudice and a violation of requirements of
Applicable Requirements with respect to mitigation of damages. Each such
indemnified party shall furthermore reasonably cooperate with the indemnifying
Party, at the indemnifying Party's reasonable request and expense, in
connection with any efforts by the indemnifying Party to mitigate such Damage.
(e) The Buyer Indemnitees and Seller Indemnitees shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to fully enforce the Confirmation Order with respect to any
Lien, Liability or other matter whose treatment is addressed in the
Confirmation Order before making a claim pursuant to this Article IX with
respect to such matters, it being understood that the Confirmation Order shall
be used first to defend against any Lien, Liability or other matter whose
treatment is addressed in the Confirmation Order before making an
indemnification claim pursuant to this Article IX with respect to such
matters; provided, however, that the costs and expenses of any Buyer
Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee of such enforcement of the Confirmation Order
shall constitute Damages for the purposes of this Agreement and shall not be
subject to the De Minimis Amount. (f) Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Sellers shall only be required to indemnify
Buyer under Section 9.2(d) for any Damages incurred with respect to GNMA Pre-
Closing Liabilities to the extent that such Damages exceed forty percent (40%)
of the amount of the Liabilities for originations set forth in the Final
Statement in respect of the GNMA Pre-Closing Liabilities. (g) Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, any Person making an Indemnification Claim
under this Article IX must give notice to the indemnifying party of any 95  

  

 ![](nrz2019630exh210100.jpg) 

such Indemnification Claim in writing in reasonable detail prior to the
expiration of the second (2nd) anniversary of the Closing Date. Any
Indemnification Claim not made on or prior to that date will be irrevocably
and unconditionally released and waived. Section 9.8 Indemnification Escrow
Amount. The Parties agree that payment of any claims indemnifiable by Sellers
in accordance with this Article IX from the available amounts in the
Indemnification Escrow Account will be the sole and exclusive remedy and
source of recovery for payment of such indemnification obligations of the
Sellers, other than in the case of Fraud. MISCELLANEOUS Section 10.1 Expenses.
Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, each Party will bear its own
costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including all fees of law firms,
commercial banks, investment banks, accountants, public relations firms,
experts and consultants. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall pay all
recording fees arising from the transfer of the Acquired Assets. Section 10.2
Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Related Agreements and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the Parties
and supersede any prior understandings, agreements or representations (whether
written or oral) by or between the Parties to the extent they relate in any
way to the subject matter hereof. Section 10.3 Incorporation of Exhibits and
Disclosure Schedule. The Exhibits to this Agreement and the Disclosure
Schedule are incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof. Section
10.4 Amendments and Waivers. No amendment of any provision of this Agreement
shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and signed by each Party.
No waiver of any breach of this Agreement shall be construed as an implied
amendment or agreement to amend or modify any other provision of this
Agreement. No waiver by any Party of any default, misrepresentation or breach
of warranty or covenant hereunder, whether intentional or not, shall be valid
unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Party making such
waiver, nor shall such waiver be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent
default, misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder or
affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent
default, misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant. No conditions,
course of dealing or performance, understanding or agreement purporting to
modify, vary, explain, or supplement the terms or conditions of this Agreement
shall be binding unless this Agreement is amended or modified in writing
pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 10.4 except as expressly
provided herein. Except where a specific period for action or inaction is
provided herein, no delay on the part of any Party in exercising any right,
power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof. Section 10.5
Succession and Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns. No Party may assign either this Agreement or any of its rights,
interests, or obligations hereunder without 96

the prior written consent of the other Parties; provided that, notwithstanding
the foregoing, without obtaining such prior written consent Buyer may assign
either this Agreement or any of its rights, interests, or obligations
hereunder to an Affiliate of Buyer at any time in its discretion (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, an assignment by Buyer to one or more of its
Affiliates of Buyer's rights hereunder to acquire any Acquired Assets and/or
assume any Assumed Liabilities), provided, however, that Buyer shall not be
relieved of its obligations hereunder in the event of such assignment to an
Affiliate. Section 10.6 Notices. All notices, requests, demands, claims and

directly or indirectly based upon or arising out of this Agreement or the

Parties irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the exclusive jurisdiction
of the Bankruptcy Court in any Litigation arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or any Related Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or thereby and agrees that all claims in respect of such Litigation

Any Party may make service on any other Party by sending or delivering a copy

 ![](nrz2019630exh210103.jpg) 

Section 10.10 Specific Performance. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the
other Parties and their respective Affiliates and estates would be damaged
irreparably in the event the other Parties do not perform their obligations
under this Agreement in accordance with its specific terms or otherwise breach
this Agreement, so that, in addition to any other remedy that the non-
breaching Party may have under Law or equity, each non-breaching Party shall
be entitled, without the requirement of posting a bond or other security or
proof of damages or otherwise, to injunctive relief to prevent any breaches of
the provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement
and the terms and provisions hereof. The remedies available to the Parties
pursuant to this Section 10.10 will be in addition to any other remedy to
which they were entitled at Law or in equity, and the election to pursue an
injunction or specific performance will not restrict, impair or otherwise
limit any Party from seeking to collect or collecting damages that such Party
is entitled to seek or collect. Section 10.11 Severability. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of any other provisions of this Agreement. In the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be held by any
Governmental Authority to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, such
provisions shall be limited or eliminated only to the minimum extent necessary
so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect.

provided in Section 10.13, this Agreement shall not confer any rights or
remedies upon any Person other than Buyer, each Seller, and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Section 10.13 Non-Recourse. All claims or
causes of action (whether in Contract or in tort, in Law or in equity, or
granted by statute) that may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or
by reason of, be connected with, or related in any manner to this Agreement or
the Related Agreements may be made only against (and are expressly limited to)
the Persons that are expressly identified as parties hereto or thereto (the
"Contracting Parties"). In no event shall any Contracting Party have any
shared or vicarious Liability for the actions or omissions of any other
Person. No Person who is not a Contracting Party, including any director,
officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, manager, stockholder,
Affiliate, agent, attorney or other Representative of, and any financial
advisor or lender to, any of the foregoing ("Non-Party Affiliates"), shall
have any Liability (whether in Contract or in tort, in Law or in equity, or
granted by statute or based upon any theory that seeks to impose Liability of
an entity party against its owners or Affiliates) for any claims, causes of
action, obligations or Liabilities arising under, out of, in connection with
or related in any manner to this Agreement or the Related Agreements or based
on, in respect of, or by reason of this Agreement or the Related Agreements or
their negotiation, execution, performance or breach; and, to the maximum
extent permitted by Law, each Contracting Party waives and releases all such
Liabilities, claims and obligations against any such Non-Party Affiliates.
Without limiting the foregoing, to the maximum extent permitted by Law, (a)
each Contracting Party hereby waives and releases any and all rights, claims,
demands, or causes of action that may otherwise be available at Law or in
equity, or granted by statute, to avoid or disregard the entity form of a
Contracting Party or otherwise impose Liability of a Contracting Party on any
Non-Party Affiliate, whether granted by statute or based on theories of
equity, agency, control, instrumentality, alter ego, domination, sham, single
business enterprise, piercing the veil, unfairness, undercapitalization, or
otherwise; and (b) each 99  

  

 ![](nrz2019630exh210104.jpg) 

Contracting Party disclaims any reliance upon any Non-Party Affiliates with
respect to the performance of this Agreement or the Related Agreements or any
representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as an inducement to
this Agreement or the Related Agreements. The Parties acknowledge and agree
that the Non-Party Affiliates are intended third-party beneficiaries of this
Section 10.13. Section 10.14 Mutual Drafting. The Parties have participated
jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an
ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall
be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden
of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the
authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement. Section 10.15
Disclosure Schedule. All capitalized terms not defined in the Disclosure
Schedule shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this Agreement. Any
disclosure set forth in one section or subsection of the Disclosure Schedule
shall be deemed disclosed with respect to, and shall be deemed to apply to and
qualify, the section or subsection of this Agreement to which it corresponds
in number and each other section or subsection of this Agreement to the extent
the qualifying nature of such disclosure with respect to such other section or
subsection is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure,
notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross-reference. The representations
and warranties of Sellers in this Agreement are made and given, and the
covenants are agreed to, subject to the disclosures and exceptions set forth
in the Disclosure Schedule. The listing of any matter shall expressly not be
deemed to constitute an admission by Sellers, or to otherwise imply, that any
such matter is material, is required to be disclosed under this Agreement or
falls within relevant minimum thresholds or materiality standards set forth in
this Agreement. No disclosure in the Disclosure Schedule relating to any
possible breach or violation of any Contract or Law shall be construed as an
admission or indication that any such breach or violation exists or has
actually occurred. In no event shall the listing of any matter in the
Disclosure Schedule be deemed or interpreted to expand the scope of Sellers'
representations, warranties, or covenants set forth in this Agreement. All
attachments to the Disclosure Schedule are incorporated by reference into the
applicable section of the Disclosure Schedule in which they are directly or
indirectly referenced. The information contained in the Disclosure Schedule is
in all respects provided subject to the Confidentiality Agreement. Section
10.16 Headings; Table of Contents. The section headings and the table of
contents contained in this Agreement and the Disclosure Schedule are inserted
for convenience only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. Section 10.17 Counterparts; Facsimile and
Electronic Signatures. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which
together will constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement or any
counterpart may be executed and delivered by facsimile copies or delivered by
electronic communications by portable document format (.pdf), each of which
shall be deemed an original. [Remainder of page intentionally left blank.] 100

reflected in the monthly statement provided to the Parties. The Escrow Funds

Escrow Agent is unable to verify the instructions, or is not satisfied with
the verification it receives, it will not execute the instruction until all
such issues have been resolved. The persons and telephone numbers for call

WEIL:\\\96975875\\\20\\\41703.0011  

  

 ![](nrz2019630exh210113.jpg) 

hand, and the Purchase Agreement, on the other, shall be resolved in favor of
the Purchase Agreement, and (ii) no provision of this Agreement (including all
schedules) shall limit or alter any term or obligations of Buyer and Sellers
created, originating or referred to in the Purchase Agreement. 5. Escrow
Agent. The Escrow Agent undertakes to perform only such duties as are
expressly set forth herein, which shall be deemed purely ministerial in
nature, and no other duties, including but not limited to any fiduciary
duties, shall be implied. The Escrow Agent shall neither be responsible for,
nor chargeable with knowledge of, nor have any requirements to comply with,
the terms and conditions of any other agreement, instrument or document
between the Parties, nor shall the Escrow Agent be required to determine if
any Person has complied with any such agreements, nor shall any additional
obligations of the Escrow Agent be inferred from the terms of such agreements,
even though reference thereto may be made in this Agreement. Notwithstanding
the terms of any other agreement between the Parties, the terms and conditions
of this Agreement will control the actions of the Escrow Agent. The Escrow
Agent may rely upon and shall not be liable for acting or refraining from
acting upon any Joint Release Instruction or Final Determination furnished to
it hereunder and believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed and
presented by an authorized signer of the proper Party or Parties. Concurrent
with the execution of this Agreement, the Parties shall deliver to the Escrow
Agent authorized signers' forms in the form of Exhibit A-1 and Exhibit A-2
attached hereto. The Escrow Agent shall be under no duty to inquire into or
investigate the validity, accuracy or content of any such document, notice,
instruction or request. The Escrow Agent shall have no duty to solicit any
payments which may be due it or the Escrow Funds. In the event that the Escrow
Agent shall be uncertain as to its duties or rights hereunder or shall receive
instructions, claims or demands from any Party hereto which, in its opinion,
conflict with any of the provisions of this Agreement, it shall be entitled to
refrain from taking any action and its sole obligation shall be to keep safely
all property held in escrow until it shall be directed otherwise in a Joint
Release Instruction or Final Determination. The Escrow Agent may interplead
all of the assets held hereunder into a court of competent jurisdiction or may
seek a declaratory judgment with respect to certain circumstances, and
thereafter be fully relieved from any and all liability or obligation with
respect to such interpleaded assets or any action or nonaction based on such
declaratory judgment. The Escrow Agent may consult with legal counsel of its
selection in the event of any dispute or question as to the meaning or
construction of any of the provisions hereof or its duties hereunder. The
Escrow Agent will not be liable for any action taken, suffered or omitted to
be taken by it in good faith except to the extent that the Escrow Agent's
gross negligence or willful misconduct was the cause of any direct loss to
either Party. To the extent reasonably practicable, the Parties agree to
pursue any redress or recourse in connection with any dispute without making
the Escrow Agent a party to the same. Anything in this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the Escrow Agent be liable for any
special, indirect, punitive, incidental or consequential losses or damages of
any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits), even if the
Escrow Agent has been advised of the likelihood of such losses or damages and
regardless of the form of action, except in the case of the Escrow Agent's
fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct as adjudicated by a court of
competent jurisdiction. 6. Resignation and Removal of Escrow Agent. The Escrow
Agent (a) may resign and be discharged from its duties or obligations
hereunder by giving sixty (60) calendar days advance notice in writing of such
resignation to the Parties specifying a date when such resignation shall 5
WEIL:\\\96975875\\\20\\\41703.0011  

  

 ![](nrz2019630exh210114.jpg) 

take effect or (b) may be removed, with or without cause, by Buyer and Seller
acting jointly at any time by providing written notice to the Escrow Agent;
provided that any such resignation or removal shall not relieve the Escrow
Agent from any liability that arose from any action or inaction that occurred
prior to the effective date of such resignation or removal. Any entity into
which the Escrow Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be
consolidated, or any corporation or association to which all or substantially
all of the escrow business of the Escrow Agent's line of business may be
transferred, shall be the Escrow Agent under this Agreement without further
act. The Escrow Agent's sole responsibility after such sixty (60) day notice
period expires or after receipt of written notice of removal shall be to hold
and safeguard the Escrow Funds (without any obligation to reinvest the same)
and to deliver the same (i) to a substitute or successor escrow agent pursuant
to a joint written designation from the Parties, (ii) as set forth in a Joint
Release Instruction or (iii) in accordance with the directions of a Final
Determination, and, at the time of such delivery, the Escrow Agent's
obligations hereunder shall cease and terminate. In the event the Escrow Agent
resigns, if the Parties have failed to appoint a successor escrow agent prior
to the expiration of sixty (60) calendar days following receipt of the notice
of resignation, the Escrow Agent may petition any court of competent
jurisdiction for the appointment of such a successor escrow agent or for other
appropriate relief, and any such resulting appointment shall be binding upon
all of the parties hereto. 7. Fees and Expenses. All fees and expenses of the
Escrow Agent are described in Schedule 1 attached hereto and shall be paid
fifty percent by Buyer and fifty percent by Seller. The fees agreed upon for
the services to be rendered hereunder are intended as full compensation for
the Escrow Agent's services as contemplated by this Agreement. 8. Indemnity.
Each of the Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Escrow Agent and its affiliates and their respective successors,
assigns, directors, officers, agents and employees (the "Indemnitees") from
and against and with respect to, any and all losses, damages, claims,
liabilities, penalties, judgments, settlements, actions, suits, proceedings,
litigation, investigations, costs or expenses (including the reasonable and
documented fees and expenses of one outside counsel and experts and their
staffs and all expense of document location, duplication and shipment)
(collectively "Escrow Agent Losses") actually incurred in connection with (a)
the Escrow Agent's execution and performance of this Agreement, tax reporting
or withholding, the enforcement of any rights or remedies under or in
connection with this Agreement, or as may arise by reason of any act, omission
or error of the Indemnitee in connection with this Agreement, except to the
extent that such Escrow Agent Losses, as determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction, in a final non-appealable judgment, have been caused by the
fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee, or (b) its
following any instructions or other directions from the Parties received in
accordance with this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, Buyer and Seller agree, solely as between themselves, that any
obligation for indemnification under this Section 8 (or for reasonable fees
and expenses of the Escrow Agent described in Section 7) shall be borne by the
Party or Parties determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final
non-appealable judgment to be responsible for causing the loss, damage,
liability, cost or expense against which the Escrow Agent is entitled to
indemnification or, if no such determination is made, then one half by Buyer
and one half by Seller. The Parties acknowledge that the foregoing indemnities
shall survive the resignation or removal of the Escrow Agent or the
termination of this Agreement. 6 WEIL:\\\96975875\\\20\\\41703.0011  

  

 ![](nrz2019630exh210115.jpg)

date hereof, the Parties shall provide the Escrow Agent with certified tax
identification numbers by furnishing correct, duly completed, dated and
executed current IRS Forms W-9 or W-8, as applicable, and including such other
supporting forms and documents that the Escrow Agent may reasonably request to
validate the form provided. If the Escrow Agent has not received IRS Forms W-9
or W-8 five (5) days prior to the date hereof, the Escrow Agent shall request
such forms from the Parties. (b) The Escrow Agent shall be responsible for
satisfying any applicable tax reporting requirements (including any applicable
IRS Form 1099) in accordance with this Section 9. The Escrow Agent shall
withhold any taxes required to be withheld by applicable Law, including but
not limited to required withholding in the absence of proper tax
documentation, and shall remit such taxes to the appropriate authorities. (c)
The Escrow Agent, its affiliates, and its employees are not in the business of
providing tax or legal advice to any taxpayer outside of Citigroup, Inc. and
its affiliates. This Agreement and any amendments or attachments hereto are
not intended or written to be used, and may not be used or relied upon, by any
such taxpayer or for the purpose of avoiding tax penalties. Any such taxpayer
should seek advice based on the taxpayer\'s particular circumstances from an
independent tax advisor. 10. Covenant of Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent hereby
agrees and covenants with Buyer and Seller that it shall perform all of its
obligations under this Agreement and shall not deliver custody or possession
of any of the Escrow Funds to anyone except pursuant to the express terms of
this Agreement or as otherwise required by Law. 11. Notices. Subject to

unless the same shall be in writing and signed by each party hereto except as

provision of this Agreement. This Agreement (and any claims, disputes, rights
and obligations of the hereunder (whether based on Contract, tort or any other
theory) directly or indirectly based upon or arising out of this Agreement or
the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement) shall be governed
by and construed in accordance with the internal Laws of the State of New York
(without giving effect to the principles of conflict of Laws thereof), except
to the extent that the Laws of such state are superseded by the Bankruptcy
Code. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally submits to
the exclusive jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court in any Litigation arising
out of or relating to this Agreement and agrees that all claims in respect of
such Litigation may be heard and determined in such court. Each party hereto
also agrees not to (a) attempt to deny or defeat such exclusive jurisdiction

 ![](nrz2019630exh210118.jpg) 

arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any other court. Each of the
parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the

that might be required of any other party hereto with respect thereto. Any
party hereto may make service on any other party hereto by sending or
delivering a copy of the process to the party to be served at the address and
in the manner provided for the giving of notices in Section 11; provided,
however, that nothing in this Section 13 shall affect the right of any party

original but all of which together will constitute one and the same

invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of any other provisions of this
Agreement. In the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be
held by any Governmental Authority to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable,
such provisions shall be limited or eliminated only to the minimum extent
necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and
effect. The Parties represent, warrant and covenant that each document,
notice, instruction or request provided by such Party to the Escrow Agent
shall comply with applicable Laws and regulations. Where, however, the
conflicting provisions of any such applicable Law may be waived, they are
hereby irrevocably waived by the parties hereto to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, to the end that this Agreement shall be enforced as written.
Except as expressly provided in Section 8, nothing in this Agreement, whether
express or implied, shall be construed to give to any person or entity other
than the Escrow Agent and the Parties any legal or equitable right, remedy,
interest or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any funds escrowed
hereunder. 14. Compliance with Court Orders. In the event that any escrow
property shall be attached, garnished or levied upon by any court order, or
the delivery thereof shall be stayed or enjoined by an order of a court, or
any order, judgment or decree shall be made or entered by any court order
affecting the property deposited under this Agreement, the Escrow Agent is
hereby expressly authorized, in its sole discretion, to obey and comply with
all writs, orders or decrees so entered or issued, which it is advised by

agreements as any other party hereto shall reasonably request to consummate or

or to assure to any other party the benefits hereof. 10

16\. Assignment. No assignment of the interest of any of the Parties shall be
binding upon the Escrow Agent unless and until written notice of such
assignment shall be filed with and consented to by the Escrow Agent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld). Any transfer or assignment of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder in violation of the terms hereof
shall be void and of no force or effect. 17. Force Majeure. The Escrow Agent
shall not incur any liability for not performing any act or fulfilling any
obligation hereunder by reason of any occurrence beyond its control
(including, but not limited to, any provision of any present or future law or
regulation or any act of any governmental authority, any act of God or war or
terrorism, or the unavailability of the Federal Reserve Bank wire services or
any electronic communication facility), it being understood that the Escrow
Agent shall use commercially reasonable efforts which are consistent with
accepted practices in the banking industry to resume performance as soon as
reasonably practicable under the circumstances. 18. Compliance with Federal
Law. To help the U.S. Government fight the funding of terrorism and money
laundering activities and to comply with Federal law requiring financial
institutions to obtain, verify and record information on the source of funds
deposited to an account, the Parties agree to provide the Escrow Agent with
the name, address, taxpayer identification number, and remitting bank for all
Parties depositing funds at Citibank pursuant to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement. For a non-individual person such as a business entity, a
charity, a trust or other legal entity, the Escrow Agent will ask for
documentation to verify its formation and existence as a legal entity. The
Escrow Agent may also ask to see financial statements, licenses, and
identification and authorization documents from individuals claiming authority
to represent the entity or other relevant documentation. 19. Use of Citibank
Name. No publicly distributed printed or other material in any language,
including prospectuses, notices, reports, and promotional material which
mentions "Citibank" by name or the rights, powers, or duties of the Escrow
Agent under this Agreement shall be issued by the Parties, or on such Parties'
behalf, without the prior written consent of the Escrow Agent. * * * * * 11

Section 4.04 Reserved. Section 4.05 Sanctions; Anti-Corruption Compliance.
None of the Seller or its respective affiliates, or any of its directors,
officers, or employees is a person that is (i) a target of United States
economic, financial, or trade sanctions in force from time to time, (ii)
named, identified, or described on any blocked person list, specially
designated nationals lists, prohibited persons list, or other official list of
restricted persons with whom United States persons may not conduct business,
including, but not limited to, restricted party lists published or maintained
by the United States government, including the respective governmental
institutions and agencies of any of the foregoing including the Office of
Foreign Assets Control and the United States Department of State, or (iii)
owned or controlled by, or an actor on behalf of, any persons described in
clauses (i) and (ii). Section 4.06 Mortgage Loans and Servicing Rights. 4.6.1
General Compliance. Each Mortgage Loan, Servicing Right and Advance conforms
to the Applicable Requirements except, in each case, as would not be
reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, and each Mortgage Loan
was eligible for sale to, insurance by, or pooling to back securities issued
or guaranteed by, or participation certificates issued by, the applicable
Agency, Investor, Insurer or other Person upon such sale, issuance of
insurance or pooling, if any. To the Seller's knowledge, there has been no
improper act or omission or alleged improper act or omission, or error by any
Originator or Prior Servicer with respect to the origination, underwriting or
servicing of any of the Mortgage Loans; and there has been no improper act or
omission or alleged improper act or omission, or error by the Seller or any
Originator or Prior Servicer with respect to the origination, underwriting or
servicing of any of the Mortgage Loans. Each Mortgage Loan has been
originated, underwritten and serviced in compliance with all Applicable
Requirements and Accepted Servicing Practices except as would not be
reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. All collection efforts
by or on behalf of the Seller have been performed timely, prudently and in
compliance with all Applicable Requirements and Accepted Servicing Practices
and, other than as set forth on Schedule 4.6.1, all "first legal" actions with
respect to Mortgage Loans insured by the FHA were timely achieved in
accordance with Applicable Requirements, except as would not be reasonably
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the applicable
Mortgage Loan or the related Servicing Rights. The Seller is not in default
and is otherwise in material compliance with respect to the Seller's
obligations under the Servicing Agreements or Applicable Requirements. The
Servicing Agreements do not contain any provisions that reasonably would be
expected to impose upon the Purchaser or the Servicer any obligations in
addition to those typically imposed upon servicers of standard Investor
servicing rights. No servicer default, servicer termination event, event of
default or other default or breach has occurred by the Seller under any
Servicing Agreement, and to the Seller's knowledge, no event has occurred
which with the passage of time or the giving of notice or both would: (A)
constitute a material default or breach by the Seller under any Servicing
Agreement or under any Applicable Requirement; (B) permit termination,
modification or amendment of any such Servicing Agreement by a third party
without the consent of the Seller; (C) enable any third party to demand that
either the Seller or the Purchaser either incur any repurchase obligations
pursuant to a Servicing Agreement or provide indemnification for any amount of
losses relating to a breach of a loan representation or warranty; (D) impose
on the Seller or the Purchaser sanctions or penalties in respect of any
Servicing Agreement; or (E) rescind any 18 4124-8327-5548.26  

  

 ![](nrz2019630exh210159.jpg) 

insurance policy or reduce insurance benefits in respect of any Servicing
Agreement which would result in a material breach or trigger a default of any
obligation of the Seller under any Servicing Agreement, that in each case
would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Servicing Rights acquired by the Purchaser hereunder. With respect to each
Bankruptcy Loan, the Seller has provided the related Mortgagor with all
applicable disclosures relating to fees charged to the Mortgagor in connection
with the related bankruptcy proceeding in accordance with all Applicable
Requirements. 4.6.2 Enforceability of Mortgage Loan. Each Mortgage Loan is
evidenced by a Mortgage Note and is duly secured by a Mortgage Instrument, in
each case, on such forms and with such terms as comply with all Applicable
Requirements. Each Mortgage Note and related Mortgage Instrument is genuine
and each Mortgage Loan and related Mortgage Instrument is the legal, valid and
binding obligation of the parties thereto and the maker thereof, enforceable
in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency and similar
laws affecting generally the enforcement of creditors' rights and the
discretion of a court to grant specific performance. All parties to each such
Mortgage Note and Mortgage Instrument had legal capacity to execute such
Mortgage Note and Mortgage Instrument and each Mortgage Note and Mortgage
Instrument has been duly and properly executed by such parties. No Mortgage
Loan is subject to any rights of rescission, set- off, counterclaim or
defense, including the defense of usury, nor will the operation of any of the
terms of the related Mortgage Note or Mortgage Instrument, or the exercise of
any right thereunder, render either such Mortgage Note or such Mortgage
Instrument unenforceable by the Seller or the Purchaser, in whole or in part,
or subject to any right of rescission, set-off, counterclaim or defense,
including the defense of usury, and no such right of rescission, set-off,
counterclaim, or defense has been asserted with respect thereto. 4.6.3
Disbursement; Future Advances. The full original principal amount of each
Mortgage Loan (net of any discounts) has been fully advanced or disbursed to
the Mortgagor named therein, there is no requirement for future advances
thereunder, and any and all requirements as to completion of any on-site or
off-site improvements and as to disbursements of any escrow funds therefor
have been satisfied. All costs, fees and expenses incurred in making, closing
or recording each Mortgage Loan have been paid. Any future advances that were
made in connection with a Mortgage Loan have been consolidated with the
outstanding principal amount secured by the related Mortgage Instrument, and
the secured principal amount, as consolidated, bears a single interest rate
and single repayment term. The lien of the related Mortgage Instrument
securing the consolidated principal amount is expressly insured as having
first lien or second lien, as applicable, priority by a title insurance
policy, if applicable, meeting the standards set forth in Section 4.6.5 of
this Agreement. The consolidated principal amount does not exceed the original
principal amount of such Mortgage Loan. 4.6.4 Priority of Lien. Each Mortgage
Instrument has been duly acknowledged and recorded or sent for recordation and
is a valid and subsisting first lien or second lien, as applicable, and each
related Mortgaged Property is free and clear of all encumbrances and liens
having priority over the lien of the related Mortgage Instrument, except for
(i) liens for real estate taxes and special assessments not yet due and
payable, (ii) covenants, conditions and restrictions, rights of way, easements
and other matters of the public record as of the date of recording, acceptable
to mortgage lending institutions generally (iii) with respect to Mortgage
Instruments constituting second liens, first liens and (iv) other matters to
which like properties are commonly subject which do not 19 4124-8327-5548.26  

  

 ![](nrz2019630exh210160.jpg) 

interfere with the benefits of the security intended to be provided by such
Mortgage Instrument or the use, enjoyment, value or marketability of the
related Mortgaged Property. There are no delinquent tax or assessment liens
against any Mortgaged Property. All tax identifications and property
descriptions in each Mortgage Instrument are legally sufficient. 4.6.5 Title
Insurance. Except for any Mortgage Loan secured by a Mortgaged Property as to
which an opinion of counsel of the type customarily rendered in such state in
lieu of title insurance has been received and complies with Applicable
Requirements, a valid and enforceable title policy, or a commitment to issue
such a policy (with respect to which a title policy will be received to
replace such commitment), has been issued and is in full force and effect for
such Mortgage Loan in the amount not less than the original principal amount
of such Mortgage Loan, which title policy insures that the related Mortgage
Instrument is a valid first lien on the Mortgaged Property therein described
and that such Mortgaged Property is free and clear of all liens having
priority over the lien of such Mortgage Instrument. All provisions of such
insurance policy have been and are being complied with, such policy is in full
force and effect and all premiums due thereunder have been paid. As to each
such policy, the Seller and any Originator and Prior Servicer have complied
with all applicable provisions and all applicable statutes and regulations,
there has been no act or omission which would or may invalidate any such
policy, there has been no event or condition which may result in the
revocation, cancellation or expiration of such policy, and the insurance is
and will remain in full force and effect with respect to the related Mortgage
Loan. There are no defenses, counterclaims, or rights of set-off against the
Seller or any other Person affecting the validity or enforceability of any
such policy. 4.6.6 No Default/No Waiver. Other than with respect to borrower
payments that have not yet caused a mortgage loan to become a Delinquent Loan
or Foreclosure Loan and as disclosed to the Purchaser on the Data Tape, there
is no default, breach, violation or event of acceleration existing under any
Mortgage Loan, and no event has occurred that, with the passage of time or
with notice and the expiration of any grace or cure period, would constitute a
default, breach, violation or event of acceleration. Except as disclosed to
the Purchaser on the Data Tape, neither the Seller nor any Originator or Prior
Servicer has, except in accordance with Applicable Requirements, (i) agreed to
any material modification, extension or forbearance in connection with any
Mortgage Note or Mortgage Instrument, (ii) released, satisfied or canceled any
Mortgage Note or Mortgage Instrument in whole or in part or released any party
thereto in whole or in part, (iii) subordinated any Mortgage Instrument in
whole or in part, (iv) released any Mortgaged Property in whole or in part
from the lien of any Mortgage Instrument or (v) induced, solicited or
knowingly received any advance of funds by a party other than the Mortgagor,
directly or indirectly, for the payment of any amount required under the
Mortgage Loan. Within five (5) Business Days following the Servicing Transfer
Date, the Seller shall provide the final report to the Purchaser, with respect
to the Mortgage Loans, identifying all modifications, extensions or
forbearances previously completed or currently in process and the terms
thereof. All such modifications, extensions or forbearances are permitted
and/or required by Accepted Servicing Practices or Applicable Requirements.
4.6.7 Application of Funds. All payments received by or on behalf of the
Seller with respect to any Mortgage Loan have been remitted and properly
accounted for in compliance with and as required by Applicable Requirements
and Accepted Servicing Practices. 20 4124-8327-5548.26  

  

 ![](nrz2019630exh210161.jpg) 

4.6.8 Mortgage Insurance. Each Ginnie Mae Loan is insured by the FHA or
guaranteed by the VA or USDA. Each Mortgage Loan which is indicated by the
Seller to have FHA insurance is insured by the FHA pursuant to section 203(b)
of the National Housing Act. Each Mortgage Loan which is indicated by the
Seller to be guaranteed by the VA is guaranteed by the VA under the provisions
of Chapter 37 of Title 38 of the United States Code. Each Mortgage Loan which
is indicated by the Seller to be guaranteed by the USDA is guaranteed by the
USDA under the provisions of 7 C.F.R. Part 4279. Each Mortgage Loan, if
required by the applicable Agency, is, or prior to the Sale Date will be,
insured as to payment defaults by a policy of primary mortgage guaranty
insurance and/or pool insurance in the amount required, and by an Insurer
approved, by the Investor, and all provisions of such primary mortgage
guaranty insurance policy and/or pool insurance policy have been and are being
complied with, such policy is in full force and effect and all premiums due
thereunder have been paid. As to each mortgage insurance (including any
private mortgage insurance), pool insurance or guaranty certificate, the
Seller and any Originator and Prior Servicer have complied with applicable
provisions of the insurance or guaranty contract and Federal statutes and
regulations, all premiums or other charges due in connection with such
insurance or guaranty have been paid, there has been no act or omission which
would or may invalidate any such insurance or guaranty with respect to the
Seller, there has been no event or condition which may result in the
revocation, cancellation or expiration of such coverage, and the insurance or
guaranty is or, when issued, will be, and will remain in full force and effect
with respect to each Mortgage Loan. There are no defenses, counterclaims, or
rights of set-off against the Seller affecting the validity or enforceability
of any mortgage insurance, pool insurance or guaranty with respect to any
Mortgage Loan. All appropriate disclosures related to such mortgage insurance,
pool insurance or guaranty were accurately prepared and have been timely
provided to each Mortgagor in compliance with the Applicable Requirements and
Accepted Servicing Practices. Any Mortgage Loan guaranteed by the VA that is a
streamlined refinance loan made pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(8) and (e) (an
"Interest Rate Reduction Refinancing Loan") meets the requirements to be
treated either as (i) a safe harbor qualified mortgage, including as currently
provided in 38 CFR § 36.4300(c)(1), or (ii) to the extent permissible under
Applicable Requirements, a rebuttable presumption qualified mortgage,
including as currently provided in 38 CFR § 36.4300(c)(2). Seller acknowledges
that the net tangible benefit standards for FHA streamline refinance loans, as
appearing in the FHA Single Family Housing Policy Handbook, Section 4000.1
II.A.8.d.vi.(C)(4)(c), were updated effective September 14, 2015, and
represents and warrants that the Collateral File for any Mortgage Loan
required or intended to meet such standards contains documentation of the
determination of compliance with the standard stated therein, or in any
successor provision with similar purpose. 4.6.9 Compliance with Laws. The
Seller and, to the Seller's knowledge, each Originator and Prior Servicer have
complied with the Applicable Requirements with respect to the Mortgage Loans
and the subject matter of this Agreement, including the federal Fair Housing
Act, federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B, federal Fair
Credit Reporting Act, federal Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z, National
Flood Insurance Act of 1968, federal Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973,
federal Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and Regulation X, federal Fair
Debt Collection Practices Act, federal Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, federal
Homeowners Protection Act of 1998, and state consumer credit and usury codes
and laws in all material respects. In addition, any Mortgage Loan that is
subject to any prepayment penalties or late fee provisions fully complies with
all applicable federal, state and local laws, regulations and Applicable
Requirements and such prepayment penalties or late fees are fully enforceable
by the Purchaser 21 4124-8327-5548.26  

  

 ![](nrz2019630exh210162.jpg) 

against each Mortgagor. All parties which have had any interest in any
Mortgage Loan, whether as mortgagee, assignee, pledgee, servicer or otherwise,
are (or, during the period in which they held and disposed such interest,
were) (1) in compliance with any and all applicable licensing requirements of
the laws of the jurisdiction and state wherein the related Mortgaged Property
is located and had all requisite licenses, permits and approvals required in
such jurisdiction, and (2) either (A) organized under the laws of such state,
(B) qualified to do business in such state, (C) federal savings and loan
associations or national banks having principal offices in such state, or (D)
not doing business in such state; except where the failure to be so qualified
or in compliance or to possess such licenses, permits and approvals would have
a Material Adverse Effect. 4.6.10 Filing of Reports. The Seller has filed or
will file in a timely manner all reports required by the Investor, the
Agencies, the Insurers and other Applicable Requirements with respect to the
Mortgage Loans and the Servicing Rights. The Seller has filed (or caused to be

Servicing Transfer Date. 4.6.11 Custodial Accounts. All Custodial Accounts

appropriate Custodial Account maintained for escrow payments, and have been
retained in and disbursed from such Custodial Account in accordance with the
Applicable Requirements. In accordance with Applicable Requirements, the

any) at the time of transfer. With regard to Mortgage Loans that provide for
Mortgage Escrow Payments, the Seller has (a) computed the amount of such
payments in compliance with Applicable Requirements, (b) paid on a timely

and no Mortgage Escrow Payments or other charges or prepayments due from
Mortgagor have been capitalized under any Mortgage Instrument or the related
Mortgage Note. All funds received by the Seller in connection with the
satisfaction of Mortgage Loans, including foreclosure proceeds and insurance
proceeds from hazard losses, have been deposited in the appropriate Custodial
Account and all such funds have been applied to pay accrued interest on the
Mortgage Loans, to reduce the principal balance of the Mortgage Loans in
question, or for reimbursement of repairs to the 22 4124-8327-5548.26

knowledge, there exists no physical damage to any Mortgaged Property from

damage. With respect to any Mortgage Loan that is a Delinquent Loan for which
the related Mortgaged Property is located in a disaster area declared by any
federal or state government during the twelve (12) months prior to the Sale
Date, the Seller has (i) obtained a property inspection of the Mortgaged
Property conducted following the disaster event and has been in contact with
the Mortgagor regarding any material damage to such property and/or hardship
to the Mortgagor resulting from such disaster to the extent required by the
applicable Agency and has complied with all other disaster relief requirements
of the applicable Agency and (ii) disclosed to the Purchaser if it has been
informed of material damage to such property or hardship to the Mortgagor
resulting from such disaster. There is no proceeding pending for the total or
partial condemnation of, or eminent domain with respect to, any Mortgaged
Property, except as disclosed to the Purchaser on the Data Tape. All of the
improvements that were included for the purpose of determining the appraised
value of any Mortgaged Property lie wholly within the boundaries and building
restriction lines of such Mortgaged Property, and no improvements on adjoining
properties encroach upon such Mortgaged Property. With respect to any
Mortgaged Property, to the Seller's knowledge, the related Mortgagor is not in

violation of, and the property does not violate any standards under, any
applicable statutes, ordinances, rules, regulations, orders or decisions
relating to pollution, protection of human health or the environment

for outstanding Trailing Loan Documents, each Collateral File contains each of
the documents and instruments specified in Exhibit 1.1 attached hereto and
includes all documents required by the Investor and such other documents as
may be necessary to demonstrate compliance with Applicable Requirements. The
Mortgage Loan Documents to be delivered to Purchaser will include all
documents customarily available as of the time of delivery that are necessary
in order for Purchaser's Document Custodian(s) to finally certify and/or
recertify the Pools and Mortgage Loans, as applicable, in accordance with the
Applicable Requirements. Each Mortgage Loan included in a Pool meets all
eligibility requirements of the Investor for inclusion in such Pool. The
securities and participation certificates backed by, or payments with respect
to which are supported by, the related Pools have been issued on uniform
documents pursuant to the Applicable Requirements without any material
deviations therefrom. All books, records and accounts of the Seller and the
Seller's Document Custodian with respect to the Servicing Rights and the

properly maintained, and accurately reflect the subject matter thereof in
accordance with industry standards such that the Purchaser will not incur a
Loss after the Sale Date as a result of any deficiency in any Collateral File.
With respect to the Mortgage Loans, (i) all Pools have been initially
certified, and if created more than twelve (12) months before the Sale Date,
except as otherwise set forth on Schedule 4.6.17, finally certified, in each
case in accordance with Applicable Requirements, (ii) all Pools and Mortgage
Loans shall be, when transferred to Purchaser, eligible for final
certification, if not yet finally certified, and recertification, as
applicable, by Purchaser's Document Custodian(s), (iii) no Mortgage Loan has
been bought out of a Pool without all required approvals of the applicable
Investor, if any are required and (iv) each Pool is properly balanced and
fully funded in accordance with Applicable Requirements. 4.6.18 Good Title.
The Seller is the sole owner and holder of all legal and beneficial right,
title and interest in and to the Servicing Rights, Advances, Custodial Funds
and Collateral Files immediately prior to the conveyance thereof pursuant to
Section 2.01 of this Agreement. The sale, transfer and assignment by the
Seller to the Purchaser of the Servicing Rights and the related documents, and
the instruments required to be executed by the Seller and delivered to the
Purchaser pursuant to the Applicable Requirements, are, and will be on the
Sale Date, valid and enforceable in accordance with their terms and will
effectively vest in the Purchaser good and marketable title to the Servicing
Rights and the related documents, free and clear of any and all liens, claims,
or encumbrances. The Seller has the sole and full right and authority to sell
and assign the Servicing Rights and the related documents to the Purchaser
pursuant to this Agreement. As of the Servicing Transfer Date, the Seller is
not obligated, contractually or otherwise, to sell or offer to sell any of the
Servicing Rights and the related documents to any Person other than the
Purchaser. 4.6.19 Fraud. No misrepresentation, error or fraudulent action or
omission has occurred on the part of any Person (including without limitation
any borrower, appraiser, builder or developer, credit reporting agency,
settlement agent, realtor, broker or correspondent) in connection with the
origination and/or servicing of any Mortgage Loan, any Servicing Agreement or
the application of any insurance proceeds with respect to a Mortgage Loan or
the Mortgaged Property. 4.6.20 Representations and Warranties to Investor. All
representations and warranties made by the Seller to the applicable Investor
in connection with the Mortgage Loans and Servicing Rights in any Servicing
Agreement or otherwise are incorporated herein by reference, hereby restated,
and inure to the benefit of the Purchaser. 4.6.21 Accuracy of Data. The
characteristics of the Mortgage Loans, Servicing Rights and Advances
(including delinquency rates, escrow balances, average weighted servicing
spread, interest rates, outstanding principal balances and loan modifications)
included in the Data Tape provided to the Purchaser with respect to the Sale
Date, are true and accurate in all material respects. 4.6.22 No Recourse. None
of the Servicing Agreements nor any other agreement or understanding
applicable to any of the Mortgage Loans provides for recourse to the Seller or
Servicer for losses incurred in connection with (or any obligation to
repurchase or reimburse, indemnify or hold harmless any Person based upon) the
default or foreclosure of, or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure or
other transfer or sale of the Mortgaged Property in connection with, 25
4124-8327-5548.26  

  

 ![](nrz2019630exh210166.jpg) 

a Mortgage Loan, except insofar as such recourse is based upon a failure of
the Originator or Servicer to comply with the Applicable Requirements before
or after the Sale Date. 4.6.23 ARM Loans. With respect to each adjustable rate
Mortgage Loan, all of the terms of such Mortgage Note and Mortgage Instrument
may be enforced by the holder thereof, its successors and assigns. With
respect to each adjustable rate Mortgage Loan, the Seller has, and each Prior
Servicer has, properly and accurately and in compliance with all Applicable
Requirements and Accepted Servicing Practices (a) entered into its system all
data required to service the Mortgage Loan, (b) adjusted the mortgage interest
rate on each interest adjustment date, (c) adjusted the monthly payment on
each payment adjustment date, (d) calculated the amortization of principal and
interest on each payment adjustment date, and (e) executed and delivered any
and all notices regarding interest rate and payment adjustments. No Mortgage
Note or Mortgage Instrument related to a Mortgage Loan contains terms or
provisions that would result in negative amortization, nor does any such
Mortgage Note or Mortgage Instrument contain any term or provision whereby its
Mortgagor is permitted prospectively to convert the Mortgage Loan to a fixed-
rate mortgage loan. 4.6.24 No Buydown Provisions; No Graduated Payments or
Contingent Interests. No Mortgage Loan contains provisions pursuant to which
monthly payments are paid or partially paid with funds deposited in any
separate account established by the Seller, the Mortgagor, or anyone on behalf
of the Mortgagor, or paid by any source other than the Mortgagor nor does it
contain any other similar provisions which may constitute a "buydown"
provision. No Mortgage Loan is a graduated payment mortgage loan and no
Mortgage Loan contains a shared appreciation or other contingent interest
feature. 4.6.25 SCRA. Other than as set forth on the Data Tape, no Mortgagor
with respect to any Mortgage Loan has notified the Seller, and the Seller has
no knowledge of any relief requested or allowed to any Mortgagor under the
SCRA or similar state statute or regulation. For any Mortgage Loan disclosed
on the Data Tape as being a mortgage loan for which the related Mortgagor has
notified the Seller, or the Seller has knowledge of any relief requested or
allowed to any Mortgagor under the SCRA, there have not been improper
servicing practices or failures to comply with Applicable Requirements. 4.6.26
Credit Information; Credit Reporting. As to each consumer report (as defined
in the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Public Law 91-508) or other credit
information furnished by the Seller to the Purchaser, the Seller has full
right and authority and is not precluded by law or contract from furnishing
such information to the Purchaser. The Seller has, in its capacity as servicer
for each Mortgage Loan, caused to be fully furnished to credit reporting
agencies, in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act and its
implementing regulations, accurate and complete information (i.e., favorable
and unfavorable) on each Mortgagor. 4.6.27 Assignments of Mortgage. Each
Mortgage Loan has been duly and properly assigned to the current Investor to
the extent required by Applicable Requirements and all Assignments of Mortgage
Instruments for such Mortgage Loan required under Applicable Requirements are
included in the applicable Collateral File maintained by the Seller's Document
Custodian(s). 26 4124-8327-5548.26  

  

 ![](nrz2019630exh210167.jpg) 

4.6.28 Residential Properties. Other than with respect to any Land-and-Home
Contract, each Mortgaged Property securing a Mortgage Loan consists of a
residential dwelling satisfying Applicable Requirements. 4.6.29 Lending
Program. No Mortgage Loan was originated pursuant to a federal, state or local
"affordable housing," "community lending" or other similar mortgage loan
program. 4.6.30 Mortgagors. For each Mortgage Loan, the Seller or the
Originator verified the identity of the Mortgagor using methods that comply
with Applicable Requirements. To the Seller's knowledge, no Mortgagor is, or
at any time on or after the date the related Mortgage Note was executed has
been, identified by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States
Department of Treasury as a specially designated national or blocked person.
4.6.31 No Additional Collateral. The Mortgage Note is not and has not been
secured by any collateral other than the lien of the corresponding Mortgage
Instrument. 4.6.32 Deeds of Trust. In the event the Mortgage Instrument
constitutes a deed of trust, a trustee, duly qualified under applicable law to
serve as such, has been properly designated and currently so serves and is
named in the Mortgage Instrument, and no fees or expenses are or will become
payable by the Purchaser, or the Investor or the applicable Agencies, or their
respective successors and assigns to the trustee under the deed of trust,
other than in connection with a trustee's sale after default by the Mortgagor.
4.6.33 Customary Provisions. The Mortgage Loan Documents contain customary and
enforceable provisions that render the rights and remedies of the holder
thereof adequate for the realization against the Mortgaged Property of the
material benefits of the security provided thereby, including, (i) in the case
of a Mortgage Instrument designated as a deed of trust, by trustee's sale and
(ii) with respect to a Mortgage Instrument related to a Mortgage Loan, by
judicial foreclosure. There is no homestead or other exemption available to a
Mortgagor that would prevent the sale of the Mortgaged Property by trustee's
sale or the foreclosure of the Mortgage Instrument. 4.6.34 Casualty Insurance
Proceeds. No casualty insurance proceeds for property damage have been used to
reduce Mortgage Loan balances or for any other purpose, other than the making
of repairs to the Mortgaged Property and other than with the consent of the
applicable Insurer providing mortgage insurance, to the extent that such
consent was required under the Applicable Requirements. Additionally, there
are no uninsured casualty losses or casualty losses where coinsurance has been
(and the Seller has no reason to believe, will be) claimed by an Insurer or
where the loss, exclusive of contents, is greater than the recovery, less
actual expenses incurred in such recovery from the Insurer. 4.6.35
Condominiums and Planned Unit Developments. (a) If the Mortgaged Property is
an individual unit in a condominium project or an individual unit in a planned
unit development (a "Unit"), then the common elements and property of the
condominium project or the common areas and property of the planned unit
development are insured against loss by fire, hazards of extended coverage,
flood and such other hazards as required by Applicable Requirements.
Additionally, without limiting 27 4124-8327-5548.26  

  

 ![](nrz2019630exh210168.jpg) 

the foregoing, each required insurance policy is in a form and amount, and is
issued by an Insurer, that is acceptable under Applicable Requirements with
respect to the condominium project or planned unit development. Additionally,
if the Mortgaged Property is a Unit, then general liability, fidelity and all
other insurance required by Applicable Requirements is maintained in
connection with the condominium project or planned unit development, and each
required insurance policy is in a form and amount, and is issued by an
Insurer, that is acceptable under Applicable Requirements with respect to the
condominium project or planned unit development. All such insurance policies
are in full force and effect, and all premiums with respect to such policies
have been paid. Each insurance policy required includes the following special
endorsements, to the extent required by the Applicable Requirements: (b)
Advance written notice will be given in writing to the mortgagee, its
successors and/or assigns in the event the policy is to be canceled, no
earlier than the time specified in the Applicable Requirements. (c) The
mortgagee, its successors and/or assigns, or such other appropriate Persons
specified by the Applicable Requirements, are named in the mortgagee clause or
loss payment clause, requiring any loss be paid to the mortgagee, its
successors and/or assigns, or such other appropriate Persons. This clause must
be written into the policy and provide that in the event of loss, the interest
of the mortgagee as successor in interest is not impaired by an act or neglect
of the Mortgagor, any foreclosure, notice of sale or any change in ownership
of the Mortgaged Property. The Seller has provided the appropriate Insurer
with such notice, or has obtained such consent, as is necessary to designate
the appropriate Persons required by the Applicable Requirements as loss payee
on each such insurance policy. 4.6.36 Environmental Issues. No Mortgaged
Property violates and has been in violation of any applicable statutes,
ordinances, rules, regulations, orders or decisions with regard to pollutants
or hazardous or toxic substances, including without limitation the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, Federal
Water Foliation Control Act, Clean Air Act, and Toxic Substances Control Act,
as such laws are amended and supplemented from time to time and any similar
federal, state or local statutes, rules and regulations. 4.6.37 Other
Agreements. Other than the consent order identified on Schedule 4.6.37, the
Seller is not a party to or subject to any agreement, stipulation, conditional
approval, memorandum of understanding, notice of determination, consent
decree, advisory settlement, compromise, litigation or other agreement or
understanding with any Agency (including without limitation the Department of
Housing and Urban Development), Investor, court, Governmental Authority or
body, or other Person which (i) seeks to modify or clarify or has the effect
of modifying or clarifying any of the terms of the Applicable Requirements
(solely with respect to the Servicing Rights and/or the Mortgage Loans), (ii)
otherwise affects (A) the Seller's or the Purchaser's servicing obligations
and practices (solely with respect to the Servicing Rights and/or the Mortgage
Loans) including, but not limited to, escrow practices and except as otherwise
addressed in this Agreement, (B) the Purchaser's rights and duties set forth
in this Agreement, including with respect to the Servicing Rights being
acquired by the Purchaser, or (C) the economic value of the Servicing Rights
being acquired by the Purchaser. 28 4124-8327-5548.26

4.6.38 Repurchase; Indemnification Agreements. As of the Sale Date, and other
than optional buyouts for any Mortgage Loans, there is no Mortgage Loan for

this Agreement. No Mortgage Loan is subject to any indemnification agreement
or an agreement for the submission of claims with an Agency or a repurchase or

rate" or "total points and fees" payable by the borrower that exceeds the
applicable thresholds defined under HOEPA and its implementing regulations,
including 12 C.F.R. § 1026.32(a)(1)(i) and (ii). No Mortgage Loan is a "high
cost" mortgage loan, "covered" mortgage loan, "high risk home" mortgage loan,
or "predatory" mortgage loan or any other comparable term, no matter how
defined under any federal, state or local law, provided that this
determination shall be made with respect to the relevant state or local law,
regardless of the effect of any available federal preemption, other than
exemptions specifically provided for in the relevant state or local law. No
Mortgage Loan is subject to any comparable federal, state or local statutes or
regulations, or any other statute or regulation providing for heightened
regulatory scrutiny, assignee liability to holders of such mortgage loans or
additional legal liability for mortgage loans having high interest rates,
points and/or fees. No Mortgage Loan is a High Cost Loan or Covered Loan, as
applicable (as such terms are defined in the current Standard and Poor's LEVELS®
Glossary Revised, Appendix E). 4.6.40 Texas Refinance Mortgage Loans. Each
Mortgage Loan originated in the state of Texas pursuant to Article XVI,
Section 50(a)(6) of the Texas Constitution (a "Texas Refinance Loan") has been
originated in full compliance with the provisions of Article XVI, Section
50(a)(6) of the Texas Constitution, Texas Civil Statutes and Texas Finance

quality control procedures designed to verify, on a regular basis, the
existence and accuracy of the legal documents, credit documents and property
appraisals relating to the Mortgage Loans that complies in all respects with
the Applicable Requirements. The program is designed to evaluate and monitor
the overall quality of the Seller's loan origination activities. The program

persons. Except as set forth in Schedule 4.07(a), within the two (2) years
immediately preceding the Sale Date, Seller's internal quality control
procedures and audits have not revealed a failure to comply with Applicable
Requirements that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on all or any portion of the Servicing Rights or on Seller's ability to
perform its obligations under this Agreement, except for audits which Seller
is prohibited by Applicable Requirements from disclosing on such Schedule
4.07(a). (b) Except as set forth in Schedule 4.07(b), within the two (2) year
immediately preceding the Sale Date, neither Seller nor any Originator or

comply with Applicable Requirements that could have a Material Adverse Effect
on the Servicing Rights being purchased by Purchaser hereunder, the Mortgage
Loans, the performance by Seller of its obligations (or by Purchaser of its
future obligations) under the Applicable Requirements, or the performance by
Seller of its obligations under this Agreement, except for audits which Seller
is prohibited by Applicable Requirements from disclosing on such Schedule
4.07(b). Section 4.08 Agency Set-off Rights. Seller has no actual notice,
including any notice received from any Agency, or any reason to believe, that,
other than in the normal course of Seller's business, any circumstances exist
that would result in Seller being liable to such Agency for any amount due
which would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect by reason
of: (i) any breach of servicing obligations or breach of mortgage selling
warranty to such Agency under servicing agreements relating to Seller's entire
servicing portfolio for such Agency (including any unmet mortgage repurchase
obligation), (ii) any unperformed obligation with respect to mortgage loans
that Seller is servicing for such Agency under the regular servicing option or
other mortgages subject to recourse agreements, (iii) any loss or damage to
such Agency by reason of any inability to transfer to a purchaser of the

Agency. Section 4.09 Initial Servicing Rights. The Servicing Rights being sold

Section 11.15 Tax Treatment of Sales of Servicing Rights. The Parties agree
that the sale of the Servicing Rights pursuant to this Agreement shall be
characterized as a true sale for tax purposes, and neither Party shall take
any position on any tax return or tax filing inconsistent therewith. In the
event, however, that it were to be determined that the transactions evidenced
hereby constitute a loan and not a purchase and sale, this Agreement
constitutes a security agreement under applicable law, the Seller hereby
grants to the Purchaser a first priority perfected security interest in all of
the Seller's right, title and interest, whether now owned or hereafter
acquired, in, to and under the Servicing Rights to secure the Seller's
obligations hereunder and under any agreement, document or instrument
delivered in connection with this Agreement, provided that such security
interest shall be subject and subordinate to all rights, powers and
prerogatives retained or reserved by the applicable Investors. The Seller
authorizes and agrees to cooperate with the Purchaser, and the Purchaser may
file, at the expense of the Purchaser, any financing statements (and
continuation statements and amendments to such financing statements) with
respect to the Servicing Rights, now existing and hereafter created, meeting
the requirements of applicable law in such manner and in such jurisdictions as
are necessary to perfect, and maintain perfection of, the rights and interests
of the Purchaser in and to the Servicing Rights. Section 11.16 Counterparts.
This Agreement may be executed simultaneously in any number of counterparts.
Each counterpart shall be deemed to be an original, and all such counterparts
shall constitute one and the same instrument. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement in Portable Document Format
(PDF), any electronic signature complying with the U.S. federal ESIGN Act of

Agreement. Section 11.17 Third Party Beneficiaries. Except for each Person
indicated in Sections 9.01 and 9.02, this Agreement is for the sole benefit of
the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns, and nothing
herein expressed or implied gives or may be construed to give to any Person,
other than the Parties and such respective successors and permitted assigns,
any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, except as set forth above, the Seller
and the Purchaser acknowledge and agree that Mortgagors are not third-party
beneficiaries of this Agreement. Section 11.18 Severability. Any part or
provision of this Agreement which is prohibited or which is held to be void or
unenforceable shall be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or
unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof. Any
part or provision of this Agreement which is prohibited or unenforceable or is
held to be void or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall be ineffective, as
to such jurisdiction, to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability
without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition
or unenforceability in any jurisdiction as to any Asset shall not invalidate
or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. To the
extent permitted by applicable law, the Parties hereto waive any provision of
law which prohibits or renders void or unenforceable any provision hereof.

Servicer's receipt of such supporting documentation and invoices, with respect
to such Advances or other amounts necessary for the Purchaser to determine
whether such Advances or other amounts are required or advisable to be paid
and are reimbursable in accordance with Applicable Requirements. If the
Purchaser, in its sole and reasonable discretion, elects to make an Advance or

Trust, or Investor, or the Purchaser, as applicable. All Custodial Accounts

such deficiency in a manner to ensure payment of such escrowed items prior to
the time at which a penalty for late payment would be assessed; provided,
however, that the Purchaser shall be responsible for any documented fees,
costs, expenses or penalties incurred by the Servicer as a result of the
Purchaser failing, after receiving notice from the Servicer pursuant to this
Section 2.03, to provide sufficient funds to cover any deficiency in the
applicable Escrow Accounts or to provide such funds with enough time to
prevent any penalty from being assessed or any fees being incurred by the
Servicer. Any payments made by the Servicer pursuant to this section shall be

applicable, the Ancillary Fees (other than any interest received on funds
deposited in the Custodial Accounts) held relating to the Servicing Rights
received with respect to the applicable Assets and Servicing Rights prior to
each Servicing Transfer Date. Starting in the month immediately following the
Sale Date, the Servicer shall remit to the Purchaser the interest received on
funds deposited in the Custodial Accounts monthly on the last Business Day of
the first week of each month during the Interim Servicing Period, or on such
other date as mutually agreed to by the parties hereto. Custodial Funds held

providing such funds to the Purchaser, the Servicer shall provide supporting
reports that reflect the Servicing Fee less the Interim Servicing Fee and
other amounts pursuant to Section 2.07 of this Agreement due to the Servicer
and the net amount due to the Purchaser. During the Interim Servicing Period,
the Servicer shall hold all such net Servicing Fees in trust for the benefit
of the Purchaser. In the event the Servicing Fee does not equal the sum of the
Interim Servicing Fee, the Servicer may elect to send an invoice to the
Purchaser for the unpaid amount due the Servicer, which invoice shall be due
and payable by the Purchaser within fifteen (15) days of the Purchaser's
receipt of such invoice. (d) Advances. To the extent that the Servicer is
entitled to reimbursement pursuant to this Agreement, the Asset Purchase

invoices with respect to such Advances necessary for the Purchaser to
determine that such Advances are reimbursable in accordance with Applicable
Requirements. Section 2.08. Litigation. (a) Notification to Counsel. With

agreed to represent the Purchaser in the Pending Bankruptcy Proceeding at the
Purchaser's request and sole cost and expense), and (iii) file pleadings and
other appropriate documents to institute proceedings to remove the Servicer as

that it is assuming such foreclosure action and the Purchaser shall remove the
Servicer as a party in any such foreclosure proceeding and substitute the
Purchaser as the real party in interest to the extent permitted by such court
as soon as reasonably practicable after the related Servicing Transfer Date.
To the extent applicable, the Servicer shall reasonably cooperate with the
Purchaser or its designee in connection with any such foreclosure as well as
to minimize disruptions to foreclosures in process as of the applicable
Servicing Transfer Date as a result of the transfer of servicing to the
Purchaser or its designee, including executing such documentation as the
Purchaser may reasonably require to substitute the Purchaser as plaintiff in
any foreclosure actions at the Purchaser's expense within thirty (30) days of

thirty (30) day limitation shall not apply in respect of any Asset that is
subject to a bankruptcy proceeding or any contested foreclosure. Section 2.09.

servicer, shall terminate at the latest to occur of the expiration of the
Interim Servicing Period and the date on which servicing is actually

to the MSRPA, the Servicer shall prepare, execute and deliver any and all
documents and other instruments, place in the Purchaser's possession all Asset
Files, and do or accomplish all other acts or things necessary or appropriate

agrees to cooperate with the Purchaser and any successor servicer in effecting
the termination of the Servicer's responsibilities hereunder as interim
servicer, including, without limitation, the transfer to such successor for
administration by it of all amounts received after the Commencement Date with

Subservicer. The Servicer may, with the Purchaser's prior written consent it

provisions of any such subservicing agreement, any of the provisions in this
Agreement or the MSRPA relating to the agreements or arrangements between the
Servicer and the Purchaser or reference to actions taken through the Servicer
or otherwise, the Servicer shall remain obligated and liable to the Purchaser
and its successors and assigns for the servicing and administration of the
Assets in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the MSRPA
without diminution of such obligation or liability by virtue of any such
subservicing agreement. All actions of each subservicer performed pursuant to

Exhibit A Advance Guidelines Overview: This memo addresses the funding of
corporate and escrow advances during the Interim Servicing Agreement ("ISA")
period. While both the Purchaser and Seller ("Ditech" or "the company") have
conceptual agreement the following provides a summary level outline of the
proposed process. General Procedure: . Ditech shall provide the Purchaser
written notice of the advance amounts required to be deposited in such
Account(s) so that the Account(s) will have funds on deposit at least equal to
the amount required to be paid to the applicable Investor, Attorney firm
and/or applicable servicer provider. . The company shall provide the Purchaser
written notice (via e-mail) as far in advance of the required funding as is
possible and no less than two (2) Business Days, unless indicated otherwise
below, prior to the required funding date, at which time the Purchaser will
wire the appropriate funds into the designated bank account(s). . As
recoveries are received they will be netted against the advance requirement.
Corporate Advances: . The company currently operates its corporate advance
expense payment processing on a 30-calendar day schedule. Therefore, the
company will have a forward view of those expenses which will be paid on a
rolling 30 calendar day basis. The company will provide Purchaser with a
report monthly reflecting the corporate advances to be paid over the next 30
days. The report will be provided monthly by the 5th business day. . On a
weekly basis the company will send a report of the invoices that were reviewed
and approved to be paid the following week. The report will be provided by end
of day Tuesday with funds to be remitted by Purchaser as soon as reasonably
possible but no later than by mid-day Friday. . The company will fully
cooperate with Purchaser to file same day financing DDAR reports so that the
Purchaser can obtain same day financing of such advances. Escrow Advances: A-1

(including UCC filings) necessary in any jurisdiction to perfect the transfers
and assignments herein contemplated and to preserve the lien created by this

of all encumbrances and liens having priority over the lien of the related
Mortgage Instrument, except for (i) liens for real estate taxes and special
assessments not yet due and payable, (ii) covenants, conditions and
restrictions, rights of way, easements and other matters of the public record
as of the date of recording, acceptable to mortgage lending institutions
generally and (iii) other matters to which like properties are commonly

marketability of the related Mortgaged Property. There are no delinquent tax
or assessment liens against any Mortgaged Property. All tax identifications
and property descriptions in each Mortgage Instrument are legally sufficient.
Title Insurance. Except for any Mortgage Loan secured by a Mortgaged Property
as to which an opinion of counsel of the type customarily rendered in such
state in lieu of title insurance has been received and complies with
Applicable Requirements, a valid and enforceable title policy, or a commitment
to issue such a policy (with respect to which a title policy will be received
to replace such commitment), has been issued and is in full force and effect
for such Mortgage Loan in the amount not less than the original principal
amount of such Mortgage Loan, which title policy insures that the related
Mortgage Instrument is a valid first lien on the Mortgaged Property therein
described and that such Mortgaged Property is free and clear of all liens
having priority over the lien of such Mortgage Instrument. All provisions of
such insurance policy have been and are being complied with, such policy is in
full force and effect and all premiums due thereunder have been paid. As to

complied with all applicable provisions and all applicable statutes and
regulations, there has been no act or omission which would or may invalidate
any such policy, there has been no event or condition which may result in the
revocation, cancellation or expiration of such policy, and the insurance is

Loan. There are no defenses, counterclaims, or rights of set-off against the
Seller or any other Person affecting the validity or enforceability of any
such policy. No Fraud. No misrepresentation, error or fraudulent action or
omission has occurred on the part of any Person (including without limitation
any borrower, appraiser, builder or developer, credit reporting agency,
settlement agent, realtor, broker or correspondent) in connection with the

enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be
limited by laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and
by general principles of equity. Valid Security Interest; No Materialmen's
Liens. The MH Contract creates a valid and enforceable perfected first
priority security interest in favor of Seller in the Manufactured Home covered
thereby as security for payment of the applicable principal balance of the
related loan and contains customary and enforceable provisions such as to
render the rights and remedies of the holder thereof adequate for the
realization against the collateral of the benefits of the security (except as
the enforceability of such provisions may be limited by laws affecting
creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity). As of the
date hereof, Purchaser will own each MH Contract free of any lien (other than
any liens imposed by Purchaser) and will have a valid and enforceable first
priority security interest in each Manufactured Home covered thereby. As of
the date hereof, there are no liens or claims which have been filed for work,
labor or materials affecting the Manufactured Home securing the MH Contract
which are or may be liens prior to, or equal or coordinate with, the lien of
the MH Contract. Land-and-Home Contracts. With respect to any Land-and-Home
Contracts, each Mortgage is a valid and enforceable perfected first lien in
favor of the Seller on real property securing the amount owed by the Mortgagor
under the related Land-and- Home Contract subject only to (i) any liens
imposed by the Purchaser, (ii) the lien of current real property taxes and
assessments, (iii) covenants, conditions and restrictions, rights of way,
easements and other matters of public record as of the date of recording of
such Mortgage, such exceptions appearing of record being acceptable to
mortgage lending institutions generally in the area wherein the property
subject to the Mortgage is located or specifically reflected in the appraisal
obtained in connection with the origination of the related Land-and-Home
Contract and (iv) other matters to which like properties are commonly subject
which do not materially interfere with the benefits of the security intended
to be provided by such Mortgage. Other than as indicated in the related List
of Contracts, the terms of the Mortgage and the Mortgage Note have not been
waived, altered, or modified in any material respect, except by a written
instrument that has been recorded, if necessary, and that is a part of the
Asset File; provided, however, that under certain circumstances where the
modification, waiver or alteration of the terms of such Mortgage or Mortgage
Note has been effected pursuant to a written instrument that is favorable to
the Mortgagor, such written instrument may or may not have been executed by
the related Mortgagor. (o) With respect to each Second Lien Mortgage Loan, the
Seller represents and warrants to the Purchaser as of the Sale Date: 17

each Mortgage Instrument are legally sufficient. (p) With respect to each

loan, pledge, charge, claim or security interest and is the sole owner thereof
with full right to transfer the Deficiency Amount to Purchaser. Deficiency

the Mortgage Instruments and Deficiency Amounts are based upon its own
independent expert evaluations of the Asset Files and other materials made
available by Seller and deemed relevant by Purchaser and its agents. Purchaser
has not relied in entering into this Agreement upon any oral or written
information from Seller (with the exception of the List of Mortgage
Instruments), or any of its respective employees, affiliates, agents or
representatives, other than the representations and warranties of Seller
contained herein. Purchaser further acknowledges that no employee or

Parties shall not be liable hereunder with respect to any disclosure to the
extent such disclosure is required by any applicable Law or Decree, including
applicable rules of any securities exchange, or requested or required by any

required by any applicable Law or Decree to disclose any such non-public
information, such Party shall, (i) to the extent permissible by such
applicable Law or Decree and practicable, provide the other Parties with
prompt written notice of such requirement, (ii) disclose only that information
that is required by such applicable Law or Decree and (iii) use commercially
reasonable efforts to preserve the confidentiality of such non-public

other Party's sole cost and expense). Section 4.3 Securitization Cooperation.
For a period of six (6) months after the Sale Date, the Seller shall
reasonably cooperate with the Purchaser and use commercially reasonable

or appropriate that is in the possession or control of the Seller and which

Seller acknowledges (a) that in connection with such a securitization, the
Purchaser has the right to engage a master servicer or trustee to determine
the allocation of payments to and make remittances to the noteholders or
certificateholders, and (b) that its fees and benefits, the collection
procedures, and the deposit of such collections, shall be subject to any such
securitization and shall be governed by the terms of the related
securitization documents; provided, however, that such acknowledgements shall
not increase or expand the Seller's obligations under this Agreement or with
respect to the Mortgage Instruments or require any representations, warranties
or indemnities in connection therewith. Notwithstanding the foregoing, under

warranties or indemnities with respect to any servicing information regarding

agreement, or with respect to the Mortgage Instruments. Section 4.4 CFPB

Purchaser or its designee, the following provisions of this Section 4.5 apply
to any such transfer of servicing. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions
of this Section 4.5 apply only to Assets in loss mitigation or where a loss
mitigation application is pending (e.g., an Asset for which a permanent
modification was consummated more than sixty (60) days prior to the date
scheduled for any transfer of servicing is not a loan in loss mitigation).
Further, all information and documentation required under this Section 4.5
shall be in addition to any other information and documentation required to be
delivered to Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement, the Transfer Instructions
and Applicable Requirements. (a) With respect to each Servicing Transfer Date,

in conformity with the terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement. (d)
The Seller and the Purchaser shall cooperate with and assist each other, as
reasonably requested, in completing any Loss Mitigation that was in process as
of the applicable Servicing Transfer Date. The Purchaser shall engage in
quality control work to validate that Loss Mitigation Information matches the
images, data and documents received from the Seller. The Purchaser shall make
reasonable efforts to identify missing or inaccurate Loss Mitigation

4165-7142-5052.16  

  

 ![](nrz2019630exh210317.jpg) 

reviews of any vendor and/or service provider performing servicing activities
or services with respect to the Assets during the Interim Servicing Period,
which supervision and review shall be completed in accordance with Applicable
Requirements, the Servicing Agreements and with Servicer's vendor management
policies and procedures. Servicer shall notify Purchaser promptly of any
material deficiencies of any such vendor or any material violations of any
Applicable Requirements by any such vendor relating to such activities or
services. The use by Servicer of any vendor shall not relieve Servicer of its

not, without the prior written consent of the Purchaser, (i) modify any Asset

within a commercially reasonable time period, a written notice to the
Purchaser of any modification or short sale request received by the Servicer.
(c) During the Interim Servicing Period, the Servicer shall collect all
payments due, including past due payments, on each of the Assets when the same
shall become due and payable and shall take care in ascertaining and
estimating Escrow Payments and all other charges that will become due and
payable with respect to the Assets and each related Mortgaged Property. (d)
During the Interim Servicing Period, the Purchaser shall be solely responsible
for making any and all Advances and other payments required to be made in
connection with the Assets. During the Interim Servicing Period, the Servicer
may, from its own funds, choose to but shall not be required to advance any
amounts relating to the servicing of the Assets (including any and all
Advances, escrow amounts, and litigation-related expenses) or make any other
out-of-pocket payments, required to be made pursuant to this Agreement, the
Guides or the Servicing Agreements. With respect to each Asset, upon gaining
knowledge of the need to pay any Advance or other amount either (i) required
to be paid pursuant to the applicable Guide or Servicing Agreement or (ii)
that is advisable to be paid, as determined at the Servicer's sole and
reasonable discretion, pursuant to Accepted Servicing Practices to preserve
the value of such Asset or the Servicing Rights related to such Asset, the
Servicer may, in its sole discretion, pay such Advances or other amounts, or
shall promptly notify the Purchaser of any such Advances or other amounts
after gaining knowledge of the need or advisability of paying such amounts, in
accordance with the guidelines set forth on Exhibit A attached hereto. In
accordance with the guidelines attached hereto as Exhibit A, the Servicer
shall promptly provide a loan level report and all 4 732543373 19621021
4165-7142-5052.16  

  

 ![](nrz2019630exh210318.jpg) 

reasonably necessary supporting documentation and invoices, upon the
Servicer's receipt of such supporting documentation and invoices, with respect
to such Advances or other amounts necessary for the Purchaser to determine
whether such Advances or other amounts are required or advisable to be paid
and are reimbursable in accordance with Applicable Requirements. If the
Purchaser, in its sole and reasonable discretion, elects to make an Advance or
other payment after receiving notice of the need or advisability thereof from
the Seller under this Section 2.01(d), then the Purchaser shall, in accordance
with the guidelines attached hereto as Exhibit A and in no event no less than
one (1) Business Day before such Advance or other payment is due, deposit the
funds necessary to make such Advance in the Custodial Account or other account
identified by the Servicer via wire transfer in immediately available funds.
If the Purchaser deposits the funds necessary to make any such Advances, the
Servicer shall use such funds to make the related Advances in accordance with
Applicable Requirements, any instructions from the Purchaser and the
guidelines set forth on Exhibit A attached hereto. Any payments or Advances
made by the Servicer from its own funds pursuant to this section shall be
reimbursable in accordance with Section 2.07(d) below. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Servicer shall be required to give notice to the Purchaser of any
amounts pursuant to this Section 2.01 only to the extent that the Servicer has
knowledge of such amounts. Section 2.02. Custodial Accounts. During the term
of this Agreement, with respect to each Asset hereunder, the Servicer shall
maintain all collections and funds in the Custodial Accounts in accordance
with Applicable Requirements pursuant to the MSRPA and MIPA, as applicable. As
provided in Section 2.01, the Purchaser shall be responsible for all Advances
required in connection with the Assets during the term of this Agreement. The
Servicer shall remit to the Custodial Accounts, pursuant to the Applicable
Requirements, Mortgage Loan Payments collected by Servicer. The Servicer
acknowledges that the Escrow Accounts, Custodial Accounts and any collections
it receives on the Assets during the term of this Agreement (except for
Ancillary Fees) are for the account of the applicable borrower, Securitization
Trust, or Investor, or the Purchaser, as applicable. All Custodial Accounts
shall be maintained by and carried in the records of Servicer in trust for the
Purchaser, the applicable Agency, securitization trust or trustee and/or
Mortgagors, as applicable, except as may otherwise be required by Applicable
Requirements. Section 2.03. Escrow Accounts. The Servicer shall ensure that an
escrow account is established or maintained for each Asset (each, an "Escrow
Account" and, collectively, the "Escrow Account"), as necessary or applicable,
in accordance with Applicable Requirements and Accepted Servicing Practices.
The Servicer shall be responsible for all matters relating to the
administration of the Escrow Accounts, including without limitation, (i) the
application of funds to a borrower's Escrow Account, (ii) the disbursement of
funds to the proper parties for escrowed items when due, (iii) payment of
interest on funds deposited into such Escrow Accounts to the extent required
by applicable law, (iv) performance of an annual escrow analysis if
applicable, and (v) maintenance of all records with respect to such Escrow
Accounts, in accordance with Accepted Servicing Practices. During the Interim
Servicing Period, if adequate funds are not available in the Escrow Account at
the Asset level to pay escrowed items when due, the Servicer may, in its sole
discretion, advance from its own funds sufficient funds to cover any such
deficiency, or shall promptly, after gaining knowledge of such deficiency,
notify the Purchaser of the amount of such deficient funds and the Purchaser
shall promptly pay sufficient funds to cover any 5 732543373 19621021
4165-7142-5052.16  

  

 ![](nrz2019630exh210319.jpg) 

such deficiency in a manner to ensure payment of such escrowed items prior to
the time at which a penalty for late payment would be assessed; provided,
however, that the Purchaser shall be responsible for any documented fees,
costs, expenses or penalties incurred by the Servicer as a result of the
Purchaser failing, after receiving notice from the Servicer pursuant to this
Section 2.03, to provide sufficient funds to cover any deficiency in the
applicable Escrow Accounts or to provide such funds with enough time to
prevent any penalty from being assessed or any fees being incurred by the
Servicer. Any payments made by the Servicer pursuant to this section shall be
reimbursable in accordance with Section 2.07(d) below. Section 2.04.
Maintenance of Fidelity Bond and Errors and Omissions Insurance. The Servicer
shall maintain with responsible companies a blanket fidelity bond and an
errors and omissions insurance policy, with broad coverage on all officers,
employees or other persons acting in any capacity that requires such persons

that it is assuming such foreclosure action and the Purchaser shall remove the

servicer, shall terminate at the latest to occur of the expiration of the

to the MSRPA, the Servicer shall prepare, execute and deliver any and all
documents and other instruments, place in the Purchaser's possession all Asset
Files, and do or accomplish all other acts or things necessary or appropriate

agrees to cooperate with the Purchaser and any successor servicer in effecting
the termination of the Servicer's responsibilities hereunder as interim
servicer, including, without limitation, the transfer to such successor for
administration by it of all amounts received after the Commencement Date with

provisions of any such subservicing agreement, any of the provisions in this
Agreement or the MSRPA relating to the agreements or arrangements between the
Servicer and the Purchaser or reference to actions taken through the Servicer
or otherwise, the Servicer shall remain obligated and liable to the Purchaser
and its successors and assigns for the servicing and administration of the
Assets in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the MSRPA
without diminution of such obligation or liability by virtue of any such
subservicing agreement. All actions of each subservicer performed pursuant to

Exhibit A Advance Guidelines Overview: This memo addresses the funding of
corporate and escrow advances during the Interim Servicing Agreement ("ISA")
period. While both the Purchaser and Seller ("Ditech" or "the company") have
conceptual agreement the following provides a summary level outline of the
proposed process. General Procedure: . Ditech shall provide the Purchaser
written notice of the advance amounts required to be deposited in such
Account(s) so that the Account(s) will have funds on deposit at least equal to
the amount required to be paid to the applicable Investor, Attorney firm
and/or applicable servicer provider. . The company shall provide the Purchaser
written notice (via e-mail) as far in advance of the required funding as is
possible and no less than two (2) Business Days, unless indicated otherwise
below, prior to the required funding date, at which time the Purchaser will
wire the appropriate funds into the designated bank account(s). . As
recoveries are received they will be netted against the advance requirement.
Corporate Advances: . The company currently operates its corporate advance
expense payment processing on a 30-calendar day schedule. Therefore, the
company will have a forward view of those expenses which will be paid on a
rolling 30 calendar day basis. The company will provide Purchaser with a
report monthly reflecting the corporate advances to be paid over the next 30
days. The report will be provided monthly by the 5th business day. . On a
weekly basis the company will send a report of the invoices that were reviewed
and approved to be paid the following week. The report will be provided by end
of day Tuesday with funds to be remitted by Purchaser as soon as reasonably
possible but no later than by mid-day Friday. . The company will fully
cooperate with Purchaser to file same day financing DDAR reports so that the
Purchaser can obtain same day financing of such advances. Escrow Advances: A-1  

  

 ![](nrz2019630exh210330.jpg) 

. Due to the unpredictability of tax disbursements, the company receives a
daily report of pending TAR disbursements from its tax service vendor
CoreLogic. As an example, see the table below which was transmitted to Ditech
from CoreLogic on Mon 6/3/2019 10:39 AM. PAY DATE 06/05/19 STATE LIEN COUNT

No later than the 15th day of each month (or the following business day if the
15th falls on a non-work day), an estimate of TandI advances for the following
month will be provided by the company to the Purchaser. A-2  

  

 ![](nrz2019630exh210331.jpg) 

. To the extent permissible, the company will adjust the timing of TAR
disbursements to satisfy Purchaser's request, subject to the limitations from
its tax service provider and the local taxing authorities. . The company will
have an estimate of the required funds necessary for the pending disbursement,
and will fully cooperate with the Purchaser so that the Purchaser can file
same day financing through filing advance financing DDARs as is conducted in
the current DDAR process between the company and Purchaser. . On a daily
basis, or when received (on days when no TAR is pending), the company will
send a copy of the report received from CoreLogic (or have Purchaser added to
current distribution list) as soon as reasonably possible. . As soon as
reasonably possible after the receipt of a TAR report, the company will
provide an estimate of the advance amount for the associated TAR disbursement.
Available customer escrow funds will be applied per applicable requirements
and the estimated advance amount will be the net of the required disbursement
and available escrow funds. . The Purchaser will review and wire the requested
amount to the company by the next business day. . The company will refund all
surplus funds provided by the Purchaser by 4 PM on the day the final advance
balance is known or the estimated advance balance is reduced. . On a daily
basis, the company can provide a copy of the P111 Escrow advance and repay
daily report (see example below) A-3

EXHIBIT E TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT This Transition Services Agreement
(this "Agreement") is entered into as of [●], 2019 (the "Effective Date"), by
and between Ditech Holding Corporation, a Maryland corporation ("Seller"), and
New Residential Investment Corp., a Delaware corporation, ("Buyer"). Seller
and Buyer are each individually referred to herein as a "Party" and are
collectively herein referred to as "Parties." Certain terms are defined below,
other terms are defined in Annex I (Defined Terms) and all other capitalized
terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed
to such terms in that certain Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of June 17,
2019, by and among Seller, certain of its subsidiaries signatory thereto and
Buyer (the "Purchase Agreement"). RECITALS WHEREAS, this Agreement constitutes
the "Transition Services Agreement" referred to in the Purchase Agreement and
is a "Related Agreement" pursuant to the Purchase Agreement; and WHEREAS, in
connection with the Purchase Agreement, the Parties desire to enter into this
Agreement to set forth the terms and conditions pursuant to which each Party
shall provide or cause to be provided Services to the other Party and its
Affiliates for a period from and after the Effective Date. NOW, THEREFORE, in
consideration of the promises and covenants hereinafter contained, in
consideration of the representations, warranties and covenants contained in
the Purchase Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties desire
to enter into this Agreement on the terms set forth herein. Intending to be
legally bound, the Parties agree as follows: ARTICLE I SERVICES Section 1.1
Services to be Provided. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, during the Service Period, Seller shall provide, or cause its
Affiliates or a Vendor contracted by Seller pursuant to Section 1.7 to
provide, to Buyer and its Affiliates, the services described on Schedule A-1
attached hereto (each, a "Seller Service", and collectively, the "Seller
Services"). Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, during the
Service Period, Buyer shall provide, or cause its Affiliates or a Vendor
contracted by Buyer pursuant to Section 1.7 to provide, to Seller and its
Affiliates, the services described on Schedule A-2 attached hereto, which each
such service can be passed through by Seller and its Affiliates to certain
third parties as designated in writing to Buyer (each, a "Buyer Service", and
collectively, the "Buyer Services"). The Seller Services and the Buyer
Services shall together be known as the "Services," and Schedule A-1 and
Schedule A-2 shall together be known as "Schedule A." For each Service,
WEIL:\\\97074215\\\1\\\41703.0011  

  

 ![](nrz2019630exh210339.jpg) 

Schedule A shall identify the Person who will provide such Service from and
after the Effective Date (whether Seller, Buyer, an Affiliate or a Vendor).
"Service Period" means the period commencing as of the Effective Date and,
subject to earlier termination pursuant to Article III, continuing until the
date indicated for each such Service on Schedule A (which such date in no
event will be a date beyond the expiration of the Term). Unless otherwise
specified in Schedule A, neither Party shall have the right to renew or extend
the Service Period without the written consent of the other Party. Unless
otherwise agreed in writing by the Parties, the Services to be provided by
Service Provider under this Agreement are limited to those expressly stated
herein, subject to any subsequent changes to the Services pursuant to Section
1.3. Section 1.2 Quality and Nature of Services. (a) Service Provider shall
provide, or shall cause to be provided, the Services in a manner, quality,
nature and level of service that is substantially similar to service with
which such Services were provided to, received by, or provided or received on
behalf of, Service Recipient or its Affiliates or predecessors in interest
(including, in the case of Buyer as Service Recipient, the Business)
immediately prior to the Effective Date. If a Service was provided immediately
prior to the Effective Date by a third party, and such Service will continue
to be provided by such third party on behalf of Service Provider, Service
Provider shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the
quality and availability of such Service is provided to Service Recipient in a
manner reasonably (including with respect to the manner and level of service)
consistent with the applicable agreement pursuant to which such third party
provided the Service to the Business immediately prior to the Effective Date.
Except as set forth in the Purchase Agreement or any other Related Agreement,
there shall be no material change in the scope or level of, or use by Service
Recipient or its Affiliates, as applicable, of the Services during the Service
Period without the mutual written agreement of the Parties. Subject to the
first sentence of this Section 1.2(a) and to Section 1.7, Service Provider may
make changes from time to time in the manner of performing Services without
Service Recipient's consent (including changes to its, its Affiliates' and its
Personnel's systems) only if (i) Service Provider is making similar changes in
the manner that it provides substantially similar services to itself and its
Affiliates, (ii) Service Provider provides Service Recipient with reasonable
prior written notice of any material change in the manner of providing
Services and (iii) Service Provider consults with Service Recipient in good
faith to minimize any adverse effect of such changes on the provision of such
Services. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Seller and certain of its
Subsidiaries are debtors in the Bankruptcy Cases and that, as such, Seller and
such Subsidiaries are subject to limitations on debtors under chapter 11 of
the Bankruptcy Code and subject to any orders of the Bankruptcy Court and its
debtor-in-possession financing. Buyer agrees that the obligations and efforts
(including commercially reasonable efforts) herein of the Seller and its
Subsidiaries are qualified accordingly. In providing the Services, the Service
Provider shall not be obligated to: (i) hire any additional employees; (ii)
maintain the employment of any specific employee; (iii) purchase, lease or
license any additional equipment or software; (iv) create or supply any
documentation or information not currently existing or available without
commercially unreasonable effort; (v) pay any costs related to the transfer or
conversion of data or other information to Service Recipient; or (vi) enter
into additional contracts or agreements or change the scope of current
contracts or agreements. -2- WEIL:\\\97074215\\\1\\\41703.0011  

  

 ![](nrz2019630exh210340.jpg) 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement (but
subject to Section 1.6), Service Provider shall not be obligated to provide
any Service to the extent the provision of such Service would violate (i) any
agreement or license with a third party or other contractual obligation, in
each case, to which Service Provider or any of its Affiliates is subject as of
the date of this Agreement or (ii) any applicable Law; provided, however, that
Service Provider shall provide Service Recipient written notice as promptly as
practicable (and no later than five (5) Business Days) after Service Provider
becomes aware of any Service that cannot be provided, which notice shall
include an explanation of the violation. In the event Service Provider is
unable to provide a Service pursuant to this Section 1.2(b), Service Provider
shall, if requested by Service Recipient, use its commercially reasonable
efforts to determine an alternate method to provide such Service; provided,
however, that Service Provider shall have no obligation to incur additional
out-of-pocket costs to provide such Service unless Service Recipient agrees in
advance to reimburse Service Provider for such costs. To the Knowledge of the
Seller, there are no material Contracts or licenses with any third party under
which such third party would be prohibited from providing all or a portion of
any Seller Service to Buyer, provided that consent may be required from such
third parties. (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
Service Provider will not provide any legal services or legal advice to
Service Recipient, and Service Recipient is not entitled to rely on Service
Provider for legal advice or counsel, and any advisory communications given by
Service Provider to Service Recipient are not to be construed as legal advice.
Service Recipient shall not resell any Services, provide the Services to any
Person that is not an Affiliate, or otherwise use the Services in a manner
that differs in any material respect from the manner in which the Services
were used by the Business, or the applicable businesses of Seller and its
Affiliates other than the Business (the "Retained Business"), immediately
prior to the Effective Date. Section 1.3 Changes in the Services. Any Service
may be modified if and to the extent the Parties mutually agree in writing
(each, a "Service Change"), it being understood that no Party is under any
obligation to agree to any such proposed modification. Upon any such written
agreement to a Service Change, Schedule A shall be automatically deemed to be
modified to reflect the Service Change and the Service Provider shall proceed
to perform the Services, as changed, in accordance with the Service Change and
all other requirements, terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement.
Section 1.4 Standard of Care. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement,
Service Provider does not assume any responsibility under this Agreement other
than to render the Services in good faith and in compliance with all
applicable Laws and the terms of this Agreement. EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN THIS
AGREEMENT, SERVICE PROVIDER MAKES NO, AND SERVICE RECIPIENT REPRESENTS THAT IT
HAS NOT RECEIVED OR RELIED UPON ANY, OTHER GUARANTEE, REPRESENTATION OR
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND (WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED) REGARDING ANY OF THE
SERVICES PROVIDED HEREUNDER. EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, SERVICE
PROVIDER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL, AND SERVICE RECIPIENT EXPRESSLY REPRESENTS
THAT IT HAS NOT AND IS NOT RELYING UPON ANY, GUARANTEES, REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES OF ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER WITH RESPECT TO THE PROVISION OF THE
SERVICES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, -3- WEIL:\\\97074215\\\1\\\41703.0011

WHETHER STATUTORY, ORAL, WRITTEN, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTIES
OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND ANY WARRANTIES
ARISING FROM COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. Section 1.5 Responsibility
for Errors; Delays. Without limiting Section 5.2, in the event there is any
error or omissions in Services caused by Service Provider or Vendor, and to
the extent any such error or omission was within the control of Service
Provider or Vendor at the time of performance, as a non-exclusive remedy to
Service Recipient for such error or omission, Service Provider shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to promptly re-perform or cause the re-
performance of such Services or furnish correct information, payment or
adjustments in the Services, in each case at no additional cost or expense to
Service Recipient as soon as Service Provider becomes aware of such error or
omission, including if Service Recipient advises Service Provider of such
error or omission. Notwithstanding the foregoing, but without limiting Section
5.2, Service Provider shall not be obligated to re-perform or cause the re-
performance of such Services or furnish correct information, payment or
adjustments in the Services if the error or omission was directly or
indirectly caused by the (i) provision of inaccurate or incomplete information
by, or (ii) gross negligence or willful misconduct of, Service Recipient, its
Affiliates or its or their Personnel. Section 1.6 Cooperation; Alternatives.
Unless otherwise provided for in this Agreement, Service Provider and Service
Recipient shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with each
other in all matters relating to the provision and receipt of the Services,
and Service Provider and Service Recipient shall each use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to cause each of their respective employees
and contractors to reasonably cooperate to the extent required for effective
delivery of the Services. Service Recipient shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide such reasonable advance notice and forecasts of Services as
are reasonably requested in writing by Service Provider performing the
Services from time to time. To the extent any consents or licenses from third
parties are reasonably necessary for the provision or receipt of any Service,
Service Provider shall seek such consents or licenses; provided that, Service
Provider shall not be required to incur any additional costs in order to
obtain such consents or licenses (other than with respect to any licenses that
were required from any third party with respect to any service that was
provided to or by Service Provider or its Affiliates prior to the Effective
Date). Section 1.7 Use of Affiliates and Vendors. Service Provider may use (a)
any Affiliate or (b) a qualified third party provider ("Vendor"), to provide
the Services; provided, however, that (i) Service Provider shall remain
responsible at all times for the performance of Services by its Affiliates or
any Vendor under this Agreement and (ii) a Vendor may only be used by Service
Provider following the written consent of Service Recipient, such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. Service Recipient's prior
written consent of a Vendor designation will not be required, however, if (x)
the Vendor provided those Services to the Business or the businesses of the
Service Recipient, as applicable, prior to the Effective Date; (y) the Vendor
is a third party who provided the same services to Service Provider prior to
the Effective Date; or (z) Service Provider changes the Vendor used to provide
such Services or similar services to Service Provider. -4-

 ![](nrz2019630exh210342.jpg) 

Section 1.8 Intellectual Property License. Solely during the Service Period,
and solely to the extent required for the provision or receipt, as applicable,
of Services in accordance with this Agreement, each Party ("Licensor"), for
itself and on behalf of its Affiliates, hereby grants to the other Party and
its Affiliates ("Licensee") a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-
sublicenseable (except that Seller and each of its Affiliates may sub-license
its rights under this Section 1.8 to any third parties it has designated in
writing to pass through Buyer Services to in accordance with Section 1.1),
royalty-free, worldwide license for the term of this Agreement, to use any
Intellectual Property (and any tangible embodiments thereof) owned by Licensor
or its Affiliates for the sole purpose of providing or receiving, as
applicable, the Services pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, subject to
any applicable restrictions, limitations and other instructions provided in
writing to Licensee. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, including in this Section 1.8, neither Party shall be
obligated to license any Intellectual Property to the extent such license
would violate (i) any agreement, license or other contractual obligation, in
each case, with a third party to which such Party or any of its Affiliates is
subject as of the date of this Agreement or (ii) any applicable Law. Section
1.9 Ownership of Data and Other Assets. Neither Party shall acquire under this
Agreement any right, title or interest in any asset or Intellectual Property
that is owned or licensed by the other Party or its Affiliates. All data
provided by or on behalf of a Party to the other Party or its Affiliates for
the purpose of providing or receiving the Services shall remain the property
of the Party providing such data unless otherwise specified herein. To the
extent the provision of any Service involves Intellectual Property, each Party
agrees that it and its Affiliates shall not copy, modify, reverse engineer,
decompile or in any way alter any of such material, or otherwise use such
material in a manner inconsistent with the terms and provisions of this
Agreement or the Purchase Agreement without the express written consent of the
other Party. Section 1.10 Data Privacy. In this Section 1.10, the terms
"personal information" and "maintain" shall have the meanings ascribed to them
under applicable data protection, privacy or similar applicable Laws
(including all statutes, enacting instruments, common law, regulations and
directives, concerning the protection or maintenance of computerized data that
includes personal information) (the "Data Protection Laws"). Each Party shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates or Personnel to, comply with all applicable
Data Protection Laws in relation to all personal information that it maintains
in the course of performing its obligations under this Agreement (the
"Protected Data"). If in connection with this Agreement, either Party acquires
or obtains access to any Protected Data, such Party shall, and shall cause
each of its relevant Affiliates to, (a) implement and maintain appropriate
technical and organization measures and security procedures and practices in
respect of the Protected Data to prevent unauthorized or unlawful acquisition,
access, disclosure, use or maintenance of the Protected Data that are no less
protective than those used by such Party in the ordinary course of business,
(b) keep reasonably accurate records relating to maintenance of Protected Data
in accordance with its applicable procedures and practices and, upon
reasonable advanced written notice, permit the other Party to examine or audit
such records with respect to compliance with Data Protection Laws, (c)
reasonably cooperate with the other Party in connection with any complaints or
investigations related to unauthorized or unlawful acquisition, access,
disclosure, use, or maintenance of the Protected Data, (d) use Protected Data
solely for the purposes of this Agreement or as otherwise required by
applicable Law (subject to providing to the other Party prior notice of any
use other than for the purpose(s) of this Agreement), (e) comply with all
reasonable restrictions on the acquisition of, access to, use, maintenance and
-5- WEIL:\\\97074215\\\1\\\41703.0011  

  

 ![](nrz2019630exh210343.jpg) 

disclosure of Protected Data imposed by the other Party or by applicable Law,
(f) notify the other Party in writing as soon as reasonably practicable, but
in any event within forty-eight (48) hours after becoming aware of any
unauthorized or unlawful acquisition, access, disclosure, use or maintenance
of Protected Data (to the extent not prohibited under applicable Law or
recommendation of a Governmental Authority) and take reasonable actions to
prevent further unauthorized or unlawful acquisition, access, disclosure, use
or maintenance and (g) use and disclose the Protected Data in a manner that is
consistent with the other Party's practices and policies, upon reasonable
advanced written notice of such practices and policies. To the extent required
by applicable Data Protection Laws or as deemed necessary by the Parties, the
Parties (or their respective Affiliates) will enter into additional agreements
with respect to the processing of Protected Data. Section 1.11 Single Point of
Contact. Each Party shall designate a contact person (each, a "Single Point of
Contact"), as set forth on Schedule B, to facilitate communications and
performance with respect to this Agreement and the Services, including
operational matters. Unless otherwise authorized in writing or specified in
the specific Schedule related to a Service, the Parties shall direct all
communications relating to this Agreement and the Services to the Single Point
of Contact for the other Party. Each Party shall have the right at any time
and from time to time to replace its Single Point of Contact by written notice
to the other Party in accordance with Section 6.3, following which Schedule B
shall be automatically amended to reflect such Party's new Single Point of
Contact. Section 1.12 Records. During the term of this Agreement and for five
(5) years thereafter (or such longer period as may be required by applicable
Law), Service Provider and Service Recipient shall each use commercially
reasonable efforts to maintain complete and accurate records related to any
Service provided, Fees invoiced and payments made hereunder (the "Service
Records"); provided, that if Service Provider at any time offers in writing to
transfer the Service Records in Service Provider's possession to Service
Recipient, Service Recipient shall have sixty (60) days thereafter to take
possession of the Service Records, after which Service Provider shall no
longer have an obligation to retain, and may thereafter delete or destroy,
such Service Records. Upon reasonable advance notice, and subject to Article
IV, each Party in possession of Service Records shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to permit the other Party or its Representatives, as
applicable, reasonable access to or, at the requesting Party's expense, copies
of, such Service Records during regular business hours; provided, that (a)
such access shall not disrupt the normal operations of such first Party's
business and (b) nothing herein shall require any Party to provide to the
other Party, its Affiliates or its Representatives with access to or copies of
any information to the extent that such access to or the provision of such
information would violate any applicable Law or contractual obligation
(including any Law or contractual obligation relating to the collection,
transfer, storage, disposal, use, processing and disclosure of personally
identifiable information); provided, that such first Party and its Affiliates
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide such information in a
manner that does not violate such Law or is in accordance with such agreement.
Section 1.13 Employees and Contractors. As between Service Provider and
Service Recipient, at all times during the provision of Services, such
Personnel shall continue to be solely an employee, agent or contractor, as
applicable, of Service Provider and shall not, unless otherwise agreed in
writing by Service Provider and Service Recipient, become an employee, agent
-6- WEIL:\\\97074215\\\1\\\41703.0011  

  

 ![](nrz2019630exh210344.jpg) 

or contractor of Service Recipient, and such Personnel shall not be entitled
to receive any compensation, benefits, perquisites or privileges from Service
Recipient provided, that, the foregoing shall not prevent such Personnel from
leaving the employment of Service Provider, either at the discretion of such
individual Personnel or at Service Provider's discretion. Service Provider or
one or more of its Affiliates, as applicable, shall be responsible for paying
all necessary employment taxes, salary and incidental appointment and
employment costs, if any, as may be required by applicable Law with respect to
any such Personnel. Section 1.14 Access to Facilities. If either Party, its
Affiliates or its Personnel require reasonable access to the facilities of the
other Party or its Affiliates (collectively, the "Facilities") in order to
receive or perform Services, then the Party controlling such access shall
reasonably allow the other Party, its Affiliates or their respective Personnel
such access in accordance with this Section 1.14 and Section 1.15, as
applicable. The Party to whom such access is given shall (a) limit such access
to those of its and its Affiliates' Personnel who reasonably require such
access in connection with this Agreement, (b) advise the other Party in
writing in advance of such access of the name of each such Personnel who shall
require such access, (c) follow, and cause its Affiliates and their respective
Personnel to follow, all rules and procedures for use of such Facilities,
provided such rules and procedures are communicated to such Party in writing
in advance, (d) not attempt to obtain access to, use or interfere with any
systems or resources of the other Party, except to the extent permitted by the
other Party and required to do so to provide or receive the Services and (e)
not intentionally damage, disrupt or impair the normal operation of the
Facilities. Any evidenced damage caused by a Party, its Affiliates or their
respective Personnel or agents in the Facilities of the other Party shall be
repaired to the condition prior to such damage by or on behalf of such Party,
in each case, at the damaging Party's sole cost and expense. Section 1.15
Computer Access. If either Party, its Affiliates or its Personnel are given
access, whether on-site or through remote facilities, to any communications,
computer, or electronic data storage systems (each, an "Electronic Resource")
of the other Party, its Affiliates or its Personnel in connection with this
Agreement, then the Party to whom such access is given shall ensure that its
Personnel's use of such access shall be solely limited to performance or
exercise of such Party's duties and rights under this Agreement, and that such
Personnel shall not attempt to access any Electronic Resources other than
those specifically required for the performance of such duties or exercise of
such rights. The Party given access shall (a) limit such access to those of
its and its Affiliates' Personnel who reasonably require such access in
connection with this Agreement, (b) advise the other Party in writing in
advance of such access of the name of each of such Personnel who shall require
such access, (c) follow, and cause its Affiliates and its and Affiliates'
Personnel to follow, all security rules and procedures for use of such
Electronic Resources, provided such rules and procedures are communicated to
such Party in writing, (d) not attempt to obtain access to, use or interfere
with any Electronic Resource of the other Party, or any data owned, used or
processed by the other Party, except to the extent permitted by the other
Party and required to do so to provide or receive the Services and (e) not
disable, damage or erase or disrupt or impair the normal operation of the
Electronic Resource. All user identification numbers and passwords disclosed
to a Party's or its Affiliates' Personnel and any information obtained by such
Party's or its Affiliates' Personnel as a result of its access to, and use of
the other Party's, its Affiliates' or its Personnel's Electronic Resources
shall be deemed to be, and shall be treated as, Confidential Information of
the Party on behalf of whom such access is granted. Each Party shall -7-
WEIL:\\\97074215\\\1\\\41703.0011  

  

 ![](nrz2019630exh210345.jpg) 

reasonably cooperate with the other Party in the investigation of any apparent
unauthorized access by the other Party, its Affiliates or its Personnel to any
Electronic Resources or unauthorized release of Confidential Information and
take reasonable actions to prevent any further unauthorized access to any
Electronic Resources or other unauthorized or unlawful conduct or activities
related to the Electronic Resources. Each Party shall notify the other Party
in writing within forty-eight (48) hours of discovery of any actual or
suspected unauthorized access to or disclosure of any Electronic Resource of
the other Party, its Affiliates or its Personnel, to the extent reasonably
practicable and not prohibited under applicable Law or recommendation of a
Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, nothing in this Section 1.15 shall in any way limit the obligations
of either Party or any of its Affiliates or Personnel set forth in Section
1.10. ARTICLE II CHARGES AND PAYMENTS FOR SERVICES Section 2.1 Compensation.
As consideration for the provision of Services, Service Recipient shall pay,
or cause to be paid, to Service Provider or its designee(s) the fees for the
Services specified on Schedule A (the "Fees"), payable in accordance with
Schedule A, for the Service Period of such Services as set forth on Schedule A
unless such Service and/or this Agreement is terminated prior to the end of
such Service Period. Such Fees shall be calculated in accordance with the cost
allocation principles set forth in Schedule C. Service Recipient shall pay a
pro rata portion of the applicable Fee specified on Schedule A for any partial
months of Service, to the extent the Fees specified on Schedule A are
calculated on a monthly basis. If the Fees include charges for Services
performed by a Vendor and the Vendor's fees increase during the Service
Period, then Service Provider shall be entitled to pass through the increased
fees as an increase in the Fees; provided, that to the extent that Service
Provider uses the same Vendor to provide similar services to itself or its
Affiliates, each of the Parties shall be responsible for their pro rata
portion of the increased amount in accordance with the level of services such
Party receives (directly or indirectly) from such Vendor. In the event of any
such increase in a Vendor's fees, Service Provider shall provide Service
Recipient with prompt written notice thereof (to the extent reasonably
practicable, at least fifteen (15) Business Days prior to such increase going
into effect). Section 2.2 Payments. Service Recipient shall pay Fees in
arrears in accordance with Section 2.1 and this Section 2.2. Unless otherwise
mutually agreed in writing or otherwise set forth on Schedule A, all
undisputed amounts payable under this Agreement shall be paid semi- monthly by
Service Recipient to Service Provider or, if applicable, its designee(s),
Affiliates or Vendors by electronic transfer of immediately available funds to
a bank account designated by such Person from time to time, within fifteen
(15) days following receipt of a written invoice for such amount, which such
invoices for accrued Fees shall by submitted on a semi-monthly basis to
Service Recipient within five (5) Business Days on the fifteenth (15th) day of
each calendar month and within five (5) Business Days of the last day of each
calendar month for payment on a semi- monthly basis. All undisputed amounts
remaining unpaid for more than fifteen (15) days after receipt of such
invoices shall accrue one and one-half percent (1.5%) interest per month until
paid in full. -8- WEIL:\\\97074215\\\1\\\41703.0011  

  

 ![](nrz2019630exh210346.jpg) 

Section 2.3 Taxes; Service Provision Taxes. The Parties hereby acknowledge
that the Fees specified in Schedule A do not include applicable Taxes. Subject
to Section 1.13, Service Recipient shall be responsible for the payment of all
Taxes payable in connection with the Services, including sales, use, excise,
value-added, business, service, goods and services, consumption, stamp, stamp
duty, documentary registration, withholding and other similar gross- receipts-
based Taxes or duties, including such Taxes incurred on transactions between
and among Service Provider, its Affiliates and its Vendors, along with any
related interest and penalties, in each case, imposed, assessed or payable
with respect to such taxes in accordance with applicable Law (together, such
amounts, the "Service Provision Taxes"). On a monthly basis, (i) Service
Provider will deliver to Service Recipient an invoice (or other valid and
customary documentation) reflecting such Service Provision Taxes imposed,
assessed, or payable, and (ii) Service Recipient shall reimburse Service
Provider for any Service Provision Taxes that are Service Recipient's
responsibility under this Agreement. In accordance with applicable Law,
Service Provider will timely remit amounts due to the applicable Governmental
Authority and promptly provide reasonable documentary evidence of the timely
and proper remittance of such amount. Notwithstanding anything in this Section
2.3 to the contrary, each Party shall be responsible for its own income and
franchise Taxes, employment Taxes and real or personal property Taxes, except
as provided in the Purchase Agreement or any other Related Agreement. The
Parties shall cooperate in good faith to minimize Service Provision Taxes and
any withholding obligations with respect to amounts payable pursuant to this
Agreement to the extent legally permissible. Each Party shall provide to the
other Party any resale exemption, multiple points of use certificates, treaty
certification and other exemption information reasonably requested by the
other Party. Section 2.4 No Off-Set. Except as otherwise expressly provided in
this Agreement, Service Recipient shall timely pay the full amount of the Fees
and shall not set-off, counterclaim or otherwise withhold any amount owed to
Service Provider under this Agreement on account of any obligation owed by
Service Provider to Service Recipient under this Agreement or any Related
Agreement without the written consent of the Service Provider. To the extent
Service Recipient is required to deduct and withhold any amounts in respect of
Taxes of Service Provider from any amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement
under any provision of U.S. federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law, the sum
payable by the Service Recipient shall be increased as necessary so that after
such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and
withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.4) the
Service Provider receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received
had no such deduction or withholding been made and the Service Recipient shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Service Provider on an after tax basis, with
respect thereto. Any Party that deducts and withholds amounts pursuant to this
Section 2.4 shall, upon the request of the other Party, provide reasonable
documentary evidence of the timely and proper remittance of such amounts.
ARTICLE III TERMINATION Section 3.1 Term. The term of this Agreement shall
commence immediately upon the Effective Date and terminate on the date which
is six (6) months following the Closing Date unless otherwise mutually agreed
in writing by the Parties (the "Term"). -9- WEIL:\\\97074215\\\1\\\41703.0011  

  

 ![](nrz2019630exh210347.jpg) 

Section 3.2 Termination of an Individual Service for Convenience by Service
Recipient. Except as otherwise set forth on Schedule A and subject to the next
sentence, Service Recipient, upon fifteen (15) days' prior written notice to
Service Provider, may reduce or terminate for Service Recipient's convenience
any individual Service; provided, that, if prior written notice for the
reduction or termination of an individual Service is provided by Service
Recipient to Service Provider on less than fifteen (15) days' notice, then
Service Recipient shall still be required to pay the applicable Fees for such
Service for the full fifteen (15) day period following the provision of such
written notice. Service Recipient may not reduce or terminate an individual
Service if such early reduction or termination would prevent Service Provider,
its Affiliates or Vendors from performing another Service that is not also
being terminated. In connection with any early reduction or termination of
Services by Service Recipient in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 3.2, Service Recipient and Service Provider shall coordinate in good
faith regarding the early termination or continuation of preexisting service
contracts with Vendors. Section 3.3 Termination of this Agreement. (a) Subject
to the immediately following sentence, either Party may terminate this
Agreement in the event of (i) a material breach of this Agreement by the other
Party if such material breach is curable by the breaching Party and the
breaching Party fails to cure the breach within thirty (30) days following its
receipt of written notice of the breach from the non-breaching Party or (ii)
an assignment with respect to which the non-assigning Party has not consented
in accordance with Section 6.2. If a material breach is reasonably determined
in good faith to not be curable by the breaching Party, the non-breaching
Party may immediately terminate this Agreement following the non-breaching
Party's delivery of notice to the breaching Party pursuant to Section 6.3.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Service Recipient's failure
to pay any Fees when due and payable shall not constitute a breach of the
terms of this Agreement if there exists a good faith disagreement regarding
such Fees and Service Recipient pays all Fees for which no good faith dispute
exists. (b) Except as otherwise provided herein, the obligation of Service
Provider to provide, or cause to be provided, any Service shall cease on the
earliest to occur of (i) the expiration of the Term, (ii) the expiration of
the Service Period applicable to such Service or (iii) the date on which such
Service is terminated in accordance with the terms of this Article III. This
Agreement shall automatically terminate without notice, and all provisions of
this Agreement shall become null and void and of no further force and effect,
except for the provisions set forth in Section 6.5, on the date on which
neither Party has any obligations to provide any Service under this Agreement.
Section 3.4 Obligations on Termination. Upon termination of this Agreement or
any Service hereunder, Service Provider shall invoice Service Recipient for
all outstanding Fees for Services rendered through the effective date of
termination of this Agreement, or with respect to any terminated Service, all
outstanding Fees for such Service rendered through the effective date of
termination for such terminated Service, and, within thirty (30) days
following receipt of such invoice, Service Recipient shall pay all outstanding
Fees for such Services. Undisputed payments not made within thirty (30) days
after termination of this Agreement shall be subject to the late charges as
provided in Section 2.2. -10- WEIL:\\\97074215\\\1\\\41703.0011  

  

 ![](nrz2019630exh210348.jpg) 

Section 3.5 Termination of an Individual Service by Vendor. If (a) a Vendor of
Service Provider that provides a Service is unwilling or unable to provide the
Service, (b) Service Provider is unable to retain a replacement Vendor to
provide the Service on terms that are reasonably comparable to the terms of
this Agreement, after using commercially reasonable efforts to find such
replacement and (c) neither Service Provider nor any of its Affiliates are
able to provide the Service using commercially reasonable efforts, Service
Provider, upon providing thirty (30) days' prior written notice to Service
Recipient, may terminate the affected Service. Such termination of the
affected Service shall have no effect upon the provision of the other Services
to Service Recipient unless other Services are dependent on that terminated
Service, in which case the Parties will cooperate and use commercially
reasonable efforts to promptly determine and implement a reasonable
alternative arrangement for the affected Services. ARTICLE IV CONFIDENTIALITY
Section 4.1 Confidential Information. "Confidential Information" means any
nonpublic information whether disclosed in oral, written, visual, electronic
or other form, that (a) one Party or one of its Affiliates (the "Disclosing
Party") discloses to the other Party or one of its Affiliates (the "Receiving
Party"), including information received as a result of data or system access
during the Term, (b) relates to or is disclosed in connection with this
Agreement and (c) is or reasonably should be understood by the Receiving Party
to be confidential or proprietary to the Disclosing Party (whether or not such
information is marked "Confidential" or "Proprietary"). Section 4.2 Treatment
of Confidential Information. The Receiving Party shall (a) restrict disclosure
of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information to its and its Affiliates'
Personnel with a need to know such Confidential Information to fulfill its
obligations under this Agreement, (b) instruct those Personnel of their
obligation not to disclose the Confidential Information or use the
Confidential Information except to fulfill the Receiving Party's obligations
under this Agreement and (c) protect the Confidential Information, and require
those Personnel to protect it, using the same degree of care as the Receiving
Party uses with its own Confidential Information, but no less than reasonable
care. The Receiving Party shall notify the Disclosing Party as soon as
reasonably practicable after obtaining knowledge of any disclosure, or
suspected disclosure, of any Confidential Information to a third party in a
manner prohibited by applicable Law or the terms of this Agreement. Section
4.3 Liability for Unauthorized Disclosure. The Receiving Party shall be liable
to the Disclosing Party for any unauthorized disclosure of Confidential
Information in violation of this Agreement by it, its Affiliates and any of
its or its Affiliates' current or former Personnel. Section 4.4 Destruction.
Without limiting the foregoing, when any Confidential Information is no longer
needed for the purposes contemplated by this Agreement, the Receiving Party
shall, promptly upon the request of the Disclosing Party, either return such
Confidential Information in tangible form or certify to the other Party that
it has destroyed such Confidential Information. -11-

 ![](nrz2019630exh210349.jpg) 

Section 4.5 Exceptions to Confidential Treatment. The obligations under
Section 4.2 do not apply to any information that the Receiving Party can
demonstrate (a) was disclosed to the Receiving Party by a third party without
an obligation of confidentiality to the Disclosing Party, its Affiliates or
any other third party, as applicable, (b) is or becomes available to the
public other than by disclosure by the Receiving Party or its Affiliates in
violation of this Agreement or (c) was or is independently developed by the
Receiving Party or its Affiliates without use of the Disclosing Party's
Confidential Information. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary,
Confidential Information relating to the Business that existed as of the
Effective Date shall not be subject to the foregoing exceptions (a) and (c).
Section 4.6 Protective Arrangement. A Receiving Party may disclose the
Disclosing Party's Confidential Information if (a) such information is
required to be disclosed by Law or the rules and regulations of any applicable
Governmental Authority or (b) such information is required to be disclosed in
response to a valid subpoena or Order of a court or other Governmental
Authority of competent jurisdiction or other valid legal process, and the
Receiving Party has complied with this Section 4.6. Prior to any such
permitted disclosure under this Section 4.6, the Receiving Party shall give
the Disclosing Party, to the extent legally permitted and reasonably
practicable, prompt prior written notice of such disclosure and an opportunity
to contest such disclosure, and the Receiving Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate, at the expense of the Receiving Party, in
seeking any reasonable protective arrangements requested by the Disclosing
Party. If such appropriate protective order or other remedy is not obtained,
the Receiving Party may furnish, or cause to be furnished, only that portion
of such information that the Receiving Party is legally required to be
disclosed. The Receiving Party shall take commercially reasonable steps to
ensure that confidential treatment is accorded such information. Section 4.7
Ownership of Information. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all
Confidential Information provided by or on behalf of a Party (or its
Affiliates) that is provided to the other Party or its Affiliates shall remain
the property of the Disclosing Party and nothing herein shall be construed as
granting or conferring rights of license or otherwise in any such Confidential
Information. ARTICLE V INDEMNIFICATION; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY Section 5.1
Indemnification by Service Recipient. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in Section 5.5, Service Recipient shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless
Service Provider and its Affiliates and its Vendors and Personnel (each, a
"Service Provider Indemnitee") from and against any and all Losses actually
incurred or suffered by Service Provider Indemnitee of every kind and nature
to the extent related to or arising out of: (a) a breach of any provision of
this Agreement by Service Recipient or its Affiliates or its or their
respective Personnel; or (b) the gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud
of Service Recipient, its Affiliates or its or their respective Personnel
(collectively, the "Service Recipient Claims"). Notwithstanding the
obligations set forth above in this Section 5.1, Service Recipient shall not
defend, indemnify or hold harmless Service Provider Indemnitees to the extent
that such Service Recipient Claims were caused by (i) a breach of any
provision of this Agreement by Service Provider, its Affiliates or its or
their respective Personnel or (ii) the gross negligence, willful misconduct or
fraud of Service -12- WEIL:\\\97074215\\\1\\\41703.0011  

  

 ![](nrz2019630exh210350.jpg) 

Provider, its Affiliates, Vendors or its or their respective Personnel during
the performance (or non-performance) of this Agreement. Section 5.2
Indemnification by Service Provider. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in Section 5.5, Service Provider shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless
Service Recipient and its Affiliates and Personnel (each, a "Service Recipient
Indemnitee") from and against any and all Losses actually incurred or suffered
by Service Recipient Indemnitee to the extent related to or arising out of (a)
a breach of any provision of this Agreement by Service Provider or its
Affiliates or its or their respective Personnel; or (b) the gross negligence,
willful misconduct or fraud of Service Provider, its Affiliates, its Vendors
or it or their respective Personnel during the performance (or non-
performance) of the Services (together, the "Service Provider Claims").
Notwithstanding the obligations set forth above in this Section 5.2, Service
Provider shall not defend, indemnify or hold harmless Service Recipient
Indemnitees to the extent that such Service Provider Claims were caused by:
(i) a breach of any provision of this Agreement by Service Recipient, its
Affiliates or its or their respective Personnel; or (ii) the gross negligence,
willful misconduct or fraud of Service Recipient, its Affiliates or its or
their respective Personnel in the performance (or non-performance) of this
Agreement. Service Recipient Claims and Service Provider Claims are each
individually referred to as a "Claim." Section 5.3 Procedure. If a Claim
arises from a third party claim, the indemnified Party shall give the
indemnifying Party prompt notice in writing of the Claim; provided, however,
that the failure to provide such notice shall not release the indemnifying
Party from any of its obligations under this Article V, except to the extent
the indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure. Upon receipt
of such notice, the indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume and control
the defense of the Claim at its expense and through counsel of its choice that
is reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified Party, and shall give notice of
its intention to do so to the indemnified Party within thirty (30) days of the
receipt of such notice from the indemnified Party; provided, however, that the
indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the
indemnified Party, (a) enter into any settlement or compromise with respect to
any Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment that does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the delivery by the claimant or plaintiff to the
indemnified Party of a written release from all liability in respect of the
Claim or (b) enter into any settlement or compromise with respect to any Claim
in any manner that may adversely affect the indemnified Party other than as a
result of money damages or other monetary payments that are indemnified
hereunder. The indemnified Party shall have the right at its own cost and
expense to employ separate counsel and participate in the defense of any
Claim. Section 5.4 Independent Obligation. The obligations of each Party to
defend, indemnify and hold harmless, the other Parties' indemnified Parties
under this Article V are independent of each other and any other obligation of
the Parties under this Agreement. Section 5.5 Limitation of Liability. EXCEPT
FOR (A) LIABILITIES THAT ARE PAYABLE BY THE APPLICABLE INDEMNIFIED PARTY IN
CONNECTION WITH A THIRD PARTY CLAIM OR (B) A PARTY'S BREACH OF ITS
CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER
PARTY, NOR ITS AFFILIATES OR ITS OR THEIR RESPECTIVE DIRECTORS, OFFICERS,

AGREEMENT, AND IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY SELLER HAVE ANY FURTHER OR OTHER
LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. THE REMEDIES SET FORTH IN THIS ARTICLE V AND
SECTION 1.5 SHALL BE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES OF THE PARTIES WITH
RESPECT TO ALL MATTERS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT. ARTICLE
VI MISCELLANEOUS Section 6.1 Amendments; Waivers. No amendment of any
provision of this Agreement shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing
and signed by each Party. No waiver of any breach of this Agreement shall be
construed as an implied amendment or agreement to amend or modify any other
provision of this Agreement. No waiver by any Party of any default,
misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder, whether
intentional or not, shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and
signed by the Party making such waiver, nor shall such waiver be deemed to

including the obligation of either Party to pay all amounts accrued hereunder
and including the provisions of Section 1.5 (Responsibility for Errors;

the Parties and supersede any prior understandings, agreements or
representations (whether written or oral) by or between the Parties to the
extent they relate in any way to the subject matter hereof. Section 6.9
Specific Performance. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the other Parties
and their respective Affiliates and estates would be damaged irreparably in
the event the other Parties do not perform their obligations under this
Agreement in accordance with its specific terms or otherwise breach this
Agreement, so that, in addition to any other remedy that the non-breaching
Party may have under Law or equity, each non-breaching Party shall be
entitled, without the requirement of posting a bond or other security or proof
of damages or otherwise, to injunctive relief to prevent any breaches of the
provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and
the terms and provisions hereof. The remedies available to the Parties
pursuant to this Section 10.10 will be in addition to any other remedy to
which they were entitled at Law or in equity, and the election to pursue an
injunction or specific performance will not restrict, impair or otherwise
limit any Party from seeking to collect or collecting damages that such Party
is entitled to seek or collect. Section 6.10 Force Majeure. Service Provider
shall not be in default hereunder by reason of any failure or delay in the
performance of its obligations hereunder where such failure or delay is due to
any cause beyond its reasonable control, including civil disturbances, riot,
rebellion, invasion, epidemic, hostilities, war, embargo, natural disaster,
acts of God, flood, fire, sabotage, accident, delay in transportation, loss
and destruction of property, intervention by Governmental Entities, change in
Laws, regulations or orders, other events or any other circumstances or causes
beyond Seller's reasonable control. Upon the occurrence of any such event
which results in, or will result in, delay or failure to perform according to
the terms of this Agreement, Seller will promptly give notice of such
occurrence and the effect or anticipated effect of such occurrence. Service
Provider will use all reasonable efforts to minimize disruptions in its
performance and to resume performance of its obligations under this Agreement
as soon as practical. If, by reason of any such event is excused from
performance, then to the extent the Services are not provided by Service
Provider, in the manner or at the times required hereunder, Service Recipient
may obtain the same or similar Services from other sources without liability
or obligation for payment to Service Provider for the provision of such
Services. Section 6.11 No Agency. Nothing in this Agreement creates (or shall
be claimed or intended to create) a relationship of agency, partnership or
employer/employee between Service Provider and Service Recipient and it is the
intent and desire of the Parties that the relationship be and be construed as
that of independent contracting parties and not as agents, partners, joint
venturers or a relationship of employer/employee. Section 6.12 Construction
and Interpretation. For purposes of this Agreement, (a) the words "hereof,"

acting alone, to do any and all things in connection with such servicing and
administration which the Servicer may deem necessary or desirable, consistent
with the terms of this Agreement, the Servicing Agreements, Accepted Servicing
Practices and Applicable Requirements. In servicing and administering the

Practices. Servicer shall supervise and conduct periodic 3 732543373 19621021

 ![](nrz2019630exh210387.jpg) 

reviews of any vendor and/or service provider performing servicing activities
or services with respect to the Assets during the Interim Servicing Period,
which supervision and review shall be completed in accordance with Applicable
Requirements, the Servicing Agreements and with Servicer's vendor management
policies and procedures. Servicer shall notify Purchaser promptly of any
material deficiencies of any such vendor or any material violations of any
Applicable Requirements by any such vendor relating to such activities or
services. The use by Servicer of any vendor shall not relieve Servicer of its
obligations under this Agreement, and Servicer shall be fully responsible for
any acts or omissions of such vendors. (b) Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement, from and after the Commencement Date, the Servicer shall
not, without the prior written consent of the Purchaser, (i) modify any Asset
(including, without limitation, a release of any collateral or any party from
liability on or with respect to such Asset) or make any other material loss
mitigation decision, (ii) forgive principal in respect of any Asset, (iii)
accept a deed in lieu of foreclosure with respect to any Asset, (iv) conduct

within a commercially reasonable time period, a written notice to the
Purchaser of any modification or short sale request received by the Servicer.
(c) During the Interim Servicing Period, the Servicer shall collect all
payments due, including past due payments, on each of the Assets when the same
shall become due and payable and shall take care in ascertaining and
estimating Escrow Payments and all other charges that will become due and
payable with respect to the Assets and each related Mortgaged Property. (d)
During the Interim Servicing Period, the Purchaser shall be solely responsible
for making any and all Advances and other payments required to be made in
connection with the Assets. During the Interim Servicing Period, the Servicer
may, from its own funds, choose to but shall not be required to advance any
amounts relating to the servicing of the Assets (including any and all
Advances, escrow amounts, and litigation-related expenses) or make any other
out-of-pocket payments, required to be made pursuant to this Agreement, the
Guides or the Servicing Agreements. With respect to each Asset, upon gaining
knowledge of the need to pay any Advance or other amount either (i) required
to be paid pursuant to the applicable Guide or Servicing Agreement or (ii)
that is advisable to be paid, as determined at the Servicer's sole and
reasonable discretion, pursuant to Accepted Servicing Practices to preserve
the value of such Asset or the Servicing Rights related to such Asset, the
Servicer may, in its sole discretion, pay such Advances or other amounts, or
shall promptly notify the Purchaser of any such Advances or other amounts
after gaining knowledge of the need or advisability of paying such amounts, in
accordance with the guidelines set forth on Exhibit A attached hereto. In
accordance with the guidelines attached hereto as Exhibit A, the Servicer
shall promptly provide a loan level report and all 4 732543373 19621021

reasonably necessary supporting documentation and invoices, upon the
Servicer's receipt of such supporting documentation and invoices, with respect
to such Advances or other amounts necessary for the Purchaser to determine
whether such Advances or other amounts are required or advisable to be paid
and are reimbursable in accordance with Applicable Requirements. If the
Purchaser, in its sole and reasonable discretion, elects to make an Advance or
other payment after receiving notice of the need or advisability thereof from
the Seller under this Section 2.01(d), then the Purchaser shall, in accordance
with the guidelines attached hereto as Exhibit A and in no event no less than
one (1) Business Day before such Advance or other payment is due, deposit the
funds necessary to make such Advance in the Custodial Account or other account
identified by the Servicer via wire transfer in immediately available funds.
If the Purchaser deposits the funds necessary to make any such Advances, the
Servicer shall use such funds to make the related Advances in accordance with
Applicable Requirements, any instructions from the Purchaser and the
guidelines set forth on Exhibit A attached hereto. Any payments or Advances
made by the Servicer from its own funds pursuant to this section shall be
reimbursable in accordance with Section 2.07(d) below. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Servicer shall be required to give notice to the Purchaser of any
amounts pursuant to this Section 2.01 only to the extent that the Servicer has
knowledge of such amounts. Section 2.02. Custodial Accounts. During the term
of this Agreement, with respect to each Asset hereunder, the Servicer shall
maintain all collections and funds in the Custodial Accounts in accordance
with Applicable Requirements pursuant to the MSRPA and MIPA, as applicable. As
provided in Section 2.01, the Purchaser shall be responsible for all Advances
required in connection with the Assets during the term of this Agreement. The
Servicer shall remit to the Custodial Accounts, pursuant to the Applicable
Requirements, Mortgage Loan Payments collected by Servicer. The Servicer
acknowledges that the Escrow Accounts, Custodial Accounts and any collections
it receives on the Assets during the term of this Agreement (except for
Ancillary Fees) are for the account of the applicable borrower, Securitization
Trust, or Investor, or the Purchaser, as applicable. All Custodial Accounts
shall be maintained by and carried in the records of Servicer in trust for the
Purchaser, the applicable Agency, securitization trust or trustee and/or
Mortgagors, as applicable, except as may otherwise be required by Applicable
Requirements. Section 2.03. Escrow Accounts. The Servicer shall ensure that an
escrow account is established or maintained for each Asset (each, an "Escrow
Account" and, collectively, the "Escrow Account"), as necessary or applicable,
in accordance with Applicable Requirements and Accepted Servicing Practices.
The Servicer shall be responsible for all matters relating to the
administration of the Escrow Accounts, including without limitation, (i) the
application of funds to a borrower's Escrow Account, (ii) the disbursement of
funds to the proper parties for escrowed items when due, (iii) payment of
interest on funds deposited into such Escrow Accounts to the extent required
by applicable law, (iv) performance of an annual escrow analysis if
applicable, and (v) maintenance of all records with respect to such Escrow
Accounts, in accordance with Accepted Servicing Practices. During the Interim
Servicing Period, if adequate funds are not available in the Escrow Account at
the Asset level to pay escrowed items when due, the Servicer may, in its sole
discretion, advance from its own funds sufficient funds to cover any such
deficiency, or shall promptly, after gaining knowledge of such deficiency,
notify the Purchaser of the amount of such deficient funds and the Purchaser
shall promptly pay sufficient funds to cover any 5 732543373 19621021
4165-7142-5052.16  

  

 ![](nrz2019630exh210389.jpg) 

such deficiency in a manner to ensure payment of such escrowed items prior to
the time at which a penalty for late payment would be assessed; provided,
however, that the Purchaser shall be responsible for any documented fees,
costs, expenses or penalties incurred by the Servicer as a result of the
Purchaser failing, after receiving notice from the Servicer pursuant to this
Section 2.03, to provide sufficient funds to cover any deficiency in the
applicable Escrow Accounts or to provide such funds with enough time to
prevent any penalty from being assessed or any fees being incurred by the
Servicer. Any payments made by the Servicer pursuant to this section shall be
reimbursable in accordance with Section 2.07(d) below. Section 2.04.
Maintenance of Fidelity Bond and Errors and Omissions Insurance. The Servicer
shall maintain with responsible companies a blanket fidelity bond and an
errors and omissions insurance policy, with broad coverage on all officers,
employees or other persons acting in any capacity that requires such persons
to handle funds, money, documents or papers relating to the Assets, in amounts
as required by the Applicable Requirements. The Servicer shall provide
Purchaser with an electronic copy of such insurance policy or policies and
fidelity bond upon Purchaser's written request. Section 2.05. Remittances to
the Investors and Securitization Trusts. The Servicer shall remit all payments
applicable to principal and interest, including without limitation prepayments
of principal, less the Interim Servicing Fee calculated and deducted pursuant
to Section 2.06 of this Agreement, in accordance with the related Guide or
Private Investor Servicing Agreement, as applicable, and shall make all
principal and interest advances to the Investor or Securitization Trust, as
applicable, pursuant to the related Guide or Private Investor Servicing
Agreement, as applicable. Section 2.06. Remittance to Purchaser. During the
Interim Servicing Period, the Purchaser will be entitled to receive the
monthly Servicing Fee less the monthly Interim Servicing Fee due to the
Servicer and other amounts due to the Servicer pursuant to Section 2.07(b) of
this Agreement. Section 2.07. Servicing Compensation. (a) Interim Servicing
Fee. In consideration for the Servicer's performance of its servicing
obligations pursuant to this Agreement and subject to the terms and conditions
herein, the Servicer shall be entitled to receive an interim servicing fee
during the Interim Servicing Period in accordance with the fee schedule set
forth below (in each case pro-rated for any partial month based on the actual
number of days in such month during which the servicing obligations are
performed) (the "Interim Servicing Fee"): LOAN STATUS MONTHLY FEE PER LOAN2

The Servicer shall provide the Purchaser with a monthly report prior to the
tenth (10th) Business Day of each month setting forth on a loan level and
aggregate basis the Interim Servicing Fee for the prior calendar month. The

Servicing Fee, the Servicer shall be entitled to receive or retain, as
applicable, the Ancillary Fees (other than any interest received on funds
deposited in the Custodial Accounts) held relating to the Servicing Rights
received with respect to the applicable Assets and Servicing Rights prior to
each Servicing Transfer Date. Starting in the month immediately following the
Sale Date, the Servicer shall remit to the Purchaser the interest received on
funds deposited in the Custodial Accounts monthly on the last Business Day of
the first week of each month during the Interim Servicing Period, or on such
other date as mutually agreed to by the parties hereto. Custodial Funds held
in such Custodial Accounts in accordance with the MIPA or the MSRPA, as
applicable. (c) Remittances to Purchaser. On or prior to the fifth (5th)
Business Day of each month, the Servicer shall remit to the Purchaser, through
a wire transfer of immediately available funds, all Servicing Fees and other
amounts payable to the Purchaser pursuant to the Guides and Servicing
Agreements with respect to the preceding calendar month in excess of the
applicable Interim Servicing Fees and the other amounts to which the Servicer
is entitled pursuant to Section 2.07(b). Within five (5) Business Days of
providing such funds to the Purchaser, the Servicer shall provide supporting
reports that reflect the Servicing Fee less the Interim Servicing Fee and
other amounts pursuant to Section 2.07 of this Agreement due to the Servicer
and the net amount due to the Purchaser. During the Interim Servicing Period,
the Servicer shall hold all such net Servicing Fees in trust for the benefit
of the Purchaser. In the event the Servicing Fee does not equal the sum of the
Interim Servicing Fee, the Servicer may elect to send an invoice to the
Purchaser for the unpaid amount due the Servicer, which invoice shall be due
and payable by the Purchaser within fifteen (15) days of the Purchaser's
receipt of such invoice. (d) Advances. To the extent that the Servicer is
entitled to reimbursement pursuant to this Agreement, the Asset Purchase
Agreement, the MIPA or the MSRPA for any Advances as of the applicable

Advance) and (ii) all reasonably necessary supporting documentation and
invoices with respect to such Advances necessary for the Purchaser to
determine that such Advances are reimbursable in accordance with Applicable
Requirements. Section 2.08. Litigation. (a) Notification to Counsel. With

that it is assuming such foreclosure action and the Purchaser shall remove the
Servicer as a party in any such foreclosure proceeding and substitute the

To the extent applicable, the Servicer shall reasonably cooperate with the
Purchaser or its designee in connection with any such foreclosure as well as
to minimize disruptions to foreclosures in process as of the applicable
Servicing Transfer Date as a result of the transfer of servicing to the
Purchaser or its designee, including executing such documentation as the
Purchaser may reasonably require to substitute the Purchaser as plaintiff in
any foreclosure actions at the Purchaser's expense within thirty (30) days of
the applicable Servicing Transfer Date; provided, however, that the foregoing
thirty (30) day limitation shall not apply in respect of any Asset that is
subject to a bankruptcy proceeding or any contested foreclosure. Section 2.09.
Termination. The servicing responsibilities of the Servicer, as interim
servicer, shall terminate at the latest to occur of the expiration of the
Interim Servicing Period and the date on which servicing is actually
transferred in accordance with the MSRPA or the MIPA, as applicable. Pursuant

documents and other instruments, place in the Purchaser's possession all Asset
Files, and do or accomplish all other acts or things necessary or appropriate
to effect the termination, whether to complete the transfer and endorsement or
assignment of the Assets and related documents, or otherwise. The Servicer
agrees to cooperate with the Purchaser and any successor servicer in effecting
the termination of the Servicer's responsibilities hereunder as interim
servicer, including, without limitation, the transfer to such successor for
administration by it of all amounts received after the Commencement Date with
respect to the Assets and held in the Custodial Account and Escrow Accounts
for distribution to the Purchaser. Section 2.10. Use by Servicer of a
Subservicer. The Servicer may, with the Purchaser's prior written consent it
its sole and absolute discretion, arrange for the subservicing of the Assets
pursuant to a subservicing agreement; provided that, notwithstanding the
provisions of any such subservicing agreement, any of the provisions in this
Agreement or the MSRPA relating to the agreements or arrangements between the
Servicer and the Purchaser or reference to actions taken through the Servicer
or otherwise, the Servicer shall remain obligated and liable to the Purchaser
and its successors and assigns for the servicing and administration of the
Assets in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the MSRPA
without diminution of such obligation or liability by virtue of any such
subservicing agreement. All actions of each subservicer performed pursuant to
any such subservicing agreement shall be performed as an agent of the Servicer
with the same force and effect as if performed directly by the Servicer. 8

Exhibit A Advance Guidelines Overview: This memo addresses the funding of
corporate and escrow advances during the Interim Servicing Agreement ("ISA")
period. While both the Purchaser and Seller ("Ditech" or "the company") have
conceptual agreement the following provides a summary level outline of the
proposed process. General Procedure: . Ditech shall provide the Purchaser
written notice of the advance amounts required to be deposited in such
Account(s) so that the Account(s) will have funds on deposit at least equal to
the amount required to be paid to the applicable Investor, Attorney firm
and/or applicable servicer provider. . The company shall provide the Purchaser
written notice (via e-mail) as far in advance of the required funding as is
possible and no less than two (2) Business Days, unless indicated otherwise
below, prior to the required funding date, at which time the Purchaser will
wire the appropriate funds into the designated bank account(s). . As
recoveries are received they will be netted against the advance requirement.
Corporate Advances: . The company currently operates its corporate advance
expense payment processing on a 30-calendar day schedule. Therefore, the
company will have a forward view of those expenses which will be paid on a
rolling 30 calendar day basis. The company will provide Purchaser with a
report monthly reflecting the corporate advances to be paid over the next 30
days. The report will be provided monthly by the 5th business day. . On a
weekly basis the company will send a report of the invoices that were reviewed
and approved to be paid the following week. The report will be provided by end
of day Tuesday with funds to be remitted by Purchaser as soon as reasonably
possible but no later than by mid-day Friday. . The company will fully
cooperate with Purchaser to file same day financing DDAR reports so that the
Purchaser can obtain same day financing of such advances. Escrow Advances: A-1  

  

 ![](nrz2019630exh210400.jpg) 

. Due to the unpredictability of tax disbursements, the company receives a
daily report of pending TAR disbursements from its tax service vendor
CoreLogic. As an example, see the table below which was transmitted to Ditech
from CoreLogic on Mon 6/3/2019 10:39 AM. PAY DATE 06/05/19 STATE LIEN COUNT

company currently advances funds for taxes and insurance ("TandI") each month.
No later than the 15th day of each month (or the following business day if the
15th falls on a non-work day), an estimate of TandI advances for the following
month will be provided by the company to the Purchaser. A-2  

  

 ![](nrz2019630exh210401.jpg) 

. To the extent permissible, the company will adjust the timing of TAR
disbursements to satisfy Purchaser's request, subject to the limitations from
its tax service provider and the local taxing authorities. . The company will
have an estimate of the required funds necessary for the pending disbursement,
and will fully cooperate with the Purchaser so that the Purchaser can file
same day financing through filing advance financing DDARs as is conducted in
the current DDAR process between the company and Purchaser. . On a daily
basis, or when received (on days when no TAR is pending), the company will
send a copy of the report received from CoreLogic (or have Purchaser added to
current distribution list) as soon as reasonably possible. . As soon as
reasonably possible after the receipt of a TAR report, the company will
provide an estimate of the advance amount for the associated TAR disbursement.
Available customer escrow funds will be applied per applicable requirements
and the estimated advance amount will be the net of the required disbursement
and available escrow funds. . The Purchaser will review and wire the requested
amount to the company by the next business day. . The company will refund all
surplus funds provided by the Purchaser by 4 PM on the day the final advance
balance is known or the estimated advance balance is reduced. . On a daily
basis, the company can provide a copy of the P111 Escrow advance and repay
daily report (see example below) A-3

 ![](nrz2019630exh210419.jpg) 

Introduction  This slide deck constitutes the Illustrative Purchase Price
Calculation and Transaction Accounting Principles for purposes of the Asset
Purchase Agreement (the "Agreement") to which it is attached. Capitalized
terms used in this Illustrative Price Calculation and not otherwise defined
herein shall have the meanings given to them in the Agreement. In the event
that this Illustrative Purchase Price Calculation conflicts, or is
inconsistent, with the Agreement, the Agreement shall control  All items
noted as "To Be Determined" are preliminary and subject to change based on
ongoing analysis. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company and Buyer will
cooperate in good faith to mutually agree on the appropriate Acquired, Assumed
or Excluded designation for these assets and liabilities.  Consistent with
the terms of the Agreement, a transaction balance sheet (the "Transaction
Balance Sheet") will be prepared in connection with the Closing (along with
supporting schedules), consistent with historical accounting practices and the
Transaction Accounting Principles(1) and will reflect the total amount of
Acquired Assets and Assumed Liabilities. In addition, the Company will update
the Transaction Balance Sheet and Illustrative Purchase Price Schedule with
actual financials as of the Closing Date (to be delivered in conjunction with
the Final Statement of the Remaining Assets)  The Transaction Balance Sheet
will be calculated in accordance with the methodologies presented herein,
including, where applicable, the value of certain Excluded Assets and Excluded
Liabilities  The Transaction Balance Sheet will be adjusted for all valuation
adjustments by asset and liability category (the "Purchase Price Schedule") 
The Company and Buyer will further create mutually agreed supporting schedules
for the Ginnie Mae Closing and the PLS Closing, to the extent such closings
are separate from the closing for all other assets  The Transaction Balance
Sheet for the Estimated Closing Statement will be prepared at the time and in
the manner described in the Agreement  The Company will also prepare and
deliver to the Buyer an updated Illustrative Purchase Price Calculation
(including the Internal Reference Materials referenced below) each month prior
to the Closing Date and in no event later than 30 days following month end,
along with supporting information  The unaudited Transaction Balance Sheet
for 3/31/19 and the Purchase Price Adjustments are detailed herein for
illustrative purposes only; however, the Parties acknowledge and agree that
the Transaction Balance Sheet as of 3/31/19 is an important component of the
calculation of the Purchase Price and is intended to serve as the baseline
from which changes in application of GAAP or key assumptions would need to be
warranted by changes in specific facts and circumstances related to the
Company's assets and liabilities  The parties agree that the Illustrative
Purchase Price Calculation is further supported by agreed upon methodologies
included in a separate file labeled "Internal Reference Materials"(2) (1) For
the avoidance of doubt, the Transaction Balance Sheet and Purchase Price
Schedule will continue to use the Company's historical practices in accordance
with GAAP, appropriately adjusted for the agreed upon Transaction Accounting
Principles (2) The Internal Reference Materials have been agreed to by the
Company and the Buyer and are located in the data room in folder "6.0 Forward
Stalking Horse Support Documents" 2

statements as of 3/31/19; This slide is intended to provide an overall picture
of how the Acquired Assets, Assumed Liabilities, Excluded Assets and Excluded
Liabilities tie to the Company's Balance Sheet. All Excluded Assets and
Liabilities estimates are preliminary calculations and subject to change based
on amounts that are "To Be Determined" and definitions and methodologies
detailed herein, subject to Buyer agreement (1) All assets of the Company,
excluding assets and liabilities of the Reverse Business (2) The Company and
Buyer acknowledge that there is a group of assets and liabilities under the
status "To Be Determined" that requires additional transition planning to
determine if the asset / liability will be Acquired, Assumed or Excluded. The
Company and Buyer will cooperate in good faith to mutually agree on the
appropriate Acquired, Assumed or Excluded designation for these assets and
liabilities based on the final employee transfer schedule, Transferred
Contract list, transition planning and transition services provided. For
illustrative purposes, all "To Be Determined" assets and liabilities are
assumed to be Acquired Assets and Assumed Liabilities, however components may
be excluded as mutually agreed upon (3) Preliminary estimates for Excluded
Assets and Excluded Liabilities. See the Acquired Assets Adjustments Support
and Assumed Liabilities Adjustments Support pages herein for additional
definitions and detail (4) In the event that the PLS Holdback is exercised,
the PLS MSRs, Advances and related liabilities will become Excluded Assets and
Excluded Liabilities (5) The Company's balance sheet contains PPandE assets and
offsetting lease liabilities related to real estate leases. Since the purchase
price formula does not provide any value for this related PPandE, both the asset
and liability shall be excluded for purposes of the Transaction Balance Sheet
and Purchase Price Calculation (6) Reflects a preliminary estimate for
liabilities that may be compromised in the bankruptcy case and is subject to
change based on ongoing work by the Company and Buyer's acceptance or
rejection of Transferred Contracts. Certain liabilities subject to compromise
may end up being assumed by the Buyer, in particular certain liabilities
related to the Tempe, Fort Washington and other leased facilities. Changes are
subject to Buyer agreement 3

Advance Pricing and Escrow Methodology 1. Advance Assets will be segmented
into 3 categories to reflect NRZ's purchase price formula a. Advance assets on
Active Loans (both Corporate and PandI) (NRZ purchase price equal to 100% of net
book value) b. Advance assets on Liquidated Loans (NRZ purchase price equal to
50% of net book value) c. Advance assets on GSE Sold Loans (NRZ purchase price
equal to 50% of net book value) 2. Process for Estimating Advance Assets as of
Closing a. The starting point will be the prior month general ledger advance
assets (net of reserves, net of servicer payables related to credit advance
balances, if any). For example, if closing will be on 7/31/19 (after the close
of business), 6/30/19 will be used as the starting point for the roll-forward
b. The gross advance assets will then be rolled forward each business day to
reflect gross cash disbursements, receipts and in-transit recoveries
(including known settlements on liquidated loans and known settlements that
are taking place from that day until the Closing Date and in-transit
reimbursements) until a mutually agreeable Cut-Off Day (the "Cut-Off-Day").
Note that GAAP reserves and servicer payables are not calculated on an intra
month basis so they will remain equal to the prior month GAAP balances
(adjusted for known differences since then) until the following month end
close and will be subject to the post-closing true-up c. The advance assets as
of the Cut-Off Day will be multiplied by a mutually agreeable Estimated
Closing Factor (a TBD amount) as a good faith estimate of the Estimated
Advance Assets as of Closing d. The Estimated Advance Assets as of Closing
will then be multiplied by NRZ's purchase price formula (for each category) to
reflect the Estimated Purchase Price of Advance Assets (for each category) e.
The Estimated Purchase Price of Advance Assets equals estimated gross advances
net of any reserves or servicer payables as of the prior month adjusted for
known differences 3. Mutually agreeable selection of the Cut-Off Day and the
Estimated Closing Factor a. Ditech will provide buyer with a schedule of
historical results (starting as of 3/31/19 through the latest available), will
track go-forward activity each business day, and will produce "trial" results
for May through the month prior to closing such that the Buyer and Seller can
select a mutually agreeable Cut-Off Day and Estimated Closing Factor 10

Accounting Principles: Reserves  

  

 ![](nrz2019630exh210434.jpg) 

Accounting Reserve Support  The reserve and liability categories below and on
the following pages represent certain accounting reserves and contingent
liabilities currently recorded by the Company in accordance with GAAP.  These
reserves and liabilities will continue to be maintained and updated consistent
with historical application through the Closing Date Reserve / Liability
Reserve / Liability Calculation Methodology Interest Curtailment Liabilities .
The interest curtailment liability has a 100% reserve for curtailments due to
missed timelines as defined within the Agency guidelines. (ICL) Liability is
established on FHA, VA and USDA serviced loans in EverBank EBO portfolio or in
GNMA, FNMA and FHLMC portfolios. . EverBank EBO portfolio ICLs relates to May
2015 EverBank Early Buy Out (EBO) MSR acquisition - Ditech is liable to
EverBank for curtailments incurred due to Ditech\'s servicing deficiencies on
these loans that end in foreclosure, which are not reimbursable by FHA/VA (per
HUD/VA agency guidelines). . GNMA, FNMA, and FHLMC related ICL - represents
future expected losses on loans that haven\'t been bought out of the GNMA,
FNMA, and FHLMC pool yet. When the loans are bought out of the pools, GNMA,
FNMA, and FHLMC pools will be made whole for the loan and the corresponding
reserve for misses is reclassified to the foreclosure receivable reserve (see
below) held as a "contra-asset" (i.e. a reduction to the foreclosure
receivable). Ditech will file a claim with the guarantor and guarantor will
curtail Ditech for servicing deficiencies on these loans. Thus, there is no
settlement needed with GN, FN, FH related to these curtailments. Pre-
Foreclosure: . Pre-FCL missed first legal is calculated on delinquent loans
based on days past last paid installment multiplied by an average loss, less a
cure rate assumption based on historical reinstatements. A curtailment reserve
is also calculated for estimated reasonable diligence misses, using a
percentage of the population multiplied by average loss less cure rate
assumption. Post-Foreclosure: . Post-FCL reserve consists of 100% missed
timelines as well as VA Buydowns within the EBO portfolio as required by
contract. Missed first legal is based on first legal dates as tracked within
the FCL workstation and based on the calculation of interest at the debenture
rate from the date of missed first legal or through the month of conveyance,
if occurred. For VA it is the interest from the required FCL start date, if
missed, through the current month, or the month that EverBank was made whole
on their PandI. All other missed timelines are reserved based on curtailments as
reported by the Claims filing team. Reserve on VA Buydowns is the difference
between the FMV of the property per the VA and the current UPB at the time of
FCL. NPL/Loans Sold - Advance . Reserve on sold and subserviced FNMA and FHLMC
portfolios for potential losses as a result of advances not recovered from the
Curtailment Liability(1) borrower/investor due to Ditech operational and
servicing errors. Consideration is also given for impact of non-servicer
errors/risk characteristics in evaluating risk. . Reserve on sold portfolios
is established at time of MSR sale based on existing advance reserve balance.
(1) Reserve on subserviced advance portfolios have curtailment expense
recorded based on the advance reserve methodology of the owned advance
population. 17  

  

 ![](nrz2019630exh210435.jpg) 

Accounting Reserve Support (cont.) Reserve / Liability Reserve / Liability
Calculation Methodology Advance Reserves . Protective advances are evaluated
for impairment under ASC Topic 450 (FAS 5), Loss Contingencies, and ASC Topic
310 (FAS 114), Impairment Evaluation. Protective advances are deemed to be
impaired when the Company concludes a loss is both probable and reasonably
estimable at the date of measurement. There are a variety of factors and
different points in the advance life cycle affecting impairment of advances
including: loan delinquency, advances not entirely meeting investor and/or GSE
guidelines, including obtaining necessary exceptions/approvals or outside
liquidation claim timing, and provisions within the MSR and Subservicing
contracts. Certain advances are evaluated for impairment based on factors
noted above and reserved for with specific reserves. Other advances in
homogenous pools not considered impaired are evaluated based on historical
loss or prepayment probability depending on advance repayment sources. .
Protective advance balances at the end of each reporting period are balanced
to the general ledger to ensure completeness and accuracy of advance
populations used for allowance for uncollectible advance calculations. Reserve
rates/amounts are determined with consideration of risks that lead to
potential uncollectability/impairment, including investor/trust servicing
agreements, borrower collection, and historical recovery/claim curtailment
experience. GSE Loans - Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac . Loans insured by Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac are evaluated for risk, including likelihood of borrower
re-payment and advances outside of investor servicing guidelines utilizing
statistical sampling (escrow advance, foreclosure legal and property
preservation) and historical loss experience (remaining expenses). Advances
deemed non-recoverable or outside of liquidation advance claim trigger
timelines are reserved at 100%. Government Loans - FHA, VA and Early Buy-Outs .
FHA insured borrower and investor recoverable advances are reserved based on
loan delinquency roll rates and investor requirement of one-third curtailment
of legal expenses (including considerations such as advances not meeting
guidelines and being outside liquidation claim timing). Escrow advances are
reserved at historical loss rates (including considerations such as advances
not meeting guidelines and being outside liquidation claim timing). VA insured
loan advance reserves are based on total indebtedness, including advances,
compared to the net value based on the VA guidelines (including principal
loss, considerations such as advances not meeting guidelines and being outside
liquidation claim timing). Home Equity and Manufactured Home Loans .
Portfolios where the Pooling and Servicing Agreements require Ditech to incur
a loss when sale proceeds do not repay outstanding advance balances utilize
historical losses to determine allowance for uncollectible advances. .
Management Imprecision - This component of overall reserve is based on
qualitative factors for risk from uncertainty with estimated curtailment rates
applied by investors and exposure on pre-acquisition balances billed back to
prior servicers. Includes assessment of aged and rejected advances on both
liquidated and non-liquidated loans having higher risk exposures, as well as,
advances tied to indem/settlement activities. Legal settlements . Reserve is
based on an active matter list generated from the Legal Tracker system. Lead
attorney assesses the probability of loss for each case and updates potential
liability range (low and high). Reserve is established for all cases deemed
probable using the low end of the range. The matter is closed in the Legal
Tracker system and the reserve released after the court settlement when
documents related to settlement have been recorded and received, and the
matter is resolved according to the settlement (payments issued, other).
Adjustments primarily impact GLs - 5205015 Litigation Settlement, 2000244
Accrued Legal Settlements and 2999244 Accrued Legal Legal Settlements -
Principal . Reserve is established for all cases where a principal write-down
is deemed probable. The reserve is based on the same active matter list as
Legal Balances Settlements. The lead attorney assesses if there is any asset
exposure for all active matters and updates an asset exposure estimate field
for any matters deemed probable. The reserve can continue to be carried after
the active litigation has been settled and the matter is closed in Legal
Tracker, if the business deems that there is ongoing asset exposure. The
reserve is assessed monthly and quarterly. Adjustments primarily impact GLs -

Accounting Reserve Support (cont.) Reserve / Liability Reserve / Liability
Calculation Methodology Origination Rep and Warrant . Conventional Production -
Rep and Warrant reserves calculated using a two tier methodology for initial
reviews by the GSE's and future Reserve projected defaults. The results of
each tier are added together for the final provision amount. The first tier is
the review probability (based on historical review rates by loan
characteristic) x estimated resale haircut (based on historical scratch and
dent execution levels) x estimated defect rate (based on historical defect
experience) x estimated client recovery rate (for Correspondent clients only
based on observed recovery rates on repurchased loans). The second tier is the
projected default rate by product (based on Applied Financial Technology - AFT
behavioral model projections on serviced MSR portfolio) x estimated resale
haircut (based on historical scratch and dent execution levels) x estimated
defect rate (based on historical defect experience) x estimated client
recovery rate (for Correspondent clients only based on observed recovery rates
on repurchased loans) . Government Production - Rep and Warrant reserves
calculated using a two tier methodology for uninsurable loans and future
projected defaults for non Correspondent production. The results of each tier
are added together for the final provision amount. The first tier is the
uninsurable rates (based on historical by production channel) x estimated
resale haircut (based on historical scratch and dent execution levels) x
estimated client recovery rate (for Correspondent clients only based on
observed recovery rates on repurchased loans). The second tier is the
projected default rate by product (based on Applied Financial Technology - AFT
behavioral model projections on serviced MSR portfolio) x estimated resale
haircut (based on historical scratch and dent execution levels) x estimated
defect rate (based on historical defect experience). The second tier portion
of the calculation is only applied for Consumer, Broker, and Correspondent
loans where Ditech was the underwriter . Qualitative Factor - In addition to
the baseline calculations described, the Company applies an assumption factor
to the Resale Haircut and the Correspondent Recovery rate, in order to capture
effects of longer term economic markets on the recently observed activity
being utilized in the baseline assumptions. Repurchase Obligation Buckets .
Data is sourced into a sharepoint site and database with data received from
FCL, legal/title curative teams, property preservation, loss mitigation,
investor repurchase groups, etc. and are categorized into the following
buckets Notice of Defects (NODs), . \'NODs reserved at a rate of $35
multiplied by number of days since indemnification notice. Title and Property
Preservation FNMA/FHLMC . Indemnification liability is recorded at 90% of the
billed amount based on historical experience. Indemnification Liability
FNMA/FHLMC . Repurchases are reserved at Total Debt, which typically include
outstanding UPB, interest accruals through current date, advances open
Repurchase/Make-whole and reimbursed and other fees, net of probable
recoveries. 19

Accounting Principles: Pipeline and Inventory Mortgage Loan Pricing  

  

 ![](nrz2019630exh210443.jpg) 

Pipeline and Inventory Mortgage Loan Pricing The purpose of this document is
to describe pricing principles to be used to calculate the fair value for
Ditech Financial LLC's ("Ditech" or the "Seller") loan pipeline and inventory
of newly originated held for sale mortgage loans. Capitalized terms used but
not otherwise defined herein have the meanings given to them in the Asset
Purchase Agreement. The loan pipeline includes the Consumer Direct and
Wholesale Pipeline Loans and the Correspondent Pipeline Loans. Upon
acquisition of Consumer Direct and Wholesale Pipeline Loans in accordance with
the Asset Purchase Agreement, such loans shall become Acquired Consumer Direct
and Wholesale Loans. As described in the Illustrative Purchase Price
Calculation and the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Correspondent Pipeline Loans
and Acquired Consumer Direct and Wholesale Loans are Acquired Assets and the
Consumer Direct and Wholesale Pipeline Loans are Excluded Assets. Loan Tape,
Pricing and Settlement Correspondent Pipeline Loans and HFS Loans Ditech shall
provide to Buyer a loan tape of the Correspondent Pipeline Loans and funded
held for sale loan inventory that is eligible for sale to the relevant
Mortgage Agency (the "Residential Loans") as of the close of business, two
Business Days prior to the Closing Date ("T-2") and the balance of such
Correspondent Pipeline Loans and Residential Loans will be used in the
preparation of the applicable Initial Statement. The Residential Loans and the
Correspondent Pipeline Loans will be priced using the agreed upon accounting
principles, which are materially described below, using market pricing as of
3:00pm ET one Business Day after the loan tape was provided to the Buyer
("T-1"). The Sellers agree that the Residential Loans and the Correspondent
Pipeline Loans in the tape delivered to the Buyer will not be sold to a third
party or delivered to any Mortgage Agency between T- 2 and the Closing Date.
The Buyer agrees to purchase all of the Correspondent Pipeline Loans and
Residential Loans and, unless otherwise directed by the Buyer in writing, the
Sellers will not accept or issue any new correspondent lock commitments on or
after the Closing Date. Sellers will provide Buyer a loan tape for any
additional loans added to the Correspondent Pipeline Loans between T-2 and the
Closing Date, and the Buyer will provide pricing for such loans using the
agreed upon accounting principles, which are materially described below, and
the 3:00pm ET market pricing the day after the loan tape was provided.
Consumer Direct and Wholesale Pipeline Loans The Acquired Consumer Direct and
Wholesale Loans will not transfer to the Buyer at Closing and will be retained
by the Sellers until they transfer to Buyer in accordance with this document
and the Asset Purchase Agreement. At T-2, Sellers will provide Buyer a loan
tape with all Consumer Direct and Wholesale Pipeline Loans and Buyer will
provide Sellers with loan prices for each Consumer Direct and Wholesale
Pipeline Loan on the loan tape (using the loan pricing principles including
the MSR Considerations described below). The Buyer will acquire the Acquired
Consumer Direct and Wholesale Loans on the later of (i) the date on which such
loans are funded and (ii) the date on which the required documents are
delivered by the Sellers to Buyer. Sellers will provide Buyer a loan tape for
any additional Consumer Direct and Wholesale Pipeline Loans for which locks
are accepted between T-2 and the Closing Date, and the Buyer will provide
pricing for such loans using the agreed upon accounting principles, which are
described below, and the 3:00pm ET market pricing the day after the loan tape
was provided. Unless otherwise directed by the Buyer, the Sellers will not
accept or issue any new Consumer or Wholesale locks after the Closing Date.
All locks accepted or issued prior to the Closing date or accepted or issued
by the Seller at the written direction of the Buyer on or after the Closing
date will be purchased by the Buyer. In Process Loans Loans in the pipeline
and HFS Loans that were not included in an Initial Statement, will be sold to
the Buyer as loans fund and become eligible for sale to the relevant Mortgage
Agency. One Business Day after loan tapes are delivered to the Buyer, the
parties will affirm the previously agreed upon price. The loans will be
settled as follows: • Loans that fund between T-2 and the Closing Date
(including the Closing Date) and are eligible for sale between T-2 and the
Closing Date (including the Closing Date) will be included in the Adjustment
Residential Loans. Such loans will be settled in accordance with the Asset
Purchase Agreement. The Sellers agree that such loans will not be sold to a
third party or delivered to any Mortgage Agency prior to the Closing Date
(including the Closing Date). • Loans that fund after the Closing Date or are
eligible for sale to the relevant Mortgage Agency only after the Closing Date
will be settled two Business Days after the Buyer has confirmed that the
relevant loan characteristics is in accordance with the pipeline pricing
provided to the Sellers. The pricing for such loans will include all
adjustments for accrued interest, escrows, value paid by the Sellers while
such loan was locked and other commercially reasonable adjustments. 26

Pipeline and Inventory Mortgage Loan Pricing (cont.) Pricing Calculations 
The proceeds for held for sale newly originated residential loans that are
determined to be eligible for sale and are considered as Acquired Assets
within the Asset Purchase Agreement will be calculated, subject to the pricing
principles above, by taking the agreed upon market value price ("MP") divided
by 100 times the unpaid principal balance ("UPB") o MP/100 x UPB o Example:
102.00/100 x $100,000.00 = $102,000.00  The proceeds for the Correspondent
Pipeline Loans that are Acquired Assets will be calculated, subject to the
pricing principles above, by taking the net of the MP less the correspondent
acquisition cost ("CC") divided by 100 times the UPB times the pull through
rate ("PT") o (MP- CC)/100 x 100,000.00 x PT o Example: (102.00-101.00)/100 x
$100,000.00 x 95% = $950.00 . Related to the Correspondent Pipeline Loans,
Ditech will consider the impact of pull through and changes in loan pricing
due to loan characteristics, including but not limited to, FICO, LTV, UPB,
term, product, lock date, et al, through the date on which the Final Closing
Statement is provided to the Buyer. Pricing for the adjusted characteristics
will revert back to the original pricing date.  The proceeds for the Consumer
Direct and Wholesale Pipeline Loans, when eligible for sale in accordance with
the Asset Purchase Agreement, will be calculated, subject to the pricing
principles above, by taking the MP divided by 100 times the UPB. o MP/100 x
UPB o Example: 102.00/100 x $100,000.00 = $102,000.00 29

Pipeline and Inventory Mortgage Loan Pricing (cont.) MSR Considerations . Per
the terms outlined in this document, MSRs that are recaptured from loans that
have been sold to the Buyer under the MSRPA as of the Closing Date will be
transferred to the Buyer at $0 value. Such pricing adjustment will be
considered in the value of any funded loans that are acquired by the Buyer. .
In addition, there will be an adjustment to the aggregate recaptured
population related to the servicing fee strip, provided such adjustment is
greater than $100,000. The payment will be calculated by taking the original
UPB times the difference of the new servicing fee strip minus the old
servicing fee strip times a 4.00x multiple for 30yr MSRs (2.50x multiple for
15yr MSRs). 30

Pricing for All Other Loans and REO  "All Other Loans and REO" are defined as
all whole loans and REO owned by the Company other than HFS, loans held in
non-residual trusts, and GNMA ROAP consolidated loans.  Parties will mutually
agree prior to closing to a loan pricing grid that includes: i. Loan and REO
sub-categories and ii. A fixed purchase price as a percentage of par balance
for each sub-category  The loan and REO sub-categories will capture 100% of
All Other Loans and REO as of 3/31/19 and will split the loans and REO by
status and by collateral type  If necessary, the Company and Buyer will
develop additional sub-categories and pricing to accommodate changes in asset
mix between 3/31/19 and the Closing Date  At closing, the pricing grid will
be applied as agreed by Buyer and Sellers to calculate the purchase price of
all "Other Loans and REO" included in the Acquired Assets  In the event
collateral changes between 3/31/19 and the Closing Date, the weighted average
aggregate purchase price at closing may vary from the aggregate purchase price
at 3/31/19.  As summarized on the following page, when applying the pricing
grid to the par balance of the Company's All Other Loans and REO as of
3/31/19, the implied purchase price prior to applying the portfolio discount
will equal the Company's GAAP Book Value as of 3/31/19.  Buyer will pay costs
relating to transfer of tax contracts up to a maximum of $20,000. Any cost in
excess of the $20,000 being paid by buyer will be a reduction to the Purchase
Price or paid by the Seller 32

Section 3.13 Intellectual Property (c) 1. To the extent the Ditech brand logos
are included in the Acquired Assets, on July 25, 2018, Ditech Financial LLC
issued a Trademark Infringement Cease and Desist Notice to Doxo, Inc. ("Doxo")
in connection with Doxo's use of the Ditech Trademarks without Ditech's
permission or license on its website Doxo.com. In response, Doxo did remove
some of the Ditech Trademarks from the Doxo website but there are still visual
depictions of Ditech's website and other proprietary information. At this
point, the Sellers have not pursued further action against Doxo. 2. By letter
dated November 14, 2018, PrimeLending, A PlainsCapital Company, Inc.
("PrimeLending") asserted that Ditech Financial LLC was infringing on
PrimeLending's federal trademark registration of "Home Loans Made Simple"
(Reg. No. 5,2333,641). PrimeLending claimed that Ditech Financial LLC was
using "Home Loans Made Simple" in its HTML code and sporadically on its
website. PrimeLending claimed such uses constituted trademark infringement,
false designation or origin, unfair competition, and trademark dilution in
violation of federal and state statutory and common law rights. As such,
PrimeLending requested that Ditech Financial LLC immediately remove "Home
Loans Made Simple" from its HTML code and website and permanently refrain from
using the trademark. In response, Ditech Financial LLC removed "Home Loans
Made Simple" from its HTML code and its website, and it took steps with Google
to have references to the trademark scrubbed and homepage metadata updated.
Until those references no longer exist, the trademark may appear linked on
Internet searches with Ditech Financial LLC URLs (even though landing page
URLs are listed, the trademark is not contained on the landing pages for such
URLs.) Finally, some websites that are not controlled by nor affiliated with
Ditech Financial LLC persist in linking Ditech Financial LLC with the
trademark. It is expected that such websites will periodically update and that
the link between Ditech Financial LLC and the trademark will disappear over
time. (f) 1. In August of 2014, the Company was notified by the United States
Secret Service of potential unauthorized access to certain computer
applications residing on servers operated on behalf of Ditech Financial LLC.
The Company retained a team of forensic experts to investigate the incident to
determine the scope of the data, if any, that was susceptible to unauthorized
access. The forensic investigation did not identify conclusive evidence that
data was in fact improperly accessed. 38
