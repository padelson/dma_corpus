1.3 _Certain Interpretations_.

 

(a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article or a Section,
such reference is to an Article or a Section of this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated, and references to "paragraphs" or "clauses" are to
separate paragraphs or clauses of the Section or subsection in which the
reference occurs. When a reference is made in this Agreement to a Schedule or
Exhibit, such reference is to a Schedule or Exhibit to this Agreement, as
applicable, unless otherwise indicated.

 

(b) When used herein, (i) the words "hereof," "herein" and "herewith" and
words of similar import will, unless otherwise stated, be construed to refer
to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement; and (ii) the words "include," "includes" and "including" will be
deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without limitation." When
used herein, the phrase "the date hereof" means "the date of this Agreement."

 

(c) Unless the context otherwise requires, "neither," "nor," "any,"
"either" and "or" are not exclusive.

(d) The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" means the degree to
which a subject or other thing extends, and does not simply mean "if."

(e) When used in this Agreement, references to "$" or "Dollars" are
references to U.S. dollars.

(f) The meaning assigned to each capitalized term defined and used in this
Agreement is equally applicable to both the singular and the plural forms of
such term, and words denoting any gender include all genders. Where a word or
phrase is defined in this Agreement, each of its other grammatical forms has
a corresponding meaning.

(g) When reference is made to any party to this Agreement or any other
agreement or document, such reference includes such Partys successors and
permitted assigns. References to any Person include the successors and
permitted assigns of that Person.

 



17

    

(h) Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in
this Agreement to the Subsidiaries of a Person will be deemed to include all
direct and indirect Subsidiaries of such entity.

 

(i) When used herein, references to "ordinary course" or "ordinary course
of business" will be construed to mean "ordinary course of business,
consistent with past practices."

(j) A reference to any specific legislation or to any provision of any
legislation includes any amendment to, and any modification, re-enactment or
successor thereof, any legislative provision substituted therefor and all
rules, regulations and statutory instruments issued thereunder or pursuant
thereto, except that, for purposes of any representations and warranties in
that Agreement that are made as a specific date, references to any specific
legislation will be deemed to refer to such legislation or provision (and all
rules, regulations and statutory instruments issued thereunder or pursuant
thereto) as of such date. A reference to "law" will refer to any legislation,
statute, law (including common law), ordinance, rule, regulation or stock
exchange listing requirement, as applicable. References to any agreement or
Contract are to that agreement or Contract as amended, modified or
supplemented from time to time, and any exhibits, schedules,
annexes, statements of work, riders and other documents attached thereto.

(k) All accounting terms used herein will be interpreted, and all
accounting determinations hereunder will be made, in accordance with GAAP. An
item arising with respect to a specific representation or warranty will be
deemed to be "reflected on" or "set forth in" a balance sheet or financial
statements, to the extent that any such phrase appears in such representation
or warranty, if (i) there is a reserve, accrual or other similar item
underlying a number on such balance sheet or financial statements that
is specifically related to such item; or (ii) such item is specifically set
forth on the balance sheet or financial statements or is specifically set
forth in the notes thereto (provided that an amount with respect to such item
is included in such notes), in each case of clauses (i) and (ii), if an
amount is so shown or set forth on such balance sheet or financial statement
or notes thereto, solely to the extent of such amount.

 

(l) The table of contents and headings set forth in this Agreement are for
convenience of reference purposes only and will not affect or be deemed to
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement or any term
or provision hereof.

 

(m) The measure of a period of one month or year for purposes of this
Agreement will be the date of the following month or year corresponding to
the starting date. If no corresponding date exists, then the end date of such
period being measured will be the next actual date of the following month or
year (for example, one month following May 18 is June 18 and one month
following May 31 is July 1). When calculating the period of time before which,
within which or following which any act is to be done or step taken pursuant
to this Agreement, the date that is the reference date in calculating such
period will be excluded. References to "from" or "through" any date mean,
unless otherwise specified, from and including or through and including such
date, respectively.

 

(n) The Parties agree that they have been represented by legal counsel
during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and therefore waive
the application of any law, regulation, holding or rule of construction
providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be construed
against the Party drafting such agreement or document.

 

(o) No summary of this Agreement or any Exhibit or Schedule delivered
herewith prepared by or on behalf of any Party will affect the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement or such Exhibit or Schedule.

matter whatsoever, including (i) any violation of law or breach of contract;
or (ii) that such information is material or that such information is required
to be referred to or disclosed under this Agreement. Disclosure of any
information or document in the Company Disclosure Letter is not a statement
or admission that it is material or required to be disclosed in the Company
Disclosure Letter. Nothing in the Company Disclosure Letter constitutes an
admission against the Companys interest or represents the Companys legal
position or legal rights on the matter so disclosed. No reference in this
Agreement to dollar amount thresholds will be deemed to be evidence of a
Company Material Adverse Effect or materiality.

negotiations among the Parties and are for the sole benefit of the Parties.
Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver
by the Parties in accordance with Section 8.5 without notice or liability to
any other Person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in
this Agreement may represent an allocation among the Parties of risks
associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the
Parties. Consequently, Persons other than the Parties may not rely on
the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date hereof or as of any other date.

demands for payment in respect of Dissenting Company Shares. For purposes of
this Section 2.7(d)(ii), "participate" means that Parent I will be kept
apprised of proposed strategy and other significant decisions with respect to
demands for appraisal pursuant to the DGCL in respect of Dissenting Company
Shares (to the extent that the attorney-client privilege between the Company
and its counsel is not undermined or otherwise affected), and Parent I may
offer comments or suggestions with respect to such demands but will not be
afforded any decision-making power or other authority over such demands except
for the payment, settlement or compromise consent set forth above.

2.9 _Exchange of_ _Certificates_.

 

(a) _Payment Agent_. Prior to the Closing, (i) Parent I will select a bank or
trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the payment
agent for the Mergers (the "Payment Agent"); and (ii) the Parent Entities will
enter into a payment agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to the Company, with such Payment Agent.

 

(b) _Exchange Fund_. At or prior to the Closing, the Parent Entities will
deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Payment Agent, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds, for payment to the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock, Company Class B Stock, Company Class C Stock, and
Holdings Units pursuant to Section 2.7, an amount of cash equal to the
aggregate consideration to which such holders become entitled pursuant to
Section 2.7; _provided_ , that the Company Parties shall, at the written
request of Parent I, deposit with the Payment Agent at the Closing
such portion of such aggregate consideration from the Company Groups Cash on
Hand as specified in such request. Until disbursed in accordance with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, such cash will be invested by the
Payment Agent, as directed by the Parent Entities or the Surviving Entities,
in (i) obligations of or fully guaranteed by the United States or any agency
or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the
United States with a maturity of no more than 30 days; (ii) commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. 

 



27

    

 or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively; or (iii) certificates of
deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial
banks with capital exceeding $1,000,000,000 (based on the most recent
financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available) (such cash
and any proceeds thereon, the "Exchange Fund"). To the extent that (A) there
are any losses with respect to any investments of the Exchange Fund; (B) the
Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the
Payment Agent to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by Section 2.7; or
(C) all or any portion of the Exchange Fund is unavailable for the Parent
Entities (or the Payment Agent on behalf of the Parent Entities) to promptly
pay the cash amounts contemplated by Section 2.7 for any reason, Parent
Entities will, or will cause the Surviving Entities to, promptly replace or
restore the amount of cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the
Exchange Fund is at all times fully available for distribution and maintained
at a level sufficient for the Payment Agent to make the payments contemplated
by Section 2.7. Any income from investment of the Exchange Fund will be
payable to the Parent Entities or the Surviving Entities, as Parent I directs.

 

(c) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly following the Closing (and in any event
within three Business Days following the Closing), the Parent Entities and
the Surviving Entities will cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of
record (as of immediately prior to the Holdings Merger Effective Time or the
Company Merger Effective Time, as applicable) of (i) a certificate or
certificates that immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock (other than Owned
Holdings Units, Dissenting Company Shares and Owned Company Shares,
as applicable) (the "Certificates"); (ii) uncertificated shares of Company
Capital Stock (other than Owned Holdings Units, Dissenting Company Shares and
Owned Company Shares, as applicable) (the "Uncertificated Shares") and (iii)
Holdings Units, (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which will
specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Payment
Agent); and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates, Uncertificated Shares and Holdings Units, as applicable, in
exchange for the Per Share Price, Class B Per Share Price, Class C Per Share
Price or Per Unit Price, as applicable, payable in respect thereof pursuant to
Section 2.7. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Payment
Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holders of
such Certificates will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount
in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number
of shares of Company Capital Stock, as applicable, represented by such
Certificate; by (y) the Per Share Price, Class B Per Share Price, or Class C
Per Share Price, as applicable (less any applicable withholding Taxes payable
in respect thereof), and the Certificates so surrendered will forthwith be
cancelled. Upon receipt of an "agents message" by the Payment Agent (or such
other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Payment Agent may reasonably
request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the
holders of such Uncertificated Shares will be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1)
the aggregate number of shares of Company Capital Stock, as applicable,
represented by such holders transferred Uncertificated Shares; by (2) the Per
Share Price, Class B Per Share Price, or Class C Per Share Price, as
applicable (less any applicable withholding Taxes payable in respect
thereof), and the transferred Uncertificated Shares so surrendered will be
cancelled. Upon receipt of an "agents message" by the Payment Agent (or such
other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Payment Agent may reasonably
request) in the case of a transfer of Holdings Units, the holders of such
Holdings Units will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in
cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the aggregate number
of Holdings Units so held; by (2) the Per Unit Price (less any applicable
withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof), and the transferred Holdings
Units so surrendered will be cancelled. The Payment Agent will accept such
Certificates and transferred Uncertificated Shares and Holdings Units upon
compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Payment Agent may
impose to cause an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange
practices. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of
the Certificates, Uncertificated Shares and Holdings Units on the Per Share
Price, Class B Per Share Price, Class C Per Share Price or Per Unit Price, as
applicable, payable upon the surrender of such Certificates and
Uncertificated Units or Uncertificated Shares pursuant to this Section 2.9(c).
Until so surrendered,

 



28

    

 outstanding Certificates, Uncertificated Shares and Holdings Units will be
deemed from and after the Holdings Merger Effective Time or the Company Merger
Effective Time, as applicable, to evidence only the right to receive the Per
Share Price, Class B Per Share Price, Class C Per Share Price or Per Unit
Price, as applicable, without interest thereon, payable in respect thereof
pursuant to Section 2.7. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, no holder of Uncertificated Shares or Holdings Units will be
required to provide a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the
Payment Agent in order to receive the payment that such holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to Section 2.7.

(d) _DTC Payment_. Prior to the Closing, the Parent Entities and the
Company will cooperate to establish procedures with the Payment Agent and the
Depository Trust Company ("DTC") with the objective that (i) if the Closing
occurs at or prior to 11:30 a.m., Eastern time, on the Closing Date, then the
Payment Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominees on the Closing Date an
amount in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, equal to (A)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Owned Company Shares
and Dissenting Company Shares) held of record by DTC or such nominee
immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time; multiplied by (B) the
Per Share Price (such amount, the "DTC Payment"); and (ii) if the Closing
occurs after 11:30 a.m., Eastern time, on the Closing Date, then the Payment
Agent will transmit the DTC Payment to DTC or its nominees on the first
Business Day after the Closing Date.

 

(e) _Transfers of Ownership_. Subject, in all cases, to the terms and
conditions of the Charter in respect of Company Capital Stock, if a transfer
of ownership of shares of Company Capital Stock is not registered in the stock
transfer books or ledger of the Company or if the Per Share Price, Class B Per
Share Price, or Class C Per Share Price, as applicable, is to be paid in a
name other than that in which the Certificates surrendered or transferred in
exchange therefor are registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the
Company, the Per Share Price, Class B Per Share Price, or Class C Per Share
Price, as applicable, may be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the Certificate so surrendered or transferred is registered in the stock
transfer books or ledger of the Company, as applicable, only if
such Certificate is properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for
surrender and transfer and the Person requesting such payment has paid to the
Parent Entities (or any agent designated by the Parent Entities) any transfer
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Per Share Price, Class B Per
Share Price, or Class C Per Share Price, as applicable, to a Person other than
the registered holder of such Certificate, or established to the satisfaction
of the Parent Entities (or any agent designated by the Parent Entities) that
such transfer Taxes have been paid or are otherwise not payable. Payment of
the Per Share Price, Class B Per Share Price, or Class C Per Share Price or
Per Unit Price, as applicable, with respect to Uncertificated Shares or
Holdings Units will only be made to the Person in whose name such
Uncertificated Shares or Holdings Units are registered in the stock transfer
books or ledger of Holdings or the Company, as applicable.

 

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, the Parent Entities, the Surviving
LLC, the Surviving Corporation or any other Party will be liable to a holder
of Holdings Units or shares of Company Capital Stock, as applicable, for any
amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

(g) _Distribution of Exchange Fund to_ _Parent Entities_. Any portion of
the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the
Certificates, Uncertificated Shares or Holdings Units on the date that is one
year after the Closing Date, as applicable, will be delivered to the
Parent Entities (as directed by Parent I) upon demand, and any holders of
shares of Company Capital Stock or Holdings Units that were issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time or the
Holdings Merger Effective Time, as applicable, who have not theretofore
surrendered or transferred their Certificates or Uncertificated Shares
representing such shares of Company Capital Stock or Holdings Units, as
applicable, for exchange pursuant to this Section 2.9 will thereafter look
for payment of the Per Unit Price, Per Share Price, Class B Per Share Price,
or Class C Per Share Price, as applicable, without interest thereon, payable
in respect of the

 



29

    

 Holdings Units or shares of Company Capital Stock represented by such
Certificates, Uncertificated Units or Uncertificated Shares solely to the
Parent Entities (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar laws),
solely as general creditors thereof, for any claim to the Per Unit Price, Per
Share Price, Class B Per Share Price, or Class C Per Share Price, as
applicable, to which such holders may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.7.
Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of any such Certificates,
Uncertificated Shares or Holdings Units two years after the Closing Date, or
at such earlier date as is immediately prior to the time at which such amounts
would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental
Authority, will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the
property of the Surviving Entities, free and clear of any claims or interest
of any such holders (and their successors, assigns or personal
representatives) previously entitled thereto.

2.10 _No Further Ownership Rights in_ _Holdings Units or_ _Company
Capital_ _Stock_. From and after the Holdings Merger Effective Time and the
Company Merger Effective Time, as applicable, (a) all Holdings Units and
shares of Company Capital Stock will no longer be outstanding and will
automatically be cancelled, retired and cease to exist; and (b) each holder of
Holdings Units or Certificates or Uncertificated Shares theretofore
representing any shares of Company Capital Stock will cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Per Unit Price,
Per Share Price, Class B Per Share Price, or Class C Per Share Price, as
applicable, payable therefor in accordance with Section 2.7, or in the
case of Dissenting Company Shares, the rights pursuant to Section 2.7(d). The
Per Unit Price, Per Share Price, Class B Per Share Price, and Class C Per
Share Price paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II will be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such Holdings Units or shares of Company Capital Stock, as applicable. From
and after the Holdings Merger Effective Time or the Company Merger Effective
Time, as applicable, there will be no further registration of transfers on
the records of the Surviving Entities of Holdings Units or shares of Company
Capital Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Holdings Merger Effective Time or the Company Merger Effective Time, as
applicable, other than transfers to reflect, in accordance with customary
settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the Holdings Merger Effective
Time or the Company Merger Effective Time. If, after the Holdings
Merger Effective Time or the Company Merger Effective Time, as applicable,
Holdings Units, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the
Surviving Entities for any reason, they will (subject to compliance with the
exchange procedures of Section 2.9(c)) be cancelled and exchanged as provided
in this Article II.

2.11 _Lost,_ _Stolen or Destroyed_ ___Certificates_. In the event that
any Certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent will
issue in exchange therefor, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the holder thereof, the Per Share Price, Class B Per Share Price, or Class C
Per Share Price payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7. Each
Parent Entity or the Payment Agent may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the payment of such Per Share Price, Class B Per Share Price, or
Class C Per Share Price, as applicable, require the owners of such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such amount as it may
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Parent
Entities, the Surviving LLC, the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent
with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed.

 

 __2.12 _Required Withholding_. Each of the Payment Agent, the Parent
Entities, Holdings, the Company and the Surviving Entities will be entitled
to deduct and withhold from any cash amounts payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder or former holder of Holdings Units or shares of
Company Capital Stock, Company PSUs, Company RSUs, Company Options, Holdings
RSUs or Holdings Incentive Units such amounts as are required to be deducted
or withheld therefrom pursuant to any Tax laws. To the extent that such
amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the
appropriate Governmental Authority, such amounts will be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such
amounts would otherwise have been paid.

 



30

    

2.13 _No Dividends or Distributions_. No dividends or other distributions
with respect to limited liability company interests of the Surviving LLC or
the capital stock of the Surviving Corporation with a record date on or after

Uncertificated Units or Uncertificated Shares.

 

2.14 _Necessary Further Actions_. If, at any time after the Holdings
Merger Effective Time or the Company Merger Effective Time, as applicable,
any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement and to vest the Surviving LLC with full right, title and possession
to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of
Holdings or Merger Sub II, or the Surviving Corporation with full right, title
and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company or Merger Sub I, then the managers, directors and
officers of Holdings, the Company, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II as of
immediately prior to the Holdings Merger Effective Time or the Company Merger
Effective Time, as applicable, will take all such lawful and necessary action.

 

2.15 _Alternative Structure_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, prior to the Holdings Merger Effective Time,
Parent I may specify that the structure of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement be revised and the Parties shall enter into such alternative
transactions as Parent I may reasonably determine to effect the purposes of
this Agreement; _ provided, however,_ that no such revision shall be required
pursuant to this Section 2.15 if, in the reasonable determination of the
Company, such revision would reasonably be expected to (a) alter or change
the amount or kind of the consideration payable to the Companys Stockholders
or the Holdings Unitholders pursuant to this Article II, or otherwise change
the economic benefits that are intended to accrue to the Company Stockholders
or the Holdings Unitholders pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, (b) prevent, materially impede or materially
delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Equity Financing and the Closing, (c) fail to comply with the
terms of the Indenture or the Capped Call Documentation, or (d) result in any
adverse tax consequences for any of the Holdings Unitholders or
Company Stockholders; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall any
such revision be required pursuant to this Section 2.15 on or after the date

Letter only to the extent that it is reasonably apparent on the face of such
disclosure in such Recent SEC Report that it is applicable to such section of

power and authority, as applicable, to conduct its business as it is
presently being conducted and to own, lease or operate its properties and
assets. Each Company Party is duly qualified to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned or
leased or the nature of its activities make such qualification necessary (to
the extent that the concept of "good standing" is applicable in the case of
any jurisdiction outside the United States), except where the failure to be
so qualified or in good standing would not have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. The Company Parties have made available to the Parent Entities true,
correct and complete copies of the Charter, the Amended and Restated Bylaws
of the Company (the "Bylaws"), the certificate of formation of Holdings, and
the Fourth Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of
Holdings (the "Holdings LLCA"), each as amended to date. The Company is not

the Mergers. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by each Company
Party, the performance by each Company Party of its covenants and obligations
hereunder, and the consummation of the Mergers have been duly authorized and
approved by all necessary corporate action or limited liability company
action on the part of each Company Party and no additional corporate or
limited liability company actions on the part of any Company Party are
necessary to authorize (i) the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
each Company Party; (ii) the performance by each Company Party of its
covenants and obligations hereunder; or (iii) subject to the receipt of the
Requisite Stockholder Approval in the case of the Company Merger, the

delivered by each Company Party and, assuming the due authorization, execution
and delivery by the Buyer Parties, constitute a legal, valid and
binding obligation of each Company Party, enforceable against each Company
Party in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability (A) may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and
other similar laws affecting or relating to creditors rights generally; and
(B) is subject to general principles of equity (the "Enforceability
Limitations").

 

3.3 _Company Board_ _Approval; Fairness Opinion; Anti-Takeover Laws_.

 

(a) _Company Board_ _Approval_. The Company Board has (i) determined that
it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, and declared
it advisable, to enter into this Agreement and consummate the Company Merger
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; (ii) approved
the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, the performance
by the Company of its covenants and other obligations hereunder, and the
consummation of the Company Merger upon the terms and conditions set forth

this Agreement in accordance with the DGCL (collectively, the "Company Board
Recommendation"), which Company Board Recommendation has not been withdrawn,
rescinded or modified in any way as of the date hereof. In its capacity as
the sole manager of Holdings, the Company acting through the Company Board has
determined that the Holdings Merger is fair to, and in the best interests of,
Holdings and the Holdings Unitholders and has taken all necessary action to
approve the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Holdings, the
performance by Holdings of its covenants and other obligations hereunder, and
the consummation of the Holdings Merger upon the terms and conditions set
forth herein for all purposes under the Holdings LLCA and the DLLCA.

(b) _Fairness Opinion_. The Company Board has received the written
opinion (or an oral opinion to be confirmed in writing) of the Companys
financial advisor, Qatalyst Partners LP (the "Advisor"), to the effect that,
as of the date of such opinion, and based upon and subject to the various
limitations,

 



32

    

 qualifications, assumptions and other matters set forth therein, the Per
Share Price to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of
this Agreement by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (other than
any Parent Entity or any Affiliate of any Parent Entity) is fair, from a
financial point of view, to such holders (it being understood and agreed that
such written opinion is for the benefit of the Company Board and may not be
relied upon by the Buyer Parties). The Company shall, following the execution
of this Agreement by all Parties, furnish an accurate, complete and
confidential copy of said opinion letter to the Parent Entities solely for
informational purposes.

(c) _Anti-Takeover Laws_. Assuming that the representations of the Buyer
Parties set forth in Section 4.6 are true and correct, the Company Board has
taken all necessary actions so that the restrictions on business combinations
set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL and any other similar applicable "anti-
takeover" law will not be applicable to the Company Merger.

3.4 _Requisite Stockholder Approval_. Except for the affirmative vote of
the holders of a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of

affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, Company Class B Stock and Company
Class C Stock (voting together as a single class) entitled to vote to adopt
this Agreement not held by the Company Excluded Parties (the "Additional
Stockholder Approval" and together with the Statutory Stockholder Approval,
the "Requisite Stockholder Approval"). Entry into, and performance under, the
Voting Agreements by each of the Company Stockholders party thereto shall not
constitute a "Transfer" (as defined in the Charter) of any shares of Company
Class B Stock or Company Class C Stock held by such Company Stockholders.

 

3.5 _Non-Contravention_. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
by the Company Parties, the performance by the Company Parties of their
respective covenants and obligations hereunder, and the consummation of the
Mergers do not (a) violate or conflict with any provision of the Charter, the
Bylaws or the Holdings LLCA; (b) violate, conflict with, result in the breach
of, constitute a default (or an event that, with notice or lapse of time or
both, would become a default) pursuant to, result in the termination of,

or acceleration pursuant to any Material Contract; (c) assuming compliance
with the matters referred to in Section 3.6 and, in the case of the

Stockholder Approval, violate or conflict with any law or order applicable to
the Company Group or by which any of its properties or assets are bound; or

of the properties or assets of the Company Group, except in the case of each

the Company Parties (a) in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Company Parties; (b) the performance by the Company Parties

States); and (ii) has the requisite corporate power and authority to carry on

leased or the nature of its activities make such qualification necessary (to
the extent that the concept of "good standing" is applicable in the case of
any jurisdiction outside the United States), except where the failure to be so
qualified or in good standing would not have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. The Company has made available to the Parent Entities true, correct

similar organizational documents of each "significant subsidiary" (as defined
in Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC) of the Company, each

of, or other equity or voting interest in, each Subsidiary of Holdings (i) has
been duly authorized, validly issued and is fully paid and nonassessable; and
(ii) except for directors qualifying or similar shares, is owned, directly
or indirectly, by the Company, free and clear of all liens (other than
Permitted Liens) and any other restriction (including any restriction on the

equity or voting interest) that would prevent such Subsidiary from conducting
its business as of the Holdings Merger Effective Time in substantially the
same manner that such business is conducted on the date hereof.

securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of

other equity or voting interest in, or any securities convertible into or
exchangeable for, shares of capital stock of, or other equity or voting
interest (including any voting debt) in, any Subsidiary of the Company; or
(iii) obligations of any Subsidiary of the Company to grant, extend or enter
into any subscription, warrant, right, convertible or exchangeable security,

Person other than the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, in each case except
in connection with any Holdings Unit Redemption.

(d) _Other Investments_. Other than equity securities held in the ordinary
course of business for cash management purposes, the Company does not own or
hold the right to acquire any equity securities, ownership interests or voting

Company SEC Report was filed. True, correct and complete copies of all Company

and Retrieval

 



36

    

 database of the SEC. As of its filing date (or, if amended or superseded by
a filing prior to the date hereof, on the date of such amended or superseded
filing), each Company SEC Report did not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make
the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading. No Subsidiary of the Company is required to
file any forms, reports or documents with the SEC.

3.10 _Company_ _Financial Statements_ _; Internal Controls; Indebtedness_
_._

(a) _Company_ _Financial Statements_. The consolidated financial

recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the rules and forms of the SEC; and (ii) such material information is
accumulated and communicated to the Companys management as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the
certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act. The Companys management has completed an assessment of the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting in
compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, and such assessment concluded
that such system was effective. Since May 16, 2018, the principal executive
officer and principal financial officer of the Company have made all
certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Neither the Company nor its
principal executive officer or principal financial officer has received
notice from any Governmental Authority challenging or questioning the
accuracy, completeness, form or manner of filing of such certifications.

 

(c) _Internal Controls_. The Company has established and maintains a
system of internal accounting controls that are effective in providing

policies and procedures that (i) require the maintenance of records that in
reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the Company Group; (ii) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with GAAP and that receipts and
expenditures of the Company Group are being made only in accordance with
appropriate authorizations of the Companys management and the Company Board;

unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the assets of the Company
Group. Neither the Company nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, the Companys
independent registered public accounting firm has identified or been made
aware of (A) any significant deficiency or material weakness in the system of
internal control over financial reporting utilized by the Company Group that
has not been subsequently remediated; or (B) any fraud that involves the
Companys management or other employees who have a role in the preparation of
financial statements or the internal control over financial reporting utilized
by the Company Group. As of the date hereof, there are no outstanding or
unresolved comments in comment letters received from the SEC with respect to
the Company SEC Reports.

thereof, to invest in the Parent Entities, directly or indirectly, the cash
amounts set forth therein for the purpose of funding up to the aggregate value

thereof in connection with the Companys exercise of its rights under Section

condition of the Equity Financing to be satisfied by it, whether or not such
term or condition is contained in the Equity Commitment Letter (it being
understood that no Parent Entity is making any representation or warranty
regarding the effect of any inaccuracy of the representations and warranties
in Article III or the Company Parties compliance hereunder). As of the date
hereof, the Parent Entities have fully paid, or caused to be fully paid,

agent, broker, investment banker or financial advisor any financial advisory
role on an

 



51

    

 exclusive basis in connection with the Mergers; or (ii) expressly
prohibiting any bank, investment bank or other potential provider of debt
financing from providing or seeking to provide debt financing or financial
advisory services to any Person in connection with a transaction relating to

entered into, or committed or agreed to enter into, any formal or informal
arrangements or other understandings (whether or not binding) with
any stockholder (other than any existing limited partner or other equity
financing source of the Guarantor or any of its Affiliates), director,
officer, employee or other Affiliate of the Company Group (a) relating to (i)
this Agreement or the Mergers; or (ii) the Surviving Entities or any of their
Subsidiaries, businesses or operations (including as to continuing employment)
from and after the Closing; or (b) pursuant to which any (i) such holder of
Holdings Units or Company Capital Stock would be entitled to receive
consideration of a different amount or nature than the Per Unit Price or Per

Capital Stock, respectively; (ii) such holder of Holdings Units or Company
Capital Stock has agreed to approve this Agreement or vote against any
Superior Proposal; or (iii) such stockholder, director, officer, employee or
other Affiliate of the Company Group other than the Guarantor has agreed to
provide, directly or indirectly, equity investment to the Buyer Parties or the
Company Parties to finance any portion of the Mergers.

 

4.13 _Solvency_. As of the Company Merger Effective Time and immediately
after giving effect to the Mergers (including the payment of all amounts
payable pursuant to Article II in connection with or as a result of the
Mergers and all related fees and expenses of the Parent Entities, the Company
and their respective Subsidiaries in connection therewith), (a) the amount of
the "fair saleable value" of the assets of each of the Surviving Entities and
its respective Subsidiaries will exceed (i) the value of all liabilities of
such Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries, including contingent and other
liabilities; and (ii) the amount that will be required to pay the probable
liabilities of each such Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries on their
existing debts (including contingent liabilities) as such debts become
absolute and matured; (b) each of the Surviving Entities and its respective
Subsidiaries will not have an unreasonably small amount of capital for the
operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged;

they mature. For purposes of the foregoing, "not have an unreasonably small
amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged
or proposed to be engaged" and "able to pay its liabilities, including
contingent and other liabilities, as they mature" means that such Person will
be able to generate enough cash from operations, asset dispositions or
refinancing, or a combination thereof, to meet its obligations as they become
due.

and warranties, including any express or implied or as to merchantability or
fitness for a particular purpose, and the Company Parties hereby disclaim any

Subsidiaries, acknowledges and agrees that, except for the representations and

5.3(b), from the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and the Company Merger
Effective Time, the Company Parties will cease and cause to be terminated any
discussions or negotiations with any Person and its Affiliates, directors,
officers, employees, consultants, agents, representatives and advisors
(collectively, "Representatives") that would be prohibited by this Section
5.3(a), request the prompt return or destruction of all non-public information
concerning the Company Group theretofore furnished to any such Person with

Company Group will not, and will not instruct, authorize or knowingly permit
any of its Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate,

reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal; (iii) participate

constitutes, or is reasonably expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal; or

agreement, acquisition agreement or other Contract relating to an Acquisition

"Alternative Acquisition Agreement"). From the date hereof until the earlier
to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and
the Company Merger Effective Time, the Company will not be required to
enforce, and will be permitted to waive, any provision of any standstill or
confidentiality agreement solely to the extent that such provision prohibits
or purports to prohibit a confidential proposal being made to the Company
Board (or any committee thereof).

 



57

    

(b) _Superior Proposals_. Notwithstanding anything to contrary set forth
in this Section 5.3, from the date hereof until the Companys receipt of the
Requisite Stockholder Approval, the Company Parties and the Company Board (or
a committee thereof) may, directly or indirectly through one or more of their
Representatives (including the Advisor), participate or engage in discussions
or negotiations with, furnish any non-public information relating to the
Company Group to, or afford access to the business, properties, assets,
books, records or other non-public information, or to any personnel, of the
Company Group pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement to any
Person or its Representatives that has made or delivered to the Company
Parties an Acquisition Proposal after the date hereof, and otherwise
facilitate such Acquisition Proposal or assist such Person (and its
Representatives and financing sources) with such Acquisition Proposal (in
each case, if requested by such Person), in each case with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal that did not result from any material breach of Section
5.3(a); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal either
constitutes a Superior Proposal or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior
Proposal, and the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has determined in
good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel) that the failure to take the actions contemplated by this Section
5.3(b) would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable
law; and _provided_ _further_ , _however_ , that the Company will promptly
(and in any event within 24 hours) make available to the Parent Entities any
non-public information concerning the Company Group that is provided to any
such Person or its Representatives that was not previously made available to
the Parent Entities.

 

(c) _No Change in Company Board Recommendation or Entry into an_
_Alternative Acquisition Agreement_. Except as provided by Section 5.3(d), at

to withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, the Company Board
Recommendation in a manner adverse to any Parent Entity in any material
respect; (B) adopt, approve, endorse, recommend or otherwise declare advisable
an Acquisition Proposal; (C) fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Board
Recommendation within 10 Business Days after Parent I so requests in writing
(it being understood that the Company will have no obligation to make such
reaffirmation on more than three separate occasions); (D) take or fail to
take any formal action or make or fail to make any recommendation or public
statement in connection with a tender or exchange offer, other than a
recommendation against such offer or a "stop, look and listen" communication
by the Company Board (or a committee thereof) to the Company Stockholders
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any
substantially similar communication) (it being understood that the Company
Board (or a committee thereof) may refrain from taking a position with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal until the close of business on the 10th
Business Day after the commencement of a tender or exchange offer in
connection with such Acquisition Proposal without such action being
considered a violation of this Section 5.3); or (E) fail to include the
Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement (any action described in
clauses (A) through (E), a "Company Board Recommendation Change"); _provided_
, _however_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, none of (1) the determination
by the Company Board (or a committee thereof) that an Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal or (2) the delivery by the Company to the
Parent Entities of any notice contemplated by Section 5.3(d) will constitute a
Company Board Recommendation Change; or

 

(ii) cause or permit the Company Group to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement.

 



58

    

(d) _Company Board Recommendation Change; Entry_ _into _ _Alternative
Acquisition Agreement_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder
Approval:

 

(i) other than in connection with a bona fide Acquisition Proposal that
constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company Board (or a committee thereof)
may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change in response to any positive
material event or development or material change in circumstances with respect
to the Company that was (A) not actually known to, or reasonably expected by,
the Company Board as of the date hereof; and (B) does not relate to (a) any
Acquisition Proposal; or (b) the mere fact, in and of itself, that the Company
meets or exceeds any internal or published projections, forecasts, estimates
or predictions of revenue, earnings or other financial or operating metrics
for any period ending on or after the date hereof, or changes after the date
hereof in the market price or trading volume of the Company Common Stock
or the credit rating of the Company (it being understood that the underlying
cause of any of the foregoing in this clause (b) may be considered and taken
into account) (each such event, an "Intervening Event"), if the Company Board
(or a committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law and if
and only if:

(1) the Company has provided prior written notice to the Parent Entities at
least four Business Days in advance to the effect that the Company Board (or
a committee thereof) has (A) so determined; and (B) resolved to effect a
Company Board Recommendation Change pursuant to this Section 5.3(d)(i), which
notice will specify the applicable Intervening Event in reasonable detail;
and

(2) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change,
the Company and its Representatives, during such four Business Day period,
must have (A) negotiated with the Parent Entities and their Representatives in
good faith (to the extent that the Parent Entities desire to so negotiate) to
make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that
the Company Board (or a committee thereof) no longer determines that the
failure to make a Company Board Recommendation Change in response to such
Intervening Event would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to
applicable law; and (B) permitted the Parent Entities and their
Representatives to make a presentation to the Company Board regarding this
Agreement and any adjustments with respect thereto (to the extent that the
Parent Entities requests to make such a presentation); or

(ii) if the Company has received a bona fide Acquisition Proposal, that
the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has concluded in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) is a
Superior Proposal, then the Company Board may (A) effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change with respect to such Acquisition Proposal; or (B)
authorize the Company to terminate this Agreement to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, in each
case if and only if:

(1) the Company Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith
(after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel)
that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
pursuant to applicable law;

 

(2) the Company Group and its Representatives have complied in all material
respects with their obligations pursuant to this Section 5.3 with respect to
such Acquisition Proposal;

(3) (i) the Company has provided prior written notice to the Parent
Entities at least four Business Days in advance (the "Notice Period") to the
effect that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has (A) received a bona
fide Acquisition Proposal that has not been withdrawn; (B) concluded in good
faith that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; and (C)
resolved to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change or to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 5.3(d)(ii) absent any revision to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, which notice will specify the basis
for such Company Board Recommendation Change or termination, including the
identity of the Person 

 



59

    

 or "group" of Persons making such Acquisition Proposal, the material terms
thereof and copies of all relevant documents relating to such Acquisition
Proposal; and (ii) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation
Change or termination, the Company and its Representatives, during the Notice
Period, must have (1) negotiated with the Parent Entities and their
Representatives in good faith (to the extent that the Parent Entities desire
to so negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a
Superior Proposal; and (2) permitted the Parent Entities and
their Representatives to make a presentation to the Company Board regarding
this Agreement and any adjustments with respect thereto (to the extent that
the Parent Entities request to make such a presentation); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in the event of any material revisions to such Acquisition
Proposal, the Company will be required to deliver a new written notice to the
Parent Entities and to comply with the requirements of this Section
5.3(d)(ii)(3) (other than the requirement of a presentation as contemplated
by clause (ii)(3) above) with respect to such new written notice (it being
understood that the "Notice Period" in respect of such new written notice will
be three Business Days); and

 

(4) in the event of any termination of this Agreement in order to cause or
permit the Company Group to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement
with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, the Company will have validly
terminated this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1(h), including paying
the Company Termination Fee in accordance with Section 8.3(b)(iii).

(e) _Notice_. From the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur
of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and the Company
Merger Effective Time, the Company will promptly (and, in any event, within
one Business Day) notify the Parent Entities if any inquiries, offers or
proposals that constitute an Acquisition Proposal are received by the Company
or any of its Representatives or any non-public information is requested from,
or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued
with, the Company or any of its Representatives with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal. Such notice must include (i) the identity of the Person or "group"
of Persons making such offers or proposals (unless, in each case, such
disclosure is prohibited pursuant to the terms of any confidentiality
agreement with such Person or "group" of Persons that is in effect on the date
of this Agreement); and (ii) a summary of the material terms and conditions
of such offers or proposals. Thereafter, the Company must keep the Parent
Entities reasonably informed, on a prompt basis, of the status (and
supplementally provide the terms) of any such offers or proposals (including
any amendments thereto) and the status of any such discussions or
negotiations.

(f) _Certain Disclosures_. Nothing in this Agreement will prohibit the
Company or the Company Board (or a committee thereof) from (i) taking and
disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act, including a "stop, look and listen"
communication by the Company Board (or a committee thereof) to the Company
Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or
any substantially similar communication); (ii) complying with Item 1012(a)
of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act; (iii) informing any
Person of the existence of the provisions contained in this Section 5.3; or
(iv) making any disclosure to the Company Stockholders (including regarding
the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company
Group) that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has determined to make
in good faith in order to comply with applicable law, regulation or stock
exchange rule or listing agreement, it being understood that any such
statement or disclosure made by the Company Board (or a committee thereof)
pursuant to this Section 5.3(f) must be subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement and will not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of
the Company or the Company Board (or any committee thereof) and the rights of
the Parent Entities under this Section 5.3, it being understood that nothing
in the foregoing will be deemed to permit the Company or the Company Board
(or a committee thereof) to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change other
than in accordance with Section 5.3(d). In addition, it is understood and
agreed that, for purposes of this Agreement, a factually accurate public
statement by the Company or the Company Board (or a committee thereof) that
describes the Companys

 



60

    

 receipt of an Acquisition Proposal, the identity of the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal, the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal and the
operation of this Agreement with respect thereto will not, in and of itself,
be deemed to be (A) a withholding, withdrawal, amendment, or modification, or
proposal by the Company Board (or a committee thereof) to withhold, withdraw,
amend or modify, the Company Board Recommendation; (B) an adoption, approval
or recommendation with respect to such Acquisition Proposal; or (C) a Company
Board Recommendation Change.

 

(g) _Breach_ _by Representatives_. The Company Parties agree that any
breach of this Section 5.3 by any director, officer or other Representative
of a Company Party (other than a consultant or an employee of a Company Party
who is not an officer of the Company) will be deemed to be a breach of this
Section 5.3 by the Company Parties. The Company Parties will not authorize,
direct or knowingly permit any consultant or employee of a Company Party to
breach this Section 5.3, and upon becoming aware of any breach or threatened
breach of this Section 5.3 by a consultant or employee of a Company Party,
shall use their reasonable best efforts to stop such breach or threatened
breach.

Foreign Investment Laws, then such Party will make (or cause to be made), as
soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other Parties,
an appropriate response in compliance with such request.

if and to the extent necessary to obtain clearance of the Mergers pursuant to

Section 7.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, the Buyer Parties (and their
respective controlled Affiliates, if applicable) will (i) offer, negotiate,

other Parties to review and discuss in advance (and to consider in good faith
any comments made by the other parties in relation to) any proposed draft
notifications, formal notifications (provided, however, that filings made

communication (and any analyses, memoranda, white papers, presentations,

parties reasonable prior notice of such meeting or discussions and, unless
prohibited by such Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend or
participate. However, each of the Company Parties and the Buyer Parties may
designate any non-public information provided to any Governmental Authority as
restricted to "outside counsel" only and any such information shall not be
shared with employees, officers or directors or their equivalents of the
other Party without approval of the Party providing the non-public
information; _provided_ , _however_ , that each of the Company Parties and the
Buyer Parties may redact any valuation and related information, or
information that is protected by legal privilege, before sharing any
information provided to any Governmental Authority with another Party on an
"outside counsel" only basis. 

6.3 _Proxy Statement and Other Required_ _SEC Filings_.

 

(a) _Proxy Statement_. Promptly following the date hereof, the Company
will prepare and file with the SEC a preliminary proxy statement (as amended
or supplemented, the "Proxy Statement") relating to the Company Stockholder
Meeting. Subject to Section 5.3(d), the Company must include the Company Board
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement.

(b) _Other Required Company Filing_. If the Company determines that it is
required to file any document other than the Proxy Statement with the SEC in
connection with the Mergers pursuant to applicable law (such document, as
amended or supplemented, an "Other Required Company Filing"), then the Company
will promptly prepare and file such Other Required Company Filing with the
SEC. The Company Parties will use their reasonable best efforts to cause the
Proxy Statement and any Other Required Company Filing to comply as to form in
all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act
and the rules of the SEC and Nasdaq. The Company Parties may not file the
Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing with the SEC without
first providing the Parent Entities and their counsel a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, and the Company Parties
will give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested thereto by the Parent Entities or their counsel. On the date of
filing, the date of mailing to the Company Stockholders (if applicable) and
at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting, neither the Proxy Statement
nor any Other Required Company Filing will contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not false or misleading.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no covenant is made by the Company Parties
with respect to any

 



63

    

 information supplied by the Buyer Parties or any of their Affiliates for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement or any Other
Required Company Filing. The information supplied by the Company Parties for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in any Other Required Parent Filings
will not, at the time that such Other Required Parent Filing is filed with the
SEC, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading.

 

(c) _Other Required Parent Filing_. If the Parent Entities determine that
any Buyer Party (or any of their respective Affiliates, if applicable) is
required to file any document with the SEC in connection with the Mergers or
the Company Stockholder Meeting pursuant to applicable law (an "Other Required
Parent Filing"), then the Buyer Parties will, and will cause their respective
Affiliates to, promptly prepare and file such Other Required Parent Filing
with the SEC. The Buyer Parties will cause, and will cause their respective
Affiliates to cause, any Other Required Parent Filing to comply as to form in
all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and
the rules of the SEC. Neither the Buyer Parties nor any of their respective
Affiliates may file any Other Required Parent Filing (or any amendment
thereto) with the SEC without first providing the Company and its counsel a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, and the Parent Entities
will give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or
changes suggested thereto by the Company or its counsel. On the date of
filing, the date of mailing to the Company Stockholders (if applicable) and at
the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting, no Other Required Parent Filing
may contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not false or misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no covenant is made
by the Buyer Parties with respect to any information supplied by the Company
Parties for inclusion or incorporation by reference in any Other Required
Parent Filing. The information supplied by the Buyer Parties and their
respective Affiliates for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement or any Other Required Company Filing will not, at the time that the
Proxy Statement or such Other Required Company Filing is filed with the SEC,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading.

 

(d) _Furnishing Information_. Each of the Company Parties, on the one
hand, and the Buyer Parties, on the other hand, will furnish all information
concerning it and its Affiliates, if applicable, as the other Party may
reasonably request in connection with the preparation and filing with the SEC
of the Proxy Statement and any Other Required Company Filing or any Other
Required Parent Filing. If at any time prior to the Company Stockholder
Meeting any information relating to the Company Parties, the Buyer Parties or
any of their respective Affiliates should be discovered by the Company, on the
one hand, or the Parent Entities, on the other hand, that should be set forth
in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, any Other Required
Company Filing or any Other Required Parent Filing, as the case may be, so
that such filing would not include any misstatement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, then the Party that discovers such information
will promptly notify the other, and an appropriate amendment or supplement to
such filing describing such information will be promptly prepared and filed
with the SEC by the appropriate Party and, to the extent required
by applicable law or the SEC or its staff, disseminated to the Company
Stockholders.

(e) _Consultation_ _Prior to Certain Communications_. The Company and its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Parent Entities and their Affiliates, on
the other hand, may not communicate in writing with the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Proxy Statement, any Other Required Company Filing or any
Other Required Parent Filing, as the case may be, without first providing the
other Party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such written
communication, and each Party will give due consideration to all reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the other Parties or
their respective counsel.

 



64

    

(f) _Notices_. The Company, on the one hand, and the Parent Entities, on
the other hand, will advise the other, promptly after it receives notice
thereof, of any receipt of a request by the SEC or its staff for (i) any
amendment or revisions to the Proxy Statement, any Other Required Company
Filing or any Other Required Parent Filing, as the case may be; (ii) any
receipt of comments from the SEC or its staff on the Proxy Statement, any
Other Required Company Filing or any Other Required Parent Filing, as the case
may be; or (iii) any receipt of a request by the SEC or its staff for
additional information in connection therewith.

 

(g) _Dissemination of Proxy Statement_. Subject to applicable law, the
Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to
be disseminated to the Company Stockholders as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the filing thereof with the SEC and confirmation from
the SEC that it will not review, or that it has completed its review of, the
Proxy Statement.

this Agreement, the Company will take all action necessary in accordance with
the DGCL, the Exchange Act, the Charter, the Bylaws and the rules of Nasdaq to

unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)) and, duly call, give notice
of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "Company Stockholder
Meeting"), in each case, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the
mailing of the Proxy Statement to the Company Stockholders for the purpose of
obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval. Within five Business Days after
the date of this Agreement (and thereafter, upon the reasonable request of
Parent I made not more than one time every two weeks), the Company shall
conduct a "broker search" in accordance with Rule 14a-13 of the Exchange Act
assuming that, for such purposes only, the record date of the Company
Stockholder Meeting will be 20 Business Days after the date the broker search
is conducted. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Company will not be required to convene and hold the Company Stockholder
Meeting at any time prior to the 20th Business Day following the mailing of
the Proxy Statement to the Company Stockholders. Subject to Section 5.3(d) and
unless there has been a Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company
will use its reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies to obtain the
Requisite Stockholder Approval.

 

(b) _Adjournment_ _of Company Stockholder Meeting_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing will prevent the Company
from postponing or adjourning the Company Stockholder Meeting if (i) there are
holders of an insufficient number of shares of the Company Common Stock
present or represented by proxy at the Company Stockholder Meeting to
constitute a quorum at the Company Stockholder Meeting (it being understood
that the Company may not postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting
more than two times pursuant to this clause (i) without Parent Is prior
written consent); or (ii) the Company is required to postpone or adjourn the
Company Stockholder Meeting by applicable law, order or a request from the SEC
or its staff. Unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with
Section 8.1, the Company will submit this Agreement to the Company
Stockholders at the Company Stockholder Meeting for the purpose of obtaining
the Requisite Stockholder Approval even if the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) has effected a Company Board Recommendation Change.

6.5 _Equity Financing_.

 

(a) _No Amendments_ _to_ _Equity Commitment Letter_. Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, the Parent Entities will not permit any

remedy pursuant to, the Equity Commitment Letter if such amendment,
modification or waiver would, or would reasonably be expected to, (i) reduce
the aggregate amount of the Equity Financing; (ii) impose new or additional
conditions or other terms or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the

 



65

    

 conditions to the receipt of the Equity Financing or any other terms to the
Equity Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (A) delay or
prevent the Closing Date; or (B) make the timely funding of the Equity
Financing, or the satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Equity
Financing, less likely to occur in any respect; or (iii) adversely impact the
ability of any Parent Entity or the Company, as applicable, to enforce its
rights against the Guarantor under the Equity Commitment Letter. Any reference
in this Agreement to (1) the "Equity Financing" will include the financing
contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letter as amended or modified in

include such document as amended or modified in compliance with this Section

event will the reasonable best efforts of the Parent Entities be deemed or
construed to require any Parent Entity to (i) bring any enforcement action
against any source of the Equity Financing to enforce its rights pursuant to
the Equity Commitment Letter (it being understood that the Parent Entities
will seek to enforce, including by bringing suit for specific performance,
the Equity Commitment Letter if the Company seeks and is granted a decree of
specific performance of the obligation to consummate the Mergers); or (ii)
seek the Equity Financing from any source other than a counterparty to, or in
any amount in excess of that contemplated by, the Equity Commitment Letter.

to result in personal liability to such officer or Representative; or (2) the
Company Board to approve any financing or Contracts related thereto, effective
prior to the Closing Date.

 

(d) _Use of Logos_. The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its
Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Debt Financing so long as such

Company Group; (ii) are used solely in connection with a description of the
Company, its business and products or the Merger; and (iii) are used in a
manner consistent with the other terms and conditions that the Company

69

    

(e) _Confidentiality_. All non-public or other confidential information
provided by the Company or any of its Representatives pursuant to this
Agreement will be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement, except that the Parent Entities will be permitted to disclose such
information to any Financing Sources or prospective Financing Sources and
other financial institutions and investors that may become parties to the Debt
Financing (and, in each case, to their respective counsel and auditors) so
long as such Persons (i) agree to be bound by the Confidentiality Agreement as
if parties thereto; or (ii) are subject to other confidentiality undertakings
reasonably satisfactory to the Company and of which the Company is a
beneficiary.

(f) _Reimbursement_. Promptly upon request by the Company, the Parent
Entities will reimburse the Company for any documented and reasonable out-of-
pocket costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by the
Company Group in connection with the cooperation of the Company Group

(g) _Indemnification_. The Company Group and its Representatives will be
indemnified and held harmless by the Parent Entities from and against any and
all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses (including
attorneys fees), interest, awards, judgments, penalties and amounts paid in
settlement suffered or incurred by them in connection with any cooperation
provided pursuant to this Section 6.6 or the provision of information utilized
in connection therewith. Parent Entities obligations pursuant to Section
6.6(f) and this Section 6.6(g) referred to collectively as the "Reimbursement
Obligations."

(h) _No Exclusive Arrangements_. In no event will the Guarantor, any
Parent Entity or any of their respective Affiliates (which for this purpose
will be deemed to include each direct investor in the Buyer Parties and the
financing sources or potential financing sources of the Buyer Parties and
such investors) enter into any Contract (i) awarding any agent, broker,
investment banker or financial advisor any financial advisory role on an
exclusive basis; or (ii) prohibiting or seeking to prohibit any bank,
investment bank or other potential provider of debt financing from providing
or seeking to provide debt financing or financial advisory services to any
Person, in each case in connection with a transaction relating to the Company
Group or in connection with the Mergers. 

(i) _No Financing Condition_. The Buyer Parties acknowledge and agree that
obtaining the Debt Financing is not a condition to the Closing. Except in the
case of a willful and material breach that has not been cured by the Company
Parties within a reasonable period of time after a Parent Entity has provided
written notice to the Company of the specific breach, the Company Parties
breach of Section 6.6(a) will not be asserted as the basis for (A) any
conditions set forth in Article VII to consummate the Mergers having not been
satisfied or (B) the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.1(e). If the Debt Financing has not been obtained, the Buyer Parties will
each continue to be obligated, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article VII, to consummate the Mergers.

6.7 _Anti-Takeover Laws_. The Company Parties and the Company Board (and
any committee empowered to take such action, if applicable) will (a) take all

if any "anti-takeover" statute or similar statute or regulation becomes
applicable to the Mergers, take all action within their power to ensure that
the Mergers may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize or make inapplicable
the effect of such statute or regulation on the Mergers.

 

6.8 _Access_. At all times during the period commencing with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and the Closing,
the Company will afford the Parent Entities and their Representatives
reasonable access during 

 



70

    

 normal business hours, upon reasonable advance notice, to the properties,
books and records and personnel of the Company Group, except that the Company
may restrict or otherwise prohibit access to any documents or information to
the extent that (a) any applicable law or regulation requires the Company
Group to restrict or otherwise prohibit access to such documents or
information; (b) access to such documents or information would give rise to a
material risk of waiving any attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine
or other privilege applicable to such documents or information; (c) access to
a Contract to which the Company Group is a party or otherwise bound
would violate or cause a default pursuant to, or give a third Person the
right terminate or accelerate the rights pursuant to, such Contract; (d)
access would result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third Persons;
or (e) such documents or information are reasonably pertinent to any adverse
Legal Proceeding between the Company and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and
any Parent Entity and its Affiliates, on the other hand. Nothing in this
Section 6.8 will be construed to require the Company Group or any of its
Representatives to prepare any reports, analyses, appraisals, opinions or
other information. Any investigation conducted pursuant to the access
contemplated by this Section 6.8 will be conducted in a manner that does not
unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company Group
or create a risk of damage or destruction to any property or assets of the
Company Group. Any access to the properties of the Company Group will
be subject to the Companys reasonable security measures and insurance
requirements and will not include the right to perform invasive testing.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company may
satisfy its obligations set forth above by electronic means if physical
access is not permitted under applicable law or not practicable as a result of
COVID-19 or any COVID-19 Measures. The terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement will apply to any information obtained by any Parent
Entity or any of its Representatives in connection with any investigation
conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this Section 6.8. All
requests for access pursuant to this Section 6.8 must be directed to the
General Counsel of the Company, or another person designated by the Company.

 

6.9 _Section_ __ _ 16(b)_ _Exemption_. The Company will take all actions
reasonably necessary to cause the Company Merger, and any dispositions of
equity securities of the Company (including derivative securities) in
connection with the Company Merger by each individual who is a director or
executive officer of the Company to be exempt pursuant to Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

6.10 _Directors_ __ _and _ _Officers_ __ _Exculpation, Indemnification and
Insurance_.

(a) _Indemnified Persons_. The Surviving Entities and their Subsidiaries
will (and the Parent Entities will cause the Surviving Entities and their
Subsidiaries to) honor and fulfill, in all respects, the obligations of the
Company Group pursuant to any indemnification agreements between a member of
the Company Group and any of its current or former directors or officers (and
any person who becomes a director or officer of a member of the Company Group
prior to the Company Merger Effective Time) (collectively, the "Indemnified
Persons") or employees for any acts or omissions by such Indemnified Persons
or employees occurring prior to the Company Merger Effective Time. In
addition, during the period commencing at the Company Merger Effective Time
and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Company Merger Effective Time, the
Surviving Entities and their Subsidiaries will (and the Parent Entities will
cause the Surviving Entities and their Subsidiaries to) cause the certificates
of incorporation, bylaws, and other similar organizational documents of the
Surviving Entities and their Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect
to indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of expenses that are at
least as favorable as the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of
expenses provisions set forth in the Charter, the Bylaws, the Holdings LLCA
and the other similar organizational documents of the Subsidiaries of the
Company, as applicable, as of the date hereof. During such six-year period,
such provisions may not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any
adverse manner except as required by applicable law.

 



71

    

(b) _Indemnification Obligation_. Without limiting the generality of the
provisions of Section 6.10(a), during the period commencing at the Company
Merger Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Company
Merger Effective Time, the Surviving Entities will (and the Parent
Entities will cause the Surviving Entities to) indemnify and hold harmless,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law or pursuant to any
indemnification agreements with the Company and any of its Subsidiaries in
effect on the date hereof, each Indemnified Person from and against any
costs, fees and expenses (including attorneys fees and investigation
expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts
paid in settlement or compromise in connection with any Legal Proceeding,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent that
such Legal Proceeding arises, directly or indirectly, out of or pertains,
directly or indirectly, to (i) any action or omission, or alleged action
or omission, in such Indemnified Persons capacity as an Affiliate, director,
officer, employee or agent of the Company Group or its Affiliates to the
extent that such action or omission, or alleged action or omission, occurred
prior to or at the Company Merger Effective Time; and (ii) the Mergers, as
well as any actions taken by the Company Parties or the Buyer Parties with
respect thereto (including any disposition of assets of the Surviving Entities
or any of their Subsidiaries that is alleged to have rendered the any of the
Surviving Entities or any of their Subsidiaries insolvent), except that if, at
any time prior to the sixth anniversary of the Company Merger Effective Time,
any Indemnified Person delivers to the Parent Entities a written notice
asserting a claim for indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.10(b), then
the claim asserted in such notice will survive the sixth anniversary of the
Company Merger Effective Time until such claim is fully and finally resolved.
In the event of any such Legal Proceeding, (A) the Surviving Corporation will
have the right to control the defense thereof after the Company Merger
Effective Time (it being understood that, by electing to control the
defense thereof, the Surviving Corporation, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates, will be deemed to have waived any right to object to the
Indemnified Persons entitlement to indemnification hereunder with respect
thereto); (B) each Indemnified Person will be entitled to retain his or her
own counsel, whether or not the Surviving Corporation elects to control the
defense of any such Legal Proceeding; (C) the Surviving Entities will advance
all fees and expenses (including fees and expenses of any counsel) as
incurred by an Indemnified Person in the defense of such Legal Proceeding,
whether or not the Surviving Corporation elects to control the defense of any
such Legal Proceeding; and (D) no Indemnified Person will be liable for any
settlement of such Legal Proceeding effected without his or her prior written
consent (unless such settlement relates only to monetary damages for which the
Surviving Corporation is entirely responsible). Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, none of the Parent Entities, the Surviving
Entities nor any of their respective Affiliates will settle or otherwise
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, or
otherwise seek the termination of, any Legal Proceeding for which
indemnification may be sought by an Indemnified Person pursuant to this
Agreement unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes
an unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from all liability
arising out of such Legal Proceeding. Any determination required to be made
with respect to whether the conduct of any Indemnified Person complies or
complied with any applicable standard will be made by independent legal
counsel selected by the Surviving Corporation (which counsel will be
reasonably acceptable to such Indemnified Person), the fees and expenses of
which will be paid by the Surviving Corporation.

 

(c) _D andO Insurance_. During the period commencing at the Company Merger
Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Company Merger
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and the Parent Entities will
cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain in effect the Companys
directors and officers liability insurance in effect on the date hereof
("DandO Insurance") in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Company Merger Effective Time on terms (including with respect to coverage,
conditions, retentions, limits and amounts) that are equivalent to those of
the DandO Insurance. In satisfying its obligations pursuant to this Section
6.10(c), the Surviving Corporation will not be obligated to pay annual
premiums in excess of 300% of the amount paid by the Company for coverage for
its last full fiscal year (such 300% amount, the "Maximum Annual Premium"). If
the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed the Maximum Annual
Premium, then the Surviving Corporation will be obligated to obtain a policy
with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum
Annual Premium from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating
as the Companys directors and officers liability insurance carrier on the
date hereof. The Company may purchase a prepaid "tail" policy with respect to
the DandO Insurance from an

 



72

    

 insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
directors and officers liability insurance carrier on the date hereof so
long as the aggregate cost for such "tail" policy does not exceed the amount
set forth on 6.10(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter. If the Company elects
to purchase such a "tail" policy, the Surviving Corporation will (and the
Parent Entities will cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such "tail"
policy in full force and effect and continue to honor its obligations
thereunder for so long as such "tail" policy is in full force and effect.

 

(d) _Successors and Assigns_. If any Parent Entity, the Surviving Entities
or any of their respective successors or assigns will (i) consolidate with or
merge into any other Person and not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity in such consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then proper
provisions will be made so that the successors and assigns of such Parent
Entity, the Surviving Entities or any of their respective successors or
assigns will assume all of the obligations of such Parent Entity and the
Surviving Entities set forth in this Section 6.10.

(e) _No Impairment_. The obligations set forth in this Section 6.10 may
not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in any manner that adversely
affects any Indemnified Person (or any other person who is a beneficiary
pursuant to the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in Section
6.10(c) (and their heirs and representatives)) without the prior written
consent of such affected Indemnified Person or other person. Each of the
Indemnified Persons or other persons who are beneficiaries pursuant to the
DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in Section 6.10(c) (and their
heirs and representatives) are intended to be third party beneficiaries of
this Section 6.10, with full rights of enforcement as if such person were
a Party. The rights of the Indemnified Persons (and other persons who are
beneficiaries pursuant to the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to
in Section 6.10(c) (and their heirs and representatives)) pursuant to
this Section 6.10 will be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights that such persons may have pursuant to (i) the Charter, Bylaws
and Holdings LLCA; (ii) the similar organizational documents of the
Subsidiaries of the Company; (iii) any and all indemnification agreements
entered into with the Company Group; or (iv) applicable law (whether at law or
in equity).

 

(f) _Joint and Several Obligations_. The obligations of the Surviving
Entities, the Parent Entities and their respective Subsidiaries pursuant to
this Section 6.10 will be joint and several.

(g) _Other Claims_. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, or will be
construed to, release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers
insurance claims pursuant to any applicable insurance policy or
indemnification agreement that is or has been in existence with respect to
the Company Group for any of its directors, officers or other employees, it
being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this
Section 6.10 is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims pursuant
to such policies or agreements.

6.11 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) _Acknowledgement_. The Parent Entities hereby acknowledge and agree that a
"change in control" (or similar phrase) within the meaning of each of the
Employee Plans, as applicable, will occur as of the Company Merger Effective
Time and/or the Holdings Merger Effective Time, as applicable.

 

(b) _Existing Arrangements_. Subject to this Section 6.11, from and after
the Company Merger Effective Time, the Surviving Entities will (and the
Parent Entities will cause the Surviving Entities to) honor all of the
Employee Plans and compensation and severance arrangements in accordance with
their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective
Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing will prohibit the Surviving
Entities from in any way amending, modifying or terminating any such Employee
Plans or compensation or severance arrangements in accordance with their terms
or if otherwise permitted pursuant to applicable law.

 



73

    

(c) _Employment; Benefits_. As of the Closing, the Surviving Entities or
one of their respective Subsidiaries will continue to employ the employees of
the Company Group as of the Company Merger Effective Time. From and after the
Company Merger Effective Time until December 31, 2021 (or, if earlier,
the termination date of an applicable Continuing Employee) (the "Continuation
Period") the Surviving Entities and their respective Subsidiaries will (and
the Parent Entities will cause the Surviving Entities and their
respective Subsidiaries to) either (i) maintain for the benefit of each
Continuing Employee the Employee Plans set forth on Section 3.18(a) of the
Company Disclosure Letter and any other employee benefit plans or other
compensation and severance arrangements (other than defined pension,
nonqualified deferred compensation, post-termination or retiree health or
welfare, or equity-based benefits and, subject to Section 6.11(b), individual
employment agreements) of the applicable Surviving Entity or Subsidiary (the
"Company Plans") at benefit levels that are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to those in effect at the Company or its applicable Subsidiaries on
the date hereof, and provide compensation and benefits (other than defined
pension, nonqualified deferred compensation, post-termination or retiree
health or welfare, or equity-based benefits and individual employment
agreements) to each Continuing Employee pursuant to such Company Plans; (ii)
provide compensation, benefits and severance payments (other than defined
pension, nonqualified deferred compensation, post-termination or retiree
health or welfare, or equity-based benefits and, subject to Section 6.11(b),
individual employment agreements) to each Continuing Employee that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to the compensation, benefits and
severance payments (other than defined pension, nonqualified deferred
compensation, post-termination or retiree health or welfare, or equity-based
benefits and individual employment agreements) provided to such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time ("Comparable
Plans"); or (iii) provide some combination of Company Plans and Comparable
Plans such that each Continuing Employee receives compensation, benefits and
severance payments (other than equity-based benefits and, subject to Section
6.11(b), individual employment agreements) that, taken as a whole, are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to the compensation, benefits and
severance payments (other than equity-based benefits and individual employment
agreements) provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Company Merger Effective Time. In each case, from and after the Company Merger
Effective Time until the first anniversary of the Closing Date, base
compensation and target incentive compensation opportunity will not be
decreased for any Continuing Employee. During the Continuation Period, the
Surviving Entities will (and the Parent Entities will cause the Surviving
Entities to) provide severance benefits to eligible employees in accordance
with the Companys severance plans, guidelines and practices as in effect on
the date hereof and that have been made available to the Parent Entities prior
to the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) nothing in this
Section 6.11 shall obligate the Surviving Entities and their respective
Subsidiaries to continue the employment of any Continuing Employee for any
specific period, and (y) the obligations set forth in this Section 6.11 shall
not (i) apply to any individual during such time as such individual is
furloughed, temporarily laid off, or suffers a termination of employment or
reduction in hours or benefits at any time because of, in whole or in
part, COVID-19-related circumstances, or (ii) limit the Surviving Entities
or their Subsidiaries right, in their sole discretion, to furlough,
temporarily layoff, terminate the employment of, or reduce the hours or
benefits of, any employee because of, in whole or in part, COVID-19-related
circumstances (in which case, for the avoidance of doubt, the Surviving
Entities and their Subsidiaries shall have no obligations under Section 6.11,
including in respect of providing any severance or termination benefits).

 

(d) _New Plans_. To the extent that a Company Plan or Comparable Plan is
made available to any Continuing Employee at or after the Company Merger
Effective Time, the Surviving Entities and their respective Subsidiaries will
(and the Parent Entities will cause the Surviving Entities and their
respective Subsidiaries to) cause to be granted to such Continuing Employee
credit for all service with the Company Group prior to the Company Merger
Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and (for
vacation

 



74

    

 and severance benefits only) entitlement to benefits where length of service
is relevant, except that (i) such service need not be credited to the extent
that it would result in duplication of coverage or benefits, (ii) such
service shall only be credited to the same extent and for the same purpose as
such service was credited under an analogous Company Plan, and (iii) no
service shall be required to be credited under any Comparable Plan that
provides for equity or equity-based, defined benefit pension, deferred
compensation or post-termination or retiree welfare benefits. In addition, and
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Surviving Entities
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that (i) each Continuing
Employee will be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting
period, in any and all employee benefit plans sponsored by the Surviving
Entities and their respective Subsidiaries (other than the Company Plans)
(such plans, the "New Plans") to the extent that coverage pursuant to any such
New Plan replaces coverage pursuant to a comparable Company Plan in which such
Continuing Employee participates immediately before the Company Merger
Effective Time (such plans, the "Old Plans"); (ii) during the plan year in
which the Closing Date occurs, for purposes of each New Plan providing
medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any Continuing
Employee, (x) the Surviving Entities will cause all waiting periods, pre-
existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements and
actively-at-work or similar requirements of such New Plan to be waived for
such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, and (y) the
Surviving Entities will cause any eligible expenses incurred by such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of
the plan year ending on the Closing Date to be given full credit pursuant to
such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance, co-pay,
offsets and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing
Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if
such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan; and (iii) credit
the accounts of such Continuing Employees pursuant to any New Plan that is a
flexible spending plan with any unused balance in the account of such
Continuing Employee. Any vacation or paid time off accrued but unused by a
Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective
Time will be credited to such Continuing Employee following the Company
Merger Effective Time, and will not be subject to accrual limits or other
forfeiture and will not limit future accruals (except to the extent that such
limits or forfeitures applied under the Company Plans in effect as of the
date hereof).

(e) _No_ _Third Party Beneficiary Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, this Section 6.11 will not be deemed to
(i) guarantee employment for any period of time for, or preclude the ability
of any Parent Entity, the Surviving Entities or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to terminate any Continuing Employee for any reason; (ii)
subject to the limitations and requirements specifically set forth in this
Section 6.11, require any Parent Entity, the Surviving Entities or any of
their respective Subsidiaries to continue any Company Plan or prevent the
amendment, modification or termination thereof after the Company Merger
Effective Time; (iii) create any third party beneficiary rights in any Person;
or (iv) establish, amend or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement.

6.12 _Obligations of_ _the Buyer Parties and the Company Parties_. The
Parent Entities will take all action necessary to cause Merger Sub I, Merger
Sub II, and the Surviving Entities to perform their respective obligations
pursuant to this Agreement and to consummate the Mergers upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. Each of the Buyer
Parties will be jointly and severally liable for any breach of this Agreement
by any Buyer Party (or, following the Closing, the Surviving Entities) or any
other failure by any Buyer Party (or, following the Closing, the Surviving
Entities) to perform and discharge any of its respective covenants, agreements
and obligations pursuant to this Agreement.

 

6.13 _Notification of Certain Matters_.

 

(a) _Notification by the_ _Company_. At all times during the period

in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement, in each case if and only
to the extent that such untruth, inaccuracy, or failure would reasonably be
expected to cause any of the conditions to the obligations of the Buyer
Parties to consummate the Mergers set forth in Section 7.2(a) or Section
7.2(b) to fail to be satisfied at the Closing, except that no
such notification will affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty of the Company set forth in this Agreement or the conditions to the

available to the Parties under this Agreement. The terms and conditions of
the Confidentiality Agreement apply to any information provided to any Parent
Entity pursuant to this Section 6.13(a).

or warranty made by the Buyer Parties in this Agreement has become untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect, or of any failure by the Buyer Parties to
comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement,
in each case if and only to the extent that such untruth, inaccuracy or
failure would reasonably be expected to cause any of the conditions to the
obligations of the Company Parties to consummate the Mergers set forth in
Section 7.3(a) or Section 7.3(b) to fail to be satisfied at the Closing,
except that no such notification will affect or be deemed to modify any

6.14 _Public Statements and Disclosure_. The initial press release
concerning this Agreement and the Mergers of the Company Parties, on the one
hand, and the Buyer Parties, on the other hand, will each be reasonably

hand, will use their respective reasonable best efforts to consult with the
other Parties before (a) participating in any media interviews; (b) engaging

Superior Proposal or Company Board Recommendation Change; or (iv) with respect
to any actual Legal Proceeding between the Company Parties or

6.15 _Transaction Litigation_. Prior to the Company Merger Effective Time,
the Company Parties will provide the Parent Entities with prompt notice of all
Transaction Litigation (including by providing copies of all pleadings with
respect thereto) and keep the Parent Entities reasonably informed with
respect to the status

to the defense, settlement and prosecution of any Transaction Litigation. The
Company Parties may not compromise, settle or come to an arrangement

for the settlement or compromise consent set forth above.

Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the

will use their reasonable best efforts to take such action. If at any time

desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest
the Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights,

of the Closing Date (except to the extent that any such representation and

contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform would result
in a failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.1 or Section 7.3, except
that if such breach or failure to perform is capable of being cured by
the Termination Date, the Company Parties will not be entitled to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(g) prior to the delivery by the
Company to the Parent Entities of written notice of such breach, delivered at
least 45 days prior to such termination (or such shorter period of time as

81

    

8.2 _Manner and Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination_. 

(a) _Manner of Termination_. The Party terminating this Agreement pursuant
to Section 8.1 (other than pursuant to Section 8.1(a)) must deliver prompt
written notice thereof to the other Parties setting forth in reasonable detail
the provision of Section 8.1 pursuant to which this Agreement is being
terminated and the facts and circumstances forming the basis for such
termination pursuant to such provision.

(b) _Effect of Termination_. Any proper and valid termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 will be effective immediately upon the
delivery of written notice by the terminating Party to the other Parties. In
the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, this
Agreement will be of no further force or effect without liability of any Party
(or any partner, member, manager, stockholder, director, officer, employee,
Affiliate, agent or other representative of such Party) to the other Parties,
as applicable, except that Section 6.6(f), Section 6.6(g), Section 6.14, this
Section 8.2, Section 8.3 and Article IX will each survive the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with their respective terms. Notwithstanding the
foregoing but subject to Section 8.3(e), nothing in this Agreement will
relieve any Party from any liability for any willful and material breach of
this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of termination of
this Agreement, the Financing Sources will have no liability to the Company
Parties, any of their Affiliates or any of its or their direct or indirect
equityholders hereunder or otherwise relating to or arising out of
the transactions contemplated hereby or any Debt Financing (including for any
willful and material breach), _provided_ that the foregoing shall not preclude
any liability of the Financing Sources to the Company Parties and their
Affiliates under any definitive agreements relating to any Debt Financing. In
addition to the foregoing, no termination of this Agreement will affect the
rights or obligations of any Party pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement
or the Guaranty, which rights, obligations and agreements will survive the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with their respective terms.

 

8.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

 

(a) _General_. Except as set forth in this Section 8.3, all fees and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Mergers will be
paid by the Party incurring such fees and expenses whether or not the Mergers
are consummated. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parent Entities or the
Surviving Entities will be responsible for all fees and expenses of the
Payment Agent. The Parent Entities will pay or cause to be paid all (i)
transfer, stamp and documentary Taxes or fees; and (ii) sales, use, real
property transfer and other similar Taxes or fees arising out of or in
connection with entering into this Agreement and the consummation of the
Mergers.

(b) _Company_ _Payments_.

 

(i) If (A) this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(c),
Section 8.1(d) or Section 8.1(e); (B)(1) in the case of a termination
pursuant to Section 8.1(c), at the time of such termination, the conditions
set forth in Sections 7.1(b) and Section 7.1(c) have been satisfied or (2) in
the case of a termination pursuant to Section 8.1(d) or Section 8.1(e), at
the time of such termination, the Company (on behalf of the Company Parties)
is not then able to terminate this Agreement pursuant to 8.1(b), and (3) the
conditions set forth in Section 7.3(a) and Section 7.3(b) would be satisfied
if the date of such termination was the Closing Date; (C) following the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c), Section 8.1(d) or Section 8.1(e), as
applicable, an Acquisition Proposal for an Acquisition Transaction has been
publicly announced or publicly disclosed and not withdrawn or otherwise
abandoned; and (D) within one year following the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c), Section 8.1(d) or Section 8.1(e), as
applicable, either an Acquisition Transaction is consummated or a Company
Party enters into a definitive agreement providing for the consummation of an
Acquisition Transaction, then the Company Parties will concurrently with the
consummation of such

 



82

    

 Acquisition Transaction pay or cause to be paid to the Parent Entities (as
directed by Parent I) an amount equal to $104,600,000 (the "Company
Termination Fee"). For purposes of this Section 8.3(b)(i), all references to
(i) "15%" in the definition of "Acquisition Transaction" will be deemed to be
references to "50%" and (ii) "the Company or Holdings (by vote or
economic interest)" will be deemed to be references to "the aggregate voting
power of the Company or the economic ownership of the Company and Holdings
taken as a whole".

 

(ii) If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(f),
then the Company Parties must promptly (and in any event within two Business
Days) following such termination pay or cause to be paid to the Parent
Entities (as directed by Parent I) the Company Termination Fee.

 

(iii) If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(h),
then the Company Parties must prior to or concurrently with such termination
pay or cause to be paid to the Parent Entities (as directed by Parent I) the
Company Termination Fee.

 

(c) _Single Payment Only_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that in no
event will the Company Parties be required to pay more than one Termination
Fee, collectively, or be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more
than one occasion, whether or not the Company Termination Fee may be payable
pursuant to more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at
different times and upon the occurrence of different events.

(d) _Payments; Default_. The Parties acknowledge that the agreements
contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the Mergers, and that,
without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Company Parties fail to promptly pay any amount due
pursuant to Section 8.3(b) and, in order to obtain such payment, any Parent
Entity commences a Legal Proceeding that results in a judgment against the
Company Parties for the amount set forth in Section 8.3(b) or any
portion thereof, the Company Parties will pay to any Parent Entity its
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable and documented attorneys fees) in connection with such Legal
Proceeding, together with interest on such amount or portion thereof at the
annual rate of 5% plus the prime rate as published in _The Wall Street
Journal_ in effect on the date that such payment or portion thereof was
required to be made through the date that such payment or portion thereof was
actually received, or a lesser rate that is the maximum permitted by
applicable law. All payments under this Section 8.3 shall be made by the
Company Parties to the Parent Entities (as directed by Parent I) by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated in Section
8.3(d) of the Parent Disclosure Letter (which account information may be
updated by Parent I by written notice to the Company Parties from time to
time).

(e) _Sole and Exclusive Remedy_.

 

(i) Under no circumstances will the collective monetary damages payable by
the Buyer Parties or any of their Affiliates for breaches under this
Agreement, the Guaranty or the Equity Commitment Letter exceed an amount equal
to $209,200,000 plus the Reimbursement Obligations in the aggregate for all
such breaches (the "Parent Liability Limitation"). In no event will any of
the Company Related Parties seek or obtain, nor will they permit any of their
Representatives or any other Person acting on their behalf to seek or obtain,
nor will any Person be entitled to seek or obtain, any monetary recovery or
monetary award in excess of the Parent Liability Limitation against (A) the
Buyer Parties or the Guarantor; or (B) the former, current and future holders
of any equity, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees,
agents, attorneys, Financing Sources, Affiliates (other than the Buyer
Parties or the Guarantor), members, managers, general or limited partners,
stockholders and assignees of each of the Buyer Parties and the Guarantor (the
Persons in clauses (A) and (B) collectively, the "Parent Related Parties"),
and in no event will the Company Group be entitled to seek or obtain any
monetary damages of any kind, including consequential, special, indirect or
punitive damages, in excess of the Parent Liability Limitation against the
Parent Related

 



83

    

 Parties for, or with respect to, this Agreement, the Equity Commitment
Letter, the Guaranty or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
(including any breach by the Guarantor or the Buyer Parties), the termination
of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the Mergers or any claims or
actions under applicable law arising out of any such breach, termination or
failure; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not preclude any liability of
the Financing Sources to the Company Parties or the Buyer Parties under the
definitive agreements relating to the Debt Financing, nor limit the Company
Parties or the Buyer Parties from seeking to recover any such damages or
obtain equitable relief from or with respect to any Financing Source pursuant
to the definitive agreements relating to the Debt Financing. Other than the
Guarantors obligations under the Guaranty and the Equity Commitment Letter
and other than the Buyer Parties obligations under this Agreement, in no
event will any Parent Related Party or any other Person other than the
Guarantor and the Buyer Parties have any liability for monetary damages to the
Company Parties or any other Person relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the Mergers.

(ii) The Parent Entities receipt of the Company Termination Fee to the
extent owed pursuant to Section 8.3(b) will be the only monetary damages that
the Buyer Parties and each of their respective Affiliates may recover from (A)
the Company Group and its Affiliates; and (B) the former, current and future
holders of any equity, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees,
agents, attorneys, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners,
stockholders and assignees of each of the Company Group and its Affiliates
(the Persons in clauses (A) and (B) collectively, the "Company Related
Parties") in respect of this Agreement, any agreement executed in connection
herewith and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, the
termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the Mergers or any
claims or actions under applicable law arising out of any such breach,
termination or failure, and upon payment of such amount, (1) none of the
Company Related Parties will have any further liability or obligation to the
Buyer Parties relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any agreement
executed in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby or any matters forming the basis of such termination (except that the
Parties (or their Affiliates) will remain obligated with respect to the
Confidentiality Agreement, the Voting Agreements Section 8.3(a) and Section
8.3(d), as applicable); and (2) none of the Buyer Parties or any other Person
will be entitled to bring or maintain any claim, action or proceeding against
the Company Parties or any Company Related Party arising out of this
Agreement, any agreement executed in connection herewith or the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby or any matters forming the basis for such
termination (except that the Parties (or their Affiliates) will remain
obligated with respect to the Confidentiality Agreement, the Voting
Agreements Section 8.3(a) and Section 8.3(d), as applicable). Under no
circumstances will the collective monetary damages payable by the Company
Parties for breaches under this Agreement (taking into account the payment of
the Company Termination Fee pursuant to this Agreement) exceed $104,600,000
in the aggregate for all such breaches (plus any obligations pursuant to
Section 8.3(d)) (the "Company Liability Limitation"). In no event will any of
the Parent Related Parties seek or obtain, nor will they permit any of their
Representatives or any other Person acting on their behalf to seek or obtain,
nor will any Person be entitled to seek or obtain, any monetary recovery or
award in excess of the Company Liability Limitation against any of the
Company Related Parties, and in no event will the Buyer Parties be entitled to
seek or obtain any monetary damages of any kind, including consequential,
special, indirect or punitive damages, in excess of the Company Liability
Limitation against the Company Related Parties for, or with respect to, this
Agreement or the Mergers, the termination of this Agreement, the failure to
consummate the Mergers or any claims or actions under applicable law arising
out of any such breach, termination or failure.

(f) _Acknowledgement Regarding Specific Performance_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in Section 8.3(e) or the existence of the Parent
Liability Limitation or the availability of monetary damages, it is agreed
that the Buyer Parties and the Company Parties will be entitled to an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief as provided in
Section 9.8(b), except that, although the Company, in its sole discretion, may
determine its choice of remedies hereunder, including by pursuing
specific performance in accordance with, but subject to the limitations of,
Section 9.8(b), under no circumstances will the Company Parties be permitted
or entitled to receive both specific performance that results in the
occurrence of the Closing and any monetary damages.

 



84

    

(g) _Non-Recourse Parent Party_. In no event will the Company Parties
seek or obtain, nor will they permit any of their Representatives to seek or
obtain, nor will any Person be entitled to seek or obtain, any monetary
recovery or monetary award against any Non-Recourse Parent Party (as defined
in the Equity Commitment Letter, which excludes, for the avoidance of doubt,
the Guarantor and the Buyer Parties) with respect to this Agreement, the
Equity Commitment Letter or the Guaranty or the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby (including any breach by the Guarantor or the Buyer
Parties), the termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby or any claims or actions under applicable
laws arising out of any such breach, termination or failure, other than from
the Buyer Parties to the extent expressly provided for in this Agreement or
the Guarantor to the extent expressly provided for in the Guaranty and
the Equity Commitment Letter.

8.4 _Amendment_. Subject to applicable law and subject to the other
provisions of this Agreement, this Agreement may be amended by the Parties at
any time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of
the Buyer Parties and the Company Parties (pursuant to authorized action by
the Company Board (or a committee thereof)), except that in the event that
the Company has received the Requisite Stockholder Approval, no amendment may
be made to this Agreement that requires the approval of the Company
Stockholders pursuant to the DGCL without such approval. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the provisions relating to the
Financing Sources set forth in Section 6.6(a), Section 8.2, Section 8.3(e),
Section 8.6, Section 9.3, Section 9.6, Section 9.8, Section 9.9, Section
9.10, Section 9.11 and this Section 8.4 (and any provision of this Agreement
to the extent a modification, waiver or termination of such provision would
modify the substance of the provisions relating to the Financing Sources set
forth in Sections 6.6(a), Section 8.2, Section 8.3(e), Section 8.6, Section
9.3, Section 9.6, Section 9.8, Section 9.9, Section 9.10, Section 9.11
or this Section 8.4) may not be amended, modified or altered without the
prior written consent of the Financing Sources.

 

8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time and from time to time prior to the
Holdings Merger Effective Time, any Party may, to the extent legally allowed
and except as otherwise set forth herein, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Parties, as
applicable; (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
made to such Party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant
hereto; and (c) subject to the requirements of applicable law, waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such
Party contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such
extension or waiver will be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by such Party. Any delay in exercising any right pursuant to
this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such right.

__8.6 _No Liability of Financing Sources_. None of the Financing Sources
will have any liability to the Company Parties or any of their Affiliates
relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Debt Financing or otherwise,
whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and none of
the Company Parties nor any of their Affiliates will have any rights or
claims against any of the Financing Sources hereunder or thereunder;
_provided_ , that nothing in this Section 8.6 shall limit the rights of the
Company Parties and their Affiliates from and after the Holdings Merger
Effective Time under any debt commitment letter or the definitive debt
documents executed in connection with the Debt Financing (but not, for the
avoidance of doubt, under this Agreement) to the extent the Company Parties
and/or their Affiliates are party thereto.

of creating a security interest herein or otherwise assigning as collateral
in respect of the Debt Financing, it being understood that, in each case, such
assignment will not (i) affect the obligations of the parties to the Equity
Commitment Letter or the Guarantor pursuant to the Guaranty; or (ii) impede
or delay the consummation of the Mergers or otherwise materially impede the
rights of the holders of shares of Company Capital Stock, Company PSUs,
Company RSUs, Company Options, Holdings RSUs and Holdings Incentive Units
pursuant to this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement
will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. No assignment by any Party will
relieve such Party of any of its obligations hereunder.

9.4 _Confidentiality_. The Buyer Parties and the Company Parties
hereby acknowledge that Vista Equity Partners Management, LLC and the Company
have previously executed a Confidentiality Agreement, dated October 6, 2020
(the "Confidentiality Agreement"), that will continue in full force and
effect in accordance with its terms; _provided_ that from and after the date
hereof, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Confidentiality
Agreement, no consent of the Company shall be required for any Person who is a
potential 

 



87

    

 source of, or may provide, equity, debt or any other type of financing for
the transactions contemplated hereby to become a Representative (as defined in
the Confidentiality Agreement) of Vista Equity Partners Management, LLC
thereunder. Each of the Buyer Parties and their respective Representatives
will hold and treat all documents and information concerning the Company Group
furnished or made available to the Buyer Parties or their respective
Representatives in connection with the Mergers in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement. By executing this Agreement, each of the Buyer
Parties agree to be bound by, and to cause their Representatives to be bound
by, the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement as if they were
parties thereto.

9.5 _Entire_ _Agreement_. This Agreement and the documents and
instruments and other agreements among the Parties as contemplated by or
referred to herein, including the Confidentiality Agreement, the Company
Disclosure Letter, the Parent Disclosure Letter, the Guaranty and the Equity
Commitment Letter, constitute the entire agreement among the Parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement will (a) not be superseded; (b)
survive any termination of this Agreement; and (c) continue in full force and
effect until the earlier to occur of the Company Merger Effective Time and
the date on which the Confidentiality Agreement expires in accordance with its
terms or is validly terminated by the parties thereto.

 

9.6 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as set forth in Section 6.10 and
this Section 9.6, the Parties agree that their respective representations,
warranties and covenants set forth in this Agreement are solely for the
benefit of the other Parties in accordance with and subject to the terms of
this Agreement. This Agreement is not intended to, and will not, confer upon
any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder, except (a) as set forth in
or contemplated by Section 6.10; (b) if a court of competent jurisdiction has
declined to grant specific performance and has instead granted an award of
damages, then the Company may enforce such award and seek additional damages
on behalf of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, Company RSUs,
Company PSUs, Company Options, Holdings Units, Holdings RSUs and
Holdings Incentive Units (which the Buyer Parties and the Guarantor
acknowledge and agree may include damages based on a decrease in share value
or lost premium) subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8.3(e)(i);
(c) if any of the Buyer Parties wrongfully terminate or willfully breach this
Agreement, or if the Guarantor wrongfully terminates or willfully breaches the
Guaranty, then, following the termination of this Agreement, the Company may
seek damages and other relief (including equitable relief) on behalf of the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock, Company RSUs, Company PSUs, Company
Options, Holdings Units, Holdings RSUs and Holdings RSUs (which the Buyer
Parties and the Guarantor acknowledge and agree may include damages based on
a decrease in share value or lost premium) subject to the limitations set
forth in Section 8.3(e)(i); and (d) from and after the Closing, the rights of
the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, Company RSUs, Company PSUs,
Company Options, Holdings Units, Holdings RSUs and Holdings Incentive Units to
receive the consideration set forth in Article II. The rights granted pursuant
to clause (c) of the second sentence of this Section 9.6 will only be
enforceable on behalf of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock,
Company RSUs, Company PSUs, Company Options, Holdings Units, Holdings RSUs and
Holdings Incentive Units by the Company, in its sole and absolute discretion,
as agent for such holders, and it is understood and agreed that any and all
interests in such claims will attach to such shares of the Company Common
Stock, Company RSUs, Company PSUs, Company Options, Holdings Units, Holdings
RSUs or Holdings Incentive Units and subsequently transfer therewith and,
consequently, any damages, settlements or other amounts recovered or received
by the Company with respect to such claims (net of expenses incurred by the
Company in connection therewith and subject to the limitations set forth in
Section 8.3(e)(i)) may, in the Companys sole and absolute discretion, be (A)
distributed, in whole or in part, by the Company to such holders as of any
date determined by the Company; or (B) retained by the Company for the use
and benefit of the Company Group in any manner that the Company deems fit. The
provisions of Section 6.6(a), Section 8.2, Section 8.3(e), Section 8.4,
Section 8.6, Section 9.3, Section 9.8, Section 9.9, Section 9.10, Section
9.11 and this Section 9.6 will inure to the benefit of the Financing Sources
and their successors and assigns, each of whom are intended to be third
party beneficiaries thereof (it

 



88

    

 being understood and agreed that the provisions of such Sections will be
enforceable by the Financing Sources and their respective successors and
assigns) and Section 8.3(g) will inure to the benefit of each Non-Recourse
Parent Party and their respective successors and assigns, each of whom are
intended to be third party beneficiaries thereof (it being understood and
agreed that the provisions of such Section will be enforceable by each Non-
Recourse Parent Party and their respective successors and assigns).

 

9.7 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or
the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties. The Parties further agree to
replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid
and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

9.8 _Remedies_.

 

(a) _Remedies Cumulative_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and
all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby or by
law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy
will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. Although the Company (on
behalf of the Company Parties) may pursue both a grant of specific performance
and monetary damages, under no circumstances will any of the Company Parties
be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance
that results in the occurrence of the Closing and monetary damages (including
any monetary damages in lieu of specific performance).

 

(b) _Specific Performance_.

 

(i) The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages,
even if available, would not be an adequate remedy would occur in the event
that the Parties do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including
any Party failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder in
order to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or
otherwise breach such provisions. The Parties acknowledge and agree that,
subject to Section 8.6, (A) the Parties will be entitled, in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, to
an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches (or threatened breaches) of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof; (B) the provisions of Section
8.3 are not intended to and do not adequately compensate the Company Parties,
on the one hand, or the Buyer Parties, on the other hand, for the harm that
would result from a breach of this Agreement, and will not be construed to
diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any Partys right to an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief; and (C) the right
of specific enforcement is an integral part of the Mergers and without that
right, neither the Company Parties nor the Buyer Parties would have entered
into this Agreement. It is explicitly agreed that the Company shall have the
right to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedies in
connection with enforcing the Buyer Parties obligations to consummate the
Mergers and cause the Equity Financing to be funded to fund the Mergers
(including to cause any Parent Entity to enforce the obligations of the
Guarantor under the Equity Commitment Letter in order to cause the Equity
Financing to be timely completed in accordance with and subject to the terms
and conditions set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter). Notwithstanding the
foregoing and subject to the rights of the parties to the definitive
agreements for any Debt Financing under the terms thereof, none of the
Company Parties and their Affiliates and their direct and indirect
equityholders shall have any rights or claims (whether in contract or in tort
or otherwise) against any Financing Source, solely in their
respective capacities as lenders or arrangers in connection with the Debt
Financing, and in no event shall any Company Party, any of its Affiliates or
its or their direct or indirect equityholders be entitled to directly seek the
remedy of specific performance of this Agreement against any Financing
Source.

 



89

    

(ii) The Parties agree not to raise any objections to (A) the granting of
an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent or
restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the Company, on
the one hand, or any Parent Entity, on the other hand; and (B) the
specific performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants, obligations and agreements of the Buyer Parties pursuant to this
Agreement. Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement will not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with such injunction or enforcement, and each Party irrevocably
waives any right that it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or
posting of any such bond or other security.

 

9.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted
and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware. Any and
all claims, controversies, and causes of action arising out of or relating to
this Agreement, whether sounding in contract, tort, or statute, shall be
governed by the internal laws of the State of Delaware, including its
statutes of limitations, without giving effect to any conflict-of-laws or
other rules that would result in the application of the laws or statutes
of limitations of a different jurisdiction.

9.10 _Consent to Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) _General Jurisdiction_. Each of the Parties (i) irrevocably consents
to the service of the summons and complaint and any other process (whether
inside or outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts) in any
Legal Proceeding relating to the Mergers and the Guaranty, for and on behalf
of itself or any of its properties or assets, in accordance with Section 9.2
or in such other manner as may be permitted by applicable law, and nothing in
this Section 9.10 will affect the right of any Party to serve legal process in
any other manner permitted by applicable law; (ii) irrevocably and
unconditionally consents and submits itself and its properties and assets in
any Legal Proceeding to the exclusive general jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom
within the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal
court within the State of Delaware (and any appellate court therefrom) or, if
any federal court within the State of Delaware declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state court within the State of
Delaware (and any appellate court therefrom)) (the "Chosen Courts") in the
event that any dispute or controversy arises out of this Agreement, the
Guaranty or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby; (iii) agrees that
it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or
other request for leave from any such court; (iv) agrees that any Legal
Proceeding arising in connection with this Agreement, the Guaranty or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby will be brought, tried and
determined only in the Chosen Courts; (v) waives any objection that it may
now or hereafter have to the venue of any such Legal Proceeding in the Chosen
Courts or that such Legal Proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and
agrees not to plead or claim the same; and (vi) agrees that it will not bring
any Legal Proceeding relating to this Agreement, the Guaranty or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby in any court other than the Chosen
Courts. Each of the Buyer Parties and the Company Parties agrees that a final
judgment in any Legal Proceeding in the Chosen Courts will be conclusive and
may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by applicable law.

 

(b) _Jurisdiction for Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Parties acknowledge and irrevocably agree (i)
that any Legal Proceeding, whether in law or in equity, in contract, in tort
or otherwise, involving the Financing Sources arising out of, or relating to,
the Mergers, the Debt Financing or the performance of services thereunder or
related thereto will be subject to the

 



90

    

 exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in the State of
New York in the borough of Manhattan and any appellate court thereof, and each
Party submits for itself and its property with respect to any such Legal
Proceeding to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court; (ii) not to bring or
permit any of their Affiliates to bring or support anyone else in bringing any
such Legal Proceeding in any other court; (iii) that service of process,
summons, notice or document by registered mail addressed to them at their
respective addresses provided in any applicable debt commitment letter will be
effective service of process against them for any such Legal Proceeding
brought in any such court; (iv) to waive and hereby waive, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, any objection which any of them may now or hereafter
have to the laying of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient forum to
the maintenance of, any such Legal Proceeding in any such court; and (v) any
such Legal Proceeding will be governed and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of New York.

 

9.11 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT THAT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY
JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING (WHETHER FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT,
TORTIOUS CONDUCT OR OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE MERGERS, THE GUARANTY, THE EQUITY COMMITMENT
LETTER, THE DEBT FINANCING OR THE EQUITY FINANCING (INCLUDING ANY SUCH LEGAL
PROCEEDING INVOLVING FINANCING SOURCES). EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES
THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE
EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (ii) IT
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER; (iii) IT MAKES
THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY; AND (iv) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS SECTION 9.11.

9.12 _Company Disclosure Letter_ _References_. The Parties agree that the
disclosure set forth in any particular section or subsection of the Company
Disclosure Letter will be deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a
disclosure for purposes of) (a) the representations and warranties (or
covenants, as applicable) of the Company Parties that are set forth in the
corresponding Section or subsection of this Agreement; and (b) any other
representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company
Parties that are set forth in this Agreement, but in the case of this clause
(b) only if the relevance of that disclosure as an exception to (or a
disclosure for purposes of) such other representations and warranties (or
covenants, as applicable) is reasonably apparent on the face of such
disclosure.

__9.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement and any amendments hereto may be
executed in one or more counterparts, all of which will be considered one and
the same agreement and will become effective when one or more counterparts
have been signed (including by electronic signature) by each of the Parties
and delivered to the other Parties, it being understood that all Parties need
not sign the same counterpart. Any such counterpart, to the extent delivered
by fax or .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpg or similar attachment to electronic mail (any
such delivery, an "Electronic Delivery"), will be treated in all manner and
respects as an original executed counterpart and will be considered to have
the same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version
thereof delivered in person. No Party may raise the use of an Electronic
Delivery to deliver a signature, or the fact that any signature or agreement
or instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of an Electronic
Delivery, as a defense to the formation of a contract, and each Party forever
waives any such defense, except to the extent such defense relates to lack of
authenticity.

 



91

    

9.14 _No Limitation_. It is the intention of the Parties that, to the
extent possible, unless provisions are mutually exclusive and effect cannot be
given to both or all such provisions, the representations, warranties,
covenants and closing conditions in this Agreement will be construed to be
cumulative and that each representation, warranty, covenant and closing
condition in this Agreement will be given full, separate and independent
effect and nothing set forth in any provision herein will in any way be deemed
to limit the scope, applicability or effect of any other provision hereof.
