ARTICLE III 

   

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK 
 OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS 

   

 Section 3.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, pursuant to this Agreement and by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub or the holders of the Shares: 

  

 (a) Each share of Common Stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Common Stock_ " or the " _Shares_ ") held by the Company (or any subsidiary of the Company) as treasury stock or owned directly or indirectly by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any Shares acquired by Parent, Merger Sub or any other subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time) shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no payment or distribution shall be made or delivered with respect thereto. 

  

 (b) [Intentionally omitted] 

  

 (c) Each share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one newly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (d) Each Share (including any Restricted Shares) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares to be canceled pursuant to _Section 3.1(a) _and Dissenting Shares), automatically shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive $54.00 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), payable to the holder 

   ##### 

  

 

thereof upon surrender of the stock certificate formerly representing such
Share (a " _Certificate_ ") in the manner provided in _Section 3.2_. Such
Shares, other than those canceled pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ and
Dissenting Shares, sometimes are referred to herein as the " _Merger
Shares_." 

   

 (e) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if required by the DGCL (but only to the extent required thereby), Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares to be canceled pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_) and that are held by holders of such Shares who have not voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who have properly exercised appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance with, and who have complied with, Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") will not be convertible into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and holders of such Dissenting Shares will be entitled to receive payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of such Section 262 unless and until any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses its rights to appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such right, such Dissenting Shares will thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and have become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, and the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for payment of the Merger Consideration for such Shares. At the Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights provided in Section 262 of the DGCL and as provided in the previous sentence. The Company will give Parent (i) notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisals of Shares and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such notices and demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or settle any such demands. 

  

 (f) If between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the number of outstanding Shares is changed into a different number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or the like, other than pursuant to the Merger, the amount of Merger Consideration payable per Merger Share shall be correspondingly adjusted. 

  

 (g) For the avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge and agree that the contribution of Shares (including Restricted Shares) to Parent pursuant to any agreements with holders of Shares (including Restricted Shares) shall be deemed to occur immediately prior to the Effective Time and prior to any other above-described event. 

  

 Section 3.2 _Payment of Cash for Merger Shares_. 

  

 (a) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall (i) designate a bank or trust company that is reasonably satisfactory to Parent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") and (ii) enter into a paying agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, with such Paying Agent, to serve as the Paying Agent for the Merger Consideration and payments in respect of the Company Options, RSUs and Net SPP Payments, unless another agent is designated as provided in _Section 3.3(a)_ , _Section 3.3(c)_ and _Section 3.3(d)_. Immediately following the Effective Time, Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation will deposit, or Parent 

   ##### 

  

 

shall cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit, with the Paying Agent cash
in the aggregate amount sufficient to pay the Merger Consideration in respect
of all Merger Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time plus
any cash necessary to pay for Company Options and RSUs outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, as well as for Net SPP Payments,
pursuant to  _Section 3.3(a)_, _Section 3.3(c)_ and _Section 3.3(d)_.
Pending distribution of the cash deposited with the Paying Agent, such cash
shall be held in trust for the benefit of the holders of Merger Shares, RSUs
and Company Options outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, as
well as for Net SPP Payments, and shall not be used for any other purposes; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving Corporation may direct the Paying
Agent to invest such cash in (i) obligations of or guaranteed by the United
States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof, (ii) money market
accounts, certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreement or bankers
acceptances of, or demand deposits with, commercial banks having a
combined capital and surplus of at least $1,000,000,000 (based on the most
recent financial statements of such bank which are publicly available), or
(iii) commercial paper obligations rated P-1 or A-1 or better by Standard and
Poors Corporation or Moodys Investor Services, Inc. Any profit or
loss resulting from, or interest and other income produced by, such
investments shall be for the account of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (b) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall send, or cause the Paying Agent to send, to each record holder of Merger Shares entitled to receive the Merger Consideration a letter of transmittal and instructions for exchanging their Merger Shares for the Merger Consideration payable therefor. The letter of transmittal will be in customary form and will specify that delivery of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) will be effected, and risk of loss and title will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent. Upon surrender of Certificate or Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent together with a properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal and any other documentation that the Paying Agent may reasonably require, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration payable in exchange therefor, less any amounts required to be withheld for Tax. Until so surrendered and exchanged, each such Certificate shall, after the Effective Time, be deemed to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and until such surrender and exchange, no cash shall be paid to the holder of such outstanding Certificate in respect thereof. 

  

 (c) If payment is to be made to a Person other than the registered holder of the Merger Shares formerly represented by the Certificate or Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor, it shall be a condition to such payment that the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Paying Agent any applicable stock transfer taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Merger Shares or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such stock transfer taxes have been paid or are not payable. 

  

 (d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than to settle transfers of Shares that occurred prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying 

   ##### 

  

 

Agent, such shares shall be canceled and exchanged for the consideration
provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this
_Article III_. 

   

 (e) If any cash deposited with the Paying Agent remains unclaimed twelve months after the Effective Time, such cash shall be returned to the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any holder who has not surrendered such holders Certificates for the Merger Consideration prior to that time shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of Certificates for any amount paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable unclaimed property laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Certificates as of a date immediately prior to such time that such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation on such date, free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

  

 (f) No dividends or other distributions with respect to capital stock of the Surviving Corporation with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate, including Dissenting Shares. 

  

 (g) From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Shares (other than Dissenting Shares) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares, other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this Agreement. 

  

 (h) In the event that any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, in addition to the posting by such holder of any bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the proper amount of the Merger Consideration in respect thereof entitled to be received pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

 (i) Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable hereunder and any amounts to be paid hereunder in respect of Company Options, RSUs or Net SPP Payments any amounts required to be deducted and withheld under any applicable Tax Law. To the extent any amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be timely paid to the applicable Tax authority and shall be treated for all purposes as having been paid to the holder from whose Merger Consideration (or amounts payable hereunder with respect to Company Options, RSUs or Net SPP Payments) the amounts were so deducted and withheld. 

  

 Section 3.3 _Treatment of Options and Other Awards_. 

  

 (a) As of the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed by Parent and the holder of Company Options with respect to such holders Company Options, each Company Option will be cancelled and extinguished, and the holder thereof will be entitled to receive an 

   ##### 

  

 

amount in cash equal to the excess (if any) of (A) the product of (i) the
number of Shares subject to such Company Option and (ii) the Merger
Consideration over (B) the aggregate exercise price of such Company Option,
without interest and less any amounts required to be deducted and withheld
under any applicable Law. All payments with respect to canceled Company
Options shall be made by the Paying Agent (or such other agent reasonably
acceptable to Parent as the Company shall designate prior to the Effective
Time) as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time from
funds deposited by or at the direction of the Surviving Corporation to pay
such amounts in accordance with _Section 3.2(a)_. 

   

 (b) As of the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed by Parent and the holder of a Share subject to vesting or other lapse restrictions pursuant to any Company Stock Plan or any applicable restricted stock award agreement (each a " _Restricted Share_ ") with respect to such holders Restricted Shares, each Restricted Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall vest and become free of such restrictions as of the Effective Time and shall, as of the Effective Time, be canceled and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 3.1(d)_. 

  

 (c) As of the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed by Parent and the holder of awards of a right under any Company Stock Plan entitling the holder thereof to Restricted Shares, shares of Common Stock or cash equal to or based on the value of Common Stock (collectively, " _RSUs_ ") with respect to such holders RSUs, each RSU outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall vest, if applicable, and become free of any lapse restriction (without regard to whether the RSUs are then vested or the applicable restrictions have lapsed) and, as of the Effective Time be canceled, and at the Effective Time, the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to the (i) product of (A) the number of Shares previously subject to such RSU and (B) the Merger Consideration, and (ii) the value of any deemed dividend equivalents accrued but unpaid with respect to such RSUs, less any amounts required to be withheld under any applicable Law. All payments with respect to canceled RSUs shall be made by the Paying Agent (or such other agent reasonably acceptable to Parent as the Company shall designate prior to the Effective Time) as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time from funds deposited by or at the direction of the Surviving Corporation to pay such amounts in accordance with _Section 3.2(a)_. 

  

 (d) At the Effective Time, all amounts withheld by the Company on behalf of the participants in the Companys Amended and Restated Management Stock Purchase Plan and the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _Stock Purchase Plans_ ", and such participants, the " _Participants_ ") from the beginning of the applicable existing salary reduction periods through the Effective Time will be deemed to have been used to purchase Common Stock pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Plans, using the Effective Time as the last date of the applicable salary reduction period under the Stock Purchase Plans (the " _Deemed Purchase_ ") and each such share of Common Stock will be deemed to have been cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, such that, as of the Effective Time, on a net basis, each Participant shall be entitled to receive, without interest and less any amounts required to be deducted and withheld under any applicable Law, (i) a refund by the Company of all reductions made pursuant to the Stock Purchase Plans by the Participant during the applicable existing salary reduction periods and (ii) an amount in cash equal to the excess (if any) of (A) the product of (1) the number of Shares that the Participant is deemed to have acquired pursuant to 

   ##### 

  

 

the terms of the applicable Stock Purchase Plan pursuant to the applicable
Deemed Purchase and (2) the Merger Consideration, over (B) the aggregate
amount of the Participants purchase price deemed to have been paid in the
Deemed Purchase (such cash amount described in (ii) being the " _Net SPP
Payment_ "). All Net SPP Payments shall be paid by the Paying Agent (or such
other agent reasonably acceptable to Parent as the Company shall designate
prior to the Effective Time) as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time from funds deposited by or at the direction of the Surviving
Corporation to pay such amounts in accordance with _Section 3.2(a)_. However,
in connection with the foregoing, if and to the extent permitted by
the applicable Stock Purchase Plan, on or after the date of this Agreement,
in no event (i) shall any person who is not currently participating in any
Stock Purchase Plan be permitted to begin participating in any Stock Purchase
Plan, and (ii) shall any person who is currently participating in any Stock
Purchase Plan be permitted to increase the level of salary reduction amount
that may otherwise be deemed used to purchase shares of Common Stock under
any Stock Purchase Plan from that level of salary reduction amount in effect
as of the date of this Agreement; and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that in no
event may any new salary reduction period commence after the date hereof and
prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will (i) (A) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any consents from the holders of Company Options, and (B) to the extent the Company does not obtain all of such consents, make any amendments to the terms of any Company Stock Plan that in the case of either clause (A) or (B), are necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by  _Section 3.3(a)_ and (ii) adopt such resolutions and will take such other actions as may be reasonably required to effectuate the actions contemplated by this _Section 3.3_, without paying any consideration or incurring any debts or obligations on behalf of the Company or the Surviving Corporation.

the case of the Companys Subsidiaries, where the failure to be so organized,
existing and in good standing has not had, and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has all corporate or
similar powers and authority required to own, lease and operate its
respective properties and to carry on its business as now conducted, except
in the case of the Companys Subsidiaries, where the failure to have such
power and authority has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to

qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the
business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and
assets owned or leased by it makes such qualification necessary, except

 Section 5.6 _Finders  Fees_. Other than Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, no agent, broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other firm or person is or will be entitled to any brokers or finders fee or any other similar commission or fee from Parent in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in the event that the Merger is not consummated. 

  

 Section 5.7 _Financing_. Parent has delivered to the Company true, correct and complete copies of the commitment letter, dated as of the date of this Agreement, among Parent and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Credit Suisse, Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC, Wachovia Bank, 

   ##### 

  

 

N.A. and Wachovia Investment Holdings, LLC (the " _Debt Financing Commitments_
"), pursuant to which the lenders party thereto have committed, subject to
the terms and conditions thereof, to lend and fund (as applicable) the
amounts set forth therein (the " _Debt Financing_ "). Prior to the date of
this Agreement, (i) none of the Debt Financing Commitments has been amended
or modified, and (ii) the respective commitments contained in the Debt
Financing Commitments have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect.
Each of the Debt Financing Commitments, in the form so delivered, is in full
force and effect as of the date of this Agreement and is a legal, valid and
binding obligation of Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent, the
other parties thereto for so long as it remains in full force and effect.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, one or more Debt
Financing Commitments may be superseded at the option of Parent after the
date of this Agreement but prior to the Effective Time by instruments (the "
_New Financing Commitments_ ") which replace existing Debt Financing
Commitments;  _provided_ , that the terms of the New Financing Commitments
shall not (a) adversely amend or expand upon the conditions precedent to the
Debt Financing as set forth in the Debt Financing Commitments without the
approval of the Board of Directors of the Company (or the Special
Committee if such committee still exists), (b) reasonably be expected to
delay or hinder the Closing or (c) reduce the aggregate amount of available
Debt Financing. In such event, the term " _Debt Financing Commitments_ " as
used herein shall be deemed to include the Debt Financing Commitments that
are not so superseded at the time in question and the New Financing
Commitments to the extent then in effect. Parent shall not amend or modify
any Debt Financing Commitment after the date of this Agreement but prior to
the Effective Time unless such amendment or modification (a) does
not adversely amend or expand upon the conditions precedent to the Debt
Financing as set forth in the Debt Financing Commitments without the approval
of the Board of Directors of the Company (or the Special Committee if such
committee still exists), (b) is not reasonably expected to delay or hinder
the Closing and (c) does not reduce the aggregate amount of available
Financing. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred which,
with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or
breach on the part of Parent under any term or condition of the Debt
Financing Commitments. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has no reason
to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or
condition of closing to be satisfied by it contained in the Debt Financing
Commitments. Parent has fully paid to the extent required to be paid prior to
the date hereof any and all commitment fees incurred in connection with the
Debt Financing Commitments and will pay when due all other commitment
fees incurred in connection with the Debt Financing Commitments as and when
they become due and payable. Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in _Article VIII_, the Debt Financing Commitments, when funded, along
with cash on hand, will provide the Surviving Corporation with financing
immediately after the Effective Time sufficient to consummate the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby (including payment of all amounts
that may become payable under the Company Benefit Plans) upon the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and to pay all related fees and expenses
associated therewith, including payment of all amounts under _Article
III_ of this Agreement and all associated costs and expenses (including any
refinancing of indebtedness of the Company or Merger Sub required in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement). 

   

 Section 5.8 _[ Intentionally Omitted]_ 

  

 Section 5.9 _Operations of Merger Sub_. Merger Sub has been formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated hereby and prior to the Effective Time will 

   ##### 

  

 

have engaged in no other business activities and will have incurred no
liabilities or obligations other than as contemplated herein, including in
connection with arranging the Financing. 

   

 Section 5.10 _Litigation_. There are no pending or, to the knowledge of Parent or Merger Sub, threatened, Proceedings of any nature against either Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective properties or assets and there are no injunctions, orders, judgments, decrees, settlement agreements, rulings or regulatory restrictions of any Governmental Authority binding on either Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective properties or assets which (i) have had or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations of Parent or Merger Sub, (ii) would prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby or (iii) otherwise prevent or materially delay the performance by Parent or Merger Sub of their obligations under this Agreement. 

  

 Section 5.11 _Solvency_. As of the Effective Time, assuming (i) satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to Parents obligation to consummate the Merger and (ii) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in _Article IV_ hereof, then after giving effect to all of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Financing, any alternative financing, the Debt Offer, any satisfaction or discharge under Section 7.11(h), payment of the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration, payment of all amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and all related fees, expenses and commissions, the Surviving Corporation on a consolidated basis will be Solvent. For the purposes of this _Section 5.11_, the term " _Solvent,_ " when used with respect to any Person, means that, as of any date of determination, (a) the amount of the "fair saleable value" of the assets of such Person will, as of such date, exceed (i) the value of all "liabilities of such Person, including contingent and other liabilities," as of such date, as such quoted terms are generally determined in accordance with applicable Laws governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors, and (ii) the amount that will be required to pay the probable liabilities of such Person on its existing debts (including contingent liabilities) as such debts become absolute and matured, (b) such Person will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged following such date, and (c) such Person will be able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature. For purposes of this definition, "not have an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged" and "able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature" means that such Person will be able to generate enough cash from operations, asset dispositions or refinancing, or a combination thereof, to meet its obligations as they become due. 

  

 Section 5.12 _Debt Financing Commitment Conditions_. There are no conditions to the funding of the Debt Financing in the amounts set forth in the Debt Financing Commitments other than the conditions precedent set forth in the Debt Financing Commitments (the conditions precedent so set forth, the " _Disclosed Conditions_ "), and no Person has any right to impose, and neither the Borrower nor Holdings (each as defined in the Debt Financing Commitments) has any obligation to accept (i) any condition precedent to such funding other then the Disclosed Conditions nor (ii) any reduction to the aggregate amount available under the Debt Financing Commitments on the Closing Date (nor any term or condition which would have the effect of reducing the aggregate amount under the Debt Financing Commitments on the Closing Date).

In furtherance of and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties contained in _Section 7.2(a)_ and  _Section 7.2(b)_, Parent shall offer to take (and if such offer is accepted, commit to take) all steps to avoid or eliminate impediments under any antitrust, competition or trade regulation law that may be asserted by the FTC, the DOJ, or any other Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger so as to enable the Effective Time to occur prior to the End Date and shall defend through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in any court by any party, including appeals. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall propose, negotiate, offer to commit and effect (and if such offer is accepted, commit to and effect), by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of such assets of businesses of Parent or, effective as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation, or their respective subsidiaries or otherwise offer to take or offer to commit to take any action which it is capable of taking and if the offer is accepted, take or commit to take such action that limits its freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, any of the businesses, services or assets of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries, in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any Proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of preventing or delaying the Effective Time beyond the End Date. At the request of Parent (and only thereupon), the Company shall agree to divest, hold separate or otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits its freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, any of the businesses, services or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, provided that the Company shall not be obligated to take any such action unless the taking of such action is conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger. 

  

 (d) Subject to the obligations under _Section 7.2(c)_, in the event that any administrative or judicial Proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by a Governmental Authority or private party challenging the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, or any other agreement contemplated hereby, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cooperate in all respects with each other and use its respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such Proceeding and to have vacated, 

   ##### 

  

 

lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other
order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and
that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 Section 7.3 _Access to Information_. 

  

 (a) Subject to applicable Law, the Company will provide and will cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives to provide Parent and Merger Sub and their respective authorized Representatives, during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice, (i) such access to the offices, properties, books and records of the Company and such Subsidiaries (so long as such access does not unreasonably interfere with the operations of the Company) as Parent or Merger Sub reasonably may request, and (ii) all documents that Merger Sub reasonably may request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Representatives shall not have access to any books, records and other information the disclosure of which would, in the Companys good faith opinion after consultation with legal counsel, result in the loss of attorney-client privilege with respect to such books, records and other information. The parties will use their reasonable best efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. 

  

 (b) No investigation by any of the parties or their respective Representatives shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the other parties set forth herein.

Upon execution of this Agreement, the Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated 

   ##### 

  

 

any solicitation, encouragement, discussion or negotiation with any Person
conducted theretofore by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal
and cause to be returned or destroyed all confidential information provided
or made available to such Person on behalf of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries. From date hereof until the Effective Time or, if earlier,
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article IX, the Company
shall not amend, modify or waive any provision of any confidentiality
agreement to which it is a party or terminate any such
confidentiality agreement, and shall use reasonable best efforts to enforce
the material terms thereof. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 7.4(b)_, if at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Vote, (i) the Company has received a written Company Acquisition Proposal from a third party that the Board of Directors of the Company (following the recommendation of the Special Committee if such committee still exists) believes in good faith to be _bona fide_ and (ii) the Board of Directors of the Company (following the recommendation of the Special Committee if such committee still exists) determines in good faith, after consultation with its independent financial advisors and outside counsel, that such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, then the Company may (A) furnish information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Company Acquisition Proposal and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person making such Company Acquisition Proposal regarding such Company Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that the Company (x) will not, and will not allow Company Representatives to, disclose any non-public information to such Person without entering into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, and (y) will promptly provide to Parent any non-public information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries provided to such other Person which was not previously provided to Parent. After the date hereof, the Company shall promptly (and in any event within two Business Days) notify Parent in the event it receives a Company Acquisition Proposal from a Person or group of related Persons or any material revisions thereto. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall promptly (and in any event within two Business Days) notify Parent if it determines to begin providing information or to engage in negotiations concerning a Company Acquisition Proposal from a Person or group of related Persons pursuant to this _Section 7.4(c)_. 

  

 (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Vote, the Company receives a Company Acquisition Proposal which the Board of Directors of the Company (following the recommendation of the Special Committee, if such committee still exists) concludes in good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors of the Company (following the recommendation of the Special Committee, if such committee still exists) may (x) effect a Recommendation Withdrawal and/or (y) terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal if the Board of Directors of the Company (following the recommendation of the Special Committee, if such committee still exists) determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that failure to take such action could violate its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ ,  _however_ that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (y), and any purported termination pursuant to the foregoing clause (y) shall be void and of no force or effect, unless concurrently with such termination the Company pays the 

   ##### 

  

 

Termination Fee payable pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ and the amount set
forth in  _Section 9.2(a)(ii)_; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Board
of Directors may not effect a Recommendation Withdrawal pursuant to the
foregoing clause (x) or terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing
clause (y) unless (i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to
Parent, at least three calendar days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ "),
of its intention to effect a Recommendation Withdrawal in response to such
Superior Proposal or terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive
agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, which notice shall include
a written summary of the material terms and conditions of such Superior
Proposal (including the identity of the party making such Superior Proposal)
and (ii) the Company shall have contemporaneously provided a copy of the
relevant proposed transaction agreements with the party making such Superior
Proposal. 

   

 In the event of any material revisions to the Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this _Section 7.4(d)_ with respect to such new written notice. 

  

 (e) The Company agrees that any violations of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 7.4_ by any Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 7.4_ by the Company. 

  

 (f) As used in this Agreement, the term: 

   

 (i) " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ " means a confidentiality and standstill agreement that contains provisions that are no less favorable in the aggregate to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement; 

   

 (ii) " _Company Acquisition Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person or group of Persons other than Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Affiliates relating to any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of a business that constitutes 15% or more of the net revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 15% or more of any class or series of Company Securities, any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person or group of Persons beneficially owning 15% or more of any class or series of capital stock of the Company, or any merger, reorganization, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company (or any Subsidiary or Subsidiaries of the Company whose business constitutes 15% or more of the net revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole); and 

   

 (iii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a Company Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company (following the recommendation of the Special Committee, if such committee still exists) in good faith determines, would, if consummated, result in a transaction that is more favorable from a financial point of view to the stockholders of the Company than the transactions contemplated hereby (x) after receiving the advice of its independent financial advisor, (y) after taking into account the likelihood of consummation of such transaction on the terms set forth therein (as compared to the terms herein) and (z) after taking into account all appropriate legal (with 

   ##### 

  

  

the advice of outside counsel), financial (including the financing terms of
any such proposal), regulatory or other aspects of such proposal and any
other relevant factors permitted by applicable Law; _provided_ , that for
purposes of the definition of "Superior Proposal", the references to "15% or
more" in the definition of Company Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be
references to "a majority".

   

 (g) Nothing contained in this _Section 7.4_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ , any such disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen" letter or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be a Recommendation Withdrawal unless the Board of Directors of the Company (following the recommendation of the Special Committee if such committee still exists) expressly publicly reaffirms at least two Business Days prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting its recommendation in favor of the adoption of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 7.5 _Director and Officer Liability_. 

  

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall to the greatest extent permitted by Law jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless (and comply with all of the Companys and its Subsidiaries existing obligations to advance funds for expenses) (i) the present and former officers and directors thereof against any and all costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened legal, administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions or governmental or regulatory investigations, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (" _Damages_ "), arising out of, relating to or in connection with any acts or omissions occurring or alleged to occur prior to or at the Effective Time, including, without limitation, the approval of this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or arising out of or pertaining to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (ii) such persons against any and all Damages arising out of acts or omissions in connection with such persons serving as an officer, director or other fiduciary in any entity if such service was at the request or for the benefit of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. 

  

 (b) As of the Effective Time, the Company shall have purchased, and, following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain, a tail policy to the current policy of directors and officers liability insurance maintained on the date hereof by the Company (the " _Current Policy_ ") which tail policy shall be effective for a period from the Effective Time through and including the date six years after the Closing Date with respect to claims arising from facts or events that existed or occurred prior to or at the Effective Time, and which tail policy shall contain substantially the same coverage and amount as, and contain terms and conditions no less advantageous, in the aggregate, than the coverage currently provided by the Current Policy;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend annually in excess of 300% of the current annual premium paid by the Company under the Current Policy (the " _Insurance Amount_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if the premium of such insurance coverage exceeds the Insurance Amount, the Company shall be 

   ##### 

  

 

obligated to obtain, and the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to
maintain, a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not
exceeding the Insurance Amount. 

   

 (c) This _Section 7.5_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, present or former directors or officers of the Company, its Subsidiaries, and their respective heirs and personal representatives and shall be binding on Parent and the Surviving Corporation and their respective successors and assigns. In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person (including by dissolution), then, and in each such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of it or of the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, assume and honor the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.5_. The agreements and covenants contained herein shall not be deemed to be exclusive of any other rights to which any such present or former director or officer is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or their respective officers, directors and employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this _Section 7.5_ is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under any such policies. 

  

 Section 7.6 _Takeover Statutes_. The parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts (i) to take all action necessary so that no Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) if any such Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to any of the foregoing, to take all action necessary so that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Takeover Statute on the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 Section 7.7 _Public Announcements_. Except with respect to any Recommendation Withdrawal or any action taken pursuant to, and in accordance with, _Section 7.4_ or  _Article IX_, so long as this Agreement is in effect, the parties will consult with each other before issuing any press release or making any public statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. No party hereto will issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except to the extent the disclosing party determines it is required to do so by applicable Law or any listing agreement with the New York Stock Exchange, in which case that party will use all reasonable efforts to consult with the other party before issuing any such release or making any such public statement. 

  

 Section 7.8 _Notice of Current Events_. From and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall promptly notify each other orally and in writing of (i) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to cause any condition to the obligations of any party to effect the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied or (ii) the failure of such party to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to 

   ##### 

  

 

be complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement which,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to result in
any condition to the obligations of any party to effect the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to be
satisfied; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to
this _Section 7.8_ shall not cure any breach of any representation or
warranty requiring disclosure of such matter prior to the date of this
Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to the
party receiving such notice. 

   

 Section 7.9 _Employee Matters_. 

  

 (a) Without limiting any additional rights that any Company Employee employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at the Effective Time (" _Current Employee_ ") may have under any Company Benefit Plan, each of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, for the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on December 31, 2008, shall maintain for Current Employees (i) their salary or hourly wage rate, commission structure and opportunities, and/or target cash bonus opportunities under annual programs (but, except as otherwise agreed with Parent or the Surviving Corporation, excluding any equity or equity equivalent award opportunities, and any other equity-based compensation) (collectively, " _Compensation_ "), that in the aggregate are not less favorable than, and (ii) severance, pension and welfare benefits (excluding any value attributable to any equity-based benefits) provided under the Company Benefit Plans that in the aggregate are not less favorable than, the Compensation and benefits, as applicable, maintained for and provided to Current Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that subject to the foregoing and this _Section 7.9_ nothing herein shall prevent the amendment or termination of any Company Benefit Plans or interfere with the Surviving Corporations right or obligation to make such changes as are necessary to conform with applicable Law. Nothing in this _Section 7.9_ shall limit the right of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any Current Employee at any time. 

  

 (b) As of and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall give Current Employees full credit for all purposes (but not benefit accruals under any newly established defined benefit pension plans), under any new employee compensation and incentive plans, benefit (including vacation) plans, programs, policies and arrangements maintained for the benefit of Current Employees as of and after the Effective Time by the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries for the Company Employees service with the Company, its Subsidiaries and their predecessor entities (each, a " _Surviving Corporation Plan_ ") to the same extent recognized by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time under any similar Company Benefit Plan. With respect to each Surviving Corporation Plan that is a "welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (i) cause there to be waived any pre-existing condition or eligibility limitations and (ii) give effect, for the applicable plan year in which the Closing occurs, in determining any deductible and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to claims incurred and amounts paid by, and amounts reimbursed to, Current Employees under similar plans maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (c) The provisions of this _Section 7.9_ are for the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be construed to 

   ##### 

  

 

(i) confer upon or give to any person (including for the avoidance of doubt
any Company Employees), other than the parties hereto and their respective
permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or
remedies (with respect to the matters provided for in this _Section 7.9_)
under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement, or (ii) constitute an
amendment or modification of any Company Benefit Plan. 

   

 Section 7.10 _Financing_. 

  

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to provide, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause their respective Representatives, including legal and accounting Representatives, to provide, all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the arrangement of the financings contemplated by any Debt Financing Commitments (provided that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries), including: (i) participation in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions and sessions with rating agencies; (ii) assisting with the preparation of materials for rating agency presentations, offering documents, private placement memoranda, bank information memoranda, prospectuses, marketing materials and similar documents (including MDandA and business description) required in connection with the Debt Financing; _provided_ , that any private placement memoranda or prospectuses in relation to high yield debt securities need not be issued by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _further_ , that any such memoranda or prospectuses shall contain disclosure and financial statements with respect to the Company or the Surviving Corporation reflecting the Surviving Corporation and/or its Subsidiaries as the obligor; (iii) executing and delivering any pledge and security documents, other definitive financing documents, or other certificates, legal opinions or documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent (including a certificate of the chief financial officer of the Company with respect to solvency of the Company on a consolidated basis and consents of accountants for use of their reports in any materials relating to the Debt Financing) and otherwise reasonably facilitating the granting, pledging, recording and perfection of collateral; (iv) furnishing Parent and its financing sources as promptly as practicable (and in any event no later than 25 Business Days prior to the End Date) with financial and other pertinent information regarding the Company as may be reasonably requested by Parent, including all financial statements and financial and other data of the type that would be required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under the Securities Act of the type and form customarily included in private placements under Rule 144A of the Securities Act to consummate the offerings of securities contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments at the time during the Companys fiscal year such offerings will be made (the " _Required Financial Information_ "); (v) using commercially reasonable efforts to assist Parent in connection with the satisfaction of the conditions of the Debt Financing Commitment, (vi) providing monthly financial statements (excluding footnotes) within the time frame, and to the extent, the Company prepares such financial statements; (vii) taking all actions reasonably necessary to (A) permit the prospective lenders involved in the Financing to evaluate the Companys current assets, cash management and accounting systems, policies and procedures relating thereto for the purpose of establishing collateral arrangements and (B) establish blocked account agreements in connection with the foregoing; (viii) entering into one or more credit or other agreements on terms reasonably satisfactory to Parent in connection with the financing contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , that none of the Company or 

   ##### 

  

 

any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to enter into any purchase agreement
for any high yield debt financing (other than bridge financing); and (ix)
taking all corporate actions, subject to the occurrence of the Closing,
reasonably requested by Parent to permit the consummation of the financings
contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments and the direct borrowing of all
of the proceeds of, the incurrence of the debt contemplated by, and the
issuance of the securities contemplated by, the Debt Financing Commitments,
including any high yield debt and any preferred financing, by the Surviving
Corporation concurrently or immediately following the Effective Time; 
_provided_ , that prior to the Effective Time neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee
or incur any other cost or expense that is not simultaneously reimbursed by
Parent in connection with the Debt Financing prior to the Effective Time.
Parent or Merger Sub shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse
the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation
and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives for and against any and all liabilities, losses,
damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties
suffered or incurred by them in connection with the Debt Financing (other
than to the extent such losses arise from the willful misconduct of the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives) and any
information utilized in connection therewith (other than information provided
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries). The Company hereby consents to the
use of its and its Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Debt Financing;
_provided_ , that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended
to nor reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and its or their marks. All non-public or otherwise
confidential information regarding the Company obtained by Parent, Merger Sub
or their Representatives pursuant to this _Section 7.10(a)_ shall be kept
confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. 

   

 (b) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange the Debt Financing as promptly as practicable taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing Period and the End Date on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Financing Commitments, including using reasonable best efforts to (i) negotiate definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contained therein or on other terms no less favorable to Parent, (ii) to satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent in such definitive agreements that are within its control and (iii) upon the satisfaction of such conditions, to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the funding of such Debt Financing. In the event any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt Financing Commitments, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain alternative financing from alternative sources on terms no less favorable to Parent (as determined in the reasonable judgment of Parent) as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event but no later than the final day of the Marketing Period or if, earlier, the End Date. Parent shall keep the Company reasonably apprised of material developments relating to the Financing. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that (x) all or any portion of the Debt Financing structured as high yield financing has not been consummated, (y) all closing conditions contained in _Article VIII_ (other than those contained in _Section 8.2(c)_ and _Section 8.3(c)_) shall have been satisfied or waived and (z) the bridge facilities contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments (or alternative bridge financing obtained in accordance with this Agreement) are available on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Financing Commitments (or 

   ##### 

  

 

replacements thereof), then Parent shall cause the proceeds of such bridge
financing to be used to replace such high yield financing no later than the
final day of the Marketing Period or, if earlier, the End Date. For purposes
of this Agreement, " _Marketing Period_ " shall mean the first period of 20
consecutive Business Days after the date hereof throughout which (A)
Parent shall have the Required Financial Information that the Company is
required to provide to Parent pursuant to _Section 7.10(a)_ and (B) the
conditions set forth in _Section 8.1_ and  _Section 8.2(d)_ shall be
satisfied and nothing has occurred and no condition exists that would cause
any of the conditions set forth in _Section 8.2(a)_ and _Section 8.2(b)_
to fail to be satisfied assuming the Closing were to be scheduled for any
time during such 20 consecutive Business Day period, and (unless Parent and
the Merger Sub have previously waived the conditions set forth in _Section
8.2(d)_) the Company has delivered a notice to Parent that the Company
believes that the conditions set forth in _Section 8.2(d)_ have been
satisfied;  _provided_ , that if the Marketing Period has not ended on or
prior to August 17, 2007, the Marketing Period shall commence no earlier than
September 4, 2007; and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that the "Marketing Period"
shall not be deemed to have commenced if, prior to the completion of the
Marketing Period, Ernst and Young LLP shall have withdrawn its audit opinion
with respect to any financial statements contained in the Company SEC
Reports. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the financial statements included
in the Required Financial Information that is available to Parent on the
first day of any such 20-Business-Day period would not be
sufficiently current on any day during such 20-Business-Day period to permit
(i) a registration statement using such financial statements to be declared
effective by the SEC on the last day of such 20-Business-Day period or (ii)
the Companys independent registered accounting firm to issue a customary
comfort letter to Merger Sub (in accordance with its normal practices and
procedures) on the last day of such 20-Business-Day period, then a new
20-Business-Day period shall commence upon Parent receiving updated Required
Financial Information that would be sufficiently current to permit the
actions described in clauses (i) and (ii) of this sentence on the last day of
such 20-Business-Day period. 

   

 (c) Without limitation of its obligations in _Section 7.10(b)_, Parent shall, on or about the same date as the commencement of the Debt Offer, commence a tender offer (the "Parent Tender Offer") and consent solicitation (the "Parent Consent Solicitation") for all of its outstanding 6 1/2% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2012 (the "Existing Parent Notes") and will purchase each of the Existing Parent Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn in the Parent Tender Offer. To the extent not all of the Existing Parent Notes are purchased pursuant to the Parent Tender Offer, on or before the Closing Date, Parent shall (i) amend the indenture relating thereto pursuant to the Parent Consent Solicitation to remove the significant restrictive covenants and the merger covenant therefrom, (ii) defease the significant restrictive covenants therefrom in accordance with the relevant provisions of the indenture governing the Existing Parent Notes and/or (iii) take such other actions necessary to redeem, satisfy and/or discharge the Existing Parent Notes pursuant to the indenture governing the Existing Parent Notes. In addition, Parent shall arrange for the repayment in full, and termination of, the existing Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of August 19, 2004, as amended, among Parent, the lenders party thereto, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as administrative agent, on or before the Closing Date, and, in connection therewith, obtain a release of all the guarantees thereof and collateral therefor. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 7.11 _Actions with Respect to Existing Debt_. 

  

 (a) As soon as reasonably practical after receipt of a written request from Parent to do so, the Company shall commence a tender offer and Consent Solicitation (the " _Debt Offer_ ") for all of the outstanding 7% Senior Notes due 2012 and 7% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013 of the Company (the " _Notes_ ") upon the terms and conditions set forth in Schedule 7.11 of the Company Disclosure Letter, and otherwise in compliance with applicable Law and SEC rules and regulations, and Parent and Merger Sub shall assist the Company in connection therewith. 

  

 (b) Promptly after the date of this Agreement, Parent shall prepare all necessary and appropriate documentation in connection with the Debt Offer, including the offer to purchase, any related letters of transmittal and other related documents (collectively, the " _Offer Documents_ ") and such documents shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company. Parent and the Company shall cooperate with each other in the preparation of the Offer Documents. All mailings to the holders of the Notes in connection with the Debt Offer shall be subject to the prior review and comment by each of the Company and Parent, subject to the terms and conditions of Schedule 7.11 of the Company Disclosure Letter, and shall be reasonably acceptable to each of them. The closing of the Debt Offer shall be conditioned on the conditions set forth in _Section 7.11(f)_;  _provided_ , that the consummation of the Debt Offer will not be a condition to the Closing. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate in connection with the Debt Offer in order to cause the consent date under the Consent Solicitation to occur as directed by Parent prior to or concurrently with the Closing and the initial settlement of the Debt Offer to occur concurrently with the Closing. The Company shall waive any of the conditions to the Debt Offer (other than that the Merger shall have occurred or that the Parent and Company shall be satisfied that it shall occur substantially concurrently with the closing of the Debt Offer, the Requested Consents shall have been received, and that there shall be no order or injunction prohibiting consummation of the Debt Offer) as may be reasonably requested by Parent and so long as such waivers would not cause the Debt Offer to violate the Exchange Act, the Trust Indenture Act, or any other Law and shall not, without the consent of Parent, waive any condition to the Debt Offer or make any changes to the terms and conditions of the Debt Offer other than as agreed between Parent and the Company. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, the Company need not make any change to the terms and conditions of the Debt Offer requested by Parent that decreases the price per Note payable in the Debt Offer or imposes conditions to the Debt Offer in addition to those set forth in Schedule 7.11 of the Company Disclosure Letter that are materially adverse to holders of the Notes, unless such change is approved in advance by the Company in writing. If, at any time prior to the completion of the Debt Offer, any information in the Offer Documents should be discovered by the Company or Parent that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Offer Documents, so that the Offer Documents shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party, and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be disseminated by the Company to the holders of the Notes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 7.11(b)_, the Company shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-l under the Exchange Act and any other applicable Law to the extent such Laws are applicable in connection with the Debt Offer. 

   ##### 

  

 

To the extent that the provisions of any applicable Law conflict with this
_Section 7.11(b)_ , the Company shall comply with the applicable Law and
shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations hereunder by such
compliance. 

   

 (c) Promptly upon the receipt of the Requested Consents with respect to the Indentures for the Notes, the Company shall enter into a supplemental indenture reflecting the amendments to such Indentures approved by such Requested Consents and will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Indentures trustee to promptly enter into such supplemental indenture; _provided_ , that the amendments contained in such supplemental indenture shall become operative upon the acceptance of the Debt Offer and payment for the Notes tendered pursuant thereto. Concurrently with the Closing and in accordance with the terms of the Debt Offer, Parent shall provide to the Company the funds necessary to consummate the Debt Offer and Consent Solicitation (including the payment of all applicable premiums, consent fees and all related fees and expenses) and the Company shall accept for purchase and use such funds to purchase the Notes tendered in the Debt Offer. 

  

 (d) If requested by Parent, the Company shall enter into one or more dealer-manager, information agent and/or depositary agreements with such Persons as Parent shall reasonably request in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company. Parent shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of any dealer-manager, information agent, depositary or other agent retained in connection with the Debt Offer. 

  

 (e) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Consent Solicitation_ " shall mean a solicitation of the Requested Consents from the holders of the Notes; and " _Requested Consents_ " shall mean the consents of holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes to the amendments to the indenture in respect of the Notes described in Schedule 7.11 of the Company Disclosure Letter. 

  

 (f) The Companys and the Surviving Corporations obligation to accept for payment and pay for the Notes tendered pursuant to the Debt Offer or make any payment for the Requested Consents shall be subject to conditions (as mutually agreed by Parent and the Company), including that, (i) the Merger shall have occurred (or Parent and the Company shall be satisfied that it will occur substantially concurrently with such acceptance and payment), (ii) the Debt Financing has been obtained, (iii) the Requested Consents shall have been received, (iv) there shall be no order or injunction prohibiting consummation of the Debt Offer and (v) such other conditions as are customary for transactions similar to the Debt Offer. 

  

 (g) If this Agreement is terminated (other than pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)(ii)_ or  _Section 9.1(d)_) prior to the consummation of the Merger, Parent shall promptly reimburse the Company and any dealer-manager under any dealer-manager agreement for any out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses incurred by the Company in connection with this _Section 7.11_. If the Effective Time does not occur, Parent and Merger Sub shall, on a joint and several basis, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective officers and directors, any dealer-manager and each Person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 20 of the Exchange Act, for and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection with the Debt Offer, Offer Documents or any other actions taken by them 

   ##### 

  

 

in accordance with this _Section 7.11_; _provided_ , _however_ , that
neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall have any obligation to indemnify and hold
harmless any such Person to the extent that any such liabilities, losses,
damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties
suffered or incurred arises from disclosure provided by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (including disclosures incorporated by reference in the Offer
Documents) that is finally judicially determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction to have contained a material misstatement or omission. 

   

 (h) If requested by Parent in writing, in lieu of commencing or closing a Debt Offer for any series of Notes (or in addition thereto), the Company shall, to the extent permitted by the Indentures, take any actions reasonably requested by Parent to facilitate the redemption, satisfaction and/or discharge of such series of Notes pursuant to the Indenture at the Effective Time; _provided_ , that prior to the Company being required to issue any irrevocable notice of redemption with respect to any such series of Notes, which redemption cannot be conditioned upon the occurrence of the Closing, Parent shall have, or shall have caused to be, deposited with the trustee under the Indentures sufficient funds to effect such redemption, satisfaction and discharge. 

  

 (i) The Company shall take such actions as may be necessary or advisable to cause the Company ESOP Debt to be satisfied in full from the proceeds due to the Company ESOP pursuant to _Section 3.2_ from a disposition by the Company ESOP of the Company ESOP Shares pursuant to the Merger. 

  

 Section 7.12 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Promptly following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will cause the Shares to be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange and deregistered under the Exchange Act. 

  

 Section 7.13 _Insurance Matters_. To the extent requested by Parent, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to purchase by the Effective Time tail policies to the current fiduciary liability and excess hospital professional liability polices maintained on the date hereof by the Company and its Subsidiaries, which tail policies shall be effective for a period from the Effective Time through a reasonable period specified by Parent and shall contain the coverage and amount reasonably requested by Parent; _provided_ , that if this Agreement is terminated (other than pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)(ii)_ or _Section 9.1(d)_) prior to the consummation of the Merger, Parent shall promptly reimburse the Company for any out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses incurred by the Company in connection with this _Section 7.13_. 

  

 Section 7.14 _Section 16(b)_. The Company shall take all steps reasonably necessary to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any other dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including derivative securities) in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is a director or executive officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. 

  

 Section 7.15 _Resignation of Directors_. At the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Parent evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent of the resignation of all directors of the Company. Upon the request of Parent, as specified by Parent reasonably in advance of the 

   ##### 

  

 

Closing, the Company will seek to obtain the resignation of all directors of
the Companys Subsidiaries, in each case, effective at the Effective Time. 

   

 Section 7.16 _Shareholder Litigation_. The Company shall promptly notify Parent of any such shareholder litigation brought, or threatened, against the Company and/or its directors and keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof. 

  

 Section 7.17 _Conveyance Taxes_. The Company, its Subsidiaries and Parent will (a) cooperate in the preparation, execution and filing of all Tax Returns, questionnaires, applications or other documents regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer and stamp Taxes, any transfer, recording, registration and other fees and any similar Taxes which become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) cooperate in the preparation, execution and filing of all applications or other documents regarding any applicable exemptions to any such Tax or fee and (c) each pay any such Tax or fee which becomes payable by it on or before the due date therefor. 

  

 Section 7.18 _Prior Merger Agreement Termination and Termination Fee_. 

  

 (a) Prior to the execution of this Agreement, the Company has made a payment to Panthera Holdco Corp. and Panthera Partners, LLC (together, " _Panthera Parent_ ") of the "Go-Shop Termination Fee" (as such term is defined in the Prior Merger Agreement, the " _Panthera Termination Fee_ ") payable by the Company in connection with the termination of the Prior Merger Agreement (the amount of such payment, the " _Initial Panthera Termination Fee_ "). Prior to the execution of this Agreement, Parent has delivered irrevocable wire transfer instructions which provide for the reimbursement of the Initial Panthera Termination Fee by Parent to the Company, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, on the date of this Agreement. In the event the Company makes any additional payments of the Panthera Termination Fee or any portion thereof to Panthera Parent, Parent shall reimburse the Company, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, for any such amount paid by the Company not later than the next Business Day following receipt of written notice of the Companys payment of such amount, which written notice shall be accompanied by a copy of the invoice from Panthera for such amount as well as reasonable documentation for the out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by Panthera Parent and its Affiliates that comprise such amount, provided that the sum of (x) the aggregate amount of reimbursements payable by Parent to the Company pursuant to this sentence and (y) the Initial Panthera Termination Fee, shall in no event exceed $40,000,000. In the event that Parent shall fail to reimburse the Company for the amount of the Panthera Termination Fee or any portion thereof in accordance with this _Section 7.18_ by the conclusion of the third Business Day following the Companys written notice of the payment of such fee or portion thereof, the Company shall have the right to terminate this Agreement, effective immediately upon delivery of notice of termination to Parent, provided that Parents obligation to reimburse the Company for the amount of the Panthera Termination Fee in accordance with this _Section 7.18_ shall survive such termination. 

  

 (b) If this Agreement is terminated (i) under circumstances where the Termination Fee is payable to Parent pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)_ or _Section 9.2(b)_ or (ii) under circumstances where Parent Expenses are payable by the Company to Parent pursuant to _Section 9.2(c)_ , then the Company shall repay to Parent the amount Parent reimbursed to the Company 

   ##### 

  

 

pursuant to _Section 7.18(a)_, as set forth in _Section 9.2(a)_,
_Section 9.2(b)_ or _Section 9.2(c)_, as the case may be. 

   

 (c) Provided that Parent has previously paid or reimbursed the Company for the Panthera Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 7.18(a)_, if a court of competent jurisdiction determines by order that has become final and non-appealable that either (1) the entry by the Company into the Prior Merger Agreement providing for the Panthera Termination Fee or (2) the payment of the Panthera Termination Fee was a breach of duty by the Companys directors or was otherwise void or invalid under applicable Law, then the Company shall assign to Parent the right to enforce such order against Panthera, and Parent shall have the right to retain any and all proceeds resulting from the enforcement of such order with respect to the Panthera Termination Fee;  _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent that Parent, following such assignment, is not entitled to all of the rights of the Company prior to such assignment, then the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to enforce such order against Panthera at the direction and for the benefit of Parent, with Parent to reimburse the Company for its reasonable fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith, and Parent shall have the right to any and all proceeds from the enforcement of such order.

 (d) [Intentionally Omitted.] 

  

 (e) Any amount that becomes payable pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)_, _Section 9.2(b)_ or _Section 9.2(c)_ shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the party entitled to receive such payment. 

  

 (f) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section 9.2_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, that without these agreements the Company, Parent and Merger Sub would not have entered into this Agreement, and that any amounts payable pursuant to this _Section 9.2_ do not constitute a penalty. If the Company fails to pay as directed in writing by Parent any amounts due to Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this _Section 9.2_ or within the time periods specified in this  _Section 9.2_, the Company shall pay the costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees

No provision of this Agreement is intended to or shall confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder or with respect hereto, except as otherwise expressly provided in _Section 7.5_. 

  

 Section 10.9 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by virtue of any applicable Law, or due to any public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party.

 Section 10.11 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof (and, more specifically, that irreparable damage would likewise occur if the Merger were not consummated and the Companys stockholders did not receive the aggregate Merger Consideration payable to them in accordance with the terms but subject to the conditions of this Agreement), and, accordingly, that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof (including the parties obligation to consummate the Merger and Parent and Merger Subs obligation to pay, and the Companys stockholders right to receive, the aggregate Merger Consideration payable to them pursuant to the Merger, subject in each case to the terms and conditions of this Agreement), in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

 (a) In any Proceeding between any of the parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of the parties hereto: (i) irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, in the case of any claim as to which the federal courts have exclusive subject matter jurisdiction, the Federal court of the United States of America, sitting in Delaware); (ii) agrees that all claims in respect of such Proceeding must be commenced, and may be heard and determined, exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if applicable, such Federal court); (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such Proceeding in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (and, if applicable, such Federal court); and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such Proceeding in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if applicable, such Federal court). Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such Proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in  _Section 10.1_. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law. 

  

 (b) EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF 

   ##### 

  

 

LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS
AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES
THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS _SECTION 10.12_. 

   

 Section 10.13 _Authorship_. The parties agree that the terms and language of this Agreement were the result of negotiations between the parties and their respective advisors and, as a result, there shall be no presumption that any ambiguities in this Agreement shall be resolved against any party. Any controversy over construction of this Agreement shall be decided without regard to events of authorship or negotiation.
