Commitments, in the form so delivered, is in full force and effect as of the date of this Agreement

delay or hinder the Closing and (c)&nbsp;does not reduce the aggregate amount of available Financing.
As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent under any term or
condition of the Debt Financing Commitments. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has no
reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of
closing to be satisfied by it contained in the Debt Financing Commitments. Parent has fully paid to

the Company shall commence a tender offer and Consent Solicitation (the &#147;<U>Debt Offer</U>&#148;) for
all of the outstanding 7% Senior Notes due 2012 and 7% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013 of the
Company (the &#147;<U>Notes</U>&#148;) upon the terms and conditions set forth in Schedule&nbsp;7.11 of the
Company Disclosure Letter, and otherwise in compliance with applicable Law and SEC rules and
regulations, and Parent and Merger Sub shall assist the Company in connection therewith.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Promptly after the date of this Agreement, Parent shall prepare all necessary and
appropriate documentation in connection with the Debt Offer, including the offer to purchase, any
related letters of transmittal and other related documents (collectively, the &#147;<U>Offer
Documents</U>&#148;) and such documents shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company. Parent and the
Company shall cooperate with each other in the preparation of the Offer Documents. All mailings to
the holders of the Notes in connection with the Debt Offer shall be subject to the prior review and
comment by each of the Company and Parent, subject to the terms and conditions of Schedule&nbsp;7.11 of
the Company Disclosure Letter, and shall be reasonably acceptable to each of them. The closing of
the Debt Offer shall be conditioned on the conditions set forth in <U>Section&nbsp;7.11(f)</U>;
<U>provided</U>, that the consummation of the Debt Offer will not be a condition to the Closing.
The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate in connection with the Debt Offer in order to
cause the consent date under the Consent Solicitation to occur as directed by Parent prior to or
concurrently with the Closing and the initial settlement of the Debt Offer to occur concurrently
with the Closing. The Company shall waive any of the conditions to the Debt Offer (other than that
the Merger shall have occurred or that the Parent and Company shall be satisfied that it shall
occur substantially concurrently with the closing of the Debt Offer, the Requested Consents shall
have been received, and that there shall be no order or injunction prohibiting consummation of the
Debt Offer) as may be reasonably requested by Parent and so long as such waivers would not cause
the Debt Offer to violate the Exchange Act, the Trust Indenture Act, or any other Law and shall
not, without the consent of Parent, waive any condition to the Debt Offer or make any changes to
the terms and conditions of the Debt Offer other than as agreed between Parent and the Company.
Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, the Company need not make any change to the
terms and conditions of the Debt Offer requested by Parent that decreases the price per Note
payable in the Debt Offer or imposes conditions to the Debt Offer in addition to those set forth in
Schedule&nbsp;7.11 of the Company Disclosure Letter that are materially adverse to holders of the Notes,
unless such change is approved in advance by the Company in writing. If, at any time prior to the
completion of the Debt Offer, any information in the Offer Documents should be discovered by the
Company or Parent that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Offer Documents, so
that the Offer Documents shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party, and an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information shall be disseminated by the Company to the holders of the
Notes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this <U>Section&nbsp;7.11(b)</U>, the Company shall
comply with the requirements of Rule&nbsp;14e-l under the Exchange Act and any other applicable Law to
the extent such Laws are applicable in connection with the Debt Offer.

or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of the parties hereto: (i)
irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive
jurisdiction and venue of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, in the case of any
claim as to which the federal courts have exclusive subject matter jurisdiction, the Federal court
of the United States of America, sitting in Delaware); (ii)&nbsp;agrees that all claims in respect of
such Proceeding must be commenced, and may be heard and determined, exclusively in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if applicable, such Federal court); (iii)&nbsp;waives, to the
fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter
have to the laying of venue of any such Proceeding in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware (and, if applicable, such Federal court); and (iv)&nbsp;waives, to the fullest extent permitted
by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such Proceeding in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if applicable, such Federal court). Each of the parties
hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such Proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced
in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Each party
to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in
<U>Section&nbsp;10.1</U>. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the right of any party to this
Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.
