 THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (the "Agreement") is made and entered into as of October 21, 2007 by and among Nuance Communications, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), Vanhalen Acquisition Corporation, a New Jersey corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Sub I"), Vanhalen LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Sub II," and with Sub I, the "Subs"), Viecore, Inc., a New Jersey corporation (the "Company"), U.S. Bank National Association, to act as escrow agent hereunder, and as a party to this Agreement solely with respect to Article VII herein (the "Escrow Agent") and Thoma Cressey Bravo, Inc. ("TCB"), who will serve as the representative of the Companys Shareholders (as defined in Section 1.6 hereof), and is referred to herein from time to time as the "Shareholder Representative." 

  

RECITALS 

   

 A. The Boards of Directors of each of Parent, Sub I and the Company believe it is in the best interests of each company and its respective stockholders/shareholders that Parent acquire the Company through the statutory merger of Sub I with and into the Company (the "First Step Merger") and, in furtherance thereof, have approved the First Step Merger. 

  

 B. Following the First Step Merger, Parent shall cause the Company to merge with and into Sub II (the "Second Step Merger" and, taken together with the First Step Merger, the "Integrated Merger" or the "Merger"). The Integrated Merger is intended to constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). Parent and the Company intend that the First Step Merger and the Second Step Merger will constitute integrated steps in a single "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treas. Reg. §§1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3, which plan of reorganization the parties adopt by executing this Agreement. 

  

 C. Pursuant to the First Step Merger, among other things, and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Company shall be converted into the right to receive the consideration set forth herein. 

  

 D. A portion of the consideration payable in connection with the First Step Merger shall be placed in escrow as security for the indemnification obligations set forth in this Agreement. 

  

 E. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and the Subs, on the other hand, desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements in connection with the Integrated Merger. 

  

 F. Concurrent with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a material inducement to Parent and the Subs to enter into this Agreement, (i) the Major Shareholders of the Company (as defined in Schedule A) are entering into Voting Agreements, in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Voting Agreements"), with Parent, pursuant to which such shareholders have irrevocably agreed to vote in favor of the Integrated Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby and to other matters set forth therein, and (ii) the Chief Executive Officer of 

   ##### 

  

    

the Company has entered into an offer letter and an Employee Proprietary
Information, Inventions and Non-Competition Agreement, each in substantially
the form attached hereto as Exhibit B-1, with Parent or the Final Surviving
Entity, as determined by Parent. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements, covenants and other promises set forth herein, the mutual benefits to be gained by the performance thereof, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged and accepted, the parties hereby agree as follows:

 (f) _No Fractional Shares_ _._ No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will be issued pursuant to the Merger, but in lieu thereof, each Shareholder who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be received by such Shareholder) shall receive from Parent an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent) equal to the product of (i) such fraction, multiplied by (ii) the Signing Price. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 1.7 to the contrary, in no event shall Parent be obligated to distribute in the aggregate shares of Parent Common Stock in excess of the Equity Consideration or, subject to Section 1.7(c) of this Agreement, cash in excess of the Cash Consideration. 

   

 (g) _Withholding Taxes_. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, Parent, the Company, the Subs, the Escrow Agent, and the Exchange and Paying Agent (as defined in Section 1.9(a) hereof) shall have the right to deduct and withhold Taxes (as defined in Section 2.10(a) hereof) from any payments to be made hereunder if such withholding is required by law and to request any necessary Tax forms, including Form W-9 or the appropriate series of Form W-8, as applicable, or any similar information, from the Shareholders and any other recipients of payments hereunder. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been delivered and paid to the Shareholder or other recipient of payments in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. 

   

 (h) _Capital Stock of Subs_. Each share of Common Stock of Sub I issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of Common Stock of the Interim Surviving 

    ##### 

  

    

Corporation. Each stock certificate of Sub I evidencing ownership of any such
shares shall continue to evidence ownership of such shares of capital stock
of the Interim Surviving Corporation. Each share of Common Stock of the
Interim Surviving Corporation issued and outstanding immediately after the
Effective Time shall be converted into and exchanged for the applicable
corresponding interest of the Final Surviving Entity. Each stock certificate
of the Interim Surviving Corporation evidencing ownership of any such shares
shall continue to evidence the applicable corresponding interest in the Final
Surviving Entity. 

   

 1.8 _Dissenting Shares._ (a) No holder of Company Capital Stock or Company Options shall be entitled to any dissenters, appraisal or similar rights under New Jersey Law or otherwise in connection with the merger. 

  

 1.9 _Surrender of Certificates_.  

  

 (a) _Exchange and Paying Agent_. Parent, or an institution selected by Parent, shall serve as the exchange and paying agent (Parent in such capacity, or such institution, the "Exchange and Paying Agent") for the Merger. 

   

 (b) _Parent to Provide Cash and Parent Common Stock_. Subject to the provisions of Section 7.3 hereof relating to escrow arrangements, as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time but in no event later than the earlier to occur of six (6) days after the Effective Time and the Registration Date, Parent shall make available to the Exchange and Paying Agent for exchange in accordance with this Article I the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable and the cash payable at the Effective Time pursuant to Section 1.7 hereof in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock; _provided, however,_ Parent shall deposit into the Escrow Fund (as defined in Section 7.3(a) hereof), out of the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock otherwise deliverable to the Principal Shareholders pursuant to Section 1.7 hereof, each Principal Shareholders Pro Rata Portion, contributed with respect to each Principal Shareholder in accordance with Section 1.7(b) hereof, and shall retain and hold in trust on behalf of each Accredited Shareholder, the Equity Holdback in accordance with Section 1.7(c)(ii) hereof and the Cash Holdback in accordance with Section 1.7(c)(iii) hereof. 

   

 (c) _Exchange Procedures_. 

   

 (i) Not less than ten (10) days prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall or shall cause the Exchange and Paying Agent to make available a form of letter of transmittal reasonably acceptable to the Company and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Company Stock Certificates (as defined below). Within two (2) days of receipt of the letter of transmittal, the Company shall mail the letter of transmittal to each Shareholder at the address set forth opposite each such Shareholders name on Section 2.2(a) of the Disclosure Schedule. After receipt of such letter of transmittal, the Shareholders, on or after the Closing, will surrender the certificates representing their shares of Company Capital Stock (the "Company Stock Certificates") to the Exchange and Paying Agent for cancellation together with a duly completed and validly executed letter of transmittal. Upon surrender of a Company Stock Certificate for 

   ##### 

  

    

cancellation to the Exchange and Paying Agent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, subject to the terms of Section 1.9(e) hereof, the
holder of such Company Stock Certificate shall be entitled to receive from
the Exchange and Paying Agent in exchange therefor, the cash amounts and
Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.7
hereof (less the Parent Common Stock to be deposited into the Escrow Fund
with respect to the Principal Shareholders and the Equity Holdback and Cash
Holdback to be held with respect to each Accredited Shareholder), and the
Company Stock Certificate so surrendered shall be cancelled. Until so
surrendered, each Company Stock Certificate outstanding after the Effective
Time will be deemed, for all corporate purposes thereafter, to evidence only
the right to receive the cash amounts payable and Parent Common
Stock issuable in exchange for shares of Company Capital Stock (without
interest) into which such shares of Company Capital Stock shall have been so
converted. No portion of the Merger Consideration will be paid to the holder
of any unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate with respect to shares
of Company Capital Stock formerly represented thereby until the holder of
record of such Company Stock Certificate shall surrender such Company Stock
Certificate pursuant hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) each
Shareholder that delivers its duly executed letter of transmittal and
such other documents as may reasonably be requested to the Exchange and
Paying Agent at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date shall
be paid all cash amounts owed to such Shareholder pursuant to Section 1.7 on
the Closing Date; and (ii) each Shareholder that delivers its duly executed
letter of transmittal and such other documents as may reasonable be requested
to the Exchange and Paying Agent after the Closing shall be paid all cash
amounts owed to such Shareholder pursuant to Section 1.7 as promptly as
practicable after such delivery. 

  

 (ii) Any holder of Class A Preferred Stock who is deemed to have received Additional Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.7(e) hereof shall be deemed to have submitted Company Stock Certificates representing the Additional Common Stock for the purposes of Section 1.9(c)(i) hereof, when such holder of Class A Preferred Stock properly submits such holders Company Stock Certificates representing their shares of Class A Preferred Stock. 

  

 (d) _Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby until the holder of record of such Company Stock Certificate shall surrender such Company Stock Certificate. Subject to applicable law, following surrender of any such Company Stock Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of the certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock. No interest shall be payable on any cash deliverable upon the exchange of any Company Capital Stock. 

   

 (e) _Transfers of Ownership_. If any certificate for shares of Parent Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Company Stock Certificate surrendered 

    ##### 

  

    

in exchange therefor is registered, or if any cash amounts are to be disbursed
pursuant to Section 1.7 hereof to any person other than the person or entity
whose name is reflected on the Company Stock Certificate surrendered in
exchange therefor, it will be a condition of the issuance or delivery thereof
that the certificate so surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise
in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such exchange will
have paid to Parent or any agent designated by it any transfer or other taxes
required by reason of the issuance of a certificate for shares of Parent
Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the
certificate surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of Parent or any
agent designated by it that such tax has been paid or is not payable. 

   

 (f) _Exchange and Paying Agent to Return Consideration_. At any time following the last day of the sixth (6th) month following the Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the Exchange and Paying Agent to deliver to Parent or its designated successor or assign all cash amounts and shares of Parent Common Stock that have been deposited with the Exchange and Paying Agent pursuant to Section 1.9(b) hereof, and any and all interest thereon or other income or proceeds thereof, not disbursed to the holders of Company Stock Certificates pursuant to Section 1.9(c) hereof, and thereafter the holders of Company Stock Certificates shall be entitled to look only to Parent (subject to the terms of Section 1.9(g) hereof) only as general creditors thereof with respect to any and all amounts that may be payable to such holders of Company Stock Certificates pursuant to Section 1.7 hereof upon the due surrender of such Company Stock Certificates in the manner set forth in Section 1.9(c) hereof. 

   

 (g) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 1.9, neither the Exchange and Paying Agent, the Final Surviving Entity, nor any party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Company Capital Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

   

 1.10 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock_. The cash amounts paid and Parent Common Stock issued in respect of the surrender for exchange of shares of Company Capital Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to be full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Capital Stock, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Final Surviving Entity of shares of Company Capital Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Company Stock Certificates are presented to the Final Surviving Entity for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article I. 

  

 1.11 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Company Stock Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange and Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such amount, if any, as may be required pursuant to Section 1.7 hereof;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the Shareholder who is the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates to either (i) deliver a bond in such amount as it may reasonably direct, or (ii) provide an indemnification agreement in a form 

   ##### 

  

    

and substance acceptable to Parent, against any claim that may be made against
Parent or the Exchange and Paying Agent with respect to the certificates
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. 

  

 1.12 _Reorganization Status_. The Integrated Merger is intended to constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Parent and the Company intend that the First Step Merger and the Second Step Merger will constitute integrated steps in a single "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treas. Reg. §1.368-2(g) and §1.368-3, which plan of reorganization the parties adopt by executing this Agreement. None of the parties hereto will take any action that would be reasonably expected to cause the Integrated Merger to fail to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code except as specifically contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 1.13 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Final Surviving Entity with full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company, Parent, the Subs, and the officers and directors of the Company, Parent and the Subs are fully authorized in the name of their respective corporations or otherwise to take, and will take, all such lawful and necessary action.

 3.1 _Organization, Standing and Power_. Parent is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.

Each of Parent and the Subs has the corporate power to own its properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted and is duly qualified or licensed to do business and 

   ##### 

  

    

is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the failure to be so
qualified or licensed would have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 3.2 _Authority_. Each of Parent and the Subs has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and any Related Agreements to which it is a party and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and any Related Agreements to which it is a party and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Parent and the Subs. This Agreement and any Related Agreements to which Parent and the Subs are parties have been duly executed and delivered by Parent and the Subs and constitute the valid and binding obligations of Parent and the Subs, enforceable against each of Parent and the Subs in accordance with their terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by principles of public policy and subject to the laws of general application relating to bankruptcy, insolvency and the relief of debtors and rules of law governing specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable remedies. 

  

 3.3 _Consents_. No consent, waiver, approval, order or authorization of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any Governmental Entity, is required by or with respect to Parent or the Subs in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and any Related Agreements to which Parent or the Subs is a party or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, except for (i) such consents, waivers, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings as may be required under applicable securities Laws, (ii) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Department of Treasury, Division of Revenue of the State of New Jersey, and (iii) compliance with the pre-merger notification requirements of the HSR Act, and under the comparable non-U.S. competition Laws the parties reasonably determine apply.

The execution and delivery by Parent and each Sub of this Agreement and any Related Agreement to which Parent or a Sub is a party, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, will not conflict with or result in any violation of or default (with or without notice of lapse of time, or both) under (i) the certificate of incorporation, certificate of formation, bylaws, limited liability company agreement or similar organizational documents of Parent or a Sub, each as amended to date and in full force and effect on the date hereof, or (ii) assuming compliance with the matters referred to in Section 3.3 hereof, any Laws applicable to Parent or either Sub or any of their respective properties (whether tangible or intangible) or assets, except in the case of clause (ii) for such violations or defaults as have not had or are not reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 3.6 _Parent Common Stock_. The Parent Common Stock which constitutes the Equity Consideration has been duly authorized, and upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company in Article II hereof and the Shareholders in the 

   ##### 

  

    

accredited investor questionnaires provided to Parent, the Parent Common Stock
that constitutes the Equity Consideration will be issued without violation of
the Securities Act or applicable state securities laws. There are no
statutory or contractual stockholders preemptive rights with respect to the
issuance of the Parent Common Stock which constitutes the Equity
Consideration.

None of Parents Subsidiaries is required to file any forms, reports or other documents with the SEC. 

  

 3.8 _Parent Financial Statements_. The financial statements of Parent included in the Parent SEC Reports comply as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods indicated (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present the consolidated financial position of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited statements to normal year-end adjustments). 

  

 3.9 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Parent has no material Liabilities other than (i) those set forth or adequately provided for in the balance sheet included in Parents most recently filed Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (including the notes thereto, the "Parent Balance Sheet"), (ii) those incurred in the ordinary course of business, consistent with past practice, and not required by GAAP to be set forth in the Parent Balance Sheet, (iii) those that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, or (iv) those incurred in the ordinary course of business since the date of the Parent Balance Sheet, consistent with past practice. 

  

 3.10 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Except as disclosed in the Parent SEC Reports, since the date of the most recent unaudited financial statements included in the Parent SEC 

    ##### 

 

  

Reports and through the date of this Agreement, there has not been (i) any
Parent Material Adverse Effect, (ii) any declaration, setting aside or
payment of any dividend or other distribution (whether in cash, stock or
property) with respect to any of Parents capital stock, (iii) any amendment
of any provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of, or of
any material term of any outstanding security issued by, Parent, (iv) any
material change in any method of accounting or accounting practice by Parent
except for any such change required by a change in GAAP, or (v) any split,
combination or reclassification of any of its capital stock or any
issuance or the authorization of any issuance of any other securities in
respect of, in lieu of, or in substitution for shares of its capital stock. 

   

 3.11 _Interim Operations of Subs_.  

  

 (a) The Subs were formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and have engaged in no business activities other than as contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 (b) All of the issued and outstanding capital stock of each Sub is validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and is owned, beneficially and of record, by Parent free and clear of all security interests, liens, claims, pledges, options, rights of first refusal, stockholder agreements, limitations on Parents voting rights, charges and other encumbrances of any nature whatsoever. 

  

 (c) As of the date hereof and as of the Effective Time, except for (i) obligations or liabilities incurred in connection with its incorporation or organization and (ii) this Agreement and any other agreements or arrangements contemplated by this Agreement or in furtherance of the transactions contemplated hereby, neither Sub has incurred, directly or indirectly, through any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, any obligations or liabilities or engaged in any business activities of any type or kind whatsoever or entered into any agreements or arrangements with any person. 

  

 3.12 _Litigation_. Except as disclosed in the Parent SEC Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement, there is no action, suit, claim or proceeding of any nature pending, or to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened, against Parent, any of its Subsidiaries, their respective properties (tangible or intangible) or any of their respective officers or directors, that could result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect, and there is no investigation or similar proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened, against Parent by or before the SEC or Nasdaq. No Governmental Entity has at any time challenged the legal right of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to conduct its operations as presently or previously conducted. 

  

 3.13 _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied in writing by Parent for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the Shareholder Registration Statement will, at the time the Shareholder Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto becomes effective, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances under which they were made, (ii) the information provided to Shareholders in the Notice Materials will, at the time they are mailed to the Shareholders and at all times that stockholder consents are

To Parents knowledge, no reason exists on the date hereof and no circumstances exist on the date hereof that with the passage of time is reasonably likely to prevent the Shareholder Registration Statement from becoming effective automatically upon filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 9.1, with the exception of the need to file Form 8-K with the Required Financials as provided in Section 5.15.

In the event that that Recipient or any of its Representatives are requested pursuant to, or required by, order, applicable law or regulation to disclose any of the Confidential Information, Recipient may disclose such confidential information, provided that the disclosing party is first provided with prompt written notice reasonably in advance (to the extent possible) of the disclosure of such confidential information by recipient so that the disclosing party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this Section 5.3. 

  

 5.4 _Expenses_. Whether or not the Merger is consummated, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger including, without limitation, all legal, accounting, financial advisory, consulting, and all other fees and expenses of third parties (including any costs incurred to obtain consents, waivers or approvals as a result of the compliance with Section 5.6 hereof and in connection with the compliance with Section 5.20 hereof) incurred by a party in connection with the negotiation and effectuation of the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby ("Third Party Expenses"), shall be the obligation of the respective party incurring such fees and expenses provided, however, that the costs and expenses (i) to complete the Year End Financials, (ii) for review of any Interim Financials, (iii) to comply with SAS 100 and Regulation S-X, and (iv) to accommodate Parents Exchange Act requirements, in each case shall not be Third Party Expenses, and further provided that any costs relating to the termination of the Companys 401(k) plan, as required by Parent shall not be Third Party Expenses. To the extent limited by the next sentence, Third Party Expenses shall also include the amount of federal, state, and local employment taxes (the "Employment Taxes") paid by the Company, Parent, Interim Surviving Entity, or Final Surviving Entity (collectively the "Group") (and for avoidance of doubt, not the portion of such taxes withheld from the employees) relating to the Bonus Payment paid to the Companys employees. If the Closing occurs before January 1, 2008, (x) all Employment Taxes in 

   ##### 

  

    

excess of $100,000 shall be Third Party Expenses, and (y) if the Closing
occurs on or after January 1, 2008, all Employment Taxes in excess of
$100,000 shall be Third Party Expenses,  _provided, however_ , that for
purposes of this clause (y), FICA Taxes shall be included as Employment Taxes
only to the extent as follows: (1) if the respective employees anticipated
aggregate taxable wages for 2007 (assuming the employees current salary is
continued throughout the remainder of 2007, and assuming the bonuses set
forth on Schedule 4.1(h) are paid before December 31, 2007) (the "2007
Wages") exceed the maximum taxable income on which FICA Tax will be
assessed in 2008 (the "FICA Cap"), no FICA Tax attributable to the portion of
the Bonus Payment to be paid to such employee will be considered Employment
Taxes, and (2) if the respective employees anticipated 2007 Wages are less
than the FICA Cap, the FICA Tax attributable to the portion of the Bonus
Payment to be paid to such employee that when added to the 2007 Wages are no
greater than the FICA Cap will be considered Employment Taxes.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, any expenses for
any accounting studies relating to the accounting policies of the Company
(including, without limitation, studies relating to revenue recognition) shall
be the responsibility of Parent and the expenses, if any, of implementing the
recommendation in such accounting studies and shall not be Third Party
Expenses. The Company shall provide Parent with a statement of estimated
Third Party Expenses incurred by the Company at least three (3) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date in form reasonably satisfactory to Parent which
statement shall be accompanied by invoices from the Companys legal,
financial, auditing and other advisors providing services in connection with
the negotiation and effectuation of the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby reflecting such
advisors final billable Third Party Expenses (the "Statement of Expenses").
Any Third Party Expenses unpaid at or prior to Closing shall be paid by the
Final Surviving Entity; _provided_ , _however_ , any Third Party Expenses
incurred by the Company in excess of the aggregate estimated Third Party
Expenses as set forth on the Statement of Expenses ("Excess Third Party
Expenses"), shall be subject to the indemnification provision of Section 7.2
hereof and shall not be limited by or count towards the Threshold Amount (as
defined in Section 7.4(a) hereof) or maximum amount of
indemnification provided in Section 7.6(a) hereof. 

  

 5.5 _Public Disclosure_. No party shall issue any statement or communication to any third party (other than their respective agents that are bound by confidentiality restrictions) regarding the subject matter of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including, if applicable, the termination of this Agreement and the reasons therefor, without the consent of the other party, except that this restriction shall be subject to Parents obligation to comply with applicable securities laws and the rules of the Nasdaq Global Market. Notwithstanding the foregoing, on the date of this Agreement and on the Closing Date (a) the parties hereto shall release a mutually agreed upon joint press release, and (b) nothing in this Section 5.5 shall prohibit any Shareholder that is a private equity fund from disclosing the terms of the Merger and this Agreement to any current investor in such Shareholder or its Affiliate that would be required to keep such information confidential, in the ordinary course of such Shareholders or its Affiliates business. 

  

 5.6 _Consents_. The Company shall obtain all necessary consents, waivers and approvals listed in Section 5.6 of the Disclosure Schedule of any parties to any Contract required thereunder in connection with the Merger (including the Second Step Merger) or for any such Contracts to remain 

   ##### 

  

    

in full force and effect, as agreed upon by Parent and the Company, all of
which are listed in Section 5.6 of the Disclosure Schedule, so as to preserve
all rights of, and benefits to, the Company under such Contract from and
after the Effective Time. Such consents, waivers and approvals shall be in a
form reasonably acceptable to Parent. In the event that the other parties to
any such Contract, conditions its grant of a consent, waiver or approval
(including by threatening to exercise a "recapture" or other termination
right) upon the payment of a consent fee, "profit sharing" payment or other
consideration, including increased rent payments or other payments under the
Contract, the Company shall be responsible for making all payments required
to obtain such consent, waiver or approval and such amounts shall be deemed
Third Party Expenses under Section 5.4 hereof. 

  

 5.7 _FIRPTA Compliance_. On the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent a properly executed statement (a "FIRPTA Compliance Certificate") in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent for purposes of satisfying Parents obligations under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2(c)(3).

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions provided in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take promptly, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do promptly, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated hereby, to satisfy the conditions to the obligations to consummate the Merger, to obtain all necessary waivers, consents and approvals and to effect all necessary registrations and filings and to remove any injunctions or other impediments or delays, legal or otherwise, in order to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for the purpose of securing to the parties hereto the benefits contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, it is expressly understood and agreed that (i) nothing in this Section 5.8 shall limit a partys right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII hereof, so long as such party has up to then complied in all material respects with its obligations under this Section 5.8; (ii) Parent shall have no obligation to litigate or contest, any Action or any order, including any suit, objection, requirement or other action by the United States Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC"), the United States Department of Justice, any other such governmental authority, or any private party with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby; and (iii) nothing in this Agreement will require, or be deemed to require, the parties to this Agreement to agree to sell, hold separate, divest, discontinue or limit, any assets, businesses or interest in any assets or businesses of Parent or the Company. 

  

 (b) Within three (3) Business Days after the date of this Agreement, the Company and Parent each shall use reasonable best efforts to file with the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice Notification and Report Forms relating to the transactions contemplated herein as required by the HSR Act, as well as comparable pre-merger notification forms required by the merger notification or control Laws of any applicable jurisdiction, as reasonably agreed by the parties to be required. The Company and Parent each shall promptly 

   ##### 

  

    

supply the other with any information which may be required in order to
effectuate such filings. The Company and Parent each shall expressly request
early or accelerated termination of any applicable waiting period attendant
to such filings, if available. Parent shall have responsibility for any
required filing fees associated with the HSR and any other required filing. 

  

 (c) Parent and the Company, acting through outside counsel, agree to coordinate and cooperate fully and promptly with each other in promptly responding to and/or exchanging information and providing assistance as the other party may reasonably request in connection with any government inquiries related to the transaction contemplated herein. Parent and the Company will (i) promptly notify the other party of any written or oral communication to that party or its affiliates from any governmental entity relating to the matters that are the subject of this Agreement and; (ii) to the extent practicable and permitted by law, provide in advance copies to the other of any information to be submitted to any governmental entity relating to the matters that are the subject of this Agreement and permit the other party to review and comment on any information to be submitted prior to its submission; (iii) not agree to participate, or to permit its affiliates to participate, in any substantive meeting or discussion with any governmental entity in respect of any filings, investigation or inquiry concerning the review, clearance or approval of any of the transactions contemplated hereby under the HSR Act or any similar applicable foreign laws unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such governmental entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting; and (iv) furnish the other party with copies of all correspondence, filings, and communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) drafted by or in conjunction with outside counsel between it and its Affiliates and its respective representatives on the one hand, and any governmental entity or members of such governmental entitys staff on the other hand, concerning the review, clearance or approval of any of the transactions contemplated hereby under the HSR Act or any similar applicable foreign law, except to the extent prohibited by applicable law or the instructions of such governmental entity. 

  

 5.9 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of: (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event, the occurrence or non-occurrence of which is likely to cause any representation or warranty of the Company contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate at or prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) any failure of the Company to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.9 shall not (a) limit or otherwise affect any remedies available to the party receiving such notice or (b) constitute an acknowledgment or admission of a breach of this Agreement. No disclosure by the Company pursuant to this Section 5.9 shall be deemed to amend or supplement the Disclosure Schedule or prevent or cure any misrepresentations, breach of warranty or breach of covenant. 

  

 5.10 _Additional Documents and Further Assurances_. Each party hereto, at the request of another party hereto, shall execute and deliver such other instruments and do and perform such other acts and things as may be necessary or desirable for effecting completely the consummation of the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   ##### 

   

  

 5.11 _New Employment Arrangements_.  

  

 (a) Parent or the Final Surviving Entity will offer pursuant to an offer letter substantially all of the Employees who are Employees at the Effective Time, "at-will" employment by Parent and/or the Final Surviving Entity, to be effective as of the Closing Date, upon proof of a legal right to work in the United States (each, an "Offer Letter"). Such "at-will" employment will: (i) be subject to and in compliance with Parents applicable policies and procedures, including, severance policies, employment background checks and the execution of an employee proprietary information agreement, governing employment conduct and performance, (ii) have terms, including the position, salary, and equity incentives (in the form of Parent Restricted Stock Units), which will be determined by Parent after consultation with the Companys management, and (iii) include agreements providing for non-competition with the business of the Company, Parent and the Final Surviving Entity, non-solicitation of the customers and employees of the Company, Parent and the Final Surviving Entity following the termination of such employee, arbitration, and release of claims, as provided in the applicable Exhibits B-1, B-2 and B-3 hereto. Each employee of the Company who remains an employee of Parent or the Final Surviving Entity after the Closing Date shall be referred to hereafter as a "Continuing Employee." Continuing Employees shall execute an Offer Letter and an Employee Proprietary Information, Inventions and Non-Competition Agreement (the "Employee Proprietary Information, Inventions and Non-Competition Agreements"). Continuing Employees shall be eligible to receive benefits consistent with Parents applicable human resources policies and shall receive compensation and benefits substantially comparable to those of similarly situated employees of Parent. Each such Continuing Employee will receive credit for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting under Parents employee benefit plans (other than any Parent equity-based awards) for years of service with the Company (or any of its Subsidiaries) prior to the Effective Time. Parent will cause to be waived any and all pre-existing condition limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability requirements under any group health plans of Parent in which such Continuing Employee and their eligible dependents will participate, unless such conditions would not have been waived under the comparable plans of the Company in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to Closing Date and will, upon receipt of proof from the employee, provide credit for any coinsurance and deductibles prior to the Effective Time but in the plan year which includes the Effective Time for purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible, out-of-pocket or similar requirements under any such plans that may apply for such plan year after the Effective Time.  

  

 (b) The aggregate value of the Parent Restricted Stock Units in the Offer Letters of the Continuing Employees shall equal at least $12,000,000 as of the Closing Date (valuing such Parent Restricted Stock Units at the average of the closing price of the Parent Common Stock for the ten Business Days prior to the date of this Agreement). The Restricted Stock Units shall only be issued following the Effective Time, and only to Continuing Employees that have executed Offer Letters and Employee Proprietary Information, Inventions and Non-Competition Agreements. In the event that Parent terminates, without cause, Continuing Employees holding an aggregate of at least 10% of the Parent Restricted Stock Units within one (1) year of the Closing, Parent shall issue to remaining Continuing Employees an aggregate number of new Parent Restricted Stock Units 

   ##### 

  

    

equal to the aggregate amount of Parent Restricted Stock Units forfeited by
such terminated Continuing Employees. The number of Parent Restricted Stock
Units to be issued to each respective remaining Continuing Employee shall be
determined by Thomas J. Chisholm after consultation with Parent as promptly
as practicable after the one (1) year anniversary of the Closing. With
respect to any Continuing Employee that is terminated by Parent without Cause
(as defined in the applicable agreements) within one (1) year of Closing, the
Parent Restricted Stock Units held by such terminated employee shall
accelerate and vest as if such employee remained employed by Parent at the
end of such one (1) year period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Parent
Restricted Stock Units shall be issued which when taken with any other
payments to an employee, in the absence of the 280G Shareholder Approval
required by Section 5.14, would be considered a Section 280G Payment. 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding anything in Article IV hereof to the contrary, after consultation with Parent, the Company shall declare and pay the Bonus Payment immediately prior to Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Bonus Payment shall be paid which when taken with any other payments to an employee, in the absence of the 280G Shareholder Approval required by Section 5.14, would be considered a Section 280G Payment. 

  

 (d) As used in this Article V and Section 6.2 hereof, references to "employees of the Company" includes employees of the Company Subsidiaries, unless the context clearly otherwise indicates. 

  

 5.12 _Sale of Shares_. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to the Shareholders in the Merger shall constitute "restricted securities" within the meaning of Rule 144 of the Securities Act and will be issued in a private placement transaction in reliance upon the exemption from the registration and prospectus delivery requirements of Section 5 of the Securities Act afforded by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act and Regulation D promulgated thereunder. The certificates evidencing the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger shall bear appropriate legends to identify such privately placed shares as being "restricted securities" under the Securities Act, to comply with state and federal securities laws and, if applicable, to notice the restrictions on transfer of such shares. 

  

 5.13 _Termination of_ _401(k)_ _Plan_. Effective as of the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, each of the Company and any ERISA Affiliate shall terminate any and all Company Employee Plans intended to include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement (each, a "401(k) Plan") (unless Parent provides written notice to the Company that such 401(k) Plans shall not be terminated). Unless Parent provides such written notice to the Company, no later than five (5) business days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such Company Employee Plan(s) have been terminated (effective as of the day immediately preceding the Closing Date) pursuant to resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company or such Affiliate, as the case may be. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to the reasonable review and approval of Parent. The Company also shall take such other actions in furtherance of terminating such Company Employee Plan(s) as Parent may reasonably require. In the event that 

   ##### 

  

    

termination of a 401(k) Plan would reasonably be anticipated to trigger
liquidation charges, surrender charges or other fees then the Company shall
take such actions as are necessary to reasonably estimate the amount of such
charges and/or fees and provide such estimate in writing to Parent no later
than fifteen (15) calendar days prior to the Closing Date. 

  

 5.14 _Section 280G_. The Company shall promptly submit to the shareholders of the Company for approval (in a manner satisfactory to Parent), by such number of shareholders of the Company as is required by the terms of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, any payments and/or benefits that may separately or in the aggregate, constitute "parachute payments" pursuant to Section 280G of the Code ("Section 280G Payments") (which determination shall be made by the Company and shall be subject to review and approval by Parent), such that such payments and benefits shall not be deemed to be Section 280G Payments, and prior to the Effective Time the Company shall deliver to Parent evidence satisfactory to Parent that (i) a vote of the shareholders of the Company was solicited in conformance with Section 280G and the regulations promulgated thereunder and the requisite shareholder approval was obtained with respect to any payments and/or benefits that were subject to the shareholder vote (the "280G Shareholder Approval"), or (ii) that the 280G Shareholder Approval was not obtained and as a consequence, that such payments and/or benefits shall not be made or provided to the extent they would cause any amounts to constitute Section 280G Payments, pursuant to the waivers of those payments and/or benefits, which were executed by the affected individuals prior to the shareholder vote. 

  

 5.15 _Financials_. 

  

 (a) The Company, prior to the Effective Time, shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its auditors to prepare and deliver as promptly as practicable after the date hereof the Year-End Financials and the unaudited balance sheets as of September 30, 2007 and September 30, 2006, and the related unaudited statements of income, cash flow and stockholders equity for the nine month periods then ended (which shall be considered "Interim Financials" hereunder), all in a form compliant with Regulation S-X and, with respect to the Interim Financials, reviewed by the Companys auditors in accordance with SAS-100. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide such assistance to the Company as is required and available only from Parent in order for the Company to complete the Required Financials (as defined below). Following delivery of the Required Financials, Parent shall be entitled to include the Required Financials in a registration statement or other filing made by Parent with the SEC. 

  

 (b) The Company, prior to the Effective Time, and the Shareholder Representative, on or after the Effective Time, shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Companys auditors to deliver any opinions, consents, comfort letters, or other materials necessary for Parent to file the Year-End Financials and Interim Financials in a registration statement or other filing made by Parent with the SEC. 

  

 (c) Within thirty (30) days following the last day of each fiscal quarter ending after September 30, 2007 and after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Parent the unaudited balance sheet as of the last day of such fiscal quarter and as 

   ##### 

  

    

of the last day of the corresponding fiscal quarter from the prior fiscal
year, and the related unaudited statement of income, cash flow, and
stockholders equity for the three (3) month periods then ended, in each case
reviewed by the Companys independent accountants in accordance with SAS-100,
and such quarterly financial statements shall be deemed "Interim Financials"
under this Agreement.  

  

 (d) The financial statements to be delivered pursuant to Section 5.15(a) and Section 5.15(c) hereof shall be referred to as the "Required Financials." 

  

 5.16 _Acknowledgement; Closing Schedule_. No later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver an updated Section 2.2 of the Disclosure Schedule detailing the capitalization of the Company as of the Closing (the "Closing Schedule"). Among other information required therein, the Closing Schedule shall set forth (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock to be outstanding as of the Effective Date, (ii) the calculation of the amount of accrued dividends for each share of Company Preferred Stock, (iii) the amount of Additional Common Stock, (iv) the Class A Liquidation Value and the Class B Liquidation Value (detailing the components thereof), and (iv) such other information as Parent may reasonably request in order to determine the aggregate and per share Merger Consideration payable hereunder. 

  

 5.17 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_. 

  

 (a) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall, cause the Final Surviving Entity or the Surviving Entity, as the case may be, to indemnify and hold harmless the officers and directors of the Company as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (each a "Covered Person") in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time to the fullest extent permitted under the Companys bylaws in effect on the date hereof and under the Companys Amended and Restated Certificate on the date hereof; _provided_ that such indemnification shall be subject to any limitation imposed from time to time under applicable law. 

  

 (b) Parent shall purchase a directors and officers insurance "tail" policy under the Companys existing directors and officers insurance policy which (i) has an effective term of six (6) years from the Effective Time, (ii) covers the Covered Persons, (iii) contains terms and conditions (including, without limitation, coverage amounts) that are no less advantageous, when taken as a whole, to those currently applicable to the Covered Persons, (iv) has a total cost of no more than $90,000, and (v) has a coverage effective date not later than the Closing Date,  _provided, however,_ that all rights to indemnification in respect of any claims (each a "DandO Claim") asserted or made within the period referenced in Section 5.17(b)(i) shall continue until the disposition of such Claim. 

  

 (c) The rights of each Covered Person under this Section 5.17 shall be in addition to any rights such person may have under the bylaws and under the Amended and Restated Certificate of the Company, in each case on the date hereof. These rights shall survive 

   ##### 

  

    

consummation of the First Step Merger and the Second Step Merger and are
intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each Covered Person. 

  

 5.18 _Charter Amendment_. The Company shall promptly submit to the shareholders of the Company for approval (in a manner satisfactory to Parent), by such number of shareholders of the Company as is required by New Jersey Law, the Charter Documents and any agreements between the Company and its shareholders, an amended and restated certificate of incorporation or waiver or consent that provides, among other things, that (i) for purposes of calculating the value of any Parent Common Stock received at the Closing to determine whether the liquidation preferences of Company Preferred Stock are satisfied, such Parent Common Stock shall be valued at the Signing Price, (ii) the termination of the accrual of dividends on the Company Preferred Stock on the Signing Date, and (iii) the Merger Consideration will be calculated and distributed in accordance with the terms hereof (the "Charter Amendment"), and prior to the Effective Time the Company shall deliver to Parent evidence satisfactory to Parent that a vote of the shareholders of the Company was solicited in conformance with New Jersey Law, the Charter Documents and any agreements between the Company and its shareholders and the requisite shareholder approval was obtained with respect to the Charter Amendment. 

  

 5.19 _Additional Tax Matters._  

  

 (a) _Preparation and Filing of Returns._  

  

 (i) Parent shall prepare and file at its expense, or shall cause to be prepared and filed, all Returns with respect to Company and the Company Subsidiaries for any tax period or portion thereof ending on or prior to the Closing Date (each, a "Pre-Closing Tax Period") that are due after the Closing Date, and shall pay all amounts shown to be due thereon; _provided_ , that Parent shall provide each such Return to the Shareholder Representative for its review and comment at least fifteen (15) Business Days prior to the date on which such Return is required to be filed, and Parent shall make changes to each such Return as are reasonably requested by the Shareholder Representative. Such Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practices, except as required by applicable law. 

  

 (ii) Parent, the Final Surviving Entity (and their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates) shall not amend any Returns with respect to the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Period without the prior written consent of the Shareholder Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

   ##### 

  

    

the Closing Date after the time of Closing shall not result in any breach of
any Tax representation or indemnification obligation therefor by the
Shareholders. 

  

 (c) _Cooperation on Tax Matters._ Parent and the Shareholder Representative shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other parties, in connection with the filing of Returns, any Tax audits, Tax proceedings or other Tax-related claims, the authorization and execution of any appropriate powers of attorney to accomplish the foregoing.

Parent and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates shall not destroy or dispose of any Tax work papers, schedules or other materials and documents supporting Returns of the Final Surviving Entity, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for Pre-Closing Periods until the seventh (7th) anniversary of the Closing Date, without the prior written consent of Shareholder Representative, and before any disposition or destruction of such materials at any time, Parent shall give the Shareholder Representative not less than thirty (30) Business Days notice as well as the opportunity to take possession of such materials and documents. 

  

 (d) _Interaction with Article VII_. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, to the extent that a provision of this Section 5.19 directly conflicts with a provision of Article VII, this Section 5.19 shall govern. 

  

 5.20 _Termination of Employment Agreement_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall terminate the rights of Andre Zirkler under that certain Executive Employment Agreement, dated March 1, 2003, between Andre Zirkler and Viecore Federal System Division, Inc. to the "Long Term Incentive Bonus" provided therein, and the "put" and "call" rights in connection with the Long Term Incentive Bonus.

The Company may allocate a portion of the Bonus Payment and/or Parent Restricted Stock Units contemplated by Section 5.11 as consideration for the termination of such agreement.

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Principal Shareholders agree to indemnify and hold Parent and its officers, directors, and affiliates, including the Final Surviving Entity (the "Indemnified Parties"), harmless against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, deficiencies, costs, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses of investigation and defense, but excluding punitive, special or consequential damages or diminution in value (hereinafter individually a "Loss" and collectively "Losses") incurred or sustained by the Indemnified Parties, or any of them (including the Final Surviving Entity), directly or indirectly, as a result of (i) any breach or inaccuracy of a representation or warranty of the Company contained in this Agreement or in any certificate or other instruments delivered by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) any failure by the Company to perform or comply with any covenant applicable to it contained in this Agreement, (iii) the amount of any Excess Third Party Expenses, or (iv) to the extent allocated in accordance with Section 1.7 hereof, the improper or alleged improper allocation of the Merger Consideration, Contingent Additional Cash Consideration, Contingent Cash Consideration, Equity Holdback or Cash Holdback (including any claims that the allocation of only cash to the Unaccredited Shareholders is improper). The Principal Shareholders shall not have any right of contribution from the Final Surviving Entity or Parent with respect to any Loss claimed by an Indemnified Party. 

  

 (b) For all purposes of this Section 7.2, any Loss of any Indemnified Party shall be net of (i) any insurance or other recoveries actually received by the Indemnified Party or its affiliates in connection with the facts giving rise to the right of indemnification (after accounting for reasonable costs incurred to collect such insurance recoveries); and (ii) any tax benefits actually recognized by the Indemnified Party in the year of the indemnity claim and resulting from the incurrence or payment of such Loss. 

  

 (c) _Limited Section 2.2 Representation_. 

  

 (i) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary (but subject to the limitations contained in this Section 7.2(c)), any indemnification relating to a breach of Section 2.2(a) resulting from either (x) the inaccuracy of the ownership of Company Capital Stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for Company Capital Stock by a Principal Shareholder, or (y) a person claiming ownership of Company Capital Stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for Company Capital Stock transferred to such person from a Principal 

   ##### 

  

    

Shareholder and not reflected in Section 2.2(a) of the Disclosure Schedule,
shall not be limited to the Escrow Amount and such representation shall
survive beyond the Survival Period until the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations, and the Principal Shareholders agree severally
(namely the Principal Shareholder who has breached the Limited Section 2.2
Representation shall indemnify), but not jointly, to indemnify the
Indemnified Parties for any such breach. 

  

 (ii) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary (but subject to the limitations contained in this Section 7.2(c)), any indemnification relating to a breach of Section 2.2(a) resulting from a person claiming ownership of Company Capital Stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for Company Capital Stock not reflected in Section 2.2(a) of the Disclosure Schedule shall not be limited to the Escrow Amount and such representation shall survive beyond the Survival Period until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, and the Principal Shareholders agree severally, but not jointly, to indemnify the Indemnified Parties for any such breach based on their Pro Rata Portions. 

  

 (iii) The indemnification obligations set forth in paragraphs (i) and (ii) above shall be referred to herein as the "Limited Section 2.2 Representations". The liability of each Principal Shareholder pursuant to this Section 7.2(c) is limited to the amount of Merger Consideration received by such Principal Shareholder. 

  

 7.3 _Escrow Arrangements_.  

  

 (a) _Escrow Fund_. 

  

 (i) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Escrow Agent each Principal Shareholders Pro Rata Portion. The Parent Common Stock to be deposited in the Escrow Fund shall be represented by a single stock certificate registered in the name of Var and Co., as nominee of the Escrow Agent. Such deposit of the Escrow Amount (plus any New Shares (as defined in Section 7.3(c)(v) hereof), as well as any cash substituted for the Parent Common Stock in accordance with Sections 7.3(a)(iii)(1) and (2) shall constitute an escrow fund (the "Escrow Fund") to be governed by the terms set forth herein. The Pro Rata Portion of each Principal Shareholder shall be as set forth on a schedule delivered by the Company to the Escrow Agent at Closing in a form previously approved by the Escrow Agent and Parent (the "Escrow Schedule"). Such Principal Shareholders right to receive its Pro Rata Portion shall be solely a right of such Principal Shareholder to receive payments as provided in this Section 7.3. Such Pro Rata Portion for each Principal Shareholder shall be deposited by Parent as, for this purpose, agent of the Principal Shareholders, who shall thereupon, without any act by them, be treated as having received from Parent under Section 1.7 hereof such Pro Rata Portion and then as having deposited such Pro Rata Portion into the Escrow Fund. The Escrow Fund shall be security for the indemnity obligations provided for in Section 7.2 hereof. The Escrow Fund shall be available to compensate the Parent Indemnified Parties for any claims by such parties for any Losses suffered or incurred by them and for which they are entitled to recovery under this Article VII. The Escrow Agent may execute this Agreement following the date hereof and prior to the Closing, and such later execution, if so executed after the date hereof, shall not affect the 

   ##### 

  

    

binding nature of this Agreement as of the date hereof between the other
signatories hereto. Interests in the Escrow Fund shall be non-transferable. 

  

 (ii) On or prior to 12:00 p.m. local time at Parents headquarters on the first Business Day following the Registration Date, the Shareholder Representative shall notify Parent in writing by telephone, facsimile and by email that it has elected to (1) sell all of the Escrow Shares (subject to Section 7.3(a)(iii)(3)) (the "Registration Time Sale"), or (2) hold all of the Escrow Shares in the Escrow Fund until the Survival Date (the "Survival Date Sale"). If the Parent does not receive any notice by such time, for purposes of this Agreement, the Shareholder Representative shall be treated as having notified Parent in writing that it has elected the Registration Time Sale. 

  

 (iii) If the Shareholder Representative has elected the Registration Time Sale, then the following shall occur: 

  

 (1) The Shareholder Representative shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause an efficient and orderly manner, method and timing of such sale, using the procedure more fully described in 7.3(d) below. All cash proceeds from the sale of Escrow Shares under a Registration Time Sale shall be placed in escrow and shall thereafter be part of the Escrow Fund. 

  

 (2) If at the Registration Time, the Escrow Amount is greater than or equal to the Registration Escrow Value, then Parent shall deliver the Contingent Cash Escrow Amount, to the Escrow Agent, together with a written notice identifying the additional Escrow Amount, which along with the proceeds of the Registration Time Sale shall constitute the Escrow Fund. 

  

 (3) If at the Registration Time, the Escrow Amount is less than the Registration Escrow Value, then Parent shall prior to the Registration Time Sale, notify the Shareholder Representative and the Escrow Agent in writing and permanently retain, and each Principal Shareholder shall have no further rights whatsoever to, that amount of Escrow Shares equal to the Parent Escrow Equity Holdback Amount, as specified in the written notice. Any shares so retained shall thereafter not be deemed Escrow Shares and shall not be sold pursuant to Section 7.3(a)(iii)(1) hereof. 

  

 (iv) If the Shareholder Representative has elected the Survival Time Sale, then the following shall occur: 

  

 (1) The Escrow Shares shall remain in the Escrow Fund as provided in this Article VII. 

  

 (2) At the Registration Time, Parent shall deliver to the Escrow Agent an amount of cash equal to the Escrow Share Percentage, multiplied by the Contingent 

   ##### 

  

    

Additional Cash Consideration, together with a written notice identifying the
additional Escrow Amount, which shall constitute part of the Escrow Fund. 

  

 (3) Subject to (5) below, if on the Survival Date, the Escrow Amount is greater than or equal to the Survival Date Value, then Parent shall deliver the Contingent Cash Escrow Amount to the Escrow Agent, together with a written notice identifying the additional Escrow Amount, which shall constitute part of the Escrow Fund. 

  

 (4) Subject to (5) below, if at the Survival Date, the Escrow Amount is less than the Survival Date Escrow Value, then Parent shall, on the Survival Date, notify the Shareholder Representative and the Escrow Agent in writing and permanently retain, and each Principal Shareholder shall have no further rights whatsoever to, that amount of Escrow Shares equal to the Parent Escrow Equity Holdback Amount, as specified in the written notice. 

  

 (5) If a pending claim exists on the Survival Date, the Shareholder Representative shall have the option of either maintaining shares of Parent Common Stock in the Escrow Fund in an amount equal to such pending claim (valued at the Survival Price) or liquidating shares held in the Escrow Fund in an amount equal to such pending claim (valued at the Survival Price), and the cash proceeds from such sale shall be retained in the Escrow Fund and held in accordance with this Article VII. Notwithstanding paragraphs (3) and (4) above, a portion of the Contingent Cash Escrow Amount or the Parent Escrow Equity Holdback Amount, as the case may be, shall initially not be distributed to the Escrow Agent or permanently retained by Parent, as the case may be. Such portion not so initially distributed or retained shall equal the Contingent Cash Escrow Amount or the Parent Escrow Equity Holdback Amount, as the case may be, multiplied by (x) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock retained in the Escrow Fund or liquidated as provided above to be held in reserve in connection with any pending claim, divided by (y) the total number of shares of Parent Common Stock in the Escrow Fund on the Survival Date. Once a final determination is made as to whether Parent is entitled to recover Losses in connection with such pending claim, the portion of the Contingent Cash Escrow Amount or the Parent Escrow Equity Holdback Amount, as the case may be, initially not distributed or retained shall be allocated to Parent based on the proportion that the finally determined Losses bear to the amount of the pending claim as of the Survival Date, and the remainder (if any) shall be allocated to the Principal Shareholders. 

  

 (b) _Escrow Period; Distribution upon Termination of Escrow Periods_. Subject to the following requirements, the Escrow Fund shall be in existence immediately following the Effective Time and shall terminate at 5:00 p.m., local time at Parents headquarters, on the Survival Date (the "Escrow Period"); _provided, however_ , that the Escrow Period shall not terminate with respect to any amount of unsatisfied claims specified in any Officers Certificate delivered to the Escrow Agent and the Shareholder Representative prior to the Escrow Period termination date with respect to facts and circumstances existing prior to the Survival Date. Subject to Section 7.3(a)(iv)(5), as soon as all such claims have been resolved in accordance with Section 7.4, the Escrow Agent shall deliver to the Principal Shareholders the remaining portion of the shares, 

   ##### 

  

    

and if applicable, any cash, in the Escrow Fund not required to satisfy such
claims. Deliveries of amounts of shares, and if applicable, cash, out of the
Escrow Fund to the Principal Shareholders pursuant to this Section 7.3(b)
shall be made in proportion to their respective initial Pro Rata Portions
(and in the same form as initially deposited) with the amount of (i) shares
delivered to each Principal Shareholder rounded down to the nearest whole
number of shares of Parent Common Stock and, (ii) if applicable, cash
delivered to each Principal Shareholder rounded down to the nearest cent. Any
distribution of all or a portion of the Parent Common Stock to the Principal
Shareholders shall be made by delivery of the stock certificate held by the
Escrow Agent representing the Parent Common Stock to the Parent, endorsed for
transfer, with instruction to the Parent to transfer and issue, or cause its
transfer agent to transfer and issue, the aggregate number of shares of
Parent Common Stock being distributed, allocated among the
Principal Shareholders based upon such Principal Shareholders Pro Rata
Portion, in each case by issuing to each such Principal Shareholder a stock
certificate representing such allocated shares, registered in such Principal
Shareholders name set forth on the Escrow Schedule and mailed by first
class mail to such Principal Shareholders address set forth on the Escrow
Schedule (or to such other address as such Principal Shareholder may have
previously instructed the Escrow Agent in writing); and, if less than all the
then remaining shares of Parent Common Stock are to be so distributed
and transferred, the Escrow Agent shall instruct the Parent to issue and
return to the Escrow Agent (or its nominee, if the Escrow Agent shall so
instruct) a stock certificate representing the remaining shares of Parent
Common Stock. The Escrow Agent shall have no liability for the actions
or omissions of, or any delay on the part of, the Parent in connection with
the foregoing. 

  

 (c) _Protection of Escrow Fund_. 

  

 (i) The Escrow Agent shall hold and safeguard the Escrow Fund during the Escrow Period and shall hold and dispose of the Escrow Fund only in accordance with the terms of this Section 7.3(c). 

  

 (ii) Each of the Principal Shareholders shall have voting rights with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock contributed to and held in the Escrow Fund on behalf of such Principal Shareholder (and on any voting securities added to the Escrow Fund in respect of such shares of Parent Common Stock). The Escrow Agent shall from time to time deliver such proxies, consents and other materials and documents to the Shareholder Representative as may be necessary to enable the Principal Shareholders to exercise such voting rights, and the Shareholder Representative shall instruct the Principal Shareholders to return any instructions with respect to such voting rights to the Shareholder Representative, who shall tabulate all votes received by the Principal Shareholders and shall vote on their behalf in accordance with the instructions given by each such Principal Shareholder. In the absence of instructions by any such Principal Shareholder, the Shareholder Representative shall not vote any of the shares held on behalf of such Principal Shareholder. 

  

 (iii) The Parent, Shareholder Representative and the Principal Shareholders agree that the Parent shall be solely responsible for providing, at their cost and 

   ##### 

  

    

expense, any certification, opinion of counsel or other instrument or document
necessary to comply with or satisfy any transfer restrictions to which the
Parent Common Stock is subject, including without limitation any opinion of
counsel required to be delivered pursuant to any restrictive legend appearing
on the certificate evidencing the Parent Common Stock in connection with any
distribution of Parent Common Stock to be made by the Escrow Agent under or
pursuant to this Agreement. Any such opinion of counsel shall include the
Escrow Agent as an addressee or shall expressly consent to the Escrow Agents
reliance thereon. 

  

 (iv) Any cash portion, if applicable, of the Escrow Fund shall be invested in the Escrow Agents "Insured Money Market Account" ("IMMA"), as described in Exhibit E hereto, and any interest paid on such cash shall not be added to the Escrow Fund and such amount shall be distributed to the Principal Shareholders on a quarterly basis. The Escrow Agent shall have no liability for any investment losses suffered absent gross negligence or willful misconduct. 

  

 (v) Cash dividends, and any non-cash taxable dividends or distributions (other than New Shares as defined below), on any shares of Parent Common Stock in the Escrow Fund, or any interest on cash held in the Escrow Fund, shall not be added to the Escrow Fund, but rather shall be distributed to the Principal Shareholders according to their respective Pro Rata Portions, and shall not become a part of the Escrow Fund. Any shares of Parent Common Stock or other equity securities issued or distributed by Parent after the Effective Time (including shares issued upon a nontaxable stock split) ("New Shares") in respect of Parent Common Stock in the Escrow Fund which have not been released from the Escrow Fund shall be added to, and become a part of, the Escrow Fund. The parties hereto (other than the Escrow Agent) agree that the Principal Shareholders are the owners of any stock in the Escrow Fund. The parties hereto (other than the Escrow Agent) agree that all interest on or other taxable income, if any, earned from the investment of such cash pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated for tax purposes as earned by the Principal Shareholders. The Escrow Agent shall report to the Principal Shareholders on Form 1099 any income earned from the investment of cash, if any, in the Escrow Fund, and the Principal Shareholders shall be responsible for any Taxes due with respect thereto. New Shares issued in respect of shares of Parent Common Stock which have been released from the Escrow Fund shall not be added to the Escrow Fund but shall be distributed to the record holders thereof. 

  

 (vi) The Principal Shareholders hereto agree to provide the Escrow Agent with a certified tax identification number by signing and returning a Form W-9 (or Form W-8 BEN, in case of non-U.S. persons) to the Escrow Agent, upon the execution and delivery of this Agreement. The parties understand that, in the event their tax identification numbers are not certified to the Escrow Agent, the Internal Revenue Code, as amended from time to time, may require withholding of a portion of any interest or other income earned on the investment of the Escrow Fund. 

  

 (d) _Sale of Escrow Shares_  

  

 (i) In connection with any sale of the Escrow Shares pursuant to Section 7.3 of this Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to receive and rely upon, prior to taking 

   ##### 

  

    

action in that regard, written direction from the Shareholder Representative
as to the manner and method to be undertaken in carrying out such sale,
including without limitation written direction (1) identifying the number of
shares to be sold, (2) requesting the Escrow Agent to use a brokerage firm
identified by the Shareholder Representative therein, or requesting the Escrow
Agent to use its affiliated brokerage service, and (3) setting forth any
necessary or special instructions with respect to the sale (including any
stop loss or minimum price per share instruction); and the Shareholder
Representative shall execute and deliver any instruments reasonably required
by the Escrow Agent in order to carry out such sale or liquidation. 

  

 (ii) The Escrow Agent shall have no responsibility in connection with such sale other than to make delivery of the Escrow Shares to the selected brokerage firm, with instruction (including any special instruction provided by the Shareholder Representative), and to receive and deposit into the Escrow Account (to be administered and distributed in accordance with this Agreement) as part of the Escrow Fund, any net sale proceeds received therefrom. The Escrow Agent shall have no duty or obligation to determine or accomplish compliance with any applicable transfer restrictions; and it shall be the sole obligation of the party directing such sale to take any remaining actions, and to provide or deliver any necessary instruments or opinions (at its expense) necessary to comply with applicable transfer restrictions or applicable securities laws. The Escrow Agent shall have no liability for any actions or omissions of any such brokerage firm, and shall have no liability for the price or execution achieved. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Shareholder Representative expressly acknowledges that (a) the Escrow Shares may be sent to a transfer agent to be reissued in saleable form, (b) the Escrow Shares may contain or be subject to transfer restrictions that may limit their marketability and impose restrictions upon the number or types of purchasers to whom they can be offered or sold, and (c) the Escrow Agent shall have no liability for any failure or delay (or any price change during any such delay) on the part of the Shareholder Representative or any transfer agent, or caused by any necessary registration or delivery procedures, or compliance with any applicable transfer restrictions involved in the transfer of such Escrow Shares. 

  

 (iii) The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to contract with any brokerage firm (which may be selected by the Escrow Agent without liability on its part, taking into consideration any brokerage firm requested by the Shareholder Representative, as provided above), which may be affiliated with the Escrow Agent, and may enter into any such contract on a "best efforts" basis with the brokerage firm. The Escrow Agent shall be indemnified hereunder for any costs, expenses and risks associated therewith or arising thereunder (other than resulting from its own gross negligence or willful misconduct), and the proceeds of any sale shall be net of all brokerage commissions and charges. 

  

 (iv) The net sale proceeds of any such sale of Escrow Shares received by the Escrow Agent, less a Sales Administration Fee (as hereinafter defined) shall be apportioned among the Principal Shareholders in their Pro Rata Portion. The "Sales Administration Fee" shall mean a fee equal to five dollars ($5.00) per Principal Shareholder per day of sale, subject to a minimum of $500.00 (the "Minimum Sales Fee"). For purposes of determining whether the 

   ##### 

  

    

Minimum Fee Limit has been reached, any individual sale (whether or not
effected on the same day) shall be counted as a separate sales transaction,
and the Sales Administration Fee shall be assessed each day any sale of
shares is effected until the total number of shares directed to be sold are
sold. As an example only, if a sale is requested that requires two separate
trades effected over two business days, then the Sales Administration fee
would be $5.00 per Principal Shareholder times the number of Principal
Shareholders times two. This fee is intended to cover not only the expense of
the sale, but also the resulting tax reporting required to be made to
the Principal Shareholders. 

  

 7.4 _Indemnification Claims_ _._  

  

 (a) _Threshold Amount_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, except as set forth in the second sentence of this Section 7.4(a), an Indemnified Party may not recover any Losses under clause (i) of Section 7.2(a) hereof unless and until one or more Officers Certificates (as defined below) identifying such Losses under clause (i) of Section 7.2(a) hereof in excess of $1,195,000 in the aggregate (the "Threshold Amount") has or have been delivered to the Shareholder Representative and the Escrow Agent as provided in Section 7.4(b) hereof, in which case Parent shall be entitled to recover all Losses so identified without regard to the Threshold Amount from the first dollar of such Losses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover for, and the Threshold Amount shall not apply as a threshold to, any and all claims or payments made with respect to all (i) Losses incurred pursuant to clauses (ii), (iii), and (iv) of Section 7.2(a) hereof, and (ii) Losses resulting from any breach of representation or warranty contained in Section 2.2 (Company Capital Structure) hereof. 

  

 (b) _Claims for Indemnification_. In order to seek indemnification under Section 7.2 hereof, Parent shall deliver an Officers Certificate to the Shareholder Representative and the Escrow Agent at any time on or before the last day of the Escrow Period; _provided, however_ , that subject to the provisions of Sections 7.2(c), 7.4(c) and 7.4(d), Parent may seek and shall be entitled to indemnification outside of the Escrow Fund directly from the Principal Shareholders for (i) fraud, or (ii) a breach of the Limited Section 2.2 Representations following the expiration of the Escrow Period by delivering an Officers Certificate to the Shareholder Representative on or before the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. Unless the Shareholder Representative shall have delivered an Objection Notice pursuant to Section 7.4(c) hereof, the Escrow Agent shall promptly, and in no event later than the thirtieth (30th) day after its receipt of the Officers Certificate, deliver to the Indemnified Party from the Escrow Fund an amount equal to the Loss set forth in such Officers Certificate. Any payment from the Escrow Fund to Indemnified Parties shall be made in Parent Common Stock, and cash, if applicable, in the same proportions as then contained in the Escrow Fund, and shall be deemed to have been made pro rata amongst the Principal Shareholders based on the aggregate amounts deposited into the Escrow Fund on each such Principal Shareholders behalf. For the purposes hereof, "Officers Certificate" shall mean a certificate signed by any officer of Parent: (i) stating that an Indemnified Party has paid, sustained, incurred, or properly accrued, or reasonably anticipates that it will have to pay, sustain, incur, or accrue Losses, and (ii) specifying in reasonable detail the individual items of 

   ##### 

  

    

Losses included in the amount so stated, the date each such item was paid,
sustained, incurred, or properly accrued, or the basis for such anticipated
liability, and the nature of the misrepresentation, breach of warranty or
covenant to which such item is related. 

  

 (c) _Objections to Claims for Indemnification_. No such payment shall be made under Section 7.4(a) hereof if the Shareholder Representative shall object in a written statement to the claim made in the Officers Certificate (an "Objection Notice"), and such Objection Notice shall have been received by Parent and the Escrow Agent prior to the expiration of the thirtieth (30th) day after its receipt of the Officers Certificate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Shareholder Representative and the Principal Shareholders hereby waive the right to object to any claims in respect of any Agreed-Upon Loss (as defined in Section 7.4(d)(vii) hereof). If the Shareholder Representative does not object in writing within such thirty (30) day period, such failure to so object shall be an irrevocable acknowledgment by the Shareholder Representative that the Indemnified Party is entitled to the full amount of the claim for Losses set forth in such Officers Certificate, and payment in respect of such Losses shall thereafter be made in accordance with this Section 7.4. 

  

 (d) _Resolution of Conflicts; Arbitration_. 

  

 (i) In case the Shareholder Representative delivers an Objection Notice in accordance with Section 7.4(c) hereof (other than Agreed-Upon Losses as defined in Section 7.4(d)(vii) hereof), the Shareholder Representative and Parent shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims. If the Shareholder Representative and Parent should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties and furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and make distributions from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms thereof. 

  

 (ii) If, after thirty (30) days after delivery of an Objection Notice, no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation, either Parent, on the one hand, or the Shareholder Representative on the other hand, may demand arbitration of the matter unless the amount of the Loss is at issue in pending litigation with a third party, in which event arbitration shall not be commenced until such amount is ascertained or both parties agree to arbitration, and in either such event the matter shall be settled by arbitration conducted by one arbitrator mutually agreeable to Parent and the Shareholder Representative. In the event that, within thirty (30) days after submission of any dispute to arbitration, Parent and the Shareholder Representative cannot mutually agree on one arbitrator, then, within fifteen (15) days after the end of such thirty (30) day period, Parent and the Shareholder Representative shall each select one arbitrator. The two arbitrators so selected shall select a third arbitrator. If either party fails to select an arbitrator during this fifteen (15) day period, then the parties agree that the arbitration will be conducted by one arbitrator selected by the other party. 

  

 (iii) Any such arbitration shall be held in New York, New York, under the rules then in effect of the American Arbitration Association. All expenses relating to the arbitration 

   ##### 

  

    

(but excluding each parties own expenses) shall be paid, including without
limitation, the fees of each arbitrator and the administrative fee of the
American Arbitration Association shall be paid as follows: fifty percent
(50%) by Parent and fifty percent (50%) by the Principal Shareholders on the
basis of the Principal Shareholders respective Pro Rata Portions;
_provided, however_ , that each party shall bear its own respective expenses
relating to the arbitration, including without limitation, legal and expert
witness fees. The arbitrator or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the
case may be, shall set a limited time period and establish
procedures designed to reduce the cost and time for discovery while allowing
the parties an opportunity, adequate in the sole judgment of the arbitrator
or majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be, to discover
relevant information from the opposing parties about the subject matter of
the dispute. The arbitrator or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the
case may be, shall rule upon motions to compel or limit discovery and shall
have the authority to impose sanctions, including attorneys fees and costs,
to the same extent as a competent court of law or equity, should the
arbitrators or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be,
determine that discovery was sought without substantial justification or that
discovery was refused or objected to without substantial justification. 

  

 (iv) The decision of the arbitrator or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be, as to the validity and amount of any claim in such Officers Certificate shall be final, binding, and conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement. 

  

 (v) Such decision shall be written and shall be supported by written findings of fact and conclusions, which shall set forth the award, judgment, decree or order awarded by the arbitrator(s), and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on and make distributions from the Escrow Fund in accordance with, the terms of such award, judgment, decree or order as applicable. Within ten (10) days of a decision of the arbitrator(s) requiring payment by one party to another, such party shall make the payment to such other party. 

  

 (vi) Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The forgoing arbitration provision shall apply to any dispute under this Article VII. 

  

 (vii) This Section 7.4(d) shall not apply to claims made in respect of any Agent Interpleader Expenses or Agent Indemnification Expenses pursuant to Section 7.4(f)(vi) hereof or Section 7.4(f)(vii) hereof (each, an "Agreed-Upon Loss"). Claims against the Escrow Fund made in respect of any Agreed-Upon Loss shall be resolved in the manner described in Section 7.4(a) and Section 7.4(c) hereof. 

  

 (e) _Third-Party Claims_. In the event Parent becomes aware of a third party claim (other than a claim that is the subject of an Agreed-Upon Loss) (a "Third Party Claim") which Parent reasonably believes may result in a demand for indemnification pursuant to this Article VII, Parent shall notify the Escrow Agent and the Shareholder Representative of such claim as soon as is practicable and in any event within thirty (30) days of the time that such Parent Indemnified Party learns of such claim, assertion, event or proceeding; provided, however, that the failure to so notify the Shareholder Representative shall not affect the Parent Indemnified Partys rights to 

   ##### 

  

    

indemnification hereunder except to the extent that the Principal Shareholders
are materially prejudiced by such failure. If the Third Party Claim may
result in a claim against the Escrow Fund, the Shareholder Representative, on
behalf of the Principal Shareholders, shall be entitled, at its expense, to
participate in, but not to determine or conduct, the defense of such Third
Party Claim. Parent shall have the right in its sole discretion to conduct
the defense of, and to settle, any such claim; _provided, however_ , that
except with the consent of the Shareholder Representative, no settlement of
any such Third Party Claim with third party claimants shall be
(i) determinative of the amount of Losses relating to such matter, and (ii)
be agreed to unless it includes a full release of liability of the Principal
Shareholders. In the event that the Shareholder Representative has consented
to any such settlement, the Principal Shareholders shall have no power or
authority to object to the amount of any Third Party Claim by
Parent. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this
Section 7.4(e) shall not apply to any third party claim that is the subject
of an Agreed-Upon Loss. 

  

 (f) _Escrow Agent_  _s Duties_. 

  

 (i) The Escrow Agent shall be obligated only for the performance of such duties as are specifically set forth herein, and as set forth in any additional written escrow instructions which the Escrow Agent may receive after the date of this Agreement which are signed by an officer of Parent and the Shareholder Representative and are not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, or, in the reasonable opinion of Escrow Agent, will not result in additional obligations or liabilities to the Escrow Agent, and may rely and shall be protected in relying or refraining from acting on any instrument reasonably believed to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties. The Escrow Agents duties hereunder are ministerial in nature and shall not be deemed fiduciary. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any act done or omitted hereunder as Escrow Agent while acting in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment, and any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of legal counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith. 

  

 (ii) The Escrow Agent is hereby expressly authorized to disregard any and all warnings given by any of the parties hereto or by any other person, excepting only orders or process of courts of law, and is hereby expressly authorized to comply with and obey orders, judgments or decrees of any court. In case the Escrow Agent obeys or complies with any such order, judgment or decree of any court, the Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any of the parties hereto or to any other person by reason of such compliance, notwithstanding any such order, judgment or decree being subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside, vacated or found to have been entered without jurisdiction. 

  

 (iii) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable in any respect on account of the identity, authority or rights of the parties executing or delivering or purporting to execute or deliver this Agreement or any documents or papers deposited or called for hereunder. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (iv) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for the expiration of any rights under any statute of limitations with respect to this Agreement or any documents deposited with the Escrow Agent. 

  

 (v) In performing any duties under this Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any party for damages, losses (including losses resulting from liquidating a position in the IMMA), or expenses, except for gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall not incur any such liability for (1) any act or failure to act made or omitted in good faith, or (2) any action taken or omitted in reliance upon any instrument, including any written statement or affidavit provided for in this Agreement that the Escrow Agent shall in good faith believe to be genuine, nor will the Escrow Agent be liable or responsible for forgeries, fraud, impersonations, or determining the scope of any representative authority. In addition, the Escrow Agent may consult with legal counsel in connection with performing the Escrow Agents duties under this Agreement and shall be fully protected in any act taken, suffered, or permitted by him/her in good faith in accordance with the advice of counsel. The Escrow Agent is not responsible for determining and verifying the authority of any person acting or purporting to act on behalf of any party to this Agreement. 

  

 (vi) If any controversy arises between the parties to this Agreement, or with any other party, concerning the subject matter of this Agreement, its terms or conditions, the Escrow Agent will not be required to determine the controversy or to take any action regarding it. The Escrow Agent may hold all documents and the Escrow Fund and may wait for settlement of any such controversy by final appropriate legal proceedings or other means as, in the Escrow Agents discretion, may be required, despite what may be set forth elsewhere in this Agreement. In such event, the Escrow Agent will not be liable for damages. Furthermore, the Escrow Agent may at its option, file an action of interpleader requiring the parties to answer and litigate any claims and rights among themselves. The Escrow Agent is authorized to deposit with the clerk of the court all documents and the Escrow Fund held in escrow, except all costs, expenses, charges and reasonable attorney fees incurred by the Escrow Agent due to the interpleader action (the "Agent Interpleader Expenses") and which the parties agree to pay as follows: fifty percent (50%) to be paid by Parent and fifty percent (50%) to be paid by the Principal Shareholders on the basis of the Principal Shareholders respective Pro Rata Portions. Upon initiating such action, the Escrow Agent shall be fully released and discharged of and from all obligations and liability imposed by the terms of this Agreement. 

  

 (vii) The parties and their respective successors and assigns agree jointly and severally to indemnify and hold Escrow Agent harmless against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses, including reasonable costs of investigation, counsel fees, including allocated costs of in-house counsel and disbursements that may be imposed on Escrow Agent or incurred by Escrow Agent in connection with the performance of his/her duties under this Agreement, including any litigation arising from this Agreement or involving its subject matter, other than those arising out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Escrow Agent (the "Agent Indemnification Expenses") as follows: fifty percent (50%) to be paid by Parent and fifty 

   ##### 

  

    

percent (50%) to be paid by the Principal Shareholders on the basis of the
Principal Shareholders Pro Rata Portions. 

  

 (viii) The Escrow Agent may resign at any time upon giving at least thirty (30) days written notice to the Parent and the Shareholder Representative; _provided, however_ , that no such resignation shall become effective until the appointment of a successor escrow agent which shall be accomplished as follows: Parent and the Shareholder Representative shall use their best efforts to mutually agree on a successor escrow agent within thirty (30) days after receiving such notice. If the parties fail to agree upon a successor escrow agent within such time, the Escrow Agent shall have the right to appoint a successor escrow agent authorized to do business in the State of New York or appeal to a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint a successor escrow agent and shall remain the escrow agent until such order is received. The successor escrow agent shall execute and deliver an instrument accepting such appointment and it shall, without further acts, be vested with all the estates, properties, rights, powers, and duties of the predecessor escrow agent as if originally named as escrow agent. Upon appointment of a successor escrow agent, the Escrow Agent shall be discharged from any further duties and liability under this Agreement. 

  

 (ix) The Escrow Agent is hereby authorized, in making or disposing of any investment permitted by this Agreement, or in carrying out any sale of the Escrow Fund permitted by this Agreement, to deal with itself (in its individual capacity) or with any one or more of its affiliates, whether it or such affiliate is acting as a subagent of the Escrow Agent or for any third person or dealing as principal for its own account. 

  

 (x) The parties hereto acknowledge that, to the extent regulations of the Comptroller of the Currency, or other applicable regulatory entity, grant the parties the right to receive individual confirmations of security transactions at no additional cost, as they occur, the parties specifically waive receipt of such confirmations to the extent permitted by law. The Escrow Agent will furnish the parties hereto with periodic cash transaction statements that include detail for all investment transactions made by the Escrow Agent hereunder. 

  

 (xi) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any provision seeking to limit the liability of the Escrow Agent shall not be applicable in the event such liability arises from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Escrow Agent. 

  

 (xii) Notwithstanding any term appearing in this Agreement to the contrary, in no instance shall the Escrow Agent be required or obligated to distribute any of the Escrow Fund (or take other action that may be called for hereunder to be taken by the Escrow Agent) sooner than two (2) Business Days after (i) it has received the applicable documents required under this Agreement in good form, or (ii) passage of the applicable time period (or both, as applicable under the terms of this Agreement), as the case may be. 

  

 (g) _Fees_. All fees (including attorneys fees) of the Escrow Agent for performance of its duties hereunder shall be paid by Parent in accordance with the standard fee schedule of the Escrow Agent previously delivered to Parent. It is understood that the fees and 

   ##### 

  

    

usual charges agreed upon for services of the Escrow Agent shall be considered
compensation for ordinary services as contemplated by this Agreement. In the
event that the conditions of this Agreement are not promptly fulfilled, or if
the Escrow Agent renders any service not provided for in this Agreement but
that has been requested by an officer of Parent, or if the parties request
a substantial modification of the terms of the Agreement, or if any
controversy arises, or if the Escrow Agent is made a party to, or intervenes
in, any litigation pertaining to the Escrow Fund or its subject matter, the
Escrow Agent shall be reasonably compensated for such extraordinary services
and reimbursed for all costs, attorneys fees, including allocated costs of
in-house counsel, and expenses occasioned by such default, delay, controversy
or litigation. 

  

 (h) _Successor Escrow Agents_. Any corporation or other entity into which the Escrow Agent in its individual capacity may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation or other entity resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Escrow Agent in its individual capacity shall be a party, or any corporation or other entity to which substantially all the corporate trust business of the Escrow Agent in its individual capacity may be transferred, shall be the Escrow Agent under this Escrow Agreement without further act. 

  

 7.5 _Shareholder Representative_.  

  

 (a) By virtue of the approval of the Merger and this Agreement by the requisite vote of the Shareholders, each of the Shareholders shall be deemed to have agreed to appoint TCB as its agent and attorney-in-fact, as the Shareholder Representative for and on behalf of the Shareholders to take all actions under this Agreement that are to be taken by the Shareholder Representative. The Shareholder Representative is authorized and empowered to take any and all actions which it believes are reasonably necessary or appropriate under this Agreement, including without limitation giving and receiving notices and communications, to authorize payment to any Indemnified Party from the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims by any Indemnified Party, to object to such payments, to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to such claims, to assert, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to, any other claim by any Indemnified Party against any Shareholder or by any such Shareholder against any Indemnified Party or any dispute between any Indemnified Party and any such Shareholder, in each case relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and to take all other actions that are either (i) necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Shareholder Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing or (ii) specifically mandated by the terms of this Agreement. Such agency may be changed from time to time upon not less than thirty (30) days prior written notice to Parent; _provided, however_ , that the Shareholder Representative may not be removed unless holders of a two-thirds (2/3) interest of the Escrow Fund agree to such removal and to the identity of the substituted agent. A vacancy in the position of Shareholder Representative may be filled by the holders of a majority in interest of the Escrow Fund. No bond shall be required of the Shareholder Representative, and the Shareholder Representative shall not receive any compensation 

   ##### 

  

    

for its services. Notices or communications to or from the Shareholder
Representative shall constitute notice to or from the Shareholders. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Shareholder Representative
shall have the full power and authority to interpret all the terms and
provisions of this Agreement and to consent to any amendment hereof thereof in
its capacity as Shareholder Representative. 

  

 (b) The Shareholder Representative shall not be liable for any act done or omitted hereunder as Shareholder Representative while acting in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment. The Shareholders shall indemnify the Shareholder Representative and hold the Shareholder Representative harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the Shareholder Representative and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Shareholder Representatives duties hereunder, including the reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel retained by the Shareholder Representative ("Shareholder Representative Expenses"). This indemnification shall survive termination of this Agreement. A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Shareholder Representative, including an amendment, extension or waiver of this Agreement, shall constitute a decision of the Shareholders and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the Shareholders; and the Escrow Agent and Parent may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Shareholder Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of the Shareholders. The Shareholder Representative may in all questions arising under this Agreement seek advice of legal counsel, and for anything done, omitted or suffered in good faith by the Shareholder Representative in accordance with such advice, the Shareholder Representative shall not be liable to any Shareholder. The Escrow Agent and Parent are hereby relieved from any liability to any person for any decision, act, consent or instruction of the Shareholder Representative. 

  

 (c) _Authorization_. In no event shall the Shareholder Representative be liable hereunder or in connection herewith to any Shareholder for any indirect, punitive, special or consequential damages. Without limiting any other provision of this Section 7.5, the Shareholder Representative is authorized to, without limitation: 

  

 (i) Give and receive all notices or documents given or to be given to Shareholder Representative pursuant hereto or in connection herewith and to receive and accept services of legal process in connection with any suit or proceeding arising under this Agreement; 

  

 (ii) Engage counsel, and such accountants and other advisors and incur such other expenses in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby as the Shareholder Representative may in its sole discretion deem appropriate; and 

  

 (iii) After the Effective Time, take such action as the Shareholder Representative may in its sole discretion deem appropriate in respect of: (A) waiving any inaccuracies in the representations or warranties of Parent or Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered by Parent or Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II pursuant hereto; (B) taking such other action as the Shareholder Representative is authorized to take under 

   ##### 

  

    

this Agreement; (C) receiving all documents or certificates and making all
determinations, in its capacity as Shareholder Representative, required under
this Agreement; and (D) all such actions as may be necessary to carry out any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, without
limitation, the defense and/or settlement of any claims for which
indemnification is sought pursuant to this Article VII and any waiver of any
obligation of Parent or the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (d) _Reasonable Reliance._ In the performance of its duties hereunder, the Shareholder Representative shall be entitled to (i) rely upon any document or instrument reasonably believed to be genuine, accurate as to content and signed by any Shareholder or any party hereunder and (ii) assume that any person purporting to give any notice in accordance with the provisions hereof has been duly authorized to do so. 

  

 (e) _Orders._ The Shareholder Representative is authorized, in its sole discretion, to comply with final, nonappealable orders or decisions issued or process entered by any court of competent jurisdiction or arbitrator with respect to the Escrow Fund. If any portion of the Escrow Fund is disbursed to the Shareholder Representative and is at any time attached, garnished or levied upon under any court order, or in case the payment, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery of any such property shall be stayed or enjoined by any court order, or in case any order, judgment or decree shall be made or entered by any court affecting such property or any part thereof, then and in any such event, the Shareholder Representative is authorized, in its sole discretion, but in good faith, to rely upon and comply with any such order, writ, judgment or decree which it is advised by legal counsel selected by it is binding upon it without the need for appeal or other action; and if the Shareholder Representative complies with any such order, writ, judgment or decree, he shall not be liable to any Shareholder or to any other person by reason of such compliance even though such order, writ, judgment or decree may be subsequently reversed, modified, annulled set aside or vacated. 

  

 (f) _Expenses of the Shareholder Representative._ The Shareholder Representative shall be entitled to reimbursement of all expenses incurred in connection with its duties as Shareholder Representative hereunder from the Principal Shareholders based on their respective Pro Rata Portions. If a Principal Shareholder shall default in its obligations to reimburse the Shareholder Representative hereunder, the Shareholder Representative shall be entitled to withhold from distribution to the defaulting Principal Shareholder an amount equal to such defaulted obligation. 

  

 (g) _Irrevocable Appointment._ Subject to Section 7.5, the appointment of the Shareholder Representative hereunder is irrevocable and any action taken by the Shareholder Representative pursuant to the authority granted in this Section 7.5 shall be effective and absolutely binding as the action of the Shareholder Representative under this Agreement. 

  

 7.6 _Maximum Payments; Remedy_.  

   ##### 

  

  

 (a) Except as set forth in Section 7.6(b) and Section 7.6(c) hereof, the maximum amount an Indemnified Party may recover from a Principal Shareholder individually pursuant to the indemnity set forth in Section 7.2 hereof for Losses shall be limited to the amounts held in the Escrow Fund with respect to such Principal Shareholder, and the maximum amount that may be recovered from Parent or the Subs for a breach of representations and warranties (but not covenants) pursuant to this Agreement shall be an aggregate amount equal to the Escrow Amount. 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall limit the liability of any party in respect of Losses arising out of any (i) fraud, (ii) willful and intentional breaches of covenants on the part of such party, (iii) the Limited Section 2.2 Representations as provided in Section 7.2(c). Subject to Section 7.2(c), any liability beyond the Escrow Fund pursuant to this Section 7.6(b)) shall be borne by the Principal Shareholders severally, and not jointly, up to the Merger Consideration received by each such Principal Shareholder. 

  

 (c) Nothing herein shall limit the liability of the Company for any breach or inaccuracy of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement or any Related Agreement if the Merger does not close. 

  

 7.7 _Treatment of Indemnity Payments; Miscellaneous_. All payments made pursuant to this Article VII shall be treated as adjustments to the Merger Consideration for tax purposes and such agreed treatment shall govern for purposes of this Agreement. For purposes of this Article VII, subject to Section 7.3(a)(iv)(5), the Parent Common Stock held in the Escrow Fund shall be deemed to have a value equal to the average closing price of the Parent Common Stock for five trading days prior to the date of the final determination of a claim subject to an Officers Certificate.

ARTICLE IX 

   

REGISTRATION  

  

 9.1 _Filing and Effectiveness of Shareholder Registration Statement_. Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to file a registration statement on Form S-3 (or other appropriate form if Form S-3 is not available) covering the resale to the public by the Shareholders of all shares representing the Equity Consideration (the "Shareholder Registration Statement") with the SEC on or prior to the later of the (i) 7th day following the Closing Date, (ii)  7th day after the date all of the Required Financials are delivered to Parent, or (iii) the third (3rd) business day following the receipt and resolution of any comments provided by the Shareholder Representative pursuant to Section 9.2(d)(viii) hereof, _provided however_ , that in each case, the Companys auditors shall have delivered any consents necessary to file the Required Financials. If, despite using commercially reasonable efforts, Parent does not file the Shareholder Registration Statement within the time periods provided for in the prior sentence, Parent shall continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to file such registration statement as soon as practicable. Parent shall use its reasonable commercial efforts to cause the Shareholder Registration Statement to be automatically effective upon filing, or if automatic effectiveness is not available, to be declared effective by the SEC as soon as practicable and use its reasonable commercial efforts to assist the Selling Shareholders in allowing sales of shares representing Equity Consideration to occur pursuant to the Shareholder Registration Statement;  _provided_ that Parent shall not be required to make any filing with the SEC prior to the date that such filing otherwise would be due other than the Parents Form 8-K containing the required financial statements of the Company and the pro-forma financial statements required in connection with the Merger (the "Form 8-K"). Parent shall provide the Shareholder Representative with two (2) or more Business Days notice of its reasonable estimate of when the Registration Time will occur and shall notify the Shareholder Representative by telephone and email of the Registration Time within three (3) hours of the Registration Time. Parent shall cause the Shareholder Registration Statement to remain effective until the one (1) year anniversary of the Closing Date or such earlier time as all of the Equity Consideration covered by the Shareholder Registration Statement has been sold pursuant thereto. Parent shall pay the expenses incurred by it in complying with its obligations under this Article IX including, without limitation, all preparation, registration, filing fees, costs and expenses, all exchange listing fees, all fees, costs and expenses of counsel for Parent, accountants for Parent and other advisors or persons retained by Parent in connection with the filing of the Shareholder Registration Statement. In addition, Parent shall pay the reasonable expenses of counsel to the Selling Shareholders in connection with the Shareholder Registration Statement not to exceed $15,000. Parent shall not be responsible for (i) any brokerage fees, selling commissions or underwriting discounts incurred by the Shareholders in connection with sales under 

   ##### 

  

 

the Shareholder Registration Statement, and (ii) the fees and expenses of any
accountants retained by the Selling Shareholders. 

   

 9.2 _Limitations on Registration Rights_.  

  

 (a) Parent may, by written notice to the Shareholders, (i) delay the filing or effectiveness of the Shareholder Registration Statement, or (ii) suspend the Shareholder Registration Statement after effectiveness and require that the Shareholders immediately cease sales of the Equity Consideration pursuant to the Shareholder Registration Statement, in the event that (1) Parent is engaged in any activity or transaction or preparations or negotiations for any activity or transaction that Parent desires to keep confidential for business reasons, if Parent determines in good faith that the public disclosure requirements imposed on Parent under the Securities Act in connection with the Shareholder Registration Statement would require disclosure of such activity, transaction, preparations or negotiations, or (2) Parent determines in good faith that the public disclosure requirements imposed on Parent under the Securities Act in connection with the Shareholder Registration Statement would require Parent to file any information or materials with the SEC prior to the date that such information or materials otherwise would be required to be filed, other than the Form 8-K. 

  

 (b) If Parent delays or suspends the Shareholder Registration Statement or requires the Shareholders to cease sales of Equity Consideration pursuant to Section 9.2(a) hereof, Parent shall, as promptly as practicable following the termination of the circumstance which entitled Parent to do so, take such actions as may be necessary to file or reinstate the effectiveness of the Shareholder Registration Statement (with such Registration Statement staying effective and remaining effective for one (1) year as contemplated by Section 9.1 above) and/or give written notice to all Shareholders authorizing them to resume sales pursuant to the Shareholder Registration Statement. If as a result thereof the prospectus included in the Shareholder Registration Statement has been amended to comply with the requirements of the Securities Act, Parent shall enclose such revised prospectus with the notice to Shareholders given pursuant to this Section 9.2(b), and the Shareholders shall make no offers or sales of Equity Consideration pursuant to the Shareholder Registration Statement other than by means of such revised prospectus. 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not suspend or delay the filing or effectiveness of the Shareholder Registration Statement pursuant to Section 9.2(a) hereof for more than sixty (60) days (a "Registration Delay Period"), and provided further that Parent shall not defer its obligation in this manner more than once in any twelve (12) month period. 

  

 (d) _Registration Procedures_. 

  

 (i) In connection with the filing by Parent of the Shareholder Registration Statement, Parent shall furnish to each Shareholder a copy of the prospectus, including a preliminary prospectus, in conformity with the requirements of the Securities Act. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (ii) Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify all shares representing the Equity Consideration covered by the Shareholder Registration Statement under the securities laws of each state of the United States; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not be required in connection with this subparagraph to qualify as a foreign corporation or execute a general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction. 

  

 (iii) Parent shall notify all Shareholders when the Shareholder Registration Statement has become effective and anytime when resales must cease or may be resumed. 

  

 (iv) Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and supplements to such Shareholder Registration Statement and the prospectus used in connection therewith as may be necessary to comply with the provisions of the Securities Act. 

  

 (v) If Parent has delivered preliminary or final prospectuses to the Shareholders and after having done so the prospectus is amended or supplemented to comply with the requirements of the Securities Act, Parent shall promptly notify the Shareholders and, if requested by Parent, the Shareholders shall immediately cease making offers or sales of shares representing the Equity Consideration under the Shareholder Registration Statement and return all prospectuses to Parent. Parent shall promptly provide the Shareholders with revised or supplemented prospectuses and, following receipt of the revised or supplemented prospectuses, the Shareholders shall be free to resume making offers and sales under the Shareholder Registration Statement. 

  

 (vi) Parent shall cause all Equity Consideration to be listed on each securities exchange on which similar securities issued by Parent are then listed. 

  

 (vii) If necessary, Parent shall provide a transfer agent, registrar and CUSIP number for the Equity Consideration, in each case not later than the effective date of the Shareholder Registration Statement. 

  

 (viii) Parent shall provide the Shareholder Representative with a draft of the Shareholder Registration Statement and a reasonable opportunity to review and provide comments to the Shareholder Registration Statement. The Shareholder Representative shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide any comments to the Shareholder Registration Statement to Parent as promptly as practicable. 

  

 9.3 _Requirements of Shareholders_.  

  

 (a) The Shareholder Representative is authorized to (i) give and receive notices for and on behalf of the Shareholders in connection with this Article IX, (ii) deliver, as promptly as practicable after receipt from Parent, to the Shareholders the Selling Shareholder Questionnaires (as defined in Section 9.3(b)(i) hereof) in the form provided by Parent to the Shareholder Representative, and collect completed and duly executed Selling Shareholder Questionnaires from 

   ##### 

  

    

the Shareholders, and (iii) deliver and resolve any comments pursuant to and
in compliance with Section 9.2(d)(viii) hereof. 

  

 (b) Parent shall not be required to include any shares representing Equity Consideration held by a particular Shareholder in the Shareholder Registration Statement unless: 

  

 (i) the Shareholder owning such Equity Consideration shall have delivered to the Shareholder Representative not later than the Closing Date, in writing such information regarding such Shareholder and the proposed sale of Equity Consideration by such Shareholder as Parent may reasonably request and as is customarily required in connection with the Shareholder Registration Statement or as shall be required in connection therewith by the SEC or any state securities law authorities ("Selling Shareholder Questionnaire"). The Selling Shareholder Questionnaire shall include an agreement by the Shareholders to indemnify Parent and each of its directors and officers against, and hold Parent and each of its directors and officers harmless from, any losses, claims, damages, expenses or liabilities (including reasonable attorneys fees) to which Parent or such directors and officers may become subject by reason of any statement or omission in the Shareholder Registration Statement made in reliance upon, or in conformity with, a written statement by such Shareholder furnished pursuant to this section (without regard to Section 7.6, _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall such indemnification by any Shareholder exceed the net proceeds received by such Shareholder from the sale of Equity Consideration pursuant to the Shareholder Registration Statement (the "Net Proceeds"); and 

  

 (ii) the Shareholder Representative shall deliver to Parent all completed and executed Selling Shareholder Questionnaires as received. To the extent that any Selling Shareholder Questionnaires are delivered to Parent prior to the day before the Registration Date, Parent shall include the Equity Consideration represented by such Selling Shareholder Questionnaires in the Shareholder Registration Statement. To the extent any Selling Shareholder Questionnaires are delivered to Parent after such date, Parent shall either amend the Shareholder Registration Statement or file a supplement to the Shareholder Registration Statement in order to include the Equity Consideration represented by such Selling Shareholder Questionnaires in the Shareholder Registration Statement;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not be obligated to file more than one (1) amendment or supplement in any 30-day period. 

  

 (c) Without regard to any payment limitations set forth in Section 7.6 which shall not apply to this Section 9.3(c), Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless each Selling Shareholder against any damages to which each Selling Stockholder may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such damages arise out of or are based upon (i) an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Shareholder Registration Statement, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or (ii) arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was not made in the 

   ##### 

  

    

Shareholder Registration Statement in reliance upon and in conformity with
written information furnished by any Selling Shareholder to Parent expressly
for use therein. 

  

 9.4 _Assignment of Rights_.  

  

 (a) A Shareholder may not assign any of its rights under this Article IX except in connection with the transfer of some or all of such Shareholders Equity Consideration to (i) an immediate family member, a charitable trust, or to a trust for their benefit, or (ii) a tax exempt organization under Section 501(c)(3) of the Code, provided each such transferee agrees in a written instrument delivered to Parent to be bound by the provisions of this Article IX. 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the distribution of shares of Parent Common Stock received by Thoma Cressey Fund VI, L.P. and Thoma Cressey Friends Fund VI, L.P. (together "Thoma Cressey") in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby by Thoma Cressey to (i) any of its partners, members or other equity owners, or retired partners, retired members or other equity owners, or to the estate of any of its partners, members or other equity owners or retired partners, retired members or other equity owners, or (ii) a venture capital fund that is controlled by or under common control with one or more general partners or managing members of, or shares the same management company with Thoma Cressey (each a "Permitted Transferees"), any Permitted Transferee shall, at their written request, be entitled to request to be included in the Shareholder Registration Statement as a selling shareholder, and Parent shall promptly amend or supplement the Shareholder Registration Statement to include such Permitted Transferee in such Shareholder Registration Statement (or if such request is received prior to the filing of the Shareholder Registration Statement to include such Permitted Transferee in such Shareholder Registration Statement, when filed). Each Permitted Transferee shall agree to be bound by the provisions of this Article IX, _provided however_ that such Permitted Transferees shall not have any rights under this Article IX other than this Section 9.4(b).

 10.4 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement, the Exhibits hereto, the Disclosure Schedule, the Confidential Disclosure Agreement, and the documents and instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto referenced herein: (i) constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, including, without limitation, that certain Letter Agreement by and among the Parent and the Company dated as of April 14, 2007, (ii) are not intended to confer upon any other person any rights or remedies hereunder, and (iii) shall not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise, except that Parent may assign its rights and delegate its obligations hereunder to its affiliates as long as Parent remains ultimately liable for all of Parents obligations hereunder. 

  

 10.5 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision. 

  

 10.6 _Other Remedies_. Any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.
