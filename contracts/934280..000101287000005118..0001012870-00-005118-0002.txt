                         AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

          This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of July 9, 2000 (the

"Agreement"), by and among CyberSource Corporation ("Acquiror"), a Delaware
 ---------                                           --------
corporation, Sapphire Merger, Inc. ("Merger Sub"), a Delaware corporation, and
                                     ----------
PaylinX Corporation (the "Company"), a Delaware corporation.  Certain
                          -------
capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in Exhibit A.
                                                        ---------

          WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Acquiror, Merger Sub and the
Company each have determined that the acquisition of the Company by Acquiror is
in the best interests of their respective companies and stockholders and
presents an opportunity for their respective companies to achieve long-term
strategic and financial benefits, and accordingly have agreed to effect the
merger provided for herein upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein; and

          WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the
merger contemplated herein shall qualify as a reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").
                                                                         ----

          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the
parties hereto agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE 1
                                   ---------
                                  THE MERGER

          1.1  The Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
               ----------
Agreement, at the Effective Time Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company, the Company shall be the surviving corporation (the "Surviving
                                                              ---------
Corporation") and the separate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease
-----------
(the "Merger"). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the
      ------
Effective Time all property, rights, powers, privileges and franchises of Merger
Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and
duties of Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation. Immediately following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Acquiror.

          1.2 Effective Time of the Merger. The Merger shall become effective
              ----------------------------
when a properly executed certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger"), in
                                                     ---------------------
such form as may be agreed by the parties hereto and as required by the relevant
provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), has been duly
                                                         ----
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, which filings shall
be made as part of the Closing upon satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set
forth in Article 7. When used in this Agreement, the term "Effective Time" shall
mean the date and time at which such Certificate of Merger has been accepted for
filing by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later time
as is provided in the Certificate of Merger.

                                   ARTICLE 2
                                   ---------
                           THE SURVIVING CORPORATION

          2.1  Certificate of Incorporation. At the Effective Time, the
               ----------------------------
Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as amended and restated to read as
the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub and as attached as Exhibit A to
the Certificate of Merger, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by the DGCL and such
Certificate of Incorporation.

                                       1
<PAGE>

     2.2  Bylaws. The Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to
          ------
the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended.

     2.3  Directors and Officers of Surviving Corporation. The directors of the
          -----------------------------------------------
Company shall resign effective as of the Effective Time. The directors of Merger
Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of
the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, and the
officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
initial and only officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed.

                                   ARTICLE 3
                                   ---------
                            CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

     3.1  Conversion of Shares.
          --------------------

               (a)  At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of the holders thereof, and subject to Section 3.10,
each share of common stock, $.01 par value per share, of the Company
("Company Common Stock") and each share of the Company's preferred stock, $.01
  --------------------
par value per share ("Company Preferred Stock," and, together with the Company
                      -----------------------
Common Stock, the "Company Stock"), that is issued and outstanding immediately
                   -------------
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive, upon
surrender of the certificate formerly representing such share of Company Stock
(the "Certificate"), one and two-tenths (1.2) shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of
      -----------
Common Stock of Acquiror, $0.001 par value per share ("Acquiror Stock");
                                                       --------------
provided, however, that each share of Company Stock that is held in the treasury
--------  -------
of the Company or by any subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall not be so converted but shall be canceled and retired, and
no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

               (b)  In no event shall Acquiror be obligated to issue more than
8,450,797 shares of Acquiror Stock to holders of Company Stock as of the date of
this Agreement, plus shares of Acquiror Stock upon conversion of Company Stock
issued upon exercise of options to purchase up to 2,430,128 shares of Company
Common Stock and warrants to purchase 14,286 shares of Company Common Stock.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Stockholder shall have a
claim against Acquiror, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation if there is a
breach of Section 4.3 resulting in a Stockholder receiving a lesser number of
shares of Acquiror Stock.

               (c)  At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of the holder thereof, each share of the common stock, no
par value per share, of Merger Sub that is issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and continue as one share of
the common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

     3.2  Options.
          -------

               (a)  At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase
Company Common Stock (a "Stock Option") subject to the Company's 2000 Stock
                         ------------
Option Plan (the "Company Stock Option Plan"), whether vested or unvested, shall
                  -------------------------
by virtue of the Merger be deemed assumed by Acquiror and will constitute an
option to acquire the number (rounded down to the nearest whole number) of
shares of Acquiror Stock as the holder of such Stock Option would have been
entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger had such holder exercised such option
in full immediately prior to the Effective Time (not taking into account whether
or not such option was in fact exercisable), at a price per share rounded up to
the nearest whole cent equal to (x) the aggregate exercise price for Company
Common Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Stock Option divided by (y)
the Exchange Ratio. Such assumed options

                                       2
<PAGE>

will be subject to the terms of the Company Stock Option Plan and the stock
option agreement between the Company and each optionee, as amended.

               (b)  As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Acquiror
shall deliver to each holder of an outstanding Stock Option an appropriate
notice setting forth such holder's rights pursuant thereto. Acquiror shall take
all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of
Acquiror Stock for delivery pursuant to the terms set forth in this Section 3.2.

               (c)  At the Effective Time, each outstanding warrant to purchase
Company Stock shall by virtue of the Merger be deemed assumed by Acquiror and
will constitute the right to acquire the number (rounded down to the nearest
whole number) of shares of Acquiror Stock as the holder of such warrant would
have been entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger had such holder exercised
such warrant in full immediately prior to the Effective Time (not taking into
account whether or not such warrant was in fact exercisable), at a price per
share rounded up to the nearest whole cent equal to (x) the aggregate exercise
price for Company Common Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to such warrant
divided by (y) the Exchange Ratio; provided that any such warrant will remain
subject to all other terms of the warrant agreement pursuant to which it was
granted.

     3.3  Exchange of Certificates.
          ------------------------

               (a)  Within twenty (20) business days after the Effective Time,
Acquiror shall make available, and each Stockholder will be entitled to receive
upon surrender of Certificates representing all shares of Company Stock held by
such Stockholder to American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, acting as
exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent"), certificates representing the number of
                     --------------
whole shares of Acquiror Stock into which such shares of Company Stock are
converted in the Merger (excluding the Escrow Shares), subject to this Section
3.3. The shares of Acquiror Stock into which the shares of the Company Stock
shall be converted in the Merger shall be deemed to have been issued at the

not at the time they were filed (or if amended or superseded by a filing prior

untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light

Acquiror's stockholders and has delivered a written copy of such opinion dated
the date hereof to the Company.

     5.8  Absence of Changes.  Since the date of the Agreement, there has not
          ------------------
been any material adverse change in the Acquiror's or Merger Sub's respective
business, condition, assets, liabilities, operations, results of operations or
prospects, and no event has occurred that likely would have a material adverse

          -------------------

               (a)  Except as disclosed in Acquiror's public filings with the
SEC, there is no pending Proceeding, and to the Knowledge of the Acquiror or
Merger Sub, no Person has threatened to commence any Proceeding, that
challenges, or that may have the effect of preventing, delaying, making illegal
or otherwise interfering with, any of the Transactions. To the Knowledge of the
Acquiror or Merger Sub, no event has occurred, and no claim, dispute or other
condition or circumstance exists, that likely would directly or indirectly give
rise to or serve as a basis for the commencement of any such Proceeding.

               (b)  There is no Order that, or to the Knowledge of the Acquiror
or Merger Sub, proposed Order (other than any proposed Order that would be
applicable generally to the online payment industry) that, if issued or
otherwise put into effect, (i) likely would have an Acquiror Material Adverse
Effect on the ability of the Acquiror or Merger Sub to comply with or perform
any covenant or obligation under this Agreement or any of the other
Transactional Agreements or (ii) may have the effect of preventing, delaying,
making legal or otherwise interfering with any of the Transactions.

     5.10 Undisclosed Liabilities.  Except as disclosed in the 1999 10-K (or in
          -----------------------
any subsequently filed Acquiror SEC Reports), as of the date hereof, neither the
Acquiror nor any of its subsidiaries or Affiliates has any liabilities or any
obligations of any nature whether or not accrued, contingent or otherwise,

Business since December 31, 1999 or which individually or in the aggregate are
not material in nature or amount.

     5.11 Full Disclosure.
          ---------------

               (a)  Neither this Agreement (including all Exhibits hereto) nor
any of the Transactional Agreements, when taken together, contains any untrue
statement of material fact or omits to state any fact necessary to make any of
the representations, warranties or statements contained therein on behalf of the
Acquiror or Merger Sub not misleading. To the extent any representation or
warranty permits omission of items otherwise required to be discussed because
they are not material or do not or would not have an Acquiror Material Adverse
Effect, such omissions in the aggregate will not and do not have an Acquiror
Material Adverse Effect.

               (b)  There is no fact within the Knowledge of Acquiror or Merger
Sub (other than publicly known facts relating exclusively to political or
economic matters of general applicability) that

                                       28
<PAGE>

(i) may have an Acquiror Material Adverse Effect on the ability of the Acquiror
or Merger Sub to comply with or perform any covenant or obligation under this
Agreement or any of the other Transactional Agreements, or (ii) may have the
effect of preventing, delaying, making illegal or otherwise interfering with any
of the Transactions.

party, but no Person shall be liable for any such misrepresentation or breach by

     8.4  Escrow Periods.  The Escrow Fund shall commence on the date hereof and
          --------------
terminate on the first anniversary of the Closing (the "Escrow Period"),

               (i)   Stating the aggregate amount of Acquiror's Damages or an
estimate thereof, in each case to the extent known or determinable at such time,
and

               (ii)  Specifying in reasonable detail the individual items of
such Damages included in the amount so stated, the date each such item was paid
or properly accrued or arose, and the nature of the misrepresentation, breach or
claim to which such item is related, then

the Escrow Agent shall, subject to the provisions of Sections 8.3, 8.7 and 8.8
hereof, deliver to Acquiror out of the Escrow Fund, as promptly as practicable,
Escrow Shares having a value equal to such Damages all in accordance with the
Escrow Agreement and Section 8.6 below.  Amounts paid or distributed from the
Escrow Fund shall be paid or distributed pro rata among the Holders (as defined
in the Escrow Agreement) based upon their respective percentage interests
therein at the time.

     8.6  Valuation.  For the purpose of compensating Acquiror or the
          ---------
Stockholders for their respective Damages pursuant to this Agreement, the value
per share of the Escrow Shares and the total consideration received pursuant to

determining the amount of any indemnity, there shall be taken into account any
tax benefit, insurance proceeds or other similar recovery or offset realized,
directly or indirectly.

thirty (30) days after such delivery, the Escrow Agent shall make no delivery of

received written authorization from the Stockholders' Agent to make such
delivery.  After the expiration of such thirty (30) day period, the Escrow Agent
shall make delivery of the Escrow Shares in the Escrow Fund in accordance with
Section 8.5, provided that no such delivery may be made if the Stockholders'
Agent shall object in a written statement to the claim made in the Officer's
Certificate, and such statement shall have been delivered to the Escrow Agent
and to Acquiror prior to the expiration of such thirty (30) day period.

     8.8  Resolution of Conflicts.
          -----------------------

               (a)  In case the Stockholders' Agent or Acquiror, as applicable
shall object in writing to any claim or claims made in any Acquiror's Officer's
Certificate or Stockholders' Agent Certificate, the non-objecting party shall
have thirty (30) days to respond in a written statement to the objection. If
after such thirty (30) day period there remains a dispute as to any claims, the
Stockholders' Agent and Acquiror shall attempt in good faith for thirty (30)
days to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of
such claims. If the Stockholders' Agent and Acquiror should so agree, a
memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both
parties and, if Acquiror has requested delivery of Escrow Shares, shall be
furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any
such memorandum and shall distribute the Escrow Shares from the Escrow Fund in
accordance with the terms of the memorandum.

               (b)  If no such agreement can be reached after good faith
negotiation, either Acquiror or the Stockholders' Agent may, by written notice
to the other, demand arbitration of the matter, unless the amount of the damage
or loss is at issue in pending litigation with a third party, in which event
arbitration shall not be commenced until such amount is ascertained or both
parties agree to arbitration; and in either such event the matter shall be
settled by arbitration conducted by three (3) arbitrators. Within fifteen (15)
days after such written notice is sent, Acquiror (on the one hand) and the
Stockholders' Agent (on the other hand) shall each select one arbitrator, and
the two arbitrators so selected shall select a third arbitrator. The decision of
the arbitrators as to the validity and amount of any claim in such Officer's
Certificate or Stockholders' Agent Certificate shall be binding and conclusive
upon the parties to this Agreement, and notwithstanding anything in Sections 8.1
through 8.5, the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to act in accordance with such
decision and make or withhold payments out of the Escrow Fund in accordance with
such decision.

               (c)  Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrators may be
entered in any court having jurisdiction. Any such arbitration shall be
conducted under the commercial rules then in effect of the American Arbitration
Association. Any arbitration shall be held in Santa Clara, California if the
arbitration is commenced by the Company, or in Reston, Virginia if the
arbitration is commenced by the Acquiror. The non-prevailing party to an
arbitration shall pay its own expenses, the fees of each arbitrator, the
administrative fee of the American Arbitration Association, and the expenses,
including, without limitation, the reasonable attorneys' fees and costs,
incurred by the prevailing party to the arbitration.

     8.9  Stockholders' Agent.
          -------------------

               (a)  John J. McDonnell, Jr. is constituted and appointed as agent
(the "Stockholders' Agent") for and on behalf of the Stockholders to give and
      -------------------
receive notices and communications, to authorize delivery to Acquiror of the
Escrow Shares or other property from the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims
by Acquiror, to object to such deliveries, to agree to, negotiate, enter into
settlements and compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders of
courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to such claims, and to take all
actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Stockholders' Agent for
the accomplishment of the foregoing. Such agency may be changed by the holders
of a majority in interest of the Escrow Shares from time to time upon not less
than ten (10) days' prior written notice to Acquiror. No bond shall be required
of the Stockholders' Agent, and the Stockholders' Agent shall receive no
compensation for services. Notices or communications to or from the
Stockholders' Agent shall constitute notice to or from each of the Stockholders.

               (b)  The Stockholders' Agent shall not be liable for any act done
or omitted hereunder as Stockholders' Agent while acting in good faith, and any
act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of

                                       41
<PAGE>

counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith. The Stockholders shall
jointly and severally indemnify the Stockholders' Agent and hold him harmless
against any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross negligence or bad
faith on the part of the Stockholders' Agent and arising out of or in connection
with the acceptance or administration of his duties under this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement, provided, that the Stockholders' Agent shall be reimbursed for
                  --------
counsel fees and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such Stockholder Agent
in connection with the administration of his duties under this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement or the Escrow Agreement from the proceeds of the sale of Escrow
Shares by the Stockholder Agent. For such purpose, the Stockholder Agent shall
be authorized to direct the Escrow Agent to deliver or cause to be delivered to
the Stockholder Agent such number of Escrow Shares the sale of which by the
Stockholder Agent in ordinary open-market brokers transactions is sufficient to
cover such out-of-pocket costs.

               (c)  The Stockholders' Agent shall have reasonable access to
information about Company and Acquiror and the reasonable assistance of
Company's and Acquiror's officers and employees for purposes of performing its
duties and exercising its rights under this Article 8, provided that the
                                                       --------
Stockholders' Agent shall treat confidentially and not disclose any nonpublic
information from or about Company or Acquiror to anyone (except on a need to
know basis to individuals who agree to treat such information confidentially).

     8.10  Actions of the Stockholders' Agent.  A decision, act, consent or
           ----------------------------------
instruction of the Stockholders' Agent shall constitute a decision of all of the
Stockholders and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each such
Stockholder, and the Escrow Agent and Acquiror may rely upon any decision, act,
consent or instruction of the Stockholders' Agent as being the decision, act,
consent or instruction of each and every such Stockholder.  The Escrow Agent and
Acquiror are hereby relieved from any liability to any person for any acts done
by them in accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Stockholders' Agent.

     8.11  Claims.  In the event Acquiror becomes aware of a third-party claim
           ------
which Acquiror believes may result in a demand against the Stockholders,
Acquiror shall notify the Stockholders' Agent of such claim, and the
Stockholders' Agent and the Stockholders shall be entitled, at their expense, to
participate in any defense of such claim. Acquiror shall have the right in its
sole discretion to settle any such claim; provided, however, that Acquiror may
not effect the settlement of any such claim without the consent of the
Stockholders' Agent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. In the
event that the Stockholders' Agent has consented to any such settlement, the
Stockholders' Agent shall have no power or authority to object to the amount of
any claim by Acquiror against the Stockholders for indemnity with respect to
such settlement, unless such claim is in an amount in excess of any amount
consented to by the Stockholders' Agent.
