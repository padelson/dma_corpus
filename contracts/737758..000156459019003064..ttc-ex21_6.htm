Article II 
THE MERGER

 

2.1The Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and in
accordance with the provisions of the OGCA, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub
will be merged with and into the Company and the separate existence of Merger
Sub will thereupon cease. The Company will be the surviving corporation in
the Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the "Surviving Corporation")
and will continue under the name "The Charles Machine Works, Inc.", to be
governed by the laws of the State of Oklahoma, and the separate existence of
the Company with all its rights, privileges, powers, immunities and franchises
will continue unaffected by the Merger, except as set forth in this Agreement. 

 

2.2Closing; Effective Time. The consummation of the Merger (the "Closing")
shall take place as soon as practicable, but no later than three (3) Business
Days, after the satisfaction or waiver of the last of the conditions set forth
in Article VI (other than the conditions set forth in Section 6.4) to be
satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions as of the Closing), or at such other time as the parties hereto
agree (the actual date on which the Closing takes place being the "Closing
Date"). Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this
Agreement, if the Closing would occur pursuant to the foregoing sentence on a
date that falls within the last twenty (20) days of a fiscal quarter of
Parent, then Parent may, by providing written notice to the Company, have the
Closing delayed (a "Delayed Closing") so that it will occur on the first day
of Parent's fiscal quarter that first begins following the date that the
Closing would have otherwise occurred pursuant to the foregoing sentence, but
subject solely to the satisfaction or waiver at the Closing of the conditions
set forth in Section 6.4. The Closing shall take place remotely via the
electronic exchange of signature and documents, or at such other location as
the parties hereto agree. In connection with the Closing, Parent and the
Company shall cause the Merger to be made effective by executing and filing a
Certificate of Merger in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C (the
"Certificate of Merger") with the Secretary of State of the State of Oklahoma
in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Applicable Laws of the State
of Oklahoma (the time of such filing or such later time as may be agreed in
writing by the Company and Parent and specified in the Certificate of Merger,
being the "Effective Time").

 

2.3Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the
OGCA and other Applicable Law. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time

 

-19-

 



   

all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and
Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities
and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities
and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

 

2.4Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws. At the Effective Time:

 

(a)the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the
provisions of the OGCA and such certificate of incorporation; provided,
however, that at the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of
Merger Sub may be amended to reflect that the name of the Surviving
Corporation is "The Charles Machine Works, Inc." and in such other manner as
determined by Parent; and

 

(b)the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended in accordance with the provisions of such bylaws; provided, however,
that at the Effective Time, the bylaws of Merger Sub may be amended in such
manner as determined by Parent.

 

2.5Directors and Officers. The initial directors of the Surviving Corporation
shall be the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time,
until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.
The initial officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be the officers of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, until their respective
successors are duly appointed.

 

2.6Effect on Capital Stock. 

 

(a)At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, any shareholder of the
Company or the Shareholders' Agent:

 

(i)Each share of Company Common Stock then outstanding (other than Dissenting
Shares and shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.6(a)(ii)) shall be
converted into the right to receive an amount, in cash, equal to the sum of
(i) the Per Share Closing Amount plus (ii) the Per Share Escrow General
Indemnity Release Amount, if any, plus (iii) the Per Share Adjustment Release
Amount, if any, plus (iv) the Per Share Retiree Medical Escrow Release Amount,
if any, plus (v) the Per Share Shareholders' Agent's Fund Distribution Release
Amount, if any (in the case of (ii)-(v) only if, as and when such
disbursements are to be made pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and, if
applicable, the Escrow Agreement);

 

(ii)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, any shares of
Company Common Stock then held by the Company or Parent or any Subsidiary of
the Company or of Parent (including any treasury shares of the Company) shall
be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall
be delivered in exchange therefor ("Cancelled Shares"), and

 

-20-

 



   

(iii)Each share of the common stock, $.001 par value per share, of Merger Sub
then outstanding shall be converted into one share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

 

(b)As of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each share of Restricted
Company Stock that is then outstanding shall become fully vested and free of
any forfeiture restrictions, and, at the Effective Time, shall be converted
pursuant to Section 2.6(a)(i).

 

2.7Dissenting Shares.

 

(a)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any share of
Company Common Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and that is held by a shareholder who has properly exercised
his, her or its appraisal rights under the OGCA with respect to that share
(such share being a "Dissenting Share," and such shareholder being a
"Dissenting Shareholder"), shall not be converted into the right to receive
the consideration to which the holder of such share would be entitled pursuant
to Section 2.6, but rather shall be converted only into the right to receive
such consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to such
Dissenting Share pursuant to the OGCA. 

 

(b)At the Effective Time, the Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder
of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except only the right to receive the fair value of such shares in accordance
with the provisions of the OGCA. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section
2.7(a), if any holder of Dissenting Shares shall effectively withdraw or lose
(through failure to perfect or otherwise) such holder's appraisal rights under
the OGCA, or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such
holder is not entitled to relief provided under the OGCA, then, as of the
later of the Effective Time and the occurrence of such event, such holder's
shares of Company Common Stock shall automatically be converted into and
represent only the right to receive the consideration for Company Common Stock
set forth in Section 2.6(a), without interest, and at such times and subject
to such conditions as are set forth in Section 2.6(a) pursuant to the exchange
procedures set forth in Section 2.8.

 

2.8Surrender of Certificates.

 

(a)At the Effective Time, (i) all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist, (ii) no holder of a certificate that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of the
Company Common Stock (a "Certificate") shall have any rights as a shareholder
of the Company and (iii) each Certificate (x) representing any outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock (except for Dissenting Shares for which
appraisal rights under the OGCA have not been abandoned, withdrawn or lost
(through failure to perfect or otherwise) or Cancelled Shares) shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of such shares as set forth in this Agreement and (y)
representing any Dissenting Shares (as long as they continue to represent
Dissenting Shares) shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the
payments described in Section 2.7.

 

-21-

 



   

(b)At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or shall cause to
be deposited with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the Company
Shareholders, an amount in cash sufficient in the aggregate to provide all
funds necessary for the Paying Agent to make the aggregate Per Share Closing
Amount to be paid to each Company Shareholder (excluding any such amounts
attributable to Dissenting Shares as long as they continue to represent
Dissenting Shares) pursuant to Section 2.6(a). From and after the Effective
Time, the Paying Agent shall act as the agent of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation in effecting any amounts to be paid under this Agreement and the
exchange of the Certificates. 

 

(c)At least ten (10) Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, the
Company shall deliver to Parent a statement by the Chief Executive Officer of
Company, certifying to his actual knowledge and solely in his capacity as an
officer of the Company, as accurate and complete and reasonably acceptable to
Parent the accompanying spreadsheet in Microsoft® Excel format, setting forth
for each Company Shareholder, the name, address, email address (to the extent
available), the number of shares of Company Common Stock held and the
certificate number(s) (if applicable) and at the Closing, the Company shall
deliver to Parent any required updates to such information so that all such
information, as updated, is accurate and complete as of the Effective Time.
Such spreadsheet will also indicate (i) the date of issuance of each
outstanding share of Company Common Stock and, with respect to shares of
Company Common Stock that are classified as "Covered Securities" under
applicable Tax Laws, accurate and complete cost basis information for such
shares to the extent such information is reasonably available to the Company
and (ii) all shares for which appraisal rights have been asserted and not
abandoned, withdrawn or lost as of the Effective Time.

 

(d)As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall
cause the Paying Agent to, mail to each Company Shareholder (i) a Letter of
Transmittal specifying that delivery shall be deemed to have occurred, and
risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of
the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof in the form included
in the Letter of Transmittal) to the Paying Agent, and (ii) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment of
the consideration to which such holder may be entitled pursuant to Section
2.6(a)(i). Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying
Agent, together with such Letter of Transmittal duly executed and completed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of such Certificate shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a payment of the Per Share Closing
Amount as provided in Section 2.6(a)(i) with respect to such Certificate
(after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings pursuant to Section
2.10) and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Parent
shall, promptly following receipt by Paying Agent of each properly surrendered
Certificate, cause the Paying Agent to make the payment of the Per Share
Closing Amount as provided in Section 2.6(a)(i) to the holder of such
Certificate, either by check or wire transfer of immediately available funds
to the account or address designated by such holder in the Letter of
Transmittal delivered with such Certificate. Parent shall cause the Paying
Agent to pay to each holder of a properly surrendered Certificate, at the time
and in the manner set forth herein such holder's applicable portion of any
Post-Closing Payment to be paid as provided in Section 2.6. Until so
surrendered, each outstanding Certificate that prior to the Effective Time
represented shares of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Shares as
long as they continue to represent Dissenting

 

-22-

 



   

Shares and Cancelled Shares) will be deemed from and after the Effective Time,
for all purposes, to evidence only the right to receive a payment of the
applicable amount provided in Section 2.6(a)(i). If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, it
shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Section 2.8. No interest
shall be paid or accrued after the Effective Time on any amount payable upon
due surrender of the Certificates. If payment is to be made to a Person other
than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, it shall be a
condition of such payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by
reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered or establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent
that such Tax was paid or is not applicable.

 

(e)For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything herein or otherwise
to the contrary, the Merger Consideration shall be deemed to provide
consideration to each Company Shareholder for their execution and delivery of
Letters of Transmittal (whether before or after the Effective Time), which are
hereby incorporated as part of the Merger and this Agreement, including the
release of claims against Parent and its Affiliates (including the Surviving
Corporation) set forth therein, and Parent would not have entered into this
Agreement without having the benefit of such releases from all Company
Shareholders being fully enforceable. By executing a written consent in favor
of this Agreement, the approval of the principal terms of the Merger, and the
consummation of the Merger or participating in the Merger and receiving the
benefits thereof, including the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
each Company Shareholder shall be deemed to have acknowledged and agreed to
the foregoing, and such Company Shareholder is specifically agreeing to and
shall have no right to decline to execute and deliver a Letter of Transmittal,
including the release of claims against Parent and its Affiliates (including
the Surviving Corporation) set forth therein, or make any allegation that the
release set forth in the Letter of Transmittal is void or unenforceable for
lack of consideration.

 

(f)At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed, and there shall thereafter be no further registration of transfers of
shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time on the records of the Company. After the Effective Time, no transfer of
Company Common Stock shall thereafter be made on the stock transfer books of
the Surviving Corporation. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are
presented to the Paying Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, they shall
be canceled and exchanged for the applicable portion of the Merger
Consideration.

 

(g)Any portion of the funds received by the Paying Agent (including the
proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the Company
Shareholders on November 30, 2020, or such later date as Parent may elect,
shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any Company Shareholder that
has not theretofore surrendered any Certificate and submitted a Letter of
Transmittal or otherwise received any portion of the Merger Consideration due
and payable to such Company Shareholder pursuant to this Agreement, shall
thereafter look only to Parent and the Surviving Corporation for payment of
the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any
required tax withholdings and without any interest thereon) upon due surrender
of any applicable

 

-23-

 



   

Certificate (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.8(g), none of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Shareholders'
Agent, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any Company
Shareholder for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Applicable Law.

 

(h)The Company shall cause any Tax withholding required as a result of the
vesting of shares of Restricted Company Stock prior to or as a result of the
Closing to be processed prior to the Closing through the Company's payroll
provider to the extent the Company is obligated to do any Tax withholding upon
such vesting, and the Company will make such modifications to the Schedule of
Shareholder Records (as defined in the Paying Agent Agreement previously
discussed by the parties) to reflect that such shares are no longer Restricted
Company Stock.

 

2.9Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by such record holder in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Parent, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay to the record holder of
such Certificate the applicable amounts thereon as provided in Section 2.6(a),
excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any amounts payable on Dissenting
Shares as long as they continue to represent Dissenting Shares, to be paid in
respect of the shares represented thereby upon due surrender of and
deliverable in respect of the shares represented by such Certificate pursuant
to, and at the times provided in, this Agreement; provided, however, that the
Surviving Corporation may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to
the payment of such consideration, require such record holder to indemnify the
Surviving Corporation against any claim that may be made against the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such lost, stolen, or destroyed Certificate.

 

2.10Withholding. Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold (provided, that
no appropriate withholding exemption is received) from any portion of any
payment payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Company Shareholder such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, or any provision of Applicable Law; provided that the withholding
party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide to the
Shareholders' Agent information about the circumstances related thereto as
promptly as practicable. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent
or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts (a) shall be remitted by Parent or
the Paying Agent to the applicable Authority and (b) shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such Company Shareholder.

 

2.11Closing Date Payments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the only payments required to be paid, or caused to be paid, by
Parent at the Closing shall be (a) to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the
Company Shareholders, an amount in cash sufficient in the aggregate to provide
all funds necessary for the Paying Agent to make the aggregate Per Share
Closing Amount to be paid to the Company Shareholders pursuant to Section
2.6(a), (b) to the account designated in writing by the Escrow Agent, an
amount of cash equal to the Escrow Amount, (c) to the account designated in
writing by the Shareholders' Agent, an amount of cash equal to the
Shareholders' Agent's Fund Amount, (d) to the applicable

 

-24-

 



   

Third Party, any unpaid Transaction Expenses included in the Estimated
Transaction Expenses pursuant to invoices timely received from the Third Party
and approved by the Company and (e) to the holder of any Indebtedness that is
secured by an Encumbrance on any assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, such amounts that are included in the Estimated Indebtedness and
specified in payoff letters provided to Parent pursuant to Section 6.2(f).

 

2.12Purchase Price Adjustment.

 

(a)At least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company shall
deliver a draft Estimated Closing Payment Certificate to Parent, with all
components thereof calculated in accordance with the Accounting Principles and
other applicable terms hereof. No later than two (2) Business Days prior to
the Closing, Parent may request reasonable changes to the Estimated Closing
Payment Certificate and the Company shall revise the Estimated Closing Payment
Certificate to reflect any such changes thereto as may be reasonably requested
by Parent, which changes shall be reflected in the final version of the
Estimated Closing Payment Certificate, which shall be delivered by the Company
to Parent at Closing. The Company shall provide to Parent, together with the
Estimated Closing Payment Certificate, all supporting information reasonably
necessary to evidence the calculations, amounts and other matters set forth in
the Estimated Closing Payment Certificate.

 

(b)On or before the ninetieth (90th) day after the Closing Date, Parent shall
prepare and deliver, or cause to be prepared and delivered, to the
Shareholders' Agent a statement (the "Post-Closing Statement") setting forth
Parent's calculation of the Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness, Company Net
Working Capital, and Transaction Expenses that are incurred or properly
accrued but unpaid as of immediately prior to the Measurement Time, all
calculated in accordance with the Accounting Principles and other applicable
terms hereof. If Parent fails to timely deliver a Post-Closing Statement to
Shareholders' Agent, then any amounts payable to the Company Shareholders
pursuant to Section 2.12(e) resulting from a Final Adjustment Surplus shall
accrue interest at a rate of 10% per annum ("Adjustment Interest") from the
ninety-first (91st) day after the Closing Date until the date that the Post-
Closing Statement is delivered to Shareholders' Agent; provided, however, that
if the Parent is not able to deliver the Post-Closing Statement by such
ninetieth (90th) day despite its good faith efforts to do so and Shareholders'
Agent agrees, which agreement will not be unreasonably withheld, to extend the
time to deliver the Post-Closing Statement, then the Adjustment Interest will
not apply if the Post-Closing Statement is delivered on or before the extended
date and then, if not so delivered, will only apply for the time period
between the extended date and the date that the Post-Closing Statement is
delivered to Shareholders' Agent.

 

(c)The Shareholders' Agent shall have sixty (60) days following its receipt of
the Post-Closing Statement (the "Review Period") to review the Post-Closing
Statement. During the Review Period, Parent will, during normal business
hours, make reasonably available to the Shareholders' Agent, to the extent
reasonably requested by the Shareholders' Agent, Parent's books, records, work
papers, personnel and such other information as the Shareholders' Agent may
require in order to evaluate the Post-Closing Statement. On or before the
expiration of the Review Period, the Shareholders' Agent shall deliver to
Parent a written statement accepting or disputing, in whole or in part, the
Post-Closing Statement. In

 

-25-

 



   

the event that the Shareholders' Agent shall dispute the Post-Closing
Statement, such statement shall include a detailed itemization of the
Shareholders' Agent's objections and the reasons therefor (such statement, a
"Dispute Statement"). Any component of the Post-Closing Statement that is not
disputed in a Dispute Statement shall be final and binding upon the parties to
this Agreement and the Company Shareholders, and not subject to appeal. If
the Shareholders' Agent does not deliver a Dispute Statement to Parent within
the Review Period or delivers a statement accepting the Post-Closing
Statement, the Post-Closing Statement, and all amounts set forth therein,
shall be final and binding upon the parties to this Agreement and the Company
Shareholders, and not subject to appeal.

 

(d)If the Shareholders' Agent delivers a Dispute Statement during the Review
Period, Parent and the Shareholders' Agent shall meet and attempt in good
faith to resolve their differences with respect to the disputed items set
forth in the Dispute Statement during the thirty (30) days immediately
following Parent's receipt of the Dispute Statement, or such longer period as
Parent and the Shareholders' Agent may mutually agree (the "Resolution
Period"). Any such disputed items that are resolved by Parent and the
Shareholders' Agent during the Resolution Period shall be set forth in a
memorandum signed by both parties, which shall be final and binding upon the
parties to this Agreement and the Company Shareholders, and not subject to
appeal. If Parent and the Shareholders' Agent do not resolve all such
disputed items by the end of the Resolution Period, Parent and the
Shareholders' Agent shall submit all items remaining in dispute with respect
to the Dispute Statement to Crowe LLP, or if such accounting firm is unable or
unwilling to accept the engagement, then to any nationally recognized
independent accounting firm upon which Parent and the Shareholders' Agent
shall reasonably agree (the "Accounting Firm") for review and resolution. The
Accounting Firm shall act as an expert and not an arbitrator. The Accounting
Firm shall determine only those items remaining in dispute between Parent and
the Shareholders' Agent, and the resolution of a dispute on any item by the
Accounting Firm shall not be more favorable than the amount set forth in the
Post-Closing Statement as originally prepared by the Parent or Shareholders'
Agent, as applicable, or more favorable than set forth in the Dispute
Statement as delivered by Parent or Shareholders' Agent, as applicable, with
respect to each such item. Each of Parent and the Shareholders' Agent shall
(i) enter into a customary engagement letter with the Accounting Firm at the
time such dispute is submitted to the Accounting Firm and otherwise cooperate
with the Accounting Firm, (ii) have the opportunity to submit a written
statement in support of their respective positions with respect to such
disputed items, to provide supporting material to the Accounting Firm in
defense of their respective positions with respect to such disputed items and
to submit a written statement responding to the other party's position with
respect to such disputed items (with all submissions to the Accounting Firm by
Parent or Shareholders' Agent, as applicable, concurrently copied to the other
party) and (iii) subject to customary confidentiality and indemnity
agreements, provide the Accounting Firm with access to their respective books,
records, personnel during normal business hours and upon reasonable request,
and representatives and such other information as the Accounting Firm may
require in order to render its determination. The Accounting Firm shall be
instructed to deliver to Parent and the Shareholders' Agent a written
determination made in accordance with the Accounting Principles and other
applicable terms hereof (such determination to include a worksheet setting
forth all material calculations used in arriving at such determination and to
be based solely on information provided to the Accounting Firm by Parent and
the

 

-26-

 



   

Shareholders' Agent) of the disputed items within thirty (30) days of receipt
of the disputed items, which determination shall, absent manifest error, be
final and binding upon the parties to this Agreement and the Company
Shareholders, and not subject to appeal. The Accounting Firm shall also
determine the portion of its fees and expenses to be paid by each of the
Shareholders' Agent and Parent, with such fees and expenses being borne in
inverse proportion to the degree to which the Accounting Firm accepted the
positions of the respective parties.

 

(e)Once each of the Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness, Company Net Working
Capital and Transaction Expenses that are incurred but unpaid as of
immediately prior to the Measurement Time are finally determined pursuant to
this Section 2.12 (such amounts, respectively, the "Final Cash", "Final
Indebtedness", "Final Company Net Working Capital" and "Final Transaction
Expenses"), (i) if there is a Final Adjustment Surplus, then Parent shall pay
or cause to be paid such amount, plus Adjustment Interest (if any), to the
Paying Agent for the benefit of the Company Shareholders in accordance with
each holder's Pro Rata Portion, to be distributed to the Company Shareholders
in accordance with Sections 2.6 and 2.8, and (ii) if there is a Final
Adjustment Shortfall, then Parent shall be entitled to recover from the Escrow
Fund - Price Adjustment (and, if that amount is not sufficient, then from any
other portion of the Escrow Fund as Parent may elect) an amount of cash equal
to the Final Adjustment Shortfall. The Shareholders' Agent and Parent shall
promptly following the final determination of the Final Adjustment Surplus or
Final Adjustment Shortfall, as applicable, pursuant to this Section 2.12 and
in any event within five (5) Business Days after such final determination,
execute and deliver a joint written notice instructing the Escrow Agent to
release: (x) if there is a Final Adjustment Surplus, an amount equal to the
entire Escrow Fund - Price Adjustment plus Adjustment Interest (if any) to the
Paying Agent, for the benefit of the Company Shareholders in accordance with
each holder's Pro Rata Portion (excluding any portion attributable to
Dissenting Shares), to be distributed to the Company Shareholders in
accordance with Sections 2.6 and 2.8 or (y) if there is a Final Adjustment
Shortfall, (A) the excess, if any, between the Escrow Fund - Price Adjustment
and the Final Adjustment Shortfall to the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the
Company Shareholders in accordance with each holder's Pro Rata Portion
(excluding any portion attributable to Dissenting Shares so as long as they
continue to represent Dissenting Shares), to be distributed to the Company
Shareholders in accordance with Sections 2.6 and 2.8 and (B) the Final
Adjustment Shortfall to Parent from the Escrow Fund - Price Adjustment, and
for greater certainty, if the Final Adjustment Shortfall exceeds the Escrow
Fund - Price Adjustment, then the entire amount of the Escrow Fund - Price
Adjustment shall be released to Parent along with, if necessary, any other
portion of the Escrow Fund as Parent may elect so that the sum of all released

Sub that the statements contained in this Article III are true and correct as
of the date hereof and the Closing Date.

 

3.1Organization, Standing and Power; Subsidiaries.

 

(a)The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in
good standing under the Applicable Law of the State of Oklahoma. Each of the
Subsidiaries of the Company is a corporation or other entity duly organized
and validly existing under the Applicable Laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation or organization. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has
all requisite corporate or other organizational power and authority necessary
to own, lease and operate its assets and to carry on its business as now being
conducted. 

 

(b)The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or authorized to
do business and is in good standing in every jurisdiction (to the extent such
concept exists in such jurisdiction) in which its ownership of property or the
conduct of its business as now conducted requires it to qualify. True and
complete copies of each of the Organizational Documents of the Company and
each of the Subsidiaries have been provided to Parent.

 

(c)Except as set forth in Section 3.1(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
(i) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries owns or controls, and none
of them is subject to any contractual or other obligation to acquire, any
capital stock of, or other equity security or voting interests of any nature
in, or any interest convertible, exchangeable or exercisable for, capital
stock of, or other equity security or voting interests of any nature in, any
other Person, either directly or indirectly (including through ownership of
interests of another Person) or in concert with any Third Party and (ii)
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a participant in any joint
venture, partnership or similar arrangement. The outstanding equity interests

Disclosure Schedule.

 

3.2Authority.

 

(a)The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into
this Agreement and, subject to the receipt of the Required Shareholder
Approval, to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby. The affirmative votes or consents of a majority of the issued and
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are the only votes or consents of
the holders of shares of capital stock of the Company necessary under
Applicable Law and the Company's Organizational Documents for the holders of
shares of capital stock of the Company to adopt this Agreement and approve the
Merger (such affirmative votes or consents, the "Required Shareholder
Approval"). The Required Shareholder Approval is sufficient for the Company
Shareholders to adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger, and no other
corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize
this Agreement or to consummate the Merger and the

 

-30-

 



   

other transactions contemplated hereby (other than the filing and recordation
of the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the provisions of the OGCA).
The Board of Directors of the Company has, by resolutions duly adopted: (i)
declared that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of the Company and
its shareholders, (ii) approved this Agreement in accordance with the
provisions of the OGCA, (iii) directed that the adoption of this Agreement and
the Merger be submitted as promptly as practicable to a vote of, or other
approval by, the shareholders of the Company, and (iv) recommended that the
shareholders of the Company adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger. To

Agreement and the declaration of its advisability by the Company's Board of
Directors and (y) the execution and delivery of this Agreement. When the
Shareholder Written Consent has been executed on behalf of holders of record
of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock as reflected
on Section 3.3(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and such executed
consents are delivered to the Company, the Required Shareholder Approval will
have been duly obtained for the adoption of this Agreement and approval of the
Merger.

 

(b)This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and,
assuming that this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the
Parent and Merger Sub, this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with
its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium or other similar Applicable Law affecting or relating
to creditors' rights generally and general principles of equity, regardless of
whether asserted in a proceeding in equity or at law (collectively, the
"Enforceability Limitations").

 

(c)Except as set forth on Section 3.2(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedules,
the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company does not
constitute, and the consummation by the Company of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby will not result in, a termination,
cancellation, acceleration or Breach by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
of, or a default by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under (with or
without notice or lapse of time, or both), (i) any provision of the
Organizational Documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) any
Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or to
which any of them or their assets are bound, or (iii) any Applicable Law,
except in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) where such termination,
cancellation, acceleration or Breach would not reasonably be expected to be
material to the Company Group. 

 

(d)No Consent or Order of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any
Authority is required to be obtained or made by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective Time in order for the Company to
execute and deliver this Agreement or to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, except for: (i) the filing of the

written consent of the holders of the requisite number of shares of Company
Common Stock to secure the Required Shareholder Approval as promptly as

-70-

 



   

the statements therein not misleading or in order to comply with applicable
law. If at any time prior to the earlier of the Effective Time and the period
during which the holders of capital stock of the Company may exercise
appraisal rights pursuant to Section 1091 of the OGCA, any event or

Subsidiaries and, if applicable, to arrange for financing in connection with
the transactions contemplated in this Agreement and for any other reasonable
business purposes; provided, however, (i) that Parent and its representatives

the Company to schedule such access and visits through a designated officer of

the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws; provided, however, that with respect to
clauses (ii) and (iii), the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to implement alternative disclosure or access arrangements that would not
waive such attorney-client or other privilege or violate such legal
obligation.

by its Tax advisors that such

 

-71-

 



   

changes (i) are contrary to Applicable Law, or (ii) are inconsistent with Tax
positions taken in the previous Tax Returns of the Company or its Subsidiaries
(as applicable) and will, or are likely to, have an adverse effect on Parent
or any of its Affiliates in any taxable period ending after the Closing Date).

 

(b)Tax Periods Beginning Before and Ending After the Closing Date.

 

(i)Parent shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and file, or cause to be
filed, on a timely basis and in a manner consistent with the Company's and its
Subsidiaries' past practice (as applicable), any Tax Returns of the Company or
any Subsidiary (including foreign subsidiaries) for taxable periods that begin

"Straddle Periods" and each, a "Straddle Period"). For Tax Returns that are
due prior to the Indemnity Release Date, Parent shall provide a draft copy of
such Straddle Period Returns to the Shareholders' Agent for review at least
thirty (30) days prior to the due date thereof. Parent shall also provide

access to the preparers of the Prior Period Tax Return. The Shareholders'
Agent shall provide comments to Parent at least fifteen (15) days prior to the
due date of such returns and Parent shall make all changes reasonably
requested by the Shareholders' Agent in good faith (unless Parent is advised
by its Tax advisors that such changes (i) are contrary to Applicable Law, or
(ii) are inconsistent with Tax positions taken in the previous Tax Returns of
the Company or its Subsidiaries (as applicable) and will, or are likely to,
have an adverse effect on Parent or any of its Affiliates in any taxable
period ending after the Closing Date). Parent shall not make, or cause to be
made, any ratable allocation election as contemplated by Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii) or (iii) (or any similar provision of any other
Applicable Law) with respect to any Prior Period Tax Return.

 

(ii)For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(A)In the case of any gross receipts, sales and use, goods and services,
harmonized sales, provincial sales, income, or similar Taxes that are payable
with respect to a Straddle Period, (1) the portion of such Taxes allocable to
the Pre-Closing Tax Period ending on or before the Closing Date and (2) the

(B)In the case of any Taxes (other than gross receipts, sales and use, goods
and services, harmonized sales, provincial sales, income, or similar Taxes)
that are payable with respect to a Straddle Period, the portion of such Taxes
allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be equal to the product of all
such Taxes multiplied by a fraction the

 

-72-

 



   

numerator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period from the
commencement of the Straddle Period through and including the Closing Date and
the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period.

 

(c)Cooperation on Tax Matters. Parent and the Shareholders' Agent shall
cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested, in connection with
the preparation, review and filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Section 5.4
and any audit, litigation, or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other party's request)
the provision of records and information reasonably relevant to any such
preparation, review, filing, audit, litigation, or other proceeding and making
their respective employees, outside consultants and advisors available on a
mutually convenient and timely basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder.

shall be indemnified and held harmless from and against, and entitled to
reimbursement solely from the Escrow Fund for, (i) any Loss attributable to
any Breach of any representation or warranty made in Section 3.13 (Taxes)
provided, however, that any limitation or qualification as to "materiality" or
"Company Material Adverse Effect" shall be disregarded for purposes of
determining whether a Breach of a representation or warranty of the Company
has occurred and in calculating any Loss arising therefrom; (ii) any Loss
attributable to any Breach or violation of, or failure to fully perform, any
covenant, agreement, undertaking or obligation of the Shareholders' Agent or
the Company Shareholders in this Section 5.4 or Section 5.5; (iii) all Pre-
Closing Taxes regardless if the existence of the Pre-Closing Taxes constitutes
a Breach of any representation or warranty made in Section 3.13 (Taxes),
including as Pre-Closing Taxes all Liabilities for Taxes arising out of
application of SAT Bulletin 7 by the PRC to the transactions contemplated by
this Merger Agreement whenever such Liabilities for Taxes are imposed, which
Liabilities under SAT Bulletin 7 shall not be considered as or treated as
Transfer Taxes under this Agreement; (iv) all income Taxes of the Company, any
Subsidiary, or any member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary
group of which the Company (or any predecessor of the Company) is or was a
member on or prior to the Closing Date by reason of a liability under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any comparable provisions of foreign, state or
local Law; and (v) any and all Taxes of any Person imposed on the Company
arising under the principles of transferee or successor liability or by
contract, relating to an event or transaction occurring on or before the
Closing Date; provided that, the Parent Indemnitees shall not be indemnified
or held harmless from any Loss consisting of, or relating to, Taxes resulting
from (x) a Code Section 338 election (or similar state or local election) with
respect to Parent's acquisition by Merger of Company's capital stock pursuant
to this Agreement, (y) any transaction occurring on the Closing Date after the
Closing outside the ordinary course of business (other than as explicitly
contemplated by this Agreement) or (z) any breach by Parent of Section 5.4(f)
of this Agreement that directly results in such Loss. In all of the above
cases in this Section 5.4(d), together with any reasonable out-of-pocket fees
and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' and accountants' fees) incurred
in connection therewith, the Parent Indemnitees shall be reimbursed from the
Escrow Fund -

 

-73-

 



   

General Indemnity (or, to the extent such funds are insufficient, then from
the Escrow Fund - Retiree Medical) for any Taxes of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that are the responsibility of the Company Shareholders pursuant
to this Section 5.4(d) within ten (10) Business Days after notice by Parent or
the Company of such Taxes being due. Notwithstanding anything in this Section
5.4(d) to the contrary, payment for any indemnification claims made pursuant
to this Section 5.4(d) shall be addressed and subject at all times to Section
8.5 (as applicable) and Section 8.6 herein.

 

(e)Tax Proceedings. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 8.10,
Parent shall conduct and control the settlement or defense of any Tax
Proceeding; provided, that if a Tax Proceeding could result in a claim for
indemnification pursuant to Section 5.4(d), Parent shall provide Shareholder's
Agent with notice of such Tax Proceeding in the manner set forth in Section
8.10(a) and shall keep Shareholders' Agent reasonably informed regarding the
progress and substantive aspects with respect to such Tax Proceeding,
including through providing copies of any material written correspondence
received from the relevant taxing authority or submitted thereto and notice in
advance of filing any material written submission or having any material
meetings or calls and Shareholders' Agent shall be entitled at its expense to
participate in the settlement or defense of such Tax Proceeding; provided,
further, that Parent shall not compromise or settle any such Tax Proceeding
without obtaining Shareholders' Agent's prior written consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) if such Tax
Proceeding could result in a claim for indemnification pursuant to Section
5.4(d).

 

(f)Amended Tax Returns. Subject to Section 5.4(h), after the Closing and
prior to the Escrow Release Date--General Indemnity, neither Parent, the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall amend, refile or otherwise modify
any Tax election or Tax Return of the Company or such Subsidiaries or grant an
extension or waiver for the assessment or reassessment of Pre-Closing Taxes
without the prior written consent of the Shareholders' Agent, which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned; provided, however,
that if Parent, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries takes any such action
without the reasonably withheld consent of the Shareholders' Agent, then
Parent shall not be entitled to indemnification with respect to any additional
Taxes that became payable as a result of such action and that would not have
been payable absent such action. Shareholders' Agent's withholding of consent
shall be deemed reasonable if the amendment, refiling or modification would
result in an increase in any Pre-Closing Taxes and such amendment, refiling or
modification was not required by Applicable Law. 

 

(g)SAT Bulletin 7. Company shall timely file, or cause the applicable members
of the Company Group to timely file, within thirty (30) days following the
date of this Agreement, any disclosure required by SAT Bulletin 7 to be filed
by such Person with respect to Merger Agreement in order for Parent to be
entitled to avoid any liability for any income Tax withholding or other
payment (including interest or penalties) to the PRC with respect to the
completion of the transactions contemplated in the Merger Agreement. Company
and Parent shall consult with their respective tax advisors and cooperate as
reasonably necessary to ensure compliance with any applicable reporting
requirements pursuant to SAT Bulletin 7, provided, however, that the Company
shall not

 

-74-

 



   

(and shall cause each member of the Company Group not to) file any Tax Return,
disclosure statement or otherwise communicate with any Tax Authority with
respect to the application of SAT Bulletin 7 to the Merger without Company's

and comment a copy of each such Voluntary Disclosure Agreement at least five

therewith) as provided in Section 5.4(d), with such Taxes considered to be
Pre-Closing Taxes for purposes of Section 5.4(d)(iii); provided that Parent
Indemnitees sole recourse for indemnification pursuant to this Section 5.4(h)

Taxes for which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries will, to the extent
not specifically included in the calculation of the Final Indebtedness or
specifically accrued as a liability in the calculation of Final Company Net
Working Capital, be included as a Transaction Expense. The party required by
Applicable Law to file a Tax Return with respect to such Transfer Taxes shall

be available to (i) any party whose action or failure to act (including the
failure to act in compliance with Section 5.8) has been a principal cause of
or resulted in the failure of the Merger to occur on or before such date and

Parent if (x) such date occurs during a Delayed Closing and (y) the condition
in Section 6.4(a) is satisfied, and the condition in Section 6.4(c) could be
satisfied, on such date;

-88-

 



   

Shareholder Required Approval having been obtained by that time (attaching
evidence thereof in the form of valid shareholder written consents);

 

(d)by either Parent or the Company if an Authority of competent jurisdiction
shall have enacted, issued, promulgated or entered a nonappealable and final
Order that is in effect and restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits
consummation of the Merger;

 

(e)by the Company if (i) there is an inaccuracy or Breach in any of the
representations or warranties of Parent or Merger Sub in this Agreement such
that the condition set forth in Section 6.3(a) would not be satisfied, or
there has been a Breach by Parent or Merger Sub of any of their respective
covenants in this Agreement such that the condition set forth in Section
6.3(b) would not be satisfied, (ii) the Company shall have delivered to Parent
a written notice of such inaccuracy or Breach, (iii) at least thirty (30) days
shall have elapsed since the delivery of such notice without such inaccuracy

not be applicable if the inaccuracy or Breach is incapable of being cured
during such period) and (iv) the Company is not in material Breach of this
Agreement; or

 

(f)by Parent if (i) there is an inaccuracy or Breach in any of the
representations or warranties of the Company in this Agreement such that the

neither Parent nor Merger Sub is in material Breach of this Agreement.

 

7.2Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this Agreement as
provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement shall terminate and be of no further
force or effect, and there shall be no liability on the part of Parent, the
Company, Merger Sub, or their respective officers, directors, or shareholders,
except to the extent that such liability results from the willful and knowing
breach by a party of any of its representations, warranties, covenants, or
agreements set forth in this Agreement prior to such termination; provided,
however, that the provisions of Section 5.10(b) (Confidentiality), this
Section 7.2, and Article IX shall remain in full force and effect and survive
any termination of this Agreement. A "willful and knowing breach" by a party
of a provision of this Agreement shall mean that the party knowingly undertook
an action, or failed to undertake an action, with the understanding that the
action, or the failure to act, was a breach by such party of the applicable
provisions of this Agreement.

 

Article VIII 
SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; INDEMNIFICATION

 

8.1Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants. The representations
and warranties of the Company and of Parent and Merger Sub contained in this
Agreement shall survive the consummation of the Merger and continue until the
Escrow Release Date - General

 

-89-

 



   

Indemnity. Each covenant or agreement requiring performance following the
Closing for a time period shall survive in accordance with its terms.

 

8.2Escrow Amount and Shareholders' Agents' Fund Amount Deposit.

 

(a)At the Closing, and without any act of any Company Shareholder, Parent
shall deposit the Escrow Amount with the Escrow Agent to be governed under the
terms set forth in this Agreement and in the Escrow Agreement. 

 

(b)At the Closing, and without any act of any Company Shareholder, Parent
shall deposit the Shareholders' Agent's Fund Amount into the account,
designated in writing by the Shareholders' Agent, to be held by the
Shareholders' Agent for the payment of expenses incurred by the Shareholders'
Agent in performing its duties pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement or any Shareholders' Agent's engagement agreement. The
Shareholders' Agent is not providing any investment supervision,
recommendations or advice and shall have no responsibility or liability for
any loss of principal of the Shareholders' Agent's Fund Amount other than as a
result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Shareholders' Agent
is not acting as a withholding agent or in any similar capacity in connection
with the Shareholders' Agent's Fund Amount, and has no tax reporting or income
distribution obligations hereunder. Any of the Shareholders' Agent's Fund
Amount originally deposited with the Shareholders' Agent at the Closing that
has not been used by the Shareholders' Agent pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement on the date that all amounts in the Escrow Fund have been disbursed
(such amount, if any, the "Shareholders' Agent's Fund Distribution Amount"),
less amounts reasonably determined by Shareholders' Agent as necessary to pay
Shareholders' Agent Expenses, shall be released by the Shareholders' Agent for
distribution to the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the Company Shareholders,
in proportion to their respective Pro Rata Portion of such remaining funds, if
any. If any withholding pursuant to Applicable Law is required in connection
with such payments, the Paying Agent shall effect such withholding as
necessary. None of Parent or any of its Affiliates shall have any liability
or obligation with respect to the use of the Shareholders' Agent's Fund Amount
by the Shareholders' Agent.

 

8.3Indemnification of the Parent Indemnitees. Subject to the other terms and
conditions of this Article VIII, from and after the Closing, each of Parent,
Merger Sub and their Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries) and their respective representatives (collectively, the "Parent
Indemnitees") shall, in addition to their indemnification rights under Section
5.4 (Taxes), be indemnified and held harmless from, and entitled to
reimbursement solely from the Escrow Fund for, any and all Losses incurred or
sustained by, or imposed upon, any of the Parent Indemnitees based upon,
arising out of, with respect to or by reason of:

 

(a)any Breach of any representation or warranty of the Company contained in
this Agreement (other than representations and warranties under Section 3.13
(Taxes), which are addressed in Section 5.4(d)) or any certificate delivered
by the Company pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, that any
limitation or qualification as to "materiality" or "Company Material Adverse
Effect" shall be disregarded for purposes of determining

 

-90-

 



   

whether a Breach of a representation or warranty of the Company has occurred
and in calculating any Losses arising therefrom;

 

(b)any failure by the Company or the Shareholders' Agent to perform or comply
with any covenant or agreement of the Company or the Shareholders' Agent
contained in this Agreement;

 

(c)any Transaction Expenses of the Company Group outstanding as of the Closing
to the extent not paid or satisfied by the Company at or prior to the Closing,
or if paid by Parent or Merger Sub at or prior to the Closing, to the extent
not deducted in the determination of the Closing Payment;

 

(d)any Indebtedness of the Company Group outstanding as of the Closing to the
extent not paid or satisfied by the Company at or prior to the Closing, or if
paid by Parent or Merger Sub at or prior to the Closing, to the extent not
deducted in the determination of the Closing Payment;

 

(e)any amounts paid to the Dissenting Shareholders, including any interest
required to be paid on the Dissenting Shares, that are in excess of what such
Company Shareholders would have received hereunder on their Dissenting Shares
had such Company Shareholders not been Dissenting Shareholders plus all costs
and expenses incurred by Parent in connection with the assertion of appraisal
rights by the Dissenting Shareholders; or

 

(f)directly or indirectly, any of the following matters:

 

(i)the Proceeding described in Item 6 under subsection (i) of Section 3.7(a)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule (relating to infringement allegation);

 

(ii)the matter described under subsection (ii) of Section 3.15(j) of the
Company Disclosure Schedules;

 

(iii)any of the matters described on Section 3.12(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedules; or

 

(iv)any of the matters described on Section 3.23 of the Company Disclosure
Schedules.

 

8.4Indemnification by Parent. Subject to the other terms and conditions of
this Article VIII, from and after the Closing, Parent shall be liable for, and
shall indemnify and hold harmless and defend each of each of the Company
Shareholders and their respective Representatives (collectively, the
"Shareholder Indemnitees") against, and shall hold each of them harmless from
and against, and shall pay and reimburse each of them for, any and all Losses
incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon, the Shareholder Indemnitees based
upon, arising out of, with respect to or by reason of:

 

(a)any Breach of any representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub
contained in this Agreement or any certificate delivered by the Company
pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, that any limitation or
qualification as to "materiality" shall be

 

-91-

 



   

disregarded for purposes of determining whether a Breach of representation or
warranty of Parent or Merger has occurred and in calculating any Losses
arising therefrom; or

 

(b)any failure by Parent or Merger Sub to perform or comply with any covenant
or agreement of Parent or Merger Sub contained in this Agreement.

 

8.5Certain Limitations. 

 

(a)The indemnification provided for in Section 8.3 and Section 5.4(d) shall be
subject to the following limitations:

 

(i)The Parent Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification under
Section 8.3(a) until the aggregate amount of all Losses in respect of
indemnification thereunder exceeds $2,625,000 (the "Deductible"), in which
event the Parent Indemnitees shall be indemnified from and against all such
Losses in excess of the Deductible but not an amount in excess of $2,625,000
(the "Cap").

 

(ii)The Parent Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification under
Sections 5.4(d) or Sections 8.3 for Losses that are in excess of the Escrow
Fund.

 

(iii)Parent Indemnitees must bring claims for indemnification under Section
8.3(a) or Section 5.4(d)(i) prior to the date the applicable representation or
warranty ceases to survive as provided in Section 8.1, after which time the
Parent Indemnitees will not be entitled to indemnification under that section
for a Breach of any representation or warranty that no longer survives,
provided, however, that, if a claim under Section 8.3(a) or Section 5.4(d)(i)
is brought prior to the date that the applicable representation or warranty
has ceased to survive, such claim shall survive until finally resolved. 

 

(iv)Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Deductible shall not apply to (i) any
Breach of any Company Fundamental Representations, (ii) any Breach of the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.11(b)(i) as it relates
to any of the Perry Owned Real Property, or (iii) for the avoidance of any
doubt, any claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 5.4(d) (Taxes) or
Sections 8.3(b) through 8.3(f). In addition, none of the limitations set forth
in this Section 8.5(a) shall apply to Losses based upon, arising out of, with
respect to or by reason of any Fraud by the Company or by any Company
Shareholder.

 

(b)Shareholder Indemnitees must bring claims for indemnification under Section
8.4(a) prior to the date the applicable representation or warranty ceases to
survive as provided in Section 8.1, after which time Parent will be under no
obligation to provide indemnification under that section for a Breach of any
representation or warranty that no longer survives provided, however, that, if
a claim under Section 8.4(a) is brought prior to the date that the applicable
representation or warranty has ceased to survive, such claim shall survive
until finally resolved.

 

-92-

 



   

(c)Subject to Section 8.6(b), all claims for recovery for any Loss or Losses
hereunder shall be made pursuant to and in accordance with, and be governed by
the terms of, this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, if applicable.

 

(d)The representations, warranties and covenants of the Company, and the
Parent Indemnitees' right to indemnification with respect thereto, shall not
be affected or deemed waived by reason of any investigation made by or on
behalf of the Parent Indemnitees (including by any of their representatives)
or by reason of the fact that any of the Parent Indemnitees knew or should
have known at any time that any such representation, warranty or covenant is,
was or might be inaccurate or Breached by reason of the Parent's waiver of any
condition set forth in Section 6.2(a) or Section 6.2(b), as the case may be,
or otherwise.

 

(e)The parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate, and to
not exacerbate, any Loss upon becoming aware of any event, state of facts,
circumstances or developments which would reasonably be expected to, or does,
give rise to such Loss to the extent such mitigation would be required under
Applicable Law. The Parent Indemnitees shall be deemed not to have suffered
any Loss for a particular matter to the extent the amount of the Loss for that
matter was specifically included in the determination of Final Indebtedness,
Final Company Net Working Capital or Final Transaction Expenses, with the
intent of this sentence to merely avoid "double counting" and not to limit any
recovery of Parent Indemnitees in excess of the actual amount included for the
particular matter in the determination of Final Indebtedness, Final Company
Net Working Capital or Final Transaction Expenses, as the case may be.

 

8.6Sources of Indemnification. 

 

(a)Any Losses payable to a Parent Indemnitee pursuant to an indemnification
claim arising under Section 8.3 or Section 5.4(d) shall be satisfied solely
(i) first from the Escrow Fund - General Indemnity and (ii) second, to the
extent the Escrow Fund - General Indemnity has been depleted or is otherwise
unavailable pursuant to the foregoing clause (i), then from any amounts in the
Escrow Fund - Retiree Medical. Whenever a Parent Indemnitee is entitled to be
paid any amount from the Escrow Fund pursuant to this Article VIII, each of
Parent and the Shareholders' Agent shall promptly execute and deliver to the
Escrow Agent a joint written instruction to disburse to such Parent Indemnitee
the applicable amount from the Escrow Fund. 

 

(b)Notwithstanding Section 8.6(a), Parent Indemnitees are not restricted to
the Escrow Fund with respect to any claims based on Fraud.

 

(c)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
representations and warranties made in this Agreement to Parent and Merger Sub
are only from the Company and in no event shall they be deemed representations
and warranties made by the ESOP or the ESOP Trustee.

 

8.7Determination of Loss Amount. The amount of any and all Losses under this
Article VIII and Section 5.4(d) shall be determined net of any amounts
actually recovered by the

 

-93-

 



   

Indemnified Party under insurance policies, other than the RandW Insurance
Policy, with respect to such Losses (only to the extent of such recovery and
net of all costs and expenses, including increased premiums (to the extent
identifiable) and attorney and advisor fees, incurred in connection with such
recovery).

 

8.8Exclusive Remedy. Absent Fraud, the indemnification provisions contained
in this Article VIII and Section 5.4 are the sole and exclusive remedy
following the Closing as to all Losses any Indemnified Party may incur arising
from or relating to this Agreement or the Merger (it being understood that
nothing in this Section 8.8 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall affect the
parties' rights to specific performance).

 

8.9Distribution of Escrow Fund - General Indemnity. On the Escrow Release
Date - General Indemnity, Parent and the Shareholders' Agent shall execute and
deliver to the Escrow Agent a joint written instruction to disburse any
remaining balance in the Escrow Fund - General Indemnity (the "Escrow General
Indemnity Release Amount") to the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the Company
Shareholders (excluding any amounts payable on Dissenting Shares) in
accordance with each holder's Pro Rata Portion, provided, however, that the
Escrow Fund - General Indemnity shall not terminate with respect to any amount
(and any such amount shall not be delivered to the Paying Agent), which, in
the reasonable judgment of Parent, subject to the reasonable objection of the
Shareholders' Agent and the subsequent resolution of the claim in the manner
provided in the Escrow Agreement, is necessary to satisfy any unsatisfied
claims specified in any Claim Notice (as defined in the Escrow Agreement)
delivered to the Escrow Agent and the Shareholders' Agent on or prior to the
Escrow Release Date - General Indemnity with respect to facts and
circumstances existing on or prior to the Escrow Release Date - General
Indemnity. As soon as all such claims have been resolved in the manner
described in this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, if any amounts are to be
delivered to the Company Shareholders, Parent and the Shareholders' Agent
shall execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent a joint written instruction to
deliver the remaining balance, or applicable portion thereof, of the Escrow
General Indemnity Release Amount to the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the
Company Shareholders, in accordance with such holder's Pro Rata Portion. If
any withholding pursuant to Applicable Law is required in connection with such
payments, the Paying Agent shall effect such withholding as necessary.

 

8.10Third Party Claims.

 

(a)A party making a claim for indemnification under this Article VIII shall
be, for the purposes of this Agreement, referred to as an "Indemnified Party"
and a party against whom such claims are asserted under this Article VIII
shall be, for purposes of this Agreement, referred to as an "Indemnifying
Party." For the avoidance of doubt, "Indemnifying Party" and "Indemnified
Party" includes, as applicable, the Shareholders' Agent acting in its capacity
as agent for the benefit of the Company Shareholders. In the event that an
Indemnified Party becomes aware of a Third Party claim (a "Third Party Claim")
that the Indemnified Party reasonably believes may result in a demand against
the Escrow Fund or for other indemnification pursuant to this Article VIII,
the Indemnified Party shall reasonably promptly notify the Indemnifying Party
of such claim. A failure to give notice of a Third Party Claim shall not
limit any Indemnified Party's right to indemnification hereunder, except to
the extent the defense of such claim is actually and materially prejudiced

 

-94-

 



   

thereby. The Indemnifying Party may, at its election, undertake and conduct
the defense of such Third Party Claim by providing written notice of such
election within five (5) Business Days of receipt of such notice; provided,
however, that with respect to any Third Party Claim in which any of the Parent
Indemnitees are the Indemnified Parties, the Shareholders' Agent, as the
Indemnifying Party, may only undertake and conduct the defense of the claim if
such Third Party Claim is only for monetary damages and Parent reasonably
believes that such monetary damages will not exceed the then available balance
of the Escrow Fund - General Indemnity. The assumption of the defense,
compromise and/or settlement of any Third Party Claim shall constitute an
irrevocable agreement by the Indemnifying Party that the Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnification hereunder with respect to such Third Party Claim.
If the Indemnifying Party properly assumes defense of a Third Party claim
pursuant to this Section 8.10(a), the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
participate in, but not to determine or conduct, the defense of such Third
Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party does not so timely elect or is not
allowed to undertake and conduct the defense of such Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party may undertake the defense of, and defend, such claim in its
discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Shareholders' Agent shall not
be entitled to assume or maintain control of (i) the defense of any Third
Party Claim for which any of the Parent Indemnitees are the Indemnified
Parties if the assumption of the defense by the Shareholders' Agent could
impact the coverage of such claim under the RandW Insurance Policy, (ii) any
Proceedings or other claims relating to Dissenting Shares which such matters
described in this clause (ii) will be entirely controlled by Parent or (iii)
any Tax Proceeding.

 

(b)If the Shareholders' Agent is entitled to and does assume or maintain
control of the defense of any Third Party Claim, it will not settle the Third
Party Claim without the written consent of Parent, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

 

(c)With respect to any claim for indemnification under this Article VIII, the
Indemnified Party shall provide to the Indemnifying Party such information as
is reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party in connection with the
evaluation, negotiation and defense of such claim.

 

(d)If the Indemnified Party assumes or maintains control of the defense of any
Third Party Claim pursuant to this Section 8.10, the Indemnified Party shall
keep the Indemnifying Party informed and provide such information as is
reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnifying Party
shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim at
its own cost and expense so long as such participation does not interfere with
the Indemnified Party's defense thereof.

 

8.11Tax Consequences of Indemnification Payments. Any payments made to an
Indemnified Party pursuant to any indemnification obligations under this
Article VIII or Section 5.4(d) will be treated as adjustments to the purchase
price for Tax purposes and such agreed treatment will govern for purposes of
this Agreement, unless otherwise required by Applicable Law.

 

-95-

 



   

8.12Shareholders' Agent.

 

(a)By virtue of the approval and adoption of this Agreement by the Company
Shareholders through the Required Shareholder Approval, or by virtue of
executing the Letter of Transmittal, each of the Company Shareholders (other
than Company Shareholders, if any, who have perfected appraisal rights under
the OGCA that have not been withdrawn, abandoned or delayed) shall be deemed
to have agreed to appoint Agent 186 LLC as its exclusive agent and attorney-
in-fact (the "Shareholders' Agent") for and on behalf of the Company
Shareholders to give and receive notices and communications, to perform all of
its rights and obligations with respect to the review and negotiation of the
Post-Closing Statement and Dispute Statement as described in Section 2.12 and
to authorize payment in the event of a Final Adjustment Surplus or Final
Adjustment Shortfall pursuant to Section 2.12, to authorize payment to any
Indemnified Party from the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims by any Parent
Indemnitees, to object to such payments, to agree to, negotiate, enter into
settlements and compromises of, comply with Orders with respect to such
claims, to assert, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and
comply with Orders with respect to, any other claim by any Parent Indemnitees
against any Company Shareholders, or by any such Company Shareholders against
any Parent Indemnitees or any dispute between any Parent Indemnitees and any
such Company Shareholders, in each case relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, and to take all other actions that are
either (i) necessary or appropriate in the reasonable judgment of the
Shareholders' Agent for the accomplishment of the foregoing or (ii)
specifically contemplated by the terms of this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement. Such agency may be changed and the Shareholders' Agent may be
replaced by the Company Shareholders who have the right to receive a majority
of the Escrow Fund from time to time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Shareholders' Agent may resign at any time by providing written notice of
intent to resign to the Company Shareholders and to Parent, which resignation
shall be effective upon the earlier of (A) thirty (30) days following delivery
of such written notice or (B) the appointment of a successor by the holders of
a majority in interest of the Escrow Fund. No bond shall be required of the
Shareholders' Agent. The powers, immunities and rights to indemnification
granted to the Shareholders' Agent hereunder: (i) are coupled with an interest
and shall be irrevocable and survive the death, incompetence, bankruptcy or
liquidation of any Company Shareholder and shall be binding on any successor
thereto and (ii) shall survive the delivery of an assignment by any Company
Shareholder of the whole or any fraction of his, her or its interest in the
Escrow Fund or the Shareholders' Agent Fund.

 

(b)The Shareholders' Agent shall not be liable for any act done or omitted
hereunder as the Company Shareholders' agent and attorney-in-fact while acting
in good faith, even if such act or omission constitutes negligence on the part
of the Shareholders' Agent. The Shareholders' Agent shall only have the
duties expressly stated in this Agreement and shall have no other duty,
express or implied, and for purposes of clarity, there are no obligations of
the Shareholders' Agent in any ancillary agreement, schedule, exhibit or the
Company Disclosure Schedule. The Shareholders' Agent may engage attorneys,
accountants and other professionals and experts. The Shareholders' Agent may
in good faith rely conclusively upon information, reports, statements and
opinions prepared or presented by such professionals, and any action taken by
the Shareholders' Agent based on such reliance shall be deemed conclusively to
have been taken in good faith. The Shareholders' Agent

 

-96-

 



   

shall be entitled to: (i) rely upon any signature believed by it to be genuine
and (ii) reasonably assume that a signatory has proper authorization to sign
on behalf of the applicable Company Shareholder or other party. The Company
Shareholders shall indemnify the Shareholders' Agent and defend and hold the
Shareholders' Agent harmless against any loss, liability, claim, damage, fee,
fine, judgment, amount paid in settlement or expense incurred on the part of
the Shareholders' Agent (so long as the Shareholders' Agent was acting in good
faith in connection therewith) and arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance or administration of the Shareholders' Agent's duties hereunder,
including the reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel or other
skilled professionals retained by the Shareholders' Agent and in connection
with seeking recovery from insurers ("Shareholders' Agent Expenses"). Such
Shareholders' Agent Expenses may be recovered first, from the Shareholders'
Agent's Fund Amount, second, from any distribution of the Escrow Fund
otherwise distributable to the Company Shareholders at the time of
distribution, and third, directly from the Company Shareholders, in
accordance with their Pro Rata Portion. The immunities and rights to
indemnification shall survive the resignation or removal of the Shareholders'
Agent and the Closing and/or any termination of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement. The Company Shareholders acknowledge that the Shareholders' Agent
shall not be required to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any
financial liability in the exercise or performance of any of its powers,
rights, duties or privileges or pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. A decision, act,
consent or instruction of the Shareholders' Agent, including an amendment,
extension or waiver of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.9 hereof, shall
constitute a decision of the Company Shareholders and shall be final, binding
and conclusive upon the Company Shareholders and their successors as if
expressly confirmed and ratified in writing by such Company Shareholder, and
all defenses which may be available to any Company Shareholder to contest,
negate or disaffirm the action of the Shareholders' Agent taken in good faith
under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement are waived.

9.3Entire Agreement; Nonassignability; Parties in Interest.

 

(a)This Agreement and the documents and instruments delivered pursuant hereto,
including the exhibits hereto, the Company Disclosure Schedule and the other
schedules hereto:

 

(i)together constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the

continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms and shall
survive any termination of this Agreement; and

 

(ii)shall not be assigned by Parent or Merger Sub (other than to any Affiliate

continue in full force and effect and be enforceable to the fullest extent
permitted by Applicable Law.

 

9.5Remedies Cumulative. Except as otherwise provided herein, including the
limitations described in Sections 8.3, 8.5, and 8.6, any and all remedies
herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with, and
not exclusive of, any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Applicable Law or
equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not
preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

 

9.6Governing Law, Forum.

performance as contemplated in Section 9.8, the parties agree that the
appropriate, exclusive and convenient forum (the "Forum") for any disputes
among any of the parties arising out of or related to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be in the Court of Chancery in the City
of Wilmington, New Castle County, Delaware, except where such court lacks
subject matter jurisdiction. In such event, the Forum shall be in the federal
district court sitting in Wilmington, Delaware or, in the event such federal
district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, then in the superior court
in the City of Wilmington, New Castle County, Delaware. The parties
irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of such courts solely in respect of any
disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. The parties further agree that no party shall bring suit
with respect to any disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby in any court or jurisdiction other than
the above specified courts; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not
limit the rights of any party to obtain execution of a judgment in any other
jurisdiction. The parties further agree, to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, that a final and non-appealable judgment against any party in
any action, suit or proceeding contemplated above shall be conclusive and may
be enforced in any other jurisdiction within or outside the U.S. by suit on
the judgment, a certified or exemplified copy of which shall be conclusive
evidence of the fact and amount of such judgment.

 

(c)To the extent that any party has or hereafter may acquire any immunity from
jurisdiction of any court or from any legal process (whether through service
or notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution,
execution or otherwise) with respect to itself or its property, each such
party hereby irrevocably (i) waives such immunity in respect of its
obligations with respect to this Agreement and (ii) submits to the personal
jurisdiction of each court described in Section 9.6(b).

 

(d)THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THEY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY
JURY IN ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN ANY OF THE PARTIES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 

(e)If any claims, disputes, controversies, demands, causes of action (whether
arising under state or federal statutes, equity, the common law or any other
Applicable Law), damages, claims or demands for equitable relief, or other
matters in question between Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand and the
Company on the other hand (prior to Closing) or Parent and Shareholders' Agent
(after the Closing), arise under this Agreement or arise out of the
negotiation, execution, delivery (including the fraudulent inducement
thereof), or performance of this Agreement, but specifically excluding (i)
matters relating to the determination of the Final Adjustment Shortfall or the
Final Adjustment Surplus, as the case may be, which matters will be resolved
as described in Section 2.12 and (ii) any matters of injunctive relief or
specific performance as contemplated in Section 9.8 (such claims, exclusive of
matters described in (i) and (ii), a "Triable Claim"), then prior to
commencing any Proceeding with respect to a Triable Claim, such disputes will
be identified by the aggrieved party by notice of dispute in writing to the
other party setting forth with particularity the issues responsible for the
dispute. Upon receipt of such notice, the parties will attempt in good faith
to resolve the dispute, including the participation by senior officers

of each party, for a period of not less than thirty (30) days prior to
initiating any Proceeding with respect to a Triable Claim.

 

9.7Rules of Construction.

 

(a)The parties hereto agree that they have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement have been represented by counsel
during the negotiation, preparation and execution of this Agreement and,
therefore, waive the application of any Applicable Law, holding or rule of
construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will
be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.

number shall include the plural, and vice versa; the masculine gender shall
include the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine gender shall include the
masculine and neuter genders; and the neuter gender shall include the
masculine and feminine genders.

 

(c)As used in this Agreement, (i) the words "include" and "including," and
variations thereof, shall not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather
shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation" and (ii) the
words "hereby," "herein," "hereunder" and "hereto" shall be deemed to refer to
this Agreement in its entirety and not to any specific section of this
Agreement (iii) "or" is used in the inclusive sense of "and/or"; (iv) "it" or
"its" in reference to a Person will be deemed to include individual natural
Persons; and (v) the terms "writing," "written" and words of similar import

the words "on behalf of the Company Shareholders" or "for the benefit of the

9.8Enforcement. Each of the parties hereto agrees that irreparable damage
would occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at
Applicable Law in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with their

 

-101-

 



   

specific terms or were otherwise breached, including the provisions of Section
5.14 (Acquisition Proposals). It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall
be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent Breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at Applicable Law or in equity. Each of the parties agrees that it
will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and/or
other equitable relief on the basis that any other party has an adequate
remedy at law or that any award of specific performance is not an appropriate
remedy for any reason at law or in equity. Any party seeking an injunction to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with such order or injunction.

 

9.9Amendment; Waiver. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto. Any
waiver of any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement must be in writing
and must be duly executed by or on behalf of the party to be charged with such
waiver. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, the failure of a
party to exercise any of its rights hereunder or to insist upon strict
adherence to any term or condition hereof on any one occasion shall not be
construed as a waiver or deprive that party of the right thereafter to insist
upon strict adherence to the terms and conditions of this Agreement at a later
date. Further, no waiver of any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement
shall be deemed to or shall constitute a waiver of any other term of condition
hereof (whether or not similar).

 

9.10Fees and Expenses. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, all
fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including fees and expenses of financial
advisors, legal counsel and other advisors, shall be paid by the party
incurring such expenses whether or not the Merger is consummated.

 

9.11Legal Representation. Parent, Merger Sub, and the Company hereby agree,
on their own behalf and on behalf of the Surviving Corporation and their
current and future directors, managers, equityholders, members, partners,
officers, employees and Affiliates and each of their successors and assigns
(in each case, in their capacity as such) (all such Persons, the "Waiving
Parties"), that McAfee and Taft A Professional Corporation ("MandT") (or any of
its successors) may represent the Shareholders' Agent or any Company
Shareholder, or any of their respective, direct or indirect, directors,
managers, members, partners, officers, employees, equityholders, or Affiliates
thereof (in each case in their capacity as such) (any such person, a
"Designated Person"), in connection with any dispute, litigation, claim,
proceeding, or obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the
Merger or other transactions contemplated hereby (any such representation, the
"Post-Closing Representation") notwithstanding its representation of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and each of Parent, Merger Sub, and the
Company on behalf of itself and the Waiving Parties hereby consents to such
representation and irrevocably waives (and will not assert) any conflict of
interest or any objection arising or relating to the Post-Closing
Representation. Parent, Merger Sub, and the Company each acknowledge that the
foregoing provision applies whether or not MandT provides legal services to the
Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary thereof after the Closing Date. Each
of Parent, Merger Sub, and the Company, for itself and the Waiving Parties,
hereby acknowledges and agrees that all communications prior to the Effective
Time among MandT, the Company, any

 

-102-

 



   

Subsidiary of the Company, the Shareholders' Agent and/or any Company
Shareholder and/or any director, officer, manager, member, employee, or
representative of any of the foregoing made in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and performance under, or any
dispute or proceeding arising out of or relating to, this Agreement, any
agreement entered into in connection with this Agreement, the Merger or the
transactions contemplated hereby (the "Transaction Representation"), are
privileged communications and the attorney-client privilege and the
expectation of client confidence belongs solely to the Shareholders' Agent,
and/or the applicable Company Shareholders, and shall be exclusively
controlled thereby and shall not pass to or be claimed by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, and from and after the Closing none of Parent, Merger
Sub, the Surviving Corporation, or any Subsidiary thereof or any other Person
purporting to act on behalf thereof or any of the Waiving Parties, will seek
to obtain the same by any process. Except as set forth in the next sentence,
from and after the Closing, each of Parent and the Company, on behalf of
itself and the Waiving Parties, waives and will not assert any attorney-client
privilege with respect to any communication prior to the Effective Time among
MandT, the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company, the Shareholders' Agent, or
any Company Shareholder, and/or any director, officer, manager, member,
employee, or representative of any of the foregoing in connection with the
Transaction Representation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that
a dispute arises between Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Company, or
any Subsidiary of the Company on the one hand, and a third party other than a
party to this Agreement after the Closing on the other hand, the Surviving
Corporation may assert the attorney-client privilege. Nothing in this Section
9.11 shall be construed as a waiver of any privilege controlled by Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company or the Surviving Corporation after the Closing.
Except as otherwise stated in this Section 9.11, nothing herein shall be
construed to permit MandT to communicate to any Designated Person after the
Closing any information subject to a privilege controlled by Parent, Merger
Sub or the Surviving Corporation.

 

9.12Disclosure Schedules. Matters reflected in the Company Disclosure
Schedules are not necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement to
be reflected in the Company Disclosure Schedules. To the extent any such
additional matters are included, they are included for informational purposes
and do not necessarily include other matters of a similar nature. Headings and
subheadings have been inserted in the Company Disclosure Schedules for
convenience of reference only and shall not have the effect of amending or
changing the express description thereof as set forth in this Agreement.
Disclosure of any fact or item in this Agreement or any Company Disclosure
Schedules referenced by a particular Section in this Agreement shall be deemed
to have been disclosed with respect to every other Section in this Agreement
to the extent that it is reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure
that such disclosure would apply to such other Sections. Neither the
specification of any dollar amount in the representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in any
Company Disclosure Schedules is intended to imply that such amounts, higher or
lower amounts, or the item so included or other items, are or are not material
or are within or outside the ordinary course of business, and no party shall
use the fact of the setting forth of such amounts or the fact of the inclusion
of any such item in any Company Disclosure Schedules in any dispute or
controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter
is or is not required to be disclosed (including, whether such amounts or
items are or are not material), or may constitute an event or condition which
could be considered to have a Material Adverse Effect. No matter or item
disclosed on a Company Disclosure Schedules admitting or indicating

 

-103-

 



   

a possible breach or violation of any Contract or Applicable Law shall be
construed as an admission or indication that an actual breach or violation
exists, has actually occurred or will occur. The parties do not assume any
responsibility to any Person that is not a party to this Agreement for the
accuracy of any information set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedules.
Subject to Applicable Law, the information on the Company Disclosure Schedules
is disclosed in confidence for the purposes contemplated in this Agreement and
is subject to the confidentiality provisions of any other agreements,
including the Confidentiality Agreement, entered into by the parties hereto or
their Affiliates. Moreover, in disclosing the information in the Company
Disclosure Schedules, each party expressly does not waive any attorney-client
privilege associated with such information or any protection afforded by the
work-product doctrine with respect to any of the matters disclosed or
discussed therein.
