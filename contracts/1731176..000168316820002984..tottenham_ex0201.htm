will be rounded to the nearest whole share.

Time, the Purchaser shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for
future issuance, and shall maintain such reservation for so long as any of the
Purchaser UPOs remain outstanding, a sufficient number of Purchaser Units for
delivery upon the exercise of such Purchaser UPOs and the exercise of the
Purchaser Rights included in such Purchaser UPOs.

every issued and outstanding Parent Warrant shall be converted automatically

and retired and shall cease to exist. The holders of certificates previously
evidencing Parent Warrants outstanding immediately prior to the

such Parent Warrants, except as provided herein or by Law. Each certificate
previously evidencing Parent Warrants shall be exchanged for a certificate
representing the same number of Purchaser Warrants upon the surrender of such
certificate in accordance with Section 2.7.

  



  

(f)   _Cancellation of Parent Ordinary Share Owned by Parent_.
At the Reincorporation Effective Time, if there are any shares of Parent
Ordinary Share that are owned by the Parent as treasury shares or any shares
of Parent Ordinary Share owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of the Parent immediately prior to the Reincorporation Effective
Time, such shares shall be canceled and extinguished without any conversion
thereof or payment therefor.

  



  

(g)   _Transfers of Ownership_. If any securities of Purchaser
are to be issued in a name other than that in which the
certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will be a
condition of the issuance thereof that the certificate so surrendered will be
properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer)
and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such
exchange will have paid to Purchaser or any agent designated by it any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the issuance of securities of
Purchaser in any name other than that of the registered holder of the
certificate surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of Purchaser or
any agent designated by it that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

thereof; provided, however, that Reincorporation Surviving Corporation
may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof,
require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates to deliver a
bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against the Reincorporation Surviving Corporation with
respect to the certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such

with, Section 262 of the DGCL (the "Appraisal Rights Provisions") shall not
be converted into the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration as
provided in Section 4.1(a) but instead such holder shall be entitled to
payment of the fair value of such shares in accordance with the Appraisal
Rights Provisions. At the Effective Time, all Appraisal Shares shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist,
and each holder of Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such Appraisal
Shares in accordance with the Appraisal Rights Provisions.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or
otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under the
Appraisal Rights Provisions or a court of competent jurisdiction shall
determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by the
Appraisal Rights Provisions, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair
value of such holder's Appraisal Shares under the Appraisal Rights Provisions
shall cease and each such Appraisal Share shall be deemed to have been
converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 4.1(a). The Company
shall serve prompt notice to Purchaser of any demands for appraisal of any
Company Stock, and Purchaser shall have the right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.

Article IV 
 CONSIDERATION

  

4.1   _Conversion of Capital._

  



  

(a)   _Conversion of Share_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Acquisition Merger and without any action on the part of the Purchaser,
the Merger Sub, the Company or the Shareholders of the Company, each share of
Company Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than any Excluded Shares and Appraisal Shares) shall be canceled and
automatically converted into the right to receive, without interest, (i) a
number of the Closing Payment Shares that is equal to the Exchange Ratio ("
_Closing Per Share Consideration_ "), (ii) Company Earn-out Shares, if any,
and (iii) the Per Share Escrow Payment, if any (such shares of Purchaser
Common Stock referred to in clauses (i) through (iii) collectively, the "
_Merger Consideration_ "). For avoidance of any doubt, after the Effective
Time, each Shareholder of the Company will cease to have any rights with
respect to the shares of Company Stock, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration. For the avoidance of doubt, each Shareholder's right to
receive the Company Earn-Out Shares and Per Share Escrow Payment is not
transferable (other than by operation of Laws or with the prior written
consent of the Reincorporation Surviving Corporation).

  



  

(b)   _Conversion of Company Option_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Acquisition Merger, each outstanding Company Option (whether
vested or unvested) shall be assumed by Purchaser and automatically converted
into an option to purchase a share of Purchaser Common Stock (each an "
_Assumed Option_ "). Except as otherwise provided in this Section 4.1(b),
each Assumed Option will be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in
the Company Plan and the applicable Company Option award agreement, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (except any references therein
to the Company or the Company Common Stock will instead mean the Purchaser
and the Purchaser Common Stock, respectively). As of the Effective Time, each
Assumed Option shall be an option to acquire that number of whole shares of
Purchaser Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the
product of: (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Option multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price
per one share of Purchaser Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent)
equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (a) the exercise price per one
share of Company Common Stock of such Company Option by (b) the Exchange
Ratio; provided that the exercise price and the number of shares of Purchaser
Common Stock subject to the Assumed Option shall be determined in a manner
consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and, in the case
of each Company Option that is intended to qualify as an "incentive stock
option" within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, consistent with the
requirements of Section 424 of the Code. In addition, each holder of a
Company Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will have the
right to receive, with respect to each share of Company Common Stock issuable
pursuant to the Company Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
an award pursuant to the Purchaser Equity Incentive Plan with respect to (A) a
number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock equal to the Milestone 1 Company
Earn-out Shares if Milestone 1 is achieved, (B) an additional number
of shares of Purchaser Common Stock equal to the Milestone 2 Company Earn-out
Shares if Milestone 2 is achieved, (C) an additional number of shares of
Purchaser Common Stock equal to the Milestone 3 Company Earn-out Shares if
Milestone 3 is achieved and (D) an additional number of shares of Purchaser
Common Stock equal to the Per Share Escrow Payment (if any) (such additional
shares in clauses (A) through (D) collectively, the " _Option True-up Shares_
"); provided that if the holder's employment or service with the Surviving
Corporation or its Affiliate terminates prior to the later of (1) the vesting
date of the applicable portion of the Company Option to which the applicable
Option True-up Shares relate and (2) the date that the applicable
Option True-up Shares are issued, the right of such holder to receive the
applicable Option True-up Shares will be forfeited. The Purchaser shall take
all corporate action necessary to reserve for future issuance and shall
maintain such reservation for so long as the Assumed Options remain
outstanding, a sufficient number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock for
delivery upon the exercise of such Assumed Option.

  



  



  



  



  

   

 | 18| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c)   _Share Capital of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock
of the Merger Sub that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time will, by virtue of the Acquisition Merger and without further
action on the part of the sole shareholder of Merger Sub, be converted into
and become one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation (and such
share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which the share of
common stock of the Merger Sub are so converted shall be the only share
of common stock of the Surviving Corporation that is issued and outstanding
immediately after the Effective Time).

  



  

(d)   _Treatment of Certain Company Stock_. At the Effective
Time, all shares of Company Stock that are owned by the Company (as treasury
shares or otherwise) or any of its direct or indirect Subsidiaries as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically canceled and
extinguished without any conversion or consideration delivered in exchange
thereof.

  



  

(e)   _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Section 4.1, none of Surviving Corporation or any party hereto shall
be liable to any person for any amount properly paid to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

  



  

(f)   _Surrender of Certificates_. All securities issued upon
the surrender of shares of Company Stock in accordance with the terms hereof,
shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such securities, provided that any restrictions on the sale and
transfer of such shares of Company Stock shall also apply to the Closing
Payment Shares so issued in exchange.

  



  

(g)   _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any
certificates for any shares of Company Stock shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Purchaser shall cause to be issued in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed certificates and for each such share, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof; provided, however, that
Purchaser may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance
thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates to
deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against Purchaser with respect to the certificates
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

  



  

(h)   _Adjustments_. Without limiting the other provisions of
this Agreement, if at any time during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding securities of
the Purchaser Common Stock shall occur (other than the issuance of additional
shares of capital stock of Purchaser as permitted by this Agreement),
including by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split
(including a reverse stock split), or combination, exchange, readjustment of
shares, or similar transaction, or any stock dividend or distribution paid in
stock, the Closing Payment Shares, Exchange Ratio and any other amounts
payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect
such change; provided, however, that this sentence shall not be construed to
permit Purchaser to take any action with respect to its securities that is
prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

4.2   _Payment of Merger Consideration and Exchange of
Certificates._

  



  

(a)  Prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser shall appoint a
bank, trust company or nationally recognized stockholder services provider or
such other Person reasonably acceptable to the Company as the exchange agent
(the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging certificates
representing shares of Company Stock and book-entry securities representing
the Parent Securities. Purchaser will make available to the Exchange Agent,
as needed, (i) the Merger Consideration to be delivered in respect of the
shares of Company Stock and (ii) the Purchaser Securities to be delivered in
respect of the Parent Securities. Promptly after the Effective Time,
Purchaser will send, or will cause the Exchange Agent to (A) send to each
holder of record of shares of Company Stock as of the Effective Time, a
letter of transmittal for use in such exchange (which shall specify that the
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the certificates to the Exchange Agent) in such form as
the Company and Purchaser may reasonably agree, for use in effecting delivery
of shares of Company Stock to the Exchange Agent; and (B) follow such
Exchange Agent's customary procedures with respect to securities represented
by book entry to effect the exchange of Parent Securities.

  



  

(b)  Each holder of shares of Company Stock that have been
converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration, together with a
properly completed letter of transmittal, will be entitled to receive (i) one
or more shares of Purchaser Common Stock (which shall be in non-certificated
book-entry form unless a physical certificate is required by applicable Law)
representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares of Purchaser
Common Stock, if any, that such holder has the right to receive pursuant
to Section 4.1. No interest shall be paid or accrued on any Merger
Consideration. Until so surrendered, each such certificate shall, after the
Effective Time, represent for all purposes only the right to receive such
Merger Consideration.

  



  

(c)  Each holder of Parent Securities that have been converted
into a right to receive Purchaser Securities, upon surrender to the Exchange
Agent of a book-entry security following the Exchange Agent's customary
procedures, will be entitled to receive the whole number of Purchaser
Securities that such holder has the right to receive in accordance with
Section 2.6 (which shall be in non-certificated book-entry form unless a
physical certificate required by applicable Law). Until so surrendered, each
such Parent Security shall, after the Effective Time, represent for all
purposes only the right to receive the applicable Purchaser Security.

  



  

(d)  If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be
registered in the name of a Person other than the Person in whose name the
applicable surrendered certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to
the registration thereof that the surrendered certificate shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person
requesting such delivery of the Merger Consideration shall pay to the
Exchange Agent any transfer or other similar Taxes required as a result of
such registration in the name of a Person other than the registered holder of
such Certificate or establish, to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent,
that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. Delivery of the Purchaser
Securities with respect to book-entry or non-certificated securities shall
only be made to the Person in whose name such book-entry or non-certificated
securities are registered.

  



  



  



  



  

   

 | 20| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(e)  After the Effective Time, there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Company Stock or Parent
Securities. If, after the Effective Time, certificates or book-entry
securities are presented to the Exchange Agent, the Company or the
Purchaser, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the consideration
provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in
this Article IV.

  



  

(f)  Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to
the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 4.2(a) that remains unclaimed by the
holders of shares of Company Stock one year after the Effective Time shall be
returned to Purchaser, or transferred as otherwise directed by Purchaser,
upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged his shares of Company
Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 4.2 prior
to that time shall thereafter look only to Purchaser for delivery of the
Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall not be
liable to any holder of shares for any Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property Laws. Any Merger
Consideration remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Stock three
years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to such
time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
governmental body, agency, Authority or entity) shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, become the property of Purchaser free and clear of any
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(g)   _Fractional Shares_. No certificates, scrip or other
evidence representing fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock will be
issued pursuant to the Acquisition Merger, and such fractional share interests
will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a shareholder
of the Purchaser.

  



  

4.3   _Company Earn-out Payment._

  



  

(a)  In addition to the Closing Per Share Consideration, with
respect to each share of Company Stock held by each Shareholder as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, such Shareholder shall be entitled to
receive additional shares of Purchaser Common Stock as follows (the "
_Company Earn-out Shares_ "):

  



  

(i)  3,333,333 shares of Purchaser Common Stock divided by the
Company Share Count (" _Milestone 1 Company Earn-out Shares_ ") if (A) the
VWAP of the shares of Purchaser Common Stock equals or exceeds $15.00 (or any
foreign currency equivalent) (the " _Milestone 1 Price_ ") in any twenty
trading days within a thirty trading day period within the three years
following the Closing Date on any securities exchange or securities market on
which the shares of Purchaser Common Stock are then traded or (B) the
Change of Control Price equals or exceeds the Milestone 1 Price if a Change
of Control Transaction occurs within the three years following the Closing
Date (the requirement set forth in clause (A) or (B), " _Milestone 1_ ");

") if (A) the VWAP of the shares of Purchaser Common Stock equals or exceeds
$20.00 (or any foreign currency equivalent) (the " _Milestone 2 Price_ ") in
any twenty trading days within a thirty trading day period within the five
years following the Closing Date on any securities exchange or securities
market on which shares of Purchaser Common Stock are then traded or (B) the
Change of Control Price equals or exceeds the Milestone 2 Price if a Change of
Control Transaction occurs within the five years following the Closing Date
(the requirement set forth in clause (A) or (B), " _Milestone 2_ "); and

  



  

(iii)  An additional 2,500,000 shares of Purchaser Common Stock
divided by the Company Share Count (the " _Milestone 3 Company Earn-out
Shares_ ") if the Company completes a randomized placebo-controlled study for
treatment of COVID-19 which results in a statistically significant finding of
clinical efficacy within twelve (12) months of the Closing Date ("
_Milestone 3_ ").

  



  

(b)  If Milestone 1 is not achieved but Milestone 2 is achieved,
the Shareholders shall receive the Milestone 1 Company Earn-out Shares as
well as the Milestone 2 Company Earn-out Shares upon satisfaction of the
requirements of Milestone 2.

  



  

(c)  The Company Earn-out Shares shall be issued by the
Purchaser within twenty (20) Business Days after the satisfaction of the
requirements as set forth in this Section 4.3.

  



  

(d)  All shares and per share amounts in this Section 4.3 shall
be appropriately adjusted to reflect splits, subdivisions, share dividends
and similar events subsequent to the Closing Date.

  



  

4.4   _Initial Shareholders ' Earn-out. _

  



  

(a)  The Initial Shareholders shall be entitled to receive
additional shares of Purchaser Common Stock as follows (the "

Initial Shareholders Earn-out Shares_ ") upon satisfaction of the
requirements of Milestone 1.

Initial Shareholders Earn-out Shares_ ") upon satisfaction of the
requirements of Milestone 2.

representations and warranties are made with respect to a certain date, as of
such date). The parties hereto agree that any reference in a particular
Section in the disclosure Schedules delivered by the Company to the
Purchaser Parties (the " _Company Disclosure Schedules_ ") shall be deemed to
be an exception to the representations and warranties of the Company that are
contained in the corresponding Section of this Article V; provided that where
it is apparent on the face of a disclosure under a particular Section of any
Schedule that such disclosure is, or may be reasonably determined to be,
relevant to the matters described under any other Sections of this Agreement,
such disclosure shall also be deemed to be relevant to such other Sections.
For the avoidance of doubt, unless the context otherwise required, the below

otherwise, and all governmental licenses, franchises, Permits, authorizations,
consents and approvals necessary and required to own and operate its

aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each member of the Company
Group is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in good standing in
each jurisdiction in which the properties owned or leased by it or the
operation of its Business as currently conducted makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed,

Additional Agreements to which the Company is a party will constitute, a valid
and legally binding agreement of the Company enforceable against the Company
in accordance with their respective terms subject to Creditors' Rights.

other action necessary or advisable to secure the approval of the Parent
Stockholder Approval Matters. If on the date for which the Parent Special
Meeting is scheduled, Parent has not received proxies representing a

Parent may make one or more successive postponements or adjournments of the
Parent Special Meeting; provided that the Parent Special Meeting may not be
postponed or adjourned by an aggregate of ten (10) Business Days without the
Company's prior written consent. In connection with the Registration

or supplements thereto, which information provided by the Parent shall be true
and correct and not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made not
materially misleading. The Purchaser will use all commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Registration Statement to be declared effective under

cause each of its subsidiaries to, make their respective directors, officers
and employees, upon reasonable advance notice, available, at a
reasonable time and location, to the Company Group, the Purchaser, Parent and
their respective representatives in connection with the drafting of the
public filings with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Registration Statement, and responding in a timely
manner to comments from the SEC. Each party shall promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Registration Statement (and other
related materials) if and to the extent that such information is determined to
have become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise
required by applicable Laws. Purchaser shall amend or supplement
the Registration Statement for any such corrections and cause the
Registration Statement, as so amended or supplemented, to be filed with the
SEC.

  



  

(e)  As soon as practicable following the Registration Statement
"clearing" comments from the SEC and being declared effective by the SEC,
Parent shall distribute the Proxy Statement to Parent's stockholders, and,
pursuant thereto, shall call the Parent Special Meeting in accordance with
BVI Law for a date no later than thirty (30) days following the
effectiveness of the Registration Statement.

  



  

9.6   _Confidentiality._ Except as necessary to complete the
Proxy Statement and Registration Statement, the Company Group, on the one
hand, and the Purchaser Parties, on the other hand, shall hold and shall cause
their respective representatives to hold in strict confidence, unless
compelled to disclose by judicial or administrative process or by other
requirements of Law, all documents and information concerning the other party
furnished to it by such other party or its representatives in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (except to the extent that
such information can be shown to have been (a) previously known by the party
to which it was furnished, (b) in the public domain through no fault of such
party or (c) later lawfully acquired from other sources on a non-confidential
basis, which source is not the agent of the other party, by the party to
which it was furnished, without any breach by such source of any obligation of
confidentiality to the other party), and each party shall not release or
disclose such information to any other person, except its representatives in
connection with this Agreement. In the event that any party is required to
disclose any such confidential information pursuant to applicable Laws, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, such party shall give timely written
notice to the other parties so that such parties may have an opportunity to
obtain a protective order or other appropriate relief, and such party shall
only disclose the minimum amount of such confidential information so required
to be disclosed. For the avoidance of doubt, the obligations set forth in this
Section 9.6 shall not limit any obligation with respect to any confidential
information of any party under any existing confidentiality agreements.

Article XI 
 INDEMNIFICATION

  



  

11.1   _Indemnification of the Purchaser._ Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Article XI and from and after the Closing Date, the
Shareholders (the "Indemnifying Parties") hereby jointly and severally, solely
out of the Escrow Shares, agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser
(the "Indemnified Party"), against and in respect of any and all out-of-
pocket loss, cost, payment, penalty, expense, liability, judgment or damage
(including reasonable, actual costs of investigation and reasonable
attorneys' fees but excluding any exemplary, punitive or special damages) (all
of the foregoing collectively, "Losses") incurred or sustained by the
Indemnified Party as a result of or in connection with any breach, inaccuracy
or nonfulfillment of any of the representations, warranties and pre-Closing
covenants of the Company contained herein.

  



  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Indemnified Party shall not assert any
claim, and shall not be entitled to indemnification, unless and until the
aggregate amount of all Losses indemnifiable hereunder exceeds an amount equal
to $1,000,000 (the "Threshold"), in which event the Indemnifying Parties
shall be responsible for the aggregate amount of all Losses from the first
dollar, regardless of the Threshold, and (ii) any liability incurred pursuant
to the terms of this Article XI shall be paid exclusively from the
Escrow Shares, valued at the then market value per share and in accordance
with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

  



  

11.2   _Procedure. The following shall apply with respect to all
claims by the Indemnified Party for indemnification:_

  



  

(a)  The Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Parties
prompt notice (an " _Indemnification Notice_ ") of any third-party action
with respect to which the Indemnified Party seeks indemnification pursuant to
Sections 11.1 or 11.2 (a " _Third-Party Claim_ "), which shall describe in
reasonable detail the Loss that has been or may be suffered by the
Indemnified Party. The failure to give the Indemnification Notice shall not
impair any of the rights or benefits of such Indemnified Party under Sections
11.1 or 11.2, except to the extent such failure materially and adversely
affects the ability of the Indemnifying Parties to defend such claim or
increases the amount of such liability.

  



  

(b)  In the case of any Third-Party Claims as to which
indemnification is sought by the Indemnified Party, such Indemnified
Party shall be entitled, at the sole expense and liability of the
Indemnifying Parties, to exercise full control of the defense, compromise or
settlement of any Third-Party Claim unless the Indemnifying Parties, within a
reasonable time after the giving of an Indemnification Notice by the
Indemnified Party (but in any event within ten (10) days thereafter), shall
(i) deliver a written confirmation to such Indemnified Party that the
indemnification provisions of Sections 11.1 or 11.2 are applicable to such
action and the Indemnifying Parties will indemnify such Indemnified Party in
respect of such action pursuant to the terms of Sections 11.1 or 11.2 and,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary, shall do so without asserting any
challenge, defense, limitation on the Indemnifying Parties liability for
Losses, counterclaim or offset, (ii) notify such Indemnified Party in writing
of the intention of the Indemnifying Parties to assume the defense thereof,
and (iii) retain legal counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified
Party to conduct the defense of such Third-Party Claim.

  



  



  



  



  

   

 | 66| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  



  

(c)  If the Indemnifying Parties assume the defense of any such
Third-Party Claim pursuant to Section 11.3(b), then the Indemnified Party
shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Parties in any manner reasonably
requested in connection with the defense, and the Indemnified Party shall
have the right to be kept fully informed by the Indemnifying Parties and their
legal counsel with respect to the status of any legal proceedings, to the
extent not inconsistent with the preservation of attorney-client or work
product privilege. If the Indemnifying Parties so assume the defense of any
such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ
separate counsel and to participate in (but not control) the defense,
compromise, or settlement thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel
employed by the Indemnified Party shall be at the expense of such Indemnified
Party unless (i) the Indemnifying Parties have agreed to pay such fees and
expenses, or (ii) the named parties to any such Third-Party Claim
(including any impleaded parties) include an Indemnified Party and an
Indemnifying Party and such Indemnified Party shall have been advised by its
counsel that there may be a conflict of interest between such Indemnified
Party and the Indemnifying Parties in the conduct of the defense thereof, and
in any such case the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel
shall be borne by the Indemnifying Parties.

  



  

(d)  If the Indemnifying Parties elect to assume the defense of
any Third-Party Claim pursuant to Section 11.3(b), the Indemnified Party
shall not pay, or permit to be paid, any part of any claim or demand arising
from such asserted liability unless the Indemnifying Parties withdraw from or
fail to vigorously prosecute the defense of such asserted liability, or unless
a judgment is entered against the Indemnified Party for such liability. If
the Indemnifying Parties do not elect to defend, or if, after commencing or
undertaking any such defense, the Indemnifying Parties fail to adequately
prosecute or withdraw such defense, the Indemnified Party shall have the
right to undertake the defense or settlement thereof, at the Indemnifying
Parties' expense. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Indemnifying
Parties shall not be entitled to control, but may participate in, and the
Indemnified Party (at the expense of the Indemnifying Parties) shall be
entitled to have sole control over, the defense or settlement of (x) that
part of any Third-Party Claim (i) that seeks a temporary restraining order, a
preliminary or permanent injunction or specific performance against the
Indemnified Party, or (ii) to the extent such Third-Party Claim involves
criminal allegations against the Indemnified Party or (y) the entire Third-
Party Claim if such Third-Party Claim would impose liability on the part of
the Indemnified Party in an amount which is greater than the amount as to
which the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement. In the event the Indemnified Party retains control of the Third-
Party Claim, the Indemnified Party will not settle the subject claim without
the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  



  

(e)  If the Indemnified Party undertakes the defense of any such
Third-Party Claim pursuant to Sections 11.1 and 11.2 and proposes to settle
the same prior to a final judgment thereon or to forgo appeal with respect
thereto, then the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Parties
prompt written notice thereof and the Indemnifying Parties shall have the
right to participate in the settlement, assume or reassume the defense
thereof or prosecute such appeal, in each case at the Indemnifying
Parties' expense. The Indemnifying Parties shall not, without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party settle or compromise or consent to
entry of any judgment with respect to any such Third-Party Claim (i) in which
any relief other than the payment of money damages is or may be sought
against the Indemnified Party, (ii) in which such Third-Party Claim could be
reasonably expected to impose or create a monetary liability on the part of
the Indemnified Party (such as an increase in the Indemnified Party's income
Tax) other than the monetary claim of the third party in such Third-Party
Claim being paid pursuant to such settlement or judgment, or (iii) which does
not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant,
person conducting such investigation or initiating such hearing, plaintiff or
petitioner to the Indemnified Party of a release from all liability with
respect to such Third-Party Claim and all other actions (known or unknown)
arising or which might arise out of the same facts.

11.3   _Escrow of Escrow Shares by Shareholders._ The Company, the
Shareholders and the Shareholders' Representative hereby authorize the
Purchaser to issue the Escrow Shares to the Escrow Agent to hold in escrow
(the "Escrow Fund") pursuant to the Escrow Agreement.

  



  

(a)   _Escrow Shares; Payment of Dividends; Voting_. Any
dividends, interest payments, or other distributions of any kind made in
respect of the Escrow Shares (the " _Escrow Distributions_ ") will be
delivered promptly to the Escrow Agent to be held in escrow. The Shareholders
shall be entitled to vote the Escrow Shares on any matters to come before the
shareholders of the Purchaser.

  



  

(b)   _Distribution of Escrow Shares_. At the times provided for
in Section 11.3(d), the Escrow Shares shall be released and transferred by
the Escrow Agent to the Exchange Agent for distribution to the Shareholders.
The Purchaser will take such action as may be necessary to cause such
securities to be issued in the names of the appropriate persons. Certificates
representing Escrow Shares so issued that are subject to resale restrictions
under applicable securities laws will bear a legend to that effect.
No fractional shares shall be released and delivered from the Escrow Fund to
the Shareholders and all fractional shares shall be rounded to the nearest
whole share.

  



  

(c)   _Assignability_. No Escrow Shares or any beneficial
interest therein may be pledged, sold, assigned or transferred, including by
operation of law, by the Shareholders or be taken or reached by any legal or
equitable process in satisfaction of any debt or other liability of the
Shareholders, prior to the transfer and delivery to such Shareholders by the
Exchange Agent of the Escrow Fund by the Escrow Agent as provided herein.

  



  

(d)   _Release from Escrow Fund_. Within five (5) business days
following expiration of the Survival Period (the " _Release Date_ "), the
Escrow Shares and any Escrow Distributions, less the number or amount of
Escrow Shares (valued at the VWAP of the shares of Purchaser Common Stock for
the period of twenty trading days ending at the close of business on the
Release Date (or if the Release Date is not a trading day, the close of
business on the first trading day after the Release Date)) equal to the
amount of any potential Losses set forth in any Indemnification Notice
delivered pursuant to the terms of Article XI from the Purchaser with respect
to any pending but unresolved claim for indemnification, will be released from
escrow to the Shareholders as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Prior to the Release Date, the Shareholders' Representative shall issue
to the Escrow Agent a certificate executed by it (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld) instructing the Escrow Agent to release such number of
Escrow Shares determined in accordance with this Section 11.3(d). Any Escrow
Shares retained in escrow as a result of the immediately preceding sentence
shall be released and transferred to the Exchange Agent for distribution to
the Shareholders promptly upon resolution of the related claim for
indemnification in accordance with the provisions of this Article XI.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any
indemnification payments will be made to Purchaser or its successors. Any
Escrow Shares received by Purchaser as an indemnification payment shall be
promptly cancelled by Purchaser after its receipt thereof.

  



  



  



  

   

 | 68| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  



  

11.4   _Payment of Indemnification._ In the event that the Purchaser
is entitled to any indemnification pursuant to this Article XI, the
Purchaser's sole and exclusive remedy is payment from the Escrow Shares.

  



  

11.5   _Insurance._ Any indemnification payments hereunder shall be
reduced by insurance proceeds or other third party reimbursement actually
received.

  



  

11.6   _Survival of Indemnification Rights._ All representations and
warranties and covenants of the Company contained in this Agreement
(including all schedules and exhibits hereto and all certificates, documents,
instruments and undertaking furnished pursuant to this Agreement) shall
survive until six (6) months following the Closing (the "Survival Period").
After the expiration of the Survival Period, the Indemnifying Parties shall
have no further liability for indemnification pursuant to this Article XI
other than with respect to the claims already made pursuant to this Article
XI.

  



  

11.7   _Sole and Exclusive Remedy._ The remedies provided in this
Article XI shall be deemed the sole and exclusive remedies of the Indemnified
Party, from and after the Closing Date, with respect to any and all claims
arising out of or related to this Agreement or in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby.

(b)  This Agreement may be terminated and the transactions
contemplated hereby may be abandoned at any time prior to the Closing by
written notice by either Parent or the Company if any Legal Restraint
permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions

14.2   _Amendments; No Waivers; Remedies._

  



  

(a)  This Agreement cannot be amended, supplemented or modified,
except by a writing signed by each of the Purchaser Parties (prior to the
Reincorporation Effective Time), the Company and the Shareholders'
Representative and cannot be amended, supplemented or modified orally or by
course of conduct. No provision hereof can be waived, except by a writing

 | 73| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  



  

(b)  Neither any failure or delay in exercising any right or
remedy hereunder or in requiring satisfaction of any condition herein nor any
course of dealing shall constitute a waiver of or prevent any party from
enforcing any right or remedy or from requiring satisfaction of any
condition. No notice to or demand on a party waives or otherwise affects any
obligation of that party or impairs any right of the party giving such notice
or making such demand, including any right to take any action without notice
or demand not otherwise required by this Agreement. No exercise of any right
or remedy with respect to a breach of this Agreement shall preclude exercise
of any other right or remedy, as appropriate to make the aggrieved party whole
with respect to such breach, or subsequent exercise of any right or remedy
with respect to any other breach.

  



  

(c)  Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, no statement
herein of any right or remedy shall impair any other right or remedy stated
herein or that otherwise may be available.

  



  

(d)  Notwithstanding anything else contained herein, neither
shall any party seek, nor shall any party be liable for, punitive or
exemplary damages, under any tort, contract, equity, or other legal theory,
with respect to any breach (or alleged breach) of this Agreement or any
provision hereof or any matter otherwise based upon this Agreement, relating
hereto or arising in connection herewith.

  



  

14.3   _Arm 's Length Bargaining; No Presumption Against Drafter._
This Agreement has been negotiated at arm's-length by parties of equal
bargaining strength, each represented by counsel or having had but declined
the opportunity to be represented by counsel and having participated in the
drafting of this Agreement. This Agreement creates no fiduciary or other
special relationship between the parties, and no such relationship otherwise
exists. No presumption in favor of or against any party in the
construction or interpretation of this Agreement or any provision hereof
shall be made based upon which Person might have drafted this Agreement or
such provision.

  



  

14.4   _Publicity._ Except as required by law and except with respect
to the Parent SEC Documents, the parties agree that neither they nor their
agents shall issue any press release or make any other public disclosure
concerning the transactions contemplated hereunder without the prior approval
of the other party hereto. If a party is required to make such a disclosure as
required by law, the Purchaser Parties or the Company (as applicable) will be
afforded a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such press release
or public announcement prior to its issuance. The foregoing shall not prohibit
disclosure made in connection with the enforcement of any right or remedy
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

14.5   _Expenses._ Unless otherwise specified herein, each party
shall bear its own costs and expenses in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ that if the Closing is
consummated, the Purchaser shall bear all expenses in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

14.6   _No Assignment or Delegation._ No party may assign any right
or delegate any obligation hereunder, including by merger, consolidation,
operation of law, or otherwise, without the written consent of the other
parties hereto; provided, that such assignment shall not prevent or impede
the Acquisition Merger from qualifying for the Intended Tax Treatment. Any
purported assignment or delegation that does not comply with the immediately
preceding sentence shall be void, in addition to constituting a
material breach of this Agreement.

substantive and procedural) of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to
the conflict of laws principles thereof.

  



  

14.8   _Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures._ This Agreement may be
executed in counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original, but all
of which shall constitute one agreement. This Agreement shall become effective
upon delivery to each party of an executed counterpart or the earlier
delivery to each party of original, photocopied, or electronically transmitted
signature pages that together (but need not individually) bear the signatures
of all other parties.

  



  

14.9   _Entire Agreement._ This Agreement together with the
Additional Agreements, including any exhibits and Schedules attached hereto
or thereto, sets forth the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior and
contemporaneous understandings and agreements related thereto (whether written
or oral), all of which are merged herein. No provision of this Agreement or
any Additional Agreement, including any exhibits and Schedules attached hereto
or thereto, may be explained or qualified by any agreement, negotiations,
understanding, discussion, conduct or course of conduct. Except as otherwise
expressly stated herein or any Additional Agreement, there is no condition
precedent to the effectiveness of any provision hereof or thereof. No party
has relied on any representation from, or warranty or agreement of, any person
in entering into this Agreement, prior hereto or contemporaneous herewith or
any Additional Agreement, except those expressly stated herein or therein.

  



  

14.10   _Severability._ A determination by a court or other legal
Authority that any provision that is not of the essence of this Agreement is
legally invalid shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other
provision hereof. The parties shall cooperate in good faith to substitute (or
cause such court or other legal Authority to substitute) for any provision
so held to be invalid a valid provision, as alike in substance to such
invalid provision as is lawful.

Shareholders' Representative nor its members, managers, directors, officers,
contractors, agents and employees nor any member of the Advisory Group

expenses and liabilities which may be incurred by the Shareholders'
Representative in performing such actions. A decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Shareholders' Representative under this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement or the Shareholders' Representative Engagement Agreement
shall, for all purposes hereunder, constitute a decision, act, consent or
instruction of all of the stockholders of the Company Group and shall be
final, binding and conclusive upon each of the Shareholders and their
successors as if expressly confirmed and ratified in writing by the
Shareholders, and all defenses which may be available to any Shareholder to
contest, negate or disaffirm the action of the Shareholders' Representative
taken in good faith under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the
Shareholders' Representative Engagement Agreement are waived. The powers,
immunities and rights to indemnification granted to the Shareholders'
Representative Group hereunder: (i) are coupled with an interest and shall be
irrevocable and survive the death, incompetence, bankruptcy or liquidation of
any Shareholder and shall be binding on any successor thereto, and (ii) shall
survive the delivery of an assignment by any Shareholder of the whole or any
fraction of his, her or its interest in the Escrow Fund or the Company Earn-
out Shares. The Shareholders' Representative shall be entitled to: (i) rely
upon the consideration spreadsheet provided to the Shareholders'
Representative by the Company, (ii) rely upon any signature believed by it to
be genuine, and (iii) reasonably assume that a signatory has proper
authorization to sign on behalf of the applicable Shareholder or other party.
