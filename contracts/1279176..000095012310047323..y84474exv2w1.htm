of the cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock was
not separately bargained-for consideration but merely represents a mechanical rounding off

respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder or for recognition and
enforcement of any judgment in respect hereof brought by the other party hereto or its successors
or assigns shall be brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any
state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery
declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the
State of Delaware). Each of the parties hereby irrevocably submit, for itself and in respect to
its properties, generally and unconditionally, to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the
aforesaid courts in respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this
Agreement and of the documents referred to in this Agreement, and in respect of the transactions
contemplated hereby. The parties hereby consent to and grant any such court jurisdiction over the
person of such parties and, to the extent permitted by Law, over the subject matter of such dispute
and agree that mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such action or proceeding
in the manner provided in <U>Section&nbsp;10.8</U> or in such other manner as may be permitted by Law
shall be valid and sufficient service thereof. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably waives, and
agrees not to attempt to assert or assert, by way of motion or other request for leave from any
such a Delaware state or federal court, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action,
suit or proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement hereof or of any such document, (i)&nbsp;the
defense of sovereign immunity, (ii)&nbsp;any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction
of the above-named courts for any reason other than the failure to serve process in accordance with
this <U>Section&nbsp;10.7</U>, (iii)&nbsp;that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of
any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of
notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of
judgment or otherwise), and (iv)&nbsp;to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law that (A)&nbsp;the
suit, action or proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (B)&nbsp;the suit,
action or proceeding is not maintainable in such court, (C)&nbsp;the venue of such suit, action or
proceeding is improper or inappropriate and (D)&nbsp;this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may
not be enforced in or by such courts. Each of the parties to this Agreement irrevocably agree that
all claims with respect to such action or proceeding shall be heard and determined in such a
Delaware state or federal court. The parties agree that a final judgment in any such action or
proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by applicable Law.
