ARTICLE IV 

   

MERGER CONSIDERATION; CONVERSION OR CANCELLATION OF SHARES IN THE MERGER 

  

 4.1 _Share Consideration for the Merger; Conversion or Cancellation of Shares in the Merger_. __ 

  

 (a) _Merger Consideration_. 

   

 (i) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the holders of any shares of Company Capital Stock or the holders of any capital stock of Merger Sub, each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares (as defined in  _Section 4.1(c)_) and Dissenting Shares (as defined in _Section 4.1(e)_) shall, by virtue of the Merger, be converted into the right to receive, pursuant to _Section 4.2_ , upon the surrender of the certificates evidencing the Company Common Stock (or evidence of shares in book entry form), the Parent Stock Consideration, the Cash Consideration and, if any, the Parent Dividend Consideration (together, the " _Merger Consideration_ "), without interest thereon, and such shares of Company Common Stock (or evidence of shares in book entry form) shall be automatically cancelled and extinguished, in accordance with _Section 4.2_. Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to  _Section 7.1(c)_, if prior to the Effective Time the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares, and, in each such case, the record date for such transaction is between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, then any number or amount contained herein that is based upon the number of shares of Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock, as the case may be, will be appropriately adjusted to provide to Parent and the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. As provided in _Section 4.4_ , the right of any holder of Company Common Stock to receive the Merger Consideration shall be subject to and reduced by the amount of any withholding under applicable Tax Law. 

   

 (ii) _Definitions_. For purposes hereof, the following terms have the following respective meanings: 

   ##### 

  

   

" _Cash Consideration_ " means an amount per share of Company Common Stock in
cash equal to $9.00. 

   

" _Conversion Ratio_ " shall equal $8.10 divided by the Parent Trading Price
and rounded to four decimal places; provided, however, that if the Parent
Trading Price is greater than $38.00, then the Conversion Ratio shall equal
0.2132, and if the Parent Trading Price is less than $34.00, then
the Conversion Ratio shall equal 0.2382. 

   

" _Parent Stock Consideration_ " means a fraction of a fully paid
and nonassessable share of Parent Common Stock equal to the Conversion
Ratio. 

   

" _Parent Trading Price"_ means the average of the reported closing sale
prices per share of Parent Common Stock on NASDAQ as reported in The Wall
Street Journal for the five (5) consecutive trading days ending on
(and including) the second trading day prior to the consummation of the
Merger. 

  

 (b) _No Fractional Shares_. 

   

 (i) No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder of shares of Company Common Stock otherwise entitled to a fractional share of Parent Common Stock will be entitled to receive, from the Exchange Agent in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 4.1(b)_, a cash payment in lieu of such fractional share of Parent Common Stock representing such holders proportionate interest, if any, in the proceeds from the sale by the Exchange Agent (reduced by any fees of the Exchange Agent attributable to such sale) in one or more transactions of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the excess of (A) the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be delivered to the Exchange Agent by Parent pursuant to _Section 4.2(a)_ over (B) the aggregate number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock to be distributed to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to _Section 4.2(b)_ (such excess, the " _Excess Shares_ "). The parties acknowledge that payment of the cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock was not separately bargained-for consideration but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Parent that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent, as agent for the holders of shares of Company Common Stock that would otherwise receive fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, shall sell the Excess Shares at then prevailing prices on NASDAQ in the manner provided in the following paragraph. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (ii) The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent, as agent for the holders of shares of Company Common Stock that would otherwise receive fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, shall be executed on the NASDAQ through one or more member firms of the NASDAQ and shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable. Until the proceeds of such sale or sales have been distributed to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall hold such proceeds in trust for the holders of shares of Company Common Stock that would otherwise receive fractional shares of Parent Common Stock (the " _Common Shares Trust_ "). The Exchange Agent shall determine the portion of the Common Shares Trust to which each holder of shares of Company Common Stock shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount of the aggregate proceeds comprising the Common Shares Trust by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional share interest to which such holder of shares of Company Common Stock would otherwise be entitled and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional share interests to which all holders of shares of Company Common Stock would otherwise be entitled. 

   

 (iii) As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of shares of Company Common Stock in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall make available such amounts to such holders of shares of Parent Common Stock without interest, subject to and in accordance with  _Section 4.2_. 

  

 (c) At the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding and owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, or held in the treasury of the Company or owned by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Excluded Shares_ ") shall cease to be outstanding, and shall be automatically cancelled and retired without payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist. 

  

 (d) At the Effective Time, each share of Merger Sub Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into a share of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (e) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has properly exercised and perfected his or her demand for appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but the holders of such Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive such consideration as shall be determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL;  _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost his or her right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL, such holders shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, and such shares shall not be deemed to be Dissenting Shares. The Company 

   ##### 

  

 

shall serve prompt written notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal,
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL received by the Company in respect of any shares of
Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to the exercise
of appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent,
make any payment with respect to, settle or offer to settle or waive any
failure to timely deliver a written demand with respect to, any such exercise
of appraisal rights, or agree to do any of the foregoing. 

   

 4.2 _Exchange of Stock Certificates_. Certificates (or evidence of shares in book entry form) for shares of Company Common Stock shall be exchanged for certificates (or evidence of shares in book entry form) evidencing the Parent Stock Consideration and for the Cash Consideration in accordance with the following procedures: 

  

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an agent reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as exchange agent under this Agreement (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") and who shall serve pursuant to an agreement between Parent and the Exchange Agent (the " _Exchange Agent Agreement_ "). Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock, (i) certificates (or evidence of shares in book entry form) representing, as nearly as practicable, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock into which all shares of Company Common Stock are to be converted in the Merger and (ii) an amount in cash equal to the Cash Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock to be converted in the Merger. 

  

 (b) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later than five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of Company Common Stock a form of letter of transmittal (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions (including customary provisions with respect to delivery of an "agents message" with respect to shares held in book-entry form) as Parent may specify, subject to the Companys reasonable approval), together with instructions thereto. Upon (i) in the case of shares of Company Common Stock represented by a certificate, the surrender of such certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, or (ii) in the case of shares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form, the receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent, in each case together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly, completely and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such shares shall be entitled to receive (and the Exchange Agent shall deliver) (A) certificates (or electronic equivalents) representing the number of shares of Parent Common Stock into which such shares of Company Common Stock shall have been converted in the Merger, and (B) a bank check for an amount equal to the Cash Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock to be converted _plus_ any cash due in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 4.1(b)_. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) No dividends or other distributions with respect to securities of Parent constituting part of the Merger Consideration, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with the procedure described in _Section 4.2(b)_, shall be paid to the holder of any certificates (or electronic equivalents) for Company Common Stock not surrendered until such certificates (or electronic equivalents) for Company Common Stock are surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, as provided in this _Section 4.2_. Following such surrender or transfer, there shall be paid, without interest, to the Person in whose name the Parent Common Stock has been registered, (i) at the time of such surrender or transfer, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares to which such Person is entitled pursuant to _Section 4.2(b)_, and the amount of all dividends or other distributions with a record date after the date hereof and on or prior to the Effective Time previously paid or payable on the date of such surrender with respect to such securities, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and prior to surrender or transfer and with a payment date subsequent to surrender or transfer payable with respect to such securities. With respect to clause (ii), such dividends and distributions shall be in addition to the Parent Dividend Consideration included as part of the Merger Consideration. 

  

 (d) In no event shall the holder of any surrendered certificates (or evidence of shares in book entry form) be entitled to receive interest on any of the Cash Consideration to be received in the Merger. 

  

 (e) If any certificate (or electronic equivalents) for such Parent Common Stock or check for the Cash Consideration is to be issued in the name of a Person other than the Person in whose name the certificates (or electronic equivalents) surrendered for exchange therefor are registered, it shall be a condition of the exchange that the certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer, and that the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required by reason of issuance of such check to a Person other than the registered holder of the certificates (or electronic equivalents) surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. 

  

 (f) If for any reason (including losses) the Exchange Agent shall not have sufficient funds or Parent Common Stock to pay the amounts to which holders of Company Common Stock are entitled under this _Article IV_, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall take all steps necessary to promptly deposit with the Exchange Agent additional cash and shares of Parent Common Stock sufficient to make all payments required under this _Article IV_. Any funds deposited with the Exchange Agent (including any interest received with respect thereto) that remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holder of Company Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with this _Article IV_ shall thereafter look only to Parent and Surviving Corporation for payment of its claim for Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends and distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this _Article IV_, in each case without any interest thereon. 

   ##### 

   

  

 (g) If any certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such amount as Parent or the Exchange Agent may reasonably direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such certificate, Parent shall direct the Exchange Agent to issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such certificate, as contemplated by this _Article IV_. 

  

 (h) None of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any shares of Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund, in each case, properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and any dividends or distributions remaining unclaimed as of a date which is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat or become property of any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interests of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

  

 (i) The Exchange Agent shall invest any of the funds deposited with the Exchange Agent as directed by Parent. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent. 

  

 (j) Except for the right to surrender of the certificate(s) (or evidence of shares in book entry form) representing the Company Common Stock in exchange for the right to receive the Merger Consideration with respect to each share of Company Common Stock and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, all shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist at the Effective Time and each holder of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights as a stockholder of the Company, and no transfer of Company Common Stock shall thereafter be made on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 4.3 _Stock Options; Restricted Stock; Restricted Stock Units_. 

  

 (a) Except as may be agreed upon by Parent and any of the individuals set forth in  _Section 7.8(e)_ of the separate disclosure letter delivered by the Company to Parent at or prior to the execution of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ "), each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock granted under any equity compensation plan or arrangement of the Company and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a " _Company Option_ "), whether or not exercisable or vested, shall be canceled at the Effective Time in exchange for a payment, in cash, equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the sum of (A) the Cash Consideration and (B) the cash value of the average of the per share closing prices for 

   ##### 

     

 

Parent Common Stock, calculated to two decimal places, for the ten (10)
consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date that is two (2) days
before the Effective Time, as reported on NASDAQ (such average, the " _Parent
Stock Price_ ") multiplied by the Conversion Ratio (such amount, the "

 (c) Except as set forth on Section 5.10(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter, no Employee Benefit Plan provides welfare benefits, including without limitation, death or medical benefits (whether or not insured), beyond retirement or termination of service, other than coverage mandated solely by applicable Law. With respect to each Employee Benefit Plan set forth on Section 5.10(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter, the full direct cost of benefits is borne by the current or former employee or director (or beneficiary thereof) and the coverage of such current or former employees does not adversely affect the premiums or rates payable by the Company or its Subsidiaries with respect to other current employees. 

  

 (d) With respect to each Employee Benefit Plan intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code, (i) each such Employee Benefit Plan has been determined to be so qualified and has received a favorable determination or opinion letter from the Internal Revenue Service with respect to its qualification, (ii) the trusts maintained thereunder have been determined to be exempt from taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code, and (iii) no event has occurred that could reasonably be expected to result in disqualification or adversely affect such exemption. 

  

 (e) Neither the Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has ever contributed to or had any obligation to contribute to: (i) a plan subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Sections 412 or 4971 of the Code; (ii) a "multiemployer plan" (within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA); (iii) a "multiple employer plan" (within the meaning of Section 413(c) of the Code); (iv) any "voluntary employees beneficiary association" (within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code); or (v) any "multiple employer welfare arrangement" (within the meaning of Section 3(40) of ERISA). Neither the Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has incurred any withdrawal liability that has not been satisfied in full. 

  

 (f) There are no pending, or to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened actions, suits, disputes or claims by or on behalf of any Employee Benefit Plan or any Foreign Plan, by any employee or beneficiary covered under any such Employee Benefit Plan or Foreign Plan, as applicable, or otherwise involving any such Employee Benefit Plan or Foreign Plan (other than routine claims for benefits). 

  

 (g) Except as set forth on Section 5.10(g) of the Company Disclosure Letter, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will, either alone or in combination with another event, (i) entitle any current or former employee, officer, director or other service provider of the 

   ##### 

  

 

Company or any Subsidiary to severance pay, unemployment compensation, a
change of control payment or any other payment, or (ii) accelerate the time
of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of compensation due any such
employee, officer, director or other service provider. Except as set forth on
Section 5.10(g) of the Company Disclosure Letter, neither the Company nor
any Subsidiary is party to any contract or arrangement that could result,
separately or in the aggregate, in the payment of any "excess parachute
payment" for purposes of Section 280G or Section 4999 of the Code. 

   

 (h) Each Employee Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as defined for purposes of Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) has (i) been maintained and operated since January 1, 2005 in good faith compliance with Section 409A of the Code and all applicable Internal Revenue Service guidance promulgated thereunder so as to avoid any Tax, penalty or interest under Section 409A of the Code and, as to any such plan in existence prior to January 1, 2005, has not been "materially modified" (within the meaning of Internal Revenue Service Notice 2005-1) at any time after October 3, 2004 or has been amended in a manner that conforms with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and (ii) since January 1, 2009, been in documentary and operational compliance with Section 409A of the Code and all applicable Internal Revenue Service guidance promulgated thereunder. 

  

 (i) Each plan, arrangement, agreement or contract that would otherwise meet the definition of an "Employee Benefit Plan" but which is subject to any Law other than U.S. federal, state or local Law (" _Foreign Plan_ ") that is intended to comply with the requirements of any tax or pension Laws in order for contributions thereto or benefits thereunder to receive intended tax benefits or favorable tax treatment complies in all material respects with such Laws. Each Foreign Plan required to be registered or approved by a non-U.S. Governmental Entity has been registered or approved and has been maintained in good standing with applicable regulatory authorities, and no event has occurred since the date of the most recent approval or application therefor relating to any such Foreign Plan that could reasonably be expected to materially affect any such approval relating thereto or increase the costs relating thereto in a manner material to the Company and its Subsidiaries as a whole. Each Foreign Plan is fully funded or fully insured on an ongoing and termination or solvency basis (determined using reasonable actuarial assumptions) in compliance with applicable Law, and the fair market value of the assets held under each Foreign Plan that is a pension plan or that is funded on an actuarial basis is sufficient so as to permit a termination of each such Foreign Plan, in full compliance with applicable Law (to the extent such a fully funded or fully insured Foreign Plan may be terminated in accordance with applicable Law), immediately after the Closing Date without Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates being required to make additional contributions to such Foreign Plan (or related trust) or to incur any liability with respect to the funding or payment of benefits under such Foreign Plan.

of penalties or excise taxes with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan by the
Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Labor, or any other Governmental
Entity. 

   

 (b) Except as set forth in Section 5.11(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, no individual is or is part of a unit represented by a labor union, labor organization, workers association, works council or other collective group of employees which represents any group of employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with his or her employment with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

The Company shall not, nor shall it permit any of its Subsidiaries to, nor shall it authorize or knowingly permit any officer, director or employee of, or any investment banker, attorney or other advisor or representative of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, (i) solicit or initiate, or take any action to knowingly encourage, facilitate or induce, directly or indirectly, any inquiries relating to, or the submission of, any proposal or offer, whether in writing or otherwise, from any Person other than Parent, Merger Sub or any Affiliates thereof (a " _Third Party_ ") to acquire beneficial ownership (as determined under Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act) of all or more than fifteen percent (15%) of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or fifteen percent (15%) or more of any class of equity securities of the Company pursuant to a merger, consolidation or other business combination, sale of shares of stock, sale of assets, tender offer, exchange offer or similar transaction or series of related transactions, which is structured to permit such Third Party to acquire beneficial ownership of more than fifteen percent (15%) of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or fifteen percent (15%) or more of any class of equity securities of the Company (an " _Acquisition Proposal_ "); (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal, or furnish to any Person any non-public information or data with respect to or access to the properties of the Company in connection with an Acquisition Proposal; (iii) enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or enter into any agreement requiring it to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or (iv) make a Board Recommendation Change. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence or any other provision of this Agreement, if, (A) after the date hereof and prior to the receipt of stockholder approval of this Agreement, the Company receives a bona fide Acquisition Proposal by a Third Party and such Acquisition Proposal did not result, directly or indirectly, from a breach of this _Section 7.2_, (B) the Company Board or any Committee determines in good faith (after consulting outside legal and financial advisors) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Acquisition Proposal, and (C) the Company receives from such Third Party an executed confidentiality agreement having provisions that are no less restrictive than those of the Confidentiality Agreement (except with respect to any "standstill" provision or other provision having similar effect in the Confidentiality Agreement), then the Company may, in response to such Acquisition Proposal, subject to compliance with this  _Section 7.2_ and after giving notice to Parent, (x) furnish information or data or access with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to, and (y) participate in discussions and negotiations directly or through its representatives with, such Third Party; provided that the Company shall provide or make available, to the extent not previously provided or made available to Parent or its representatives, to Parent any material 

   ##### 

  

 

non-public information with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
that is provided to the Third Party making such Acquisition Proposal prior to
or substantially concurrently with the time it is provided or made available
to such Third Party; provided further, however, that nothing in this _Section
7.2_ shall require the Company to provide or make available to
Parent information that (i) it is not legally permitted to disclose or the
disclosure of which would contravene any applicable Law or binding order or
(ii) the Company determines, in its good faith judgment, would constitute
trade secrets or other material information that is
competitively sensitive. 

   

 (b) The Company shall advise Parent orally and in writing, promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) after receipt thereof, of (i) any proposal for an Acquisition Proposal received by any officer or director of the Company or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any financial advisor, attorney or other advisor or representative of the Company, and (ii) the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal (including the identity of the entity proposing the Acquisition Proposal), and provide a copy of such proposal for an Acquisition Proposal to Parent if such proposal is in writing. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of, and any material changes to, the terms of any such Acquisition Proposal and the status of discussions and negotiations with respect thereto. 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding _Section 7.2(a)_ or any other provision of this Agreement, at any time prior to receipt of stockholder approval of this Agreement, the Company Board or any Committee may make a Board Recommendation Change (i) following receipt of an Acquisition Proposal made after the date hereof that the Company Board or such Committee determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial and legal advisors, constitutes a Superior Acquisition Proposal, _provided_ , that such Acquisition Proposal did not result, directly or indirectly, from a breach of this _Section 7.2_, and that the Board or a Committee has determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to constitute a violation of its fiduciary duties, or (ii) if in response to any material event, development, circumstance, occurrence or change in circumstances or facts that was not known to the Company Board or Committee on the date hereof (or if known, the magnitude or material consequences of which were not known or understood by the Company Board or Committee as of the date hereof), the Company Board or a Committee determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to constitute a violation of its fiduciary duties. 

  

 (d) " _Last Look_ ". Further, neither the Company Board of Directors nor a Committee shall make a Board Recommendation Change in response to an Acquisition Proposal as permitted by  _Section 7.2(c)(i)_, unless (i) the Company promptly notifies Parent, in writing at least three Business Days before taking that action, of its intention to do so, attaching the most current version of any proposed agreement under which such Acquisition Proposal is proposed to be consummated and the identity of the Third Party making the Acquisition Proposal, and (ii) Parent does not make, within three Business Days after its receipt of that written notification, an offer that the Company Board or Committee determines, in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial and legal advisors, is at least as favorable to the stockholders of the Company as such Acquisition Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the 

   ##### 

  

 

financial terms or other material terms of such Acquisition Proposal shall
require a new written notification from the Company and a new three Business
Day period under clause (ii) of this  _Section 7.2(d)_. Neither the Company
Board nor a Committee shall make a Board Recommendation Change as permitted
by _Section 7.2(c)(ii)_, unless (A) the Company has provided Parent at least
three Business Days prior written notice advising Parent of its intention to
make a Board Recommendation Change, attaching a reasonably detailed
explanation of the facts underlying the determination by the Company Board or
Committee of its need to make a Board Recommendation Change and (B) Parent
does not make, within three Business Days after its receipt of that written
notification, an offer that the Company Board or Committee determines, in good
faith, after consultation with its outside financial and legal advisors,
would obviate the need for a Board Recommendation Change. During any three
Business Day period prior to its effecting a Board Recommendation Change
pursuant to this _Section 7.2(d)_, the Company and its representatives shall
negotiate in good faith with Parent and its representatives regarding any
revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
proposed by Parent. 

   

 (e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company, Company Board or Committee from (i) complying with any applicable Law, rule or regulation, including, without limitation, Rule 14d-9 and Rule l4e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act, (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders required by applicable Law, rule or regulation or by the rules and regulations of the NASDAQ, or (iii) otherwise making such disclosure to the Companys stockholders or otherwise that the Company Board or a Committee (after consultation with counsel) concludes in good faith is necessary in order to comply with its fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law; provided, that any such action taken or statement or disclosure made that relates to an Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a Board Recommendation Change unless the Company Board or a Committee publicly reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation within three (3) Business Days following such statement or disclosure or in connection with such action (except that a mere "stop, look and listen" disclosure in compliance with Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act shall not constitute a Board Recommendation Change). 

  

 (f) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Acquisition Proposal_ " means any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal not solicited or initiated in violation of this _Section 7.2_ that (i) relates to an acquisition by a Person or group acting in concert of either (A) more than 50% of the Company Capital Stock pursuant to a tender offer, merger or otherwise or (B) more than 50% of the assets used in the conduct of the business of the Company and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) the Company Board determines in its good faith judgment (after consultation with outside legal counsel and the Company Boards independent financial advisors) would, if consummated, result in a transaction (A) that offers for each share of Company Capital Stock an amount in consideration greater than the Merger Consideration as of the date of determination and (B) that is, in light of the other terms of such proposal, more favorable to the Companys stockholders than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, or in any other proposal made by Parent after Parents receipt of notice of a proposed Board Recommendation Change in response to a Superior Acquisition Proposal, and (iii) the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and its outside legal counsel) is reasonably capable of being consummated on the terms proposed, in 

   ##### 

  

 

each case taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory, fiduciary and
other aspects of the proposal, and for which financing, if a cash transaction
(whether in whole or in part), is then fully committed or reasonably
determined to be available by the Company Board.

 (a) The Company, acting through the Company Board, shall: 

   

 (i) (A) use reasonable best efforts to promptly, and in any event within forty-five (45) days after the date of this Agreement, prepare (with the assistance of Parent and its representatives) and file with the SEC a proxy statement for the purposes of considering and taking action upon this Agreement (the " _Proxy Statement_ "), (B) obtain and furnish the information required to be included by it in the Proxy Statement and, after consultation with Parent and Merger Sub, respond promptly to any comments made by the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and any preliminary version thereof, and (C) undertake to obtain the necessary approvals by its stockholders of this Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby; 

   

 (ii) include in the Proxy Statement the Company Board Recommendation; _provided_ , that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Company Board or a Committee may make a Board Recommendation Change in accordance with _Section 7.2(c)_ , in which case any such Board Recommendation Change shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement; and 

   

 (iii) duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of considering and taking action upon this Agreement (the " _Stockholders Meeting_ "), to be held as soon as practicable following filing of the Proxy Statement with the SEC and the completion of the SECs review of the Proxy Statement, and, without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), within forty-five (45) days after the Proxy Statement is declared effective, and the Company shall not adjourn or postpone the Stockholders Meeting if there are sufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Stockholders Meeting and the Company believes such shares will be voted in a number sufficient to approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger (the Companys obligation to call, give notice of and hold the Stockholders Meeting in accordance with this _Section 7.3_ shall not be limited or otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission of any Superior Acquisition Proposal or other Acquisition Proposal, or by any Board Recommendation Change); _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholder Meeting to the earliest practicable date but no later than ten (10) Business Days from such adjournment or postponement in order to permit the dissemination of any supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement or 

   ##### 

  

    

other disclosure to the Companys stockholders if after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, the Company Board or a Committee determines in good
faith that the failure to make such disclosure would be reasonably likely to
violate applicable Law, including its fiduciary duties to stockholders. 

  

 (b) Parent and Merger Sub shall each cause their respective representatives to fully cooperate with the Company in the preparation of the Proxy Statement, and shall, upon request, furnish the Company with all information concerning it and its Affiliates as the Company may deem reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement.

information by the SEC. 

   

 (g) Parent shall promptly prepare and submit to the NASDAQ a listing application covering the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in the Merger, and shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain approval for the listing of such Parent Common Stock, subject to official notice of issuance, and the Company shall reasonably cooperate with Parent with respect to such listing. 

  

 7.4 _Efforts to Complete Transactions_. 

  

 (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall (i) prepare and make promptly its respective filings, and thereafter make any other required submissions, under the HSR Act and applicable foreign Competition Laws with respect to the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as reasonably possible and (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation, using its reasonable best efforts to obtain all Permits, consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications and orders of Governmental Entities and parties to contracts with the Company and the Subsidiaries as are necessary for the consummation of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to fulfill the conditions to the Merger. In case, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement shall use their reasonable best efforts to take all such action. 

  

 (b) To the extent not prohibited by applicable Law, each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to furnish to the other parties all information required for any application or other filing to be made pursuant to any applicable Laws in connection with the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent and Company shall give each other reasonable prior notice of any communication with, and any proposed understanding, undertaking or agreement with, any Governmental Entity regarding any such filings or any such transaction. The parties hereto agree that both Parent and Company shall be represented at all in person meetings and in all substantive conversations with any Governmental Entity regarding the matters set forth in this  _Section 7.4_, except if, and to the extent, that any Governmental Entity objects to any partys being represented at any such meeting or in any such conversation and such objection has not been withdrawn after the parties have used their reasonable best efforts to contest such objection. The parties hereto will consult and cooperate with one another in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in connection with proceedings under or relating to the HSR Act and applicable foreign Competition Laws.

transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act. 

   

 (c) Each of the parties hereto agrees to cooperate and use its reasonable best efforts to vigorously contest and resist any action or proceeding, including administrative or judicial action or proceeding, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that is in effect and that restricts, prevents or prohibits consummation of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation, by vigorously pursuing all available avenues of administrative and judicial appeal, unless Parent determines, in its reasonable discretion after consulting with the Company, that litigation is not in its best interests or unless the Company determines, in its reasonable discretion after consulting with Parent, that litigation is not in its best interests. 

  

 (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary and in furtherance of, and not in limitation of, the foregoing, Parent shall take, or cause to be taken, all such further actions as may be necessary to resolve such objections, if any, as the United States Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice, state antitrust enforcement authorities or competition authorities of any other nation or other jurisdiction or any other Person may assert under any Competition Law with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, and to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any Competition Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity or any other Person with respect to the Merger so as to enable the Closing to occur as promptly as reasonably practicable and in any event no later than the Termination Date (as such date may be extended pursuant to  _Section 9.2_); provided, however, nothing in this section or in this Agreement shall be deemed to require Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to agree to or take any action that would result in any Burdensome Condition. For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Burdensome Condition_ " shall mean executing or carrying out agreements (including consent decrees) or submitting to Orders (i) providing for the license, sale or other disposition or holding separate (through the establishment of trust or otherwise) of any assets or categories of assets of the Company, Parent or their respective Subsidiaries or the holding separate of the capital stock of a Parent Subsidiary or (ii) imposing or seeking to impose any limitation on the ability of the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries to conduct their respective businesses (including, with respect to, market practices and structure) or own such assets or to acquire, hold or exercise full rights of ownership of the business of Parent, each of the Parent Subsidiaries, the Company or the Subsidiaries that, in the case of (i) and (ii), individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to result in (A) the sale or divestiture of a material asset of the Company, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, (B) a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect, or a material adverse effect on the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or (C) a material adverse effect on the benefits which Parent reasonably expects to be realized or derived from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each case following the Effective Time. With respect to the materiality criteria set forth in the immediately prior sentence and for the avoidance of doubt, the parties understand that the sale, divestiture or other disposition, or any license or other restriction on use of any 

   ##### 

  

 

business or assets acquired or to be acquired after the date hereof shall not
be deemed material for purposes of (A), (B), or (C) of the foregoing proviso
and any such sale, divestiture or other disposition, or any license or other
restriction on use of any business or assets acquired or to be acquired after
the date hereof shall not be considered in the determination of whether there
is a Burdensome Condition. Parent represents and warrants as of the time of
this Agreement that it has not (since April 30, 2010) entered into any
agreement obligating Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to acquire any other
business or Person. 

   

 (e) Prior to the date which is 90 days immediately following the date hereof, Parent shall not, and shall not permit its Subsidiaries to, acquire or agree to acquire in any transaction any firm, corporation, partnership, or similar entity if the aggregate amount of the consideration paid or transferred by Parent and its Subsidiaries in connection with any such transaction would exceed $150,000,000.

 (g) Each of the parties hereto agrees to cooperate with each other in taking, or causing to be taken, all actions necessary to delist the Company Common Stock from the NASDAQ and to terminate registration under the Exchange Act; _provided_ , that such delisting and termination shall not be effective until after the Effective Time of the Merger. 

  

 7.5 _Access to Information_. 

  

 (a) Upon reasonable notice, the Company shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) afford to officers, employees, counsel, accountants and other authorized representatives of Parent (" _Parent Representatives_ "), in order to evaluate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to its officers, employees, accountants, consultants, representatives, plants, properties, contracts, commitments, books and records and, during such period, shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) furnish or make available reasonably promptly to such Parent Representatives all information concerning its business, properties and personnel as may reasonably be requested (including financial and operating data, customer billing and other data files for the purpose of system integration and testing as well as compensation and payroll data files for the purpose of payroll system integration and testing with respect to employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries); _provided_ , _however_ , that any such access shall be conducted under the supervision of personnel of the Company and in a manner that does not materially interfere with the normal operations of the Company;  _provided_ , _further_ , that, other than information provided to Parents legal counsel in connection with preparing and making filings pursuant to the HSR Act, the Company and its 

   ##### 

  

 

Subsidiaries shall not be required to furnish or make available competitively
sensitive pricing or customer information.

Notwithstanding clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence, if any of the information or material furnished pursuant to this _Section 7.5_ includes materials or information subject to the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege concerning pending or threatened legal proceedings or governmental investigations, each party understands and agrees that the parties have a commonality of interest with respect to such matters and it is the desire, intention and mutual understanding of the parties that the sharing of such material or information is not intended to, and shall not, waive or diminish in any way the confidentiality of such material or information or its continued protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege. All such information provided by the Company that is entitled to protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege shall remain entitled to such protection under these privileges, this Agreement, and under the joint defense doctrine. 

  

 (d) No information received pursuant to an investigation made under this _Section 7.5_ shall be deemed to (i) qualify, modify, amend or otherwise affect any representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements of the Company set forth in this Agreement or any certificate or other instrument delivered to Parent and Merger Sub in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) amend or otherwise supplement the information set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter, (iii) limit or restrict the remedies available to the parties under applicable Law arising out of a breach of this Agreement, or (iv) limit or restrict the ability of either party to invoke or rely on the conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement set forth in _Article VIII_ hereof. 

  

 (e) The Confidentiality Agreement, dated April 15, 2009 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), by and between the Company and Parent shall continue to apply with respect to 

   ##### 

  

 

information furnished by the Company, its Subsidiaries and the Companys
officers, employees, counsel, accountants and other authorized
representatives hereunder. 

   

 7.6 _Publicity_. The parties shall consult with each other and shall mutually agree upon any press releases or public announcements pertaining to this Agreement and the Merger and shall not issue any such press releases or make any such public announcements prior to such consultation and agreement, except (i) as may be required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any agreement with any national securities exchange or automated quotation system, in which case the party proposing to issue such press release or make such public announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to consult in good faith with the other party before issuing any such press releases or making any such public announcements; _provided_ , that no such consultation shall be required to make any disclosure or otherwise take any action expressly permitted by _Section 7.2_ or following a Board Recommendation Change; _provided_ , _further_ , that each of Parent and the Company may include disclosures relating to this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated herein in its periodic filings with the SEC without seeking approval from, or consulting with, the other party so long as such disclosures are substantially similar to the information contained in previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made jointly by Parent and the Company (or individually, if approved by the other party), or (ii) each of Parent and the Company may make any public statement in response to specific questions by the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences or financial analyst conference calls, so long as such statements are substantially similar to the information contained in previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made jointly by Parent and the Company (or individually, if approved by the other party).

at the time of termination of this Agreement it is in breach of its

In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 9.3(iii)_, the receipt of such liquidated damages by Parent pursuant to the provisions of this _Section 9.5_ shall be the exclusive remedy of Parent with respect to a termination of this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 9.3(iii)_ and Parent shall not be entitled to any further or other rights, claims or remedies at law or in equity, all of which further rights, claims and remedies Parent irrevocably waives; _provided_ , that Parent shall not be precluded from exercising any remedies upon the failure of the Company to pay such liquidated damages when due. __ 

  

 (d) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section 9.5_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay any amount due to Parent pursuant to this _Section 9.5_, it shall also pay any costs and expenses actually incurred by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with a legal action to enforce this Agreement that results in a judgment against the Company for such amount, together with interest on the amount of any unpaid fee, cost or expense at the publicly announced prime rate of Citibank, N.A. from the date such fee, cost or expense was required to be paid to (but excluding) the payment date.

hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

The parties agree that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law. 

  

 (b) EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY 

   #####

 (c) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached and that any defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate is hereby waived. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware), in addition to any and all other rights and remedies at law or in equity, and all such rights and remedies shall be cumulative. Any requirements for the securing or posting of any bond with such remedy are waived. The parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific performance is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason.
