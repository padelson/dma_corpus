 At the Trizec Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Trizec Merger and without any action on the part of Trizec or the holders of any capital stock of Trizec (other than the requisite approval of the Trizec Merger by the stockholders of Trizec in accordance with DGCL): 

    

 (a) Each Trizec Common Share held in treasury and not outstanding and each Trizec Common Share that is owned by MergerCo immediately prior to the Trizec Merger Effective Time shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto. 

   

 (b) Each Trizec Common Share held by TZ Canada or any TZ Canada Subsidiaries, Parent, and AcquisitionCo immediately prior to the Trizec Merger Effective Time shall continue to remain an issued and outstanding share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (c) Each Trizec Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Trizec Merger Effective Time (other than Trizec Dissenting Shares and Trizec Common Shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 3.01(a) and Trizec Common Shares remain issued and outstanding in accordance with Section 3.01(b)), shall be converted and exchanged automatically into one fully paid and non-assessable Redeemable Preferred Share of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Trizec Common Share Merger Consideration_ ", and the Trizec Common Shares that are to be so converted into the Trizec Common Share Merger Consideration are referred to herein as the " _Merger Shares_ "). Immediately after the completion of the Trizec Merger, in accordance with the terms of the Surviving Corporation Charter, the Surviving Corporation shall cause each Redeemable Preferred Share to be redeemed for the right to receive cash in the amount of (i) $29.01 per share, plus (ii) an amount equal to $0.20 multiplied by the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the number of days between the last day of the quarter for which a full quarterly dividend on the Trizec Common Shares has been declared and the Closing Date (including the Closing Date), by (y) the total number of days in the quarter in which the Closing Date occurs, without interest (the " _Redemption Amount_ "), without interest subject to any applicable Taxes required to be withheld in accordance with Section 3.09 with respect to such payment and payable upon surrender, in the manner provided in Section 3.05, of the certificate evidencing the Trizec Common Shares that are to be so converted into the Trizec Common Share Merger Consideration (the " _Trizec Common Share Certificates_ ").

 (e) Each share of Class F convertible stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Trizec (" _Trizec Class F Stock_") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Trizec Merger Effective Time shall continue to remain issued and outstanding as a share of Class F convertible stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (f) Immediately prior to the Trizec Merger Effective Time, each outstanding qualified or nonqualified option to purchase Trizec Common Shares (" _Trizec Stock Options_ ") under the 2002 Trizec Properties, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended and restated, and any employee or director share option or compensation plan or arrangement of Trizec (collectively, " _Incentive Plans_ "), shall become fully vested and exercisable or payable, as the case may be (whether or not then vested or subject to any performance condition that has not been satisfied, and regardless of the exercise price thereof). At the Trizec Merger Effective Time, each Trizec Share Option not theretofore exercised shall be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive a single lump sum cash payment, equal to the product of (i) the number of Trizec Common Shares subject to such Trizec Share Option immediately prior to the Trizec Merger Effective Time, whether or not vested or exercisable, and (ii) the 

   ##### 

  

    

excess, if any, of the Redemption Amount over the exercise price per share of
such Trizec Share Option, without interest (the " _Trizec Option
Consideration_ "), subject to any applicable Taxes required to be withheld in
accordance with Section 3.09 with respect to such payment. If the exercise
price per share of any such Trizec Share Option is equal to or greater than
the Redemption Amount, such Trizec Share Option shall be cancelled without
any cash payment being made in respect thereof. 

   

 (g) All restricted share awards (" _Trizec Restricted Shares_ ") granted pursuant to the Incentive Plans or otherwise that remain unvested, including any awards of Trizec Restricted Shares that may be awarded pursuant to, or in connection with, the Trizec 2004 Long-Term Outperformance Company Program (the " _OPP_ "), automatically shall become fully vested and free of any forfeiture or holding restrictions immediately prior to the Trizec Merger Effective Time, and each Trizec Restricted Share shall be considered an outstanding Trizec Common Share for all purposes of this Agreement, including the right to receive the Common Share Merger Consideration. 

   

 (h) All restricted share unit, deferred restricted share unit, restricted share rights and deferred restricted share rights awards (collectively, " _Trizec Restricted Share Rights_ ") granted pursuant to the Incentive Plans or otherwise automatically shall become fully vested and free of any forfeiture restrictions immediately prior to the Trizec Merger Effective Time, and each Trizec Restricted Share Right shall be considered an outstanding Trizec Common Share for all purposes of this Agreement, including the right to receive the Common Share Merger Consideration. Payment of the Common Share Merger Consideration in respect of any Trizec Restricted Share Rights shall be performed in accordance with Section 8.06(d). 

   

 (i) Immediately prior to the Trizec Merger Effective Time, the terms of each outstanding warrant to purchase Trizec Common Shares (" _Trizec Warrants_ ") (other than such Trizec Warrants that are held by TZ Canada or any TZ Canada Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Trizec Merger Effective Time), shall be adjusted in accordance with Section Eight of the warrant agreement with respect to each Trizec Warrant, to provide that from and after the Trizec Merger Effective Time, each such Trizec Warrant shall entitle the holder thereof upon exercise of such Trizec Warrant and payment of the exercise price thereof to receive solely, in full satisfaction thereof, a single lump sum cash payment, equal to the product of (i) the number of Trizec Common Shares subject to such Trizec Warrant immediately prior to the Trizec Merger Effective Time, whether or not vested or exercisable, and (ii) the Redemption Amount, without interest (the " _Trizec Warrant Consideration_ "), and subject to any applicable Taxes required to be withheld in accordance with Section 3.09 with respect to such payment.

 At the Trizec Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Trizec Merger and without any action on the MergerCo or Parent, as the holder of all outstanding capital stock of MergerCo (other than the requisite approval by Parent as a stockholder of MergerCo in accordance with DGCL, which approval has been obtained), all outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of MergerCo issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Trizec Merger Effective Time shall collectively be converted into such aggregate number of shares of common stock, par value $0.01, of the Surviving Corporation in an amount equal to the aggregate number of Trizec Common Shares (other than the Trizec Common Shares held by TZ Canada and any TZ Canada Subsidiaries) outstanding immediately prior to the Trizec Merger Effective Time, including Trizec Common Shares deemed to be outstanding pursuant to Section 3.01(g) and 3.01(h). 

   

SECTION 3.03. _Effects on Operating Company Securities_. 

   

 (a) At the Operating Company Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Operating Company Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any limited liability company interest of Operating Company or Merger Operating Company, each Class A and Class B common unit of limited liability company interest in the Operating Company issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Operating Company Merger Effective Time (the " _Existing Units_ ") (other than any Existing Units held by Trizec or any of Trizec Subsidiaries, which Existing Units shall remain outstanding and unchanged as units of limited liability company interest in the Surviving Operating Corporation), shall be converted and exchanged automatically into one fully-paid Redeemable Preferred Unit of the Surviving Operating Company (the " _Operating Company Merger Consideration_ ", and together with the Redemption Amount, Trizec Option Consideration and the Trizec Warrant Consideration, the " _Trizec Consideration_ "). 

   

 (b) At the Operating Company Merger Effective Time, the limited liability company interests of Operating Company held by Trizec shall remain outstanding and unchanged as limited liability company interests in the Surviving Operating Company, entitling the holder thereof to such rights, duties and obligations as are more fully set forth in the Amended Operating Agreement. 

   

 (c) At the Operating Company Merger Effective Time, without any action of any Person, the limited liability company interests in the Merger Operating Company shall be converted and exchanged automatically into limited liability company interests in the Surviving Operating Company commensurate with their value. 

   

 (d) Each holder of Class B Common Units of the Operating Company shall be afforded the opportunity to make an unconditional election, prior to the Closing Date, to exercise the Preferred Redemption Right (as defined in Section F(i) of Exhibit G) or the Preferred Conversion Right (as defined in Section H(i) of Exhibit G) relating to the Redeemable Preferred Units that such holder will receive in the Operating Company Merger, effective immediately following the Operating Company Merger Effective Time, (an " _Election_ ") as follows: 

    ##### 

  

      

 (i) Parent shall prepare and deliver to the Operating Company, as promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, and the Operating Company shall mail to the holders of Class B Common Units, a form of election, which form shall be subject to the reasonable approval of Trizec, in its capacity as the managing member of the Operating Company (the " _Form of Election_ "). The Form of Election shall set forth the procedures, reasonably acceptable to Trizec, for holders of Class B Common Units to make an election to exercise the Preferred Redemption Right and the Preferred Conversion Right, including the deadline for making Elections and the procedures (if any) for revoking an Election. 

   

 (ii) The Trizec Parties agree to reasonably cooperate with Parent in preparing any disclosure statement or other disclosure information to accompany the Form of Election, including information applicable to an offering of securities exempt from registration under the Securities Act.

operated by it or the conduct or nature of its business makes such

relating to Trizec, TZ Canada or the Buyer Parties or any of their respective
affiliates, officers, members or directors, should be discovered by Trizec,
TZ Canada or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement
to the Proxy Statement or the Other Filings, so that the Proxy Statement
or the Other Filings shall not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party which

or filing the Other Filings (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or
responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, Trizec shall
provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such
document or response and will in good faith consider such comments, and to
the extent practicable, Trizec will provide TZ Canada and Parent with the
opportunity to participate in any substantive calls between Trizec, or any of
its representatives, and the SEC concerning the Proxy Statement. 

   

(b) Trizec shall duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of

may determine (1) not to make or to withdraw, modify or change such
recommendation (a " _Trizec Change in Recommendation_ "), and (2) not to use
such efforts to solicit proxies or take such other necessary or
advisable actions in favor of the adoption of this Agreement if, in the case
of both clauses (1) and (2), it has determined in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. Unless
this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with Section 10.01, Trizec
shall hold the Trizec 

   ##### 

  

   

Stockholders Meeting regardless of whether the Trizec Board has made a
Trizec Change in Recommendation. If there are an insufficient number of
Trizec Common Shares represented in person or by proxy at the Trizec
Stockholders Meeting to constitute a quorum or to adopt this Agreement,

Meeting for up to ten (10) business days so long as, during such period,
Trizec uses its reasonable best efforts to obtain a quorum and the requisite
vote to adopt this Agreement as promptly as practicable. Trizec may, if it
receives a _bona fide_ written unsolicited Trizec Acquisition Proposal, delay
the mailing of the Proxy Statement or the holding of the Trizec Stockholders
Meeting, in each case for such reasonable period as would provide
a reasonable opportunity for the Trizec Board and/or the Special Committee to
consider such Trizec Acquisition Proposal and to determine the effect, if

Transaction Resolution if, in the case of both clauses (1) and (2), it has
determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,

duties under applicable Canadian Law. Unless this Agreement has been
terminated in accordance with Section 10.01, TZ Canada shall hold the TZ
Canada Shareholders Meeting regardless whether the TZ Canada Board has made
a TZ Canada Change in Recommendation. If there are an insufficient number of
TZ Canada Shares represented in person or by proxy at the TZ Canada
Shareholders Meeting to constitute a quorum or to adopt this Agreement, TZ
Canada may adjourn or postpone, as applicable, the TZ Canada Shareholders
Meeting for up to ten (10) business days so long as, during such period, TZ
Canada uses its reasonable best efforts to obtain a quorum and the requisite
vote to adopt this Agreement as promptly as practicable. TZ Canada may, if it
receives an unsolicited TZ Canada Acquisition Proposal, delay the mailing of
the TZ Canada Circular or the holding of the TZ Canada Shareholders Meeting,
in each case for such reasonable period as would provide a reasonable
opportunity for the TZ Canada Board to consider such TZ Canada Acquisition
Proposal and to determine the effect, if any, on the TZ Canada Recommendation

TZ Canada shall promptly notify Trizec and Parent upon the receipt of any comments from any applicable securities regulator or its staff or any request from any applicable securities regulator or its staff for amendments or supplements to the TZ Canada Circular or the Additional Filings and shall promptly provide Trizec and Parent with copies of all correspondence between TZ Canada and its representatives, on the one hand, and the applicable securities regulator and its staff, on the other hand, relating to the TZ Canada Circular or the Additional Filings. If at any time prior to the TZ Canada Shareholders Meeting, any information relating to Trizec, TZ Canada or the Buyer Parties or any of their respective affiliates, officers, members or directors, should be discovered by Trizec, TZ Canada or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the TZ Canada Circular or the

Additional Filings, so that the TZ Canada Circular or the Additional Filings
shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other parties, and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be filed with the applicable
securities regulator and, to the extent required by applicable Law,

thereto, TZ Canada shall provide Trizec and Parent a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such document or response and will in
good faith consider such comments, and to the extent practicable, TZ Canada
will provide Trizec and Parent with the opportunity to participate in any
substantive calls between TZ Canada, or any of its representatives, and the
applicable securities regulator concerning the TZ Canada Circular.

Each Continuing Employee will be credited with his or her years of service with TZ

Canada and the TZ Canada Subsidiaries (and any predecessor entities thereof)
before the Closing Date under the parallel employee benefit plan of Parent or
the TZ Canada Subsidiaries to the same extent as such employee was entitled,
before the Plan of Arrangement Effective Time, to credit for such service
under the respective Plan (except to the extent such credit would result in

 (e) If TZ Canada or any of its respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with or into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of TZ Canada assumes the obligations set forth in this Section 8.08. 

   

 (f) This Section 8.08 is intended for the irrevocable benefit of, and to grant third party rights to, the TZ Canada Indemnified Parties and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of TZ Canada and Parent. Each of the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to enforce the covenants contained in this Section 8.08. 

   

 (g) Parent shall have the right to participate in the defense or settlement of any shareholder or member litigation against TZ Canada, its directors or officers, relating to the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, provided, however, that no such settlement shall be agreed to without Parents consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. 

  

SECTION 8.09. _Financing; Cooperation with Financing_. 

    

 (a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain the proceeds of the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter, including using reasonable best efforts to (i) negotiate definitive agreements with respect thereto on terms and conditions contained therein and (ii) to satisfy all conditions applicable to the Buyer Parties in such definitive agreements. In the event any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain any such portion from alternative sources as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event. Parent shall give Trizec and TZ Canada prompt notice of any material breach by any party of the Debt Commitment Letter or any termination of the Debt Commitment Letter. Parent shall keep Trizec and TZ Canada informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing and shall not permit any material amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any material provision or remedy under, the Debt Commitment Letter without first consulting with Trizec and TZ Canada or, if such amendment would or would be reasonably expected to materially and adversely affect or delay in any material respect Parents ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, without first obtaining Trizecs and TZ Canadas prior written consent. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Debt Financing (or any alternative financing) has not been obtained, the Buyer Parties shall continue to be obligated to consummate the Trizec Merger and the Arrangement on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and subject only to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Sections 8.01 and 8.02 of this Agreement and to Parents rights under Section 9.01, regardless of whether the Buyer Parties have 

   ##### 

  

   

complied with all of their other obligations under this Agreement (including
their obligations under this Section 8.09). 

   

 (b) Each of Trizec and TZ Canada agrees to provide, and shall cause the Trizec Subsidiaries and the TZ Canada Subsidiaries, as applicable, to provide, all reasonable cooperation in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing as may be reasonably requested by Parent (provided that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of Trizec and Trizec Subsidiaries or TZ Canada and TZ Canada Subsidiaries, as the case may be), including without limitation, (a) delivering such financial and statistical information and projections relating to Trizec, the Trizec Subsidiaries, the Material Trizec JV Entities, TZ Canada, and the TZ Canada Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested in connection with the Debt Financing, (b) arranging for Trizecs and TZ Canadas independent accountants, lawyers and consultants to provide such services that may be reasonably required in respect of the Debt Financing, (c) making appropriate officers of Trizec, the Trizec Subsidiaries, the Material Trizec JV Entities, TZ Canada, and the TZ Canada Subsidiaries available for due diligence meetings and for participation in meetings with rating agencies and prospective sources of financing, (d) providing timely access to diligence materials and appropriate personnel to allow sources of financing and their representatives to complete all appropriate diligence, (e) providing assistance with respect to the review and granting of mortgages and security interests in collateral for the Debt Financing, and obtaining any consents associated therewith, and (f) obtaining estoppels and certificates from tenants, lenders and ground lessors in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to any potential lender. Parent shall promptly reimburse Trizec and TZ Canada for any reasonable costs incurred in performing their obligations under this Section 8.09(b). 

 

SECTION 8.10. _Tax Matters_. 

  

 During the period from the date of this Agreement to Trizec Merger Effective Time, Trizec and the Trizec Subsidiaries shall: 

    

 (a) continue to operate in such a manner as to permit Trizec to continue to qualify as a REIT for the taxable year of Trizec that includes the Trizec Merger Effective Time; 

   

 (b) prepare and timely file all Tax Returns (or obtain extensions thereof ) required to be filed by them on or before the Closing Date (" _Post-Signing Returns_ ") in a manner consistent with past practice, except as otherwise required by applicable Laws; 

   

 (c) fully and timely pay all Taxes due and payable in respect of such Post-Signing Returns that are so filed; 

   

 (d) properly reserve (and reflect such reserve in their books and records and financial statements), for all Taxes payable by them for which no Post-Signing Return is due prior to Trizec Merger Effective Time in a manner consistent with past practice; and 

   ##### 

  

   

 (e) terminate all Tax sharing agreements to which Trizec or any of the Trizec Subsidiaries is a party such that there are no further liabilities thereunder (provided that the foregoing does not apply to existing Tax Protection Agreements). For greater certainty, the parties acknowledge that the Tax Co-operation Agreement dated May 8, 2002 between Trizec and TrizecHahn Office Properties Ltd. (a predecessor to TZ Canada) is not a Tax sharing agreement and shall not be terminated. 

  

SECTION 8.11. _Further Action; Reasonable Efforts_. 

    

 (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall (i) make promptly its respective filings, and thereafter make any other required submissions, under the HSR Act with respect to this Agreement and the Trizec Merger, if required, (ii) make promptly its respective filings, and thereafter make any other required submissions, under the Competition Act (Canada) and the Investment Canada Act with respect to this Agreement and the Arrangement, if required, and (iii) use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws and applicable Canadian Laws to consummate and make effective the Trizec Merger and the Arrangement as promptly as practicable, including using its reasonable best efforts to obtain all Permits, consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications and orders of Governmental Authorities and parties to contracts with Trizec, the Trizec Subsidiaries, TZ Canada and the TZ Canada Subsidiaries as are necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to fulfill the conditions to the Trizec Merger and the Arrangement as promptly as practicable. 

   

 (b) The parties hereto agree to cooperate and assist one another in connection with all actions to be taken pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section 8.11, including the preparation and making of the filings referred to therein and, if requested, amending or furnishing additional information thereunder, including, subject to applicable Law and the Confidentiality Agreement, providing copies of all related documents to the non-filing party and their advisors prior to filing, and, to the extent practicable, none of the parties will file any such document or have any communication with any Governmental Authority without prior consultation with the other parties. Each party shall keep the other parties apprised of the content and status of any communications with, and communications from, any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. To the extent practicable and permitted by a Governmental Authority, each party hereto shall permit representatives of the other parties to participate in meetings and calls with such Governmental Authority. 

   

 (c) Each of the parties hereto agrees to cooperate and use its reasonable best efforts to defend through litigation on the merits any Action, including administrative or judicial Action, asserted by any third party in order to avoid the entry of, or to have vacated, lifted, reversed, terminated or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that in whole 

   ##### 

  

   

or in part restricts, delays, prevents or prohibits consummation of the
Trizec Merger or the Arrangement, including, without limitation, by
vigorously pursuing all available avenues of administrative and judicial
appeal. 

   

 (d) Parent and AcquisitionCo shall carry out the terms of the Interim Order and Final Order applicable to either of them and use commercially reasonable efforts to comply promptly with all requirements which applicable Canadian Laws may impose on them with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement. 

 

SECTION 8.12. _Transfer Taxes._  

  

 Parent and Trizec shall cooperate in the preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires, applications or other documents regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer or stamp taxes, any transfer, recording, registration and other fees and any similar taxes that become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (together with any related interests, penalties or additions to Tax, " _Transfer Taxes_ "), and shall cooperate in attempting to minimize the amount of Transfer Taxes. From and after the Trizec Merger Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall pay or cause to be paid, without deduction or withholding from any consideration or amounts payable to holders of the Trizec Common Shares, Redeemable Preferred Shares, Trizec Stock Options, and Trizec Restricted Share Rights and Trizec Restricted Shares, all Transfer Taxes. 

  

SECTION 8.13. _Trizec Indebtedness_. 

  

 Subject to Section 2.07, Trizec agrees to provide, and shall request that their respective Representatives provide, all reasonable cooperation in order for the Buying Parties to prepay or assume such outstanding indebtedness of Trizec or any Trizec Subsidiary as may be reasonably requested by the Buying Parties (collectively, "Loan Activities"). 

  

SECTION 8.14. _Public Announcements._  

  

 The parties hereto agree that no public release or announcement concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Mergers or the Arrangement shall be issued by a party without the prior consent of the other parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), except as such release or announcement may be required by Law, Canadian Law or the rules or regulations of any securities exchange, in which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall use its reasonable efforts to allow the other parties reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance. The parties have agreed upon the form of a joint press release announcing the Mergers, the Arrangement and the execution of this Agreement. 

   

SECTION 8.15. _Operating Company Merger._  

   

 In connection with the Operating Company Merger, each of the members of the Operating Company (not including the membership interests held by Trizec) will receive a Redeemable Preferred Unit with the rights set forth on _Exhibit E_ hereto, subject to the Amended Operating Agreement. The Amended Operating Agreement shall be negotiated in good faith and mutually agreed upon by Parent, Trizec and the Operating Company following the date hereof. Parent agrees that the Amended Operating Agreement shall provide rights for the holders of the Continuing Common Units and Redeemable Preferred Units comparable to those afforded to the 

    ##### 

 

    

"Non-Managing Members" in the Operating Company LLC Agreement so as to
qualify for the exception from the definition of "Adverse Modification" set
forth in the second sentence of the definition of such term in the Redemption
and Contribution Agreement dated as of May 1, 2006. Notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, none of Trizec Parties shall
have any liability hereunder either for any failure to qualify for such
exception or for the Operating Company Merger being deemed to violate
the Operating Company LLC Agreement and any such failure or violation shall
not be asserted as the basis for a breach by the Trizec Parties of this
Agreement or as the basis for a failure to satisfy the conditions
for obligations of the parties set forth in Article IX. TZ Canada, Trizec and
the Operating Company agree to cooperate in good faith and use their
reasonable best efforts to take all actions necessary or advisable to effect
the foregoing.

 (d) If this Agreement is terminated by the Trizec Parties or TZ Canada pursuant to Section 10.01(e), Parent shall pay to the Trizec Parties and TZ Canada within three (3) Business Days after the date of termination all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and expenses of lawyers, accountants, consultants, financial advisors and investment bankers, incurred by the Trizec Parties, the Trizec Subsidiaries, TZ Canada and the TZ Canada Subsidiaries in connection with the entering into of this Agreement and the carrying out of any and all acts contemplated hereunder up to an aggregate maximum amount of $15,500,000 in respect of the Trizec Parties (" _Trizec Expenses_ ") and up to an aggregate maximum amount of $9,500,000 in respect of TZ Canada (" _TZ Canada Expenses_ ," and together with Trizec Expenses, the " _Seller Party Expenses_ "). The payment of expenses by Parent set forth in this Section 10.03(e) or by TZ Canada or Trizec set forth in Section 10.03(b) is not an exclusive remedy, but is in addition to any other rights or remedies available to the parties hereto (whether at law or in equity), and in no respect is intended by the parties hereto to constitute liquidated damages, or be viewed as an indicator of the damages payable, or in any other respect limit or restrict damages available in case of any breach of this Agreement. 

   

 (e) Each of the Trizec Parties, TZ Canada and Parent acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 10.03 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that (w) Trizec shall 

   ##### 

  

   

fail to pay when due the Full Termination Fee and Parent Expenses pursuant to
Section 10.03(b)(i), (iii) or (iv), (x) Trizec shall fail to pay when due the
Trizec Termination Fee pursuant to the proviso in 10.03(b)(ii), (v) or (vi),
(y) TZ Canada shall fail to pay when due the TZ Canada Termination Fee and
Parent Expenses pursuant to Section 10.03(b)(ii), (v) or (vii) or (z) Parent
shall fail to pay the Seller Party Expenses when due pursuant to Section
10.03(d), the Trizec Parties and TZ Canada or Parent, as the case may be,
shall reimburse the other party for all reasonable costs and expenses
actually incurred or accrued by such other party (including reasonable fees
and expenses of counsel) in connection with the collection under and
enforcement of this Section 10.03. If payable, none of the Full Termination
Fee, Trizec Termination Fee, TZ Canada Termination Fee, Seller Party Expenses
or Parent Expenses shall be payable more than once pursuant to this
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto acknowledge that
the maximum aggregate amount that may be paid pursuant to Section 10.03 by
Trizec and TZ Canada shall be an amount equal to the Full Termination Fee
plus the Parent Expenses. 

 

SECTION 10.04. _Escrow of Trizec Expenses_. 

    

 (a) In the event that Parent is obligated to pay Trizec Expenses set forth in Section 10.03(e), Parent shall pay to Trizec from Trizec Expenses deposited into escrow in accordance with the next sentence, an amount equal to the lesser of (i) Trizec Expenses and (ii) the sum of (A) the maximum amount that can be paid to Trizec without causing Trizec to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and 856(c)(3) of the Code determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute income described in Sections 856(c)(2)(A)-(H) or 856(c)(3)(A)-(I) of the Code (" _Qualifying Income_ "), as determined by Trizecs independent certified public accountants, plus (B) in the event Trizec receives either (1) a letter from Trizecs counsel indicating that Trizec has received a ruling from the IRS described in Section 10.04(b) or (2) an opinion from Trizecs outside counsel as described in Section 10.04(b), an amount equal to Trizec Expenses less the amount payable under clause (A) above. To secure Parents obligation to pay these amounts, Parent shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash equal to Trizec Expenses with an escrow agent selected by Parent and on such terms (subject to Section 10.04(b)) as shall be mutually agreed upon by Trizec, Parent and the escrow agent. The payment or deposit into escrow of Trizec Expenses pursuant to this Section 10.04(b) shall be made at the time Parent is obligated to pay Trizec such amount pursuant to Section 10.03(e) by wire transfer or bank check. 

   

 (b) The escrow agreement shall provide that Trizec Expenses in escrow or any portion thereof shall not be released to Trizec unless the escrow agent receives any one or combination of the following: (i) a letter from Trizecs independent certified public accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid by the escrow agent to Trizec without causing Trizec to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute Qualifying Income or a subsequent letter from Trizecs accountants revising that amount, in which case the escrow agent shall release such 

   ##### 

  

   

amount to Trizec, or (ii) a letter from Trizecs counsel indicating that
Trizec received a ruling from the IRS holding that Trizec Expenses
would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross
income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (or
alternatively, Trizecs outside counsel has rendered a legal opinion to the
effect that the receipt by Trizec of Trizec Expenses would constitute
Qualifying Income, would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of
Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code or would not otherwise
disqualify Trizec as a REIT), in which case the escrow agent shall release
the remainder of Trizec Expenses to Trizec. Parent agrees to amend this
Section 9.04 at the request of Trizec in order to (x) maximize the portion of
Trizec Expenses that may be distributed to Trizec hereunder without causing
Trizec to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the
Code, (y) improve Trizecs chances of securing a favorable ruling described
in this Section 10.04(b) or (z) assist Parent in obtaining a favorable
legal opinion from its outside counsel as described in this Section 10.04(b).
The escrow agreement shall also provide that any portion of Trizec Expenses
held in escrow for five (5) years shall be released by the escrow agent to
Parent. 

 

SECTION 10.05. _Waiver._  

  

 At any time prior to the Trizec Merger Effective Time, the Trizec Parties and TZ Canada (jointly), on the one hand, and Parent, MergerCo and AcquisitionCo, on the other hand, may (a) extend the time for the performance of any obligation or other act of the other party, (b) waive any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of the other party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any agreement of the other party or any condition to its own obligations contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the Trizec Parties and TZ Canada (jointly) or Parent (on behalf of Parent, MergerCo and AcquisitionCo). The failure of any party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.

SECTION 11.03. _Severability_. 

  

 If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy or the application of this Agreement to any person or circumstance is invalid or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. To such end, the provisions of this Agreement are agreed to be severable. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible. 

  

SECTION 11.04. _Amendment_. 

  

 This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto by action taken by their respective board of directors (or similar governing body or entity) at any time prior to the Trizec Merger Effective Time; provided, however, that, after approval of the Trizec Merger by the Trizec Stockholders, no amendment may be made without further stockholder approval which, by Law or in accordance with the rules of the NYSE, requires further approval by such stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto. 

  

SECTION 11.05. _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. 

  

 This Agreement, together with the Confidentiality Agreement and the Disclosure Schedule, constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement shall not be assigned (whether pursuant to a merger, by operation of law or otherwise). 

    ##### 

  

    

SECTION 11.06. _Remedies_.

 

Except as otherwise provided in Section 11.07 or elsewhere in this Agreement,
any and all remedies expressly conferred upon a party to this Agreement shall
be cumulative with, and not exclusive of, any other remedy contained in this
Agreement, at law or in equity and the exercise by a party to this Agreement
of any one remedy shall not preclude the exercise by it of any other remedy.
Without limiting the right to receive any payment it may be entitled to
receive under Sections 2.07 and 8.09(b), each of the Trizec Parties and TZ
Canada agrees that to the extent it has incurred losses or damages (including
any amounts paid by Parent pursuant to Section 8.09(b)) in connection with
this Agreement the maximum aggregate liability of the Buyer Parties for such
losses or damages shall be limited to an amount equal to the amount of the
Guaranty, and in no event shall the Trizec Parties or TZ Canada seek to
recover any money damages in excess of such amount from the Buyer Parties or
their respective Representatives and affiliates in connection therewith. 

  

SECTION 11.07. _Specific Performance._

 

The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event any
provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms
hereof and that, prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 10.01, the Buyer Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by the Trizec Parties or TZ
Canada and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement
in any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this
being, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or
equity. The parties acknowledge that none of the Trizec Parties or TZ Canada
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement or to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement and that the Trizec Parties and TZ Canadas sole and exclusive
remedy with respect to any such breach shall be the remedy set forth in
Section 11.06 and the Guaranty; provided, however, the Trizec Parties and TZ
Canada shall be entitled to seek specific performance to prevent any breach
by the Buyer Parties of Section 8.03(b). 

  

SECTION 11.08. _Reserved._  

  

SECTION 11.09. _Parties in Interest._

  

This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each
party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended
to or shall confer upon any other person any right, benefit or remedy of any
nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, other than (a) the
provisions of Article III and Sections 8.06 and 8.07 (which are intended to
be for the benefit of the persons covered thereby or the persons entitled to
payment thereunder and may be enforced by such persons); and (b) the right of
Trizec and/or TZ Canada, on behalf of their respective stockholders, to
pursue damages in the event of Parents, MergerCos or AcquisitionCos
intentional breach of this Agreement or fraud, which right is hereby
acknowledged and agreed by Parent, MergerCo, AcquisitionCo and the
Guarantor. 

  

SECTION 11.10. _Governing Law; Forum._

 

All disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, or the negotiation, validity or performance of this Agreement, or
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to its rules
of conflict of laws, except for the provisions hereof which relate expressly
to the CBCA (including, without limitation, the Plan of Arrangement), which
shall be construed, performed and enforced in accordance with the CBCA. 

    ##### 

   

    

Except as set out below, each of the Trizec Parties, TZ Canada, Parent,
MergerCo and AcquisitionCo hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to
submit to the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of
Delaware or any court of the United States located in the State of Delaware
(the " _Delaware Courts_ ") for any litigation arising out of or relating to
this Agreement, or the negotiation, validity or performance of this
Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby (and agrees not to
commence any litigation relating thereto except in such courts), waives any
objection to the laying of venue of any such litigation in the Delaware
Courts and agrees not to plead or claim in any Delaware Court that such
litigation brought therein has been brought in any inconvenient forum. Each
of the parties hereto agrees, (a) to the extent such party is not otherwise
subject to service of process in the State of Delaware, to appoint
and maintain an agent in the State of Delaware as such partys agent for
acceptance of legal process, and (b) that service of process may also be made
on such party by prepaid certified mail with a proof of mailing receipt
validated by the United States Postal Service constituting evidence of valid
service. Service made pursuant to (a) or (b) above shall have the same legal
force and effect as if served upon such party personally within the State of
Delaware. For purposes of implementing the parties agreement to appoint and
maintain an agent for service of process in the State of Delaware, Parent
does hereby appoint The Prentice-Hall Corporation System, Inc. as such agent,
Trizec does hereby appoint The Prentice-Hall Corporation System, Inc. as such
agent and TZ Canada does hereby appoint The Prentice-Hall Corporation System,
Inc. as such agent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall
derogate from the authority of the Court and all Canadian courts competent to
hear appeals therefrom with respect to the Plan of Arrangement and each of
the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally consents to submit to the
sole jurisdiction of such courts in that regard. 

  

SECTION 11.11. _Waiver of Jury Trial._  

 

Each of the parties hereto hereby waives to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law any right it may have to a trial by jury with respect to any
litigation directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of
the parties hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of
any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other
party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce that foregoing
waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other hereto have been induced to
enter into this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, as applicable, by, among other things, the mutual waivers
and certifications in this Section 11.10. 

  

SECTION 11.12. _Headings._  

 

The descriptive headings contained in this Agreement are included for
convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any way the meaning
or interpretation of this Agreement. 

  

SECTION 11.13. _Counterparts._  

 

This Agreement may be executed and delivered (including by facsimile
transmission) in two or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto
in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be
an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
agreement. 

  

SECTION 11.14. _Waiver._  

 

Except as provided in this Agreement, no action taken pursuant to this
Agreement, including, without limitation, any investigation by or on behalf of
any party, shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the party taking such
action of compliance with any 

    ##### 

  

    

representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement. The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any provision
hereunder shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any prior or
subsequent breach of the same or any other provision hereunder. 

     ##### 

  

     

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent, MergerCo, AcquisitionCo, the Trizec Parties and TZ Canada have caused this Agreement to be executed as of the date first written above by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized.

executed Letter of Transmittal and such other documents as AcquisitionCo or

such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.2(d) by way of a
cheque issued by the Depositary (or other form of immediately available
funds), less any amounts withheld pursuant to Section 3.4.

When authorizing such payment in exchange for any lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the Person to whom any Arrangement Consideration is to be delivered shall, as a condition precedent to the delivery thereof, give a bond satisfactory to the Corporation and its transfer agent in such sum as the Corporation and its transfer agent may direct or otherwise indemnify the Corporation and its transfer agent in a manner satisfactory to the Corporation and its transfer agent against any claim that may be made against the Corporation or its transfer agent with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.
