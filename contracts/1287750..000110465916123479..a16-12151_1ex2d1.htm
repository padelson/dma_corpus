(b) _Further Action_. If, at any time after the Adviser Merger Effective Time,
any further action is determined by IHAM to be necessary or desirable to carry
out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Adviser Merger Surviving
Entity with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property
of Subsidiary Adviser, the officers and general partner of IHAM shall be fully
authorized (in the name of IHAM, Subsidiary Adviser and otherwise) to take
such action.

 



 

Section 2.2 _Company Merger Effect on Securities_.

 



 

(a) _Effect of Company Merger_. At the Company Merger Effective Time, by
virtue of the Company Merger and without any action on the part of the
Company, Parent, Acquisition Sub or the holders of any securities of the
Company or Acquisition Sub:

 



 

(i) _Cancellation of Company Securities_. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the " **Company Common Stock** ") held
by the Company as treasury stock or held, directly or indirectly, by Parent or
Acquisition Sub immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, except
for the Company Incentive Awards issued pursuant to the Performance Incentive
Plan and held by the Trust, shall automatically be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and no consideration or payment shall be delivered in
exchange therefor or in respect thereof.

 



 

(ii) _Conversion of Company Securities_. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time
(including Company Common Stock issued in respect of Company Incentive Awards
pursuant to _Section 2.4(b)_ and excluding any shares canceled pursuant to
_Section 2.2(a)(i) _and any Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the
right to receive, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement: (A) $6.41 in
cash, without interest, from Parent (such amount of cash, the " **Parent Cash
Consideration** "), _plus_ (B) subject to the proviso in _Section 2.3(c)_,
$1.20 in cash, without interest, from Parent External Adviser, acting solely
on its own behalf (such amount of cash, the " **Parent External Adviser Cash
Consideration** "), _plus_ (C) $2.45 in cash, _minus_ the Mortgage Manager TSA
Insurance Amount, without interest, which amount represents such per share
amount of cash consideration to be paid pursuant to the Mortgage Manager
Purchase Agreement and

 



      
 

 



 

which amount shall be freely available cash in the Company at the time of the
Closing without giving effect to and prior to (i) any adjustments or payments
contemplated by the Mortgage Manager Purchase Agreement or (ii) any debt
repayments required or caused by the Merger, this Agreement or the Mortgage
Manager Purchase Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
(such amount of cash, the " **Mortgage Manager Cash Consideration** "), _plus_
(D) the Make-up Dividend Amount, if any (together with the Parent Cash
Consideration, the Parent External Adviser Cash Consideration and the Mortgage
Manager Cash Consideration, the " **Cash Consideration** ") _plus_ (E) 0.483
(such ratio, as may be adjusted pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)_, the "
**Exchange Ratio** ") of a validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share
of Parent Common Stock (and, if applicable, cash in lieu of fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock payable in accordance with _Section 2.2(c)_ and such
share of Parent Common Stock and any such cash in lieu of fractional shares,
together with the Cash Consideration, the " **Merger Consideration** "). Each
share of Company Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as provided in this _Section 2.2(a)(ii)_ shall no longer
be outstanding and shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist,
and the holders of certificates (the " **Certificates** ") or book-entry
shares (" **Book-Entry Shares** "), which immediately prior to the Company
Merger Effective Time represented such Company Common Stock, shall cease to
have any rights with respect to such Company Common Stock other than the right
to receive, upon surrender of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in
accordance with _Section 2.3_, the Merger Consideration.

 



 

(iii) _Conversion of Acquisition Sub Capital Stock_. Each share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Acquisition Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time shall be converted into
and become one (1) fully paid share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Company Merger Surviving Corporation and constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company Merger Surviving
Corporation.

 



 

(b) _Adjustments_. Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, if
at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the
Company Merger Effective Time, any change in the number or type of outstanding
shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock shall occur as a result
of a reclassification, recapitalization, exchange, stock split (including a
reverse stock split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or
any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such
period, the Exchange Ratio and any other similarly dependent items, as the
case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. Nothing in this
_Section 2.2(c)_ shall be construed to permit any party to take any action
that is otherwise prohibited or restricted by any other provision of this
Agreement.

 



 

(c) _Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of Company
Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)(ii)_, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to any Parent Common Stock or to
vote or to any other rights of a holder of Parent Common Stock. All fractional
shares to which a single record holder of Company Common Stock would be
otherwise entitled to receive shall be aggregated and calculations shall be
rounded to three (3)

 



      
 

 



 

decimal places. In lieu of any such fractional shares, each holder of Company
Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to such fractional shares shall
be entitled to an amount in cash, without interest, rounded down to the
nearest cent, equal to the product of (i) the amount of the fractional share
interest in a share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder would, but for
this _Section 2.2(d)_, be entitled under _Section 2.2(a)(ii)_ and (ii) an
amount equal to the average of the volume weighted average price per share of
Parent Common Stock on NASDAQ (as reported by Bloomberg L.P. or, if not
reported therein, in another authoritative source mutually selected by Parent
and the Company) on each of the five (5) consecutive trading days ending with
the third (3rd) complete trading day immediately prior to the Closing Date. As
soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to
be paid to holders of Company Common Stock in lieu of any fractional share
interests in Parent Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall make available such
amount, without interest, to the holders of Company Common Stock entitled to
receive such cash. The payment of cash in lieu of fractional share interests
pursuant to this _Section 2.2(d)_ is not a separately bargained-for
consideration.

 



 

Section 2.3 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Designation of Exchange Agent; Deposit of Exchange Fund_. Prior to the
Closing, Parent and Parent External Adviser shall enter into a customary
exchange agreement with a nationally recognized financial institution
designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "
**Exchange Agent** ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration as provided
in _Section 2.2(a)(ii)_. At or prior to the Company Merger Effective Time,
(i) Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent,
for exchange in accordance with this _Article II_, through the Exchange Agent
book-entry shares (or certificates if requested) representing the full number
of whole shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to _Section
2.2(a)(ii)_ in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, (ii)
Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent, cash
in an aggregate amount necessary to pay the Parent Cash Consideration portion
of the Merger Consideration, and Parent shall, after the Company Merger
Effective Time on the appropriate payment date, if applicable, provide or
cause to be provided to the Exchange Agent any dividends or other
distributions payable on such shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to
_Section 2.3(d)_ and (iii) Parent External Adviser shall deposit, or cause to
be deposited with the Exchange Agent, cash in an aggregate amount necessary to
pay the Parent External Adviser Cash Consideration portion of the Merger
Consideration (such shares of Parent Common Stock, Parent Cash Consideration
and Parent External Adviser Cash Consideration provided to the Exchange Agent,
together with any dividends or other distributions with respect thereto, are
hereinafter referred to as the " **Exchange Fund** "). For purposes of the
deposit, Parent shall assume that there will not be any fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock. Parent shall make available to Exchange Agent, for
addition to the Exchange Fund, from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to
pay cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with _Section 2.2(d)_. In
the event the Exchange Fund shall at any time be insufficient to make the
payments contemplated by _Section 2.2(a)(ii)_, Parent shall promptly deposit,
or cause to be deposited, additional funds with the Exchange Agent in an
amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount required to make such
payment. Parent, and with respect to the Parent External Adviser Cash
Consideration, Parent External Adviser, shall cause the Exchange Fund to be
(i) held for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock and (ii)
applied promptly to making the payments pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)(ii)_. The
Exchange Fund

 



      
 

 



 

shall not be used for any purpose other than to fund payments pursuant to
_Section 2.2_, except as expressly provided for in this Agreement.

 



 

(b) As promptly as practicable following the Company Merger Effective Time and
in any event not later than the second Business Day thereafter, Parent shall
cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or
Book-Entry Share that immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (i) a letter of
transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent and which shall be in
the form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may
reasonably specify and (ii) instructions (which instructions shall be in the
form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably
specify) for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares in exchange for (A) cash in an amount equal to the Cash Consideration
multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock previously
represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, (B) the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in book-entry form unless a
certificate is requested) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of
shares that such holder has the right to receive in respect of such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)(ii)_, (C) any
dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.3(d)_ and (D)
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable pursuant to
_Section 2.2(d)_.

 



 

(c) Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or
Book-Entry Share for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a
letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant
to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and Parent, and with respect to
the Parent External Adviser Cash Consideration, Parent External Adviser, shall
cause the Exchange Agent to pay and deliver in exchange thereof as promptly as
practicable, but in any event within two (2) Business Days following the
Exchange Agents receipt of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Share, (A) cash in an amount equal to the Cash
Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock
previously represented by such Certificate of Book-Entry Shares, (B) the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in book-entry form
unless a certificate is requested) representing, in the aggregate, the whole
number of shares that such holder has the right to receive in respect of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)(ii)_, (C) any
dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.3(d)_ and (D)
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable pursuant to
_Section 2.2(d)_, and the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof)
or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall be forthwith canceled; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall Parent External Adviser Cash Consideration
be used to make any payments required by _Section 2.4_. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section 2.3(c)_, each Certificate (or affidavit of loss
in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed, from and after the
Company Merger Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive the
applicable Merger Consideration as contemplated by this _Section 2.3(c)_ and
any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.3(d)_.
The Exchange Agent shall accept such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with

 



      
 

 



 

such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to
effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange
practices. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of
the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the cash payable upon the surrender
of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

 



 

(d) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. Subject to Applicable
Law, following surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Shares for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, there
shall be paid to the holder of the Parent Common Stock issued in exchange for
such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, without interest, (i) at the time of
delivery of such Parent Common Stock by the Exchange Agent pursuant to
_Section 2.3(c)_, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Company Merger Effective Time theretofore paid with
respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate
payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Company Merger Effective Time but prior to such delivery of
such Parent Common Stock by the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section 2.3(c)_,
and a payment date subsequent to such delivery of such Parent Common Stock by
the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section 2.3(c)_, payable with respect to such
shares of Parent Common Stock. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event will any former holder
of Company Common Stock be entitled to receive any dividend or other amount
pursuant to this _Section 2.3(d)_ with respect to a calendar quarter in which
any Make-Up Dividend Amount has increased the Merger Consideration.

 



 

(e) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is
not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the
appropriate amount of Merger Consideration (and any dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock as contemplated by _Section
2.3(d)_) may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered is registered, if such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer (and accompanied by all documents reasonably required by the Exchange
Agent) or such Book-Entry Share shall be properly transferred and the Person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by
reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share or establish to the satisfaction of Parent
that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

 



 

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
for one (1) year after the Company Merger Effective Time shall be delivered to
Parent or its designee, upon demand, and any such holders prior to the Company
Merger who have not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall
thereafter look only to (i) Parent as general creditor thereof for payment of
their claims for Merger Consideration (other than the Parent External Adviser
Cash Consideration) and any dividends or distributions with respect to Parent
Common Stock as contemplated by _Section 2.3(d)_ and (ii) Parent External
Adviser as general creditor thereof for payment of their claims for the Parent
External Adviser Cash Consideration. Parent shall pay all charges and
expenses, including those of the Exchange Agent, in connection with the
exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the Merger Consideration.

 



      
 

 



 

(g) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company, Parent
External Adviser or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in
respect of any shares of Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions
with respect thereto) or cash held in the Exchange Fund delivered to a
Governmental Authority pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar Law. If any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall not have been
surrendered immediately prior to the date on which any Merger Consideration in
respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Authority, any such Merger
Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the
extent permitted by Applicable Law, become the property of Parent, or with
respect to any such Merger Consideration consisting of Parent External Adviser
Cash Consideration, Parent External Adviser, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(h) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ , that (i) no
such investment shall relieve Parent, Parent External Adviser or the Exchange
Agent from making the payments required by this _Article II_, and following
any losses Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the Exchange
Agent for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock in the amount of
such losses, (ii) no such investment shall have maturities that could prevent
or delay payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement and (iii) such
investments shall be in short term obligations of the United States of America
with maturities of no more than thirty (30) days or guaranteed by the United
States of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States
of America, or in commercial paper rated "A-1" or "P-1" or better by Moodys
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Financial Services LLC,
respectively. Any interest or income produced by such investments will be
payable to Parent or its designee as directed by Parent.

 



 

(i) _Withholding_. Parent, Parent External Adviser and the Exchange Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration and any
amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any former holder of
Company Common Stock or holder of Company Options and Company Incentive Awards
such amounts as Parent, Parent External Adviser or the Exchange Agent are
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any provision of applicable Tax Law. If amounts are so
withheld and paid over to the appropriate Taxing Authority by Parent, Parent
External Adviser or the Exchange Agent on behalf of the Person, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made
by Parent, Parent External Adviser or the Exchange Agent.

 



 

Section 2.4 _Company Options; Company Incentive Awards_.

 



 

(a) _Treatment of Company Options_. As of immediately prior to the Company
Merger Effective Time, each vested and unvested Company Option that is
outstanding other than an Underwater Option shall become vested and
exercisable in full and shall, to the extent not exercised as of the Company
Merger Effective Time, be canceled and shall entitle the holder thereof to
receive at the Company Merger Effective Time the positive amount of Option
Consideration (subject to any applicable withholding or other Taxes required
by Applicable Law to be withheld, which withholding shall first be applied
against the cash portion of the Option Consideration) attributable to such
Company Option; _provided_ , _however_ , that the cash portion of

 



      
 

 



 

such Option Consideration shall be payable solely from cash provided to the
Exchange Agent by Parent (and not, for the avoidance of doubt, by Parent
External Adviser); _provided_ , _further_ , that the foregoing shall in no way
reduce the amount of Option Consideration payable in respect of a Company
Option under this Agreement, it being understood and agreed that
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Total Cash Consideration
in respect of each Company Option shall be the same amount as the product of
(i) the Cash Consideration as defined in _Section 2.2(a)(ii)_ without
reduction and (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such Company Option immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time.
Following the Company Merger Effective Time, any such canceled Company Option
shall no longer be exercisable for Company Common Stock and shall entitle the
holder of such canceled Company Option only to the Option Consideration, which
shall be paid as soon as practicable following the Company Merger Effective
Time. Any Underwater Option shall be canceled and shall terminate at the
Company Merger Effective Time with no consideration paid therefor.

 



 

(b) _Treatment of Company Incentive Awards_. Effective as of immediately prior
to the Company Merger Effective Time, each vested and unvested Company
Incentive Award that is outstanding shall become vested in full immediately
prior to the Company Merger Effective Time and the corresponding shares of
Company Common Stock shall be released from the Trust pursuant to and
consistent with the terms of the Performance Incentive Plans, after which each
such share of Company Common Stock shall be immediately converted into the
right to receive at the Company Merger Effective Time the Merger Consideration
(subject to any applicable withholding or other Taxes or other amounts
required by Applicable Law to be withheld in accordance with the terms of the
Performance Incentive Plans and any Company Incentive Award thereunder) (the "
**Incentive Award Payment** "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the cash portion
of such Incentive Award Payment shall be payable solely from cash provided to
the Exchange Agent by Parent (and not, for the avoidance of doubt, by Parent
External Adviser); _provided_ , _further_ , that the foregoing shall in no way
reduce the amount of Incentive Award Payment payable in respect of a Company
Incentive Award under this Agreement, it being understood and agreed that
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Cash Consideration in
respect of each such share of Company Common Stock released from the Trust as
described in this _Section 2.4(b)_ shall be the same amount per share as the
Cash Consideration as defined in _Section 2.2(a)(ii)_ without reduction. Each
such share of Company Common Stock that is converted into the right to receive
the Incentive Award Payment shall be canceled as provided in _Section
2.2(a)(i)_, and the holders of such Company Common Stock shall cease to have
any rights with respect to such Company Common Stock and any underlying
Company Incentive Awards other than the right to receive the Incentive Award
Payment. The Incentive Award Payment shall be paid at the Company Merger
Effective Time.

 



 

Section 2.5 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable
amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this
_Article II_.

 



       
 

 



 

Section 2.6 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, to the extent that holders of Company Common Stock are entitled
to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, shares of Company Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective
Time and held by a holder who has properly exercised and perfected his or her
demand for appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL and not effectively
withdrawn or lost such holders rights to appraisal (the " **Dissenting
Shares** "), shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, but the holders of such Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to
receive such consideration as shall be determined pursuant to Section 262 of
the DGCL (it being understood and acknowledged that at the Company Merger
Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding, shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and such holder shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto other than the right to receive
the "fair value" of such Dissenting Shares as determined in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL); _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder
shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost his,
her or its right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL (whether occurring
before, at or after the Company Merger Effective Time), such holders shares
of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted as of
the Company Merger Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon, and such shares shall not be
deemed to be Dissenting Shares. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent
of any demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock,
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the
DGCL received by the Company relating to appraisal demands, and Parent shall
have the right to participate in all negotiations and Proceedings with respect
to such demands. Prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, the Company shall
not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to or settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise any such
demand or Proceeding, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 



 

Section 2.7 _Transfers; No Further Ownership Rights_. After the Company Merger
Effective Time, there shall be no registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time. If
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Company Merger
Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Exchange Agent for transfer following the
Company Merger Effective Time, they shall be canceled against delivery of the
applicable Merger Consideration, as provided for in _Section 2.2(a)(ii)_, for
each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares.

 



 

Section 2.8 _Further Action_. If, at any time after the Company Merger
Effective Time, any further action is determined by Parent or the Company
Merger Surviving Corporation to be necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Company Merger Surviving Corporation
with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of the
Company, the officers and managers of Parent shall be fully authorized (in the
name of Acquisition Sub, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take
such action.

 ** _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY ADVISER_**

 



 

Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents filed by the Company prior to
the date of this Agreement (but in each case excluding any risk factor or
similar disclosure under the headings "Risk Factors" or "Forward Looking
Statements" or any similar non-specific, predictive, precautionary or forward-
looking statements), or as disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter, the
Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent, except with respect to the
representations and warranties in _Section 3.1_, _Section 3.2_, _Section

to conduct its business as it is now being conducted, to own and use its
assets in the manner in which its assets are currently used, and to perform
its obligations under all Company Material Contracts to which it is a party,

Company Material Contracts would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Each of the Company, its Consolidated Subsidiaries and the members of the
Subsidiary Adviser Group is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is
in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the property owned, leased or
operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such

Adverse Effect. The Companys Third Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation (as amended) and Second Amended and Restated Bylaws (as
amended), as currently in effect, are included in the Company SEC Documents
and the Company is not in violation of such documents. The Company has duly
elected to be regulated as a business development company (" **BDC** ")

Subsidiary Adviser Group does not currently file a Tax Return that it is or

Consolidated Subsidiaries, the members of the Subsidiary Adviser Group and
certain Portfolio Companies or customary commercial Contracts entered into in
the ordinary course of business, the principle subject matter of which is not
Taxes) that will not be terminated on or before the Closing Date without any
future liability to the Company, its Consolidated Subsidiaries or the members
of the Subsidiary Adviser Group.

 



 

(g) There are no Liens for Taxes on any of the assets of the Company or any of
its Consolidated Subsidiaries or any member of the Subsidiary Adviser Group
other than Permitted Liens.

6011 of the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations thereunder.

 



 

(i) Within the last two (2) years, none of the Company, any of its
Consolidated Subsidiaries or any member of the Subsidiary Adviser Group has

there are no limitations on the utilization of the net operating losses, tax
credit carryovers or other tax attributes of the Company under Section 382
through Section 384 of the Code (or any corresponding or similar provisions of
Applicable Law) or the separate return limitation year rules under the
consolidated return provisions of the Treasury Regulations (or any
corresponding or similar provisions of Applicable Law), other than any such
limitation arising as a result of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(k) The transactions contemplated by the Mortgage Manager Purchase Agreement
and any Pending Sale Agreement will not result in any material Tax liability
(other than an increase in any liability for alternative minimum tax or an
increase in any state or local Tax liability) imposed on or payable by the
Company or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries.

inclusion or incorporation by reference therein). The Joint Proxy Statement
will comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

 



 

Section 4.8 _Disclosure Controls and Procedures_. Parent and its Subsidiaries
maintain Internal Controls. Such Internal Controls are designed to ensure that
all information required to be disclosed in any Parent SEC Documents are
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the rules and forms of the SEC, and further designed and maintained to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of Parents financial
reporting and the preparation of Parents financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP. Parents management has completed an
assessment of the effectiveness of Parents system of internal controls over
financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 and such
assessment concluded that such Internal Controls were effective using the
framework specified in Parents Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015 and, except as set forth on _Section 4.8 of the Parent
Disclosure Letter_, such assessment did not identify, and to the Knowledge of
Parent, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has been made aware of, (i)
any significant deficiency or material weakness in the design or operation of
internal control over financial reporting utilized by Parent or its
Subsidiaries or (ii) any illegal act or fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries. The principal
executive officer and principal financial officer of Parent have made all
certifications required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and
any related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC with respect to the
Parent SEC Documents, and the statements contained in any such certifications
were true and correct on the date such certifications were made and such
officers would be able to make such certifications as of the date hereof and
as of the Closing Date as if required to be made as of such dates. Parent and
each of its Subsidiaries, if applicable, is in compliance in all material
respects with the applicable listing standards and corporate governance
standards of NASDAQ or other listing exchanges or self-regulating
organizations applicable to Parent and its Subsidiaries, and has not received
any written (or to the Knowledge of Parent, any verbal) notice asserting any
non-compliance with the listing standards and corporate governance standards
of NASDAQ.

with past practice, (b) there has not been any event, development or state of
circumstances that has had a Parent Material Adverse Effect and (c) there has

consistent with past practice since December 31, 2015, (c) for liabilities or
obligations incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby,

to the date of this Agreement or (e) for liabilities or obligations that would
not be material to Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as of the
date hereof, none of Parent or its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature, whether or not accrued, contingent or otherwise,
that would be required by GAAP to be reflected on a consolidated balance sheet
(or the notes thereto) of Parent.

 



 

Section 4.11 _Litigation_. As of the date of this Agreement, (i) there is no
Proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries that would, individually or in the aggregate, be

judgment or order of any Governmental Authority outstanding against, or, to

from the SEC with respect to any such disqualification, nor is there any
Proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened by any
Governmental Authority that would result in any such disqualification of any
employee, officer or director of Parent. Neither Parent nor any of its
"associated persons" is subject to a "statutory disqualification" (as such
terms are defined in the Exchange Act) and there is no Proceeding pending or,
to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened by any Governmental Authority that
would result in Parent or any of its "associated persons" becoming so subject.

(c) Except as set forth on _Section 4.14(c) of the Parent Disclosure Letter_,
neither the execution or delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of
the Mergers will, either alone or in conjunction with any other event

provider to, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to any material payment, except
as expressly provided in this Agreement, (ii) materially increase the amount
or value of any benefit or compensation otherwise payable or required to be
provided to any such director or service provider or (iii) accelerate the time
of payment or vesting of amounts due any such director or service provider or,
except as provided for in this Agreement. No amounts payable under any
employee benefit plan or otherwise will fail to be deductible for federal
income tax purposes by virtue of Section 280G of the Code as a result of the
occurrence of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, either alone or
in combination with another event.

 



 

(d) Parent has not, and has never been the "employer" or "connected or
associated" with the "employer" (as those terms in quotation marks are used in

Knowledge of Parent, valid.

 



 

(b) To the Knowledge of Parent, except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, be material to Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,

operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation
as, a regulated investment company taxable under Subchapter M of Chapter 1 of
the Code, and its proposed method of operation will enable it to continue to
meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a regulated investment
company under Subchapter M of Chapter 1 of the Code. Parent and each of its
Subsidiaries have (i) timely filed or caused to be timely filed (taking into
account any extension of time within which to file) all material Tax Returns
required to be filed by any of them and all such filed Tax Returns (taking
into account all amendments thereto) are true, complete and accurate in all
material respects and (ii) paid all material Taxes due and owing (whether or

for which adequate reserves or accruals have been established in accordance
with GAAP.

 



 

(b) The unpaid Taxes of Parent and its Subsidiaries did not, as of the date of
its most recent consolidated financial statements, materially exceed the
reserve or accrual for Tax liability (excluding any reserve for deferred Taxes
established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) set
forth on the face of such consolidated financial statements (rather than in
any notes thereto). Since the date of its most recent consolidated financial
statements, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any
material liability for Taxes outside the ordinary course of business or
otherwise inconsistent with past custom and practice.

 



 

(c) As of the date of this Agreement, there are no pending, threatened in
writing or ongoing audits, examinations, investigations or other Proceedings
by any Governmental Authority in respect of material Taxes of or with respect
to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has waived any statute of limitations with respect to material
Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with respect to a material Tax
assessment or deficiency. No written claim has been made by any Governmental
Authority in a jurisdiction where Parent or any of its Subsidiaries does not
currently file a Tax Return that it is or may be subject to taxation by that
jurisdiction in respect of Taxes that would be covered by or the subject of
such Tax Return, nor has any such assertion been threatened or proposed in
writing and received by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(d) All Taxes that Parent or any of its Subsidiaries are or were required by
Law to withhold or collect have been duly and timely withheld or collected in
all material respects on behalf of its respective employees, independent
contractors or other Third Parties and, have been timely paid to the proper
Governmental Authority or other Person or properly set aside in accounts for
this purpose.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has ever been a member of a
consolidated, combined or unitary Tax group (other than such a group the
common parent of which is Parent or any of its Subsidiaries), and neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability for Taxes of any other
Person (other than Taxes of Parent or any Subsidiary) under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of foreign, state or
local law), as a transferee or successor, by Contract or otherwise.

 



 

(f) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or is bound by
any Tax sharing, Tax allocation or Tax indemnification agreement or
arrangement (other than such an agreement or arrangement exclusively between
or among Parent and its Subsidiaries or customary commercial Contracts entered
into in the ordinary course of business, the principle subject matter of which
is not Taxes) that will not be terminated on or before the Closing Date
without any future liability to the Company or its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(g) There are no Liens for Taxes on any of the assets of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries other than Permitted Liens.

 



 

(h) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has participated in or been a
party to a transaction that, as of the date of this Agreement, constitutes a
"listed transaction" that is required to be reported to the IRS pursuant to
Section 6011 of the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations thereunder.

 



 

(i) Within the last two (2) years, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries
has been a party to any transaction intended to qualify under Section 355 of
the Code.

 



 

This _Section 4.16_ contains the sole and exclusive representations and
warranties of Parent and its Subsidiaries relating to Taxes.

costs and expenses (including fees, cash and expenses related to the Debt
Financing). The Debt Commitment Letter contains all of the conditions
precedent to the obligations of the parties thereunder to make the Debt
Financing available to Parent and Acquisition Sub. The only conditions

after the Company Merger Effective Time.

as applicable, shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause to be filed
with the SEC within forty-five (45) days after the execution of this
Agreement, the Joint Proxy Statement in preliminary form. Parent shall prepare
(with the Companys reasonable cooperation), and Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause to be filed with the SEC within forty-five
(45) days after the execution of this Agreement, the Form N-14, in which the
Joint Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus, in connection with the
registration under the Securities Act of the Parent Common Stock to be issued
in the Company Merger. Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to (i) cause the Form N-14 and the Joint Proxy Statement to
comply with the applicable rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, (ii)
have the Form N-14 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
practicable after such filing (including by responding to comments from the
SEC), and, prior to the effective date of the Form N-14, take all action
reasonably required to be taken under any applicable state securities Laws in
connection with the Parent Stock Issuance and (iii) keep the Form N-14
effective through the Closing Date in order to permit the consummation of the
Mergers. Each of Parent and the Company shall furnish all information as may
be reasonably requested by the other in connection with any such action and
the preparation, filing and distribution of the Form N-14 and the Joint Proxy
Statement. As promptly as practicable after the Form N-14 shall have become
effective, each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to its respective
stockholders. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Form N-14 will
be made by Parent, and no filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Joint
Proxy Statement will be made by Parent or the Company, in each case without
providing the other party with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
thereon. If, at any time prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, any
information relating to Parent of the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates, directors or officers, should be discovered by Parent or the
Company which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to either the

 



      
 

 



 

Form N-14 or the Joint Proxy Statement, so that either such document would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information
shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information shall be prepared and, following a
reasonable opportunity for the other party (and its counsel) to review and
comment on such amendment or supplement, promptly filed with the SEC and, to
the extent required by Applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of
Parent and the Company. Subject to Applicable Law, each party shall notify the
other promptly of the time when the Form N-14 has become effective, of the
issuance of any stop order or suspension of the qualification of the Parent
Common Stock issuable in connection with the Company Merger for offering or
sale in any jurisdiction, or of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or
the staff of the SEC and of any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for
amendments or supplements to the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form N-14 or for
additional information and shall supply each other with copies of all
correspondence between either party or any of its Representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Joint
Proxy Statement, the Form N-14 or the Company Merger.

 



 

(b) Subject to the earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Article VII_, the Company shall, as soon as practicable following the

stockholders (the " **Company Stockholders  Meeting**") for the purpose of
seeking the Company Stockholder Approval, and shall submit such proposal to
such holders at the Company Stockholders Meeting and shall not submit any
other proposal to such holders in connection with the Company Stockholders

notice of, and to vote at, the Company Stockholders Meeting and shall not
change such record date without the prior written consent of Parent and shall
not adjourn or otherwise postpone or delay such Company Stockholders Meeting
without the prior written consent of Parent. If the Company Board has not made
a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company shall, through the
Company Board, make the Company Recommendation, and shall include such Company
Recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement, and use its reasonable best
efforts to (x) solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption
of this Agreement and (y) take all other action necessary or advisable to
secure the Company Stockholder Approval. Except as expressly permitted in

and this Agreement are in the best interests of the Companys stockholders,

Days after a tender offer or exchange relating to the securities of the
Company shall have been commenced, a statement disclosing that the Company
Board recommends rejection of such tender offer or exchange offer, (iv) take
or resolve to take any other action or make any other statement in connection
with the Company Stockholders Meeting inconsistent with the Company
Recommendation or (v) approve, determine to be advisable, or recommend, or
propose publicly to approve, determine to be advisable, or recommend, any
Competing Proposal ((i)

"). Notwithstanding any Company Adverse Recommendation Change, unless this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the obligations of the
parties hereunder shall continue in full force and effect and such obligations
shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure
or communication to the Company of any Competing Proposal (whether or not a
Superior Proposal).

stockholders (the " **Parent Stockholders  Meeting**") for the purpose of
seeking the Parent Stockholder Approval, and shall submit such proposal to
such holders at the Parent Stockholders Meeting and shall not submit any
other proposal to such holders in connection with the Parent Stockholders
Meeting without the prior written consent of the Company. Parent in
consultation with the Company shall set a record date for Persons entitled to
notice of, and to vote at, the Parent Stockholders Meeting and shall not
change such record date without the prior written consent of the Company and
shall not adjourn or otherwise postpone or delay such Parent Stockholders
Meeting without the prior written consent of the Company. If the Parent Board
has not made a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change, Parent shall, through the
Parent Board, make the Parent Recommendation, and shall include such Parent
Recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement, and use its reasonable best
efforts to (x) solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the Parent
Stock Issuance and (y) take all other action necessary or advisable to secure
the Parent Stockholder Approval. Except as expressly permitted in _Section
5.6(e)_, neither the Parent Board nor any committee thereof shall (i)
withhold, withdraw or modify or qualify, or propose publicly to withhold,

(d) _Regulated Fund_. The Company shall cause each member of the Subsidiary

the Regulated Fund Board and the shareholders of the Regulated Fund, in
accordance with the requirements of the Investment Company Act applicable
thereto, of a new Advisory Agreement for the Regulated Fund with IHAM to be
effective as of the Closing with such agreement containing terms, taken as a
whole, that are substantially similar to the terms of the existing Advisory
Agreement between the Regulated Fund and the applicable Adviser, with the
exception of its effective and termination dates. Without limiting the
foregoing, subject to the requirements of Applicable Law and the fiduciary
duties of the Subsidiary Adviser Group and the Regulated Fund Board:

 



 

(i) The Company shall cause each member of the Subsidiary Adviser Group to use
its commercially reasonable efforts, (A) to request, as promptly as practical
following the date of this Agreement, the Regulated Fund Board to approve (and
to recommend that the shareholders of the Regulated Fund approve) a new
Advisory Agreement as described in the first sentence of this subsection _(d)_
; (B) to request, as promptly as practical following receipt of the approval
and recommendation described in clause (A) above, the Regulated Fund Board to
call a meeting of the shareholders of the Regulated Fund to be held as
promptly as reasonably practical for the purpose of voting upon a proposal to
approve (in the requisite manner) such new Advisory Agreement; (C) to prepare
and to file (or to cause to be prepared and filed) with the SEC and all other
applicable Governmental Authorities, as promptly as practical following
receipt of the approval and recommendation described in clause (A) above, all
proxy solicitation materials required to be distributed to the shareholders of
the Regulated Fund with respect to the actions recommended for shareholder
approval by the Regulated Fund Board and to mail (or to cause to be mailed)
such proxy solicitation materials as promptly as practical after clearance
thereof by the SEC (if applicable); and (D) to request the Regulated Fund
Board to submit, as promptly as practical following the mailing of the proxy
materials, to the shareholders of the Regulated Fund for a vote at a
shareholders meeting the proposal described in clause (B) above.

 



 

(ii) The parties hereto agree that the Regulated Fund shall be deemed to have
consented for all purposes under this Agreement to the transactions
contemplated hereby and the continued management of the Regulated Fund by the
applicable Adviser following the Closing if a new Advisory Agreement has been
approved by the Regulated

 



      
 

 



 

Fund Board and the shareholders of the Regulated Fund in the manner
contemplated by clause (i) of this subsection _(d)_ , unless at any time prior
to the Closing the Regulated Fund Board notifies the Company in writing that
the Regulated Fund has terminated its Advisory Agreement prior to or as of a
date following the Closing (and such notice is not withdrawn).

 



 

(iii) The Company agrees that the information provided by it or the Subsidiary
Adviser Group (or on their behalf) in writing specifically for inclusion in
the proxy materials to be furnished to the shareholders of the Regulated Fund
(other than information that is or will be provided by or on behalf of Parent
or its Affiliates or any other Third Party specifically for inclusion in such
proxy materials) will not contain, as of the date of such proxy materials, any
untrue statement of a material fact, or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Parent
agrees that the information provided by it or its Affiliates (or on their
behalf) in writing specifically for inclusion in the proxy materials to be
furnished to the shareholders of the Regulated Fund will not contain, as of
the date of such proxy materials, any untrue statement of a material fact, or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. Each of the Company and Parent shall have the right
to review in advance and to approve (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld) all the information relating to it and any of its Affiliates
proposed to appear in any registration statement or proxy statement or any
amendment or supplement thereto submitted to the SEC or such other applicable
Governmental Authority in connection with the approvals contemplated by this
subsection _(d)_.

 



 

(iv) In the event that the approval by the shareholders of the Regulated Fund
of the applicable new Advisory Agreement described in this subsection _(d)_
is not obtained prior to the Closing, the Subsidiary Adviser Group may request
the Regulated Fund Board to approve, in conformity with Rule 15a-4 under the
Investment Company Act, an interim Advisory Agreement with IHAM, to be
effective immediately following the Closing, for the Regulated Fund with IHAM
containing substantially similar terms as the existing Advisory Agreement with
the Regulated Fund (except for changes thereto to the extent necessary to
comply with Rule 15a-4 under the Investment Company Act). In the event that
the provisions of Rule 15a-4 under the Investment Company Act are utilized,
the Company and Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
required Regulated Fund shareholder approval as promptly as practicable
following the Closing Date (and in any event prior to the expiration of such
interim Advisory Agreement).

 



 

(e) _Non-Regulated Funds_. With respect to each Non-Regulated Fund (other than
the CDO Fund and the European Funds), the Company shall cause each member of
the Subsidiary Adviser Group to use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date hereof, the
consent of such Non-Regulated Fund to the "assignment" (as defined in the
Investment Advisers Act or, if applicable, other Applicable Law) of its
Advisory Agreement to IHAM resulting from the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby if and to the extent required by the terms of such
Advisory Agreement

 



      
 

 



 

and/or Applicable Law, and in the manner required by the terms of such
Advisory Agreement and/or Applicable Law, which commercially reasonable
efforts the parties agree shall be deemed to have been satisfied upon:

 



 

(i) in the case of the Non-Regulated Fund listed in _Section 5.4(e)(i) of the
Company Disclosure Letter_, (A) the sending of written notice to the limited
partners, members, shareholders or other investors of such Non-Regulated Fund
describing the proposed transactions hereunder and requesting each such
limited partner, member, shareholder or other investor to consent in writing
to such assignment or continuation and (B) with respect to any limited
partners, members, shareholders or other investors of such Non-Regulated Fund
that do not either provide consent in writing to such assignment or
continuation or object in writing to such assignment or continuation within
thirty (30) days from the sending of such first notice pursuant to clause (A),
the sending of second written notice to such limited partners, members,
shareholders or other investors describing the proposed transactions
hereunder, requesting each such limited partner, member, shareholder or other
investor to consent in writing to such assignment or continuation and
explaining that each such limited partner, member, shareholder or other
investor that does not object to the assignment of the applicable Advisory
Agreement within forty-five (45) days following delivery of such second notice
will be deemed to have consented to such assignment or continuation; and

 



 

(ii) in the case of each of such Non-Regulated Funds other than the Non-
Regulated Fund specified in subsection _(i)_ of this _Section 5.4(e)_, the
sending of a written request to the advisory board or board of directors (as
applicable) of such Non-Regulated Fund to consent in writing to such
assignment or continuation.

 



 

(f) _Fund Consents_. The Company shall take reasonable steps to keep Parent
reasonably informed of the status of obtaining the Fund consents to be
requested pursuant to subsections _(d)_ and _(e)_ of this _Section 5.4_
and, upon Parents request, make available to Parent copies of (i) the written
requests and notices contemplated by subsections _(e)(i)_ and _(e)(ii)_ of
this _Section 5.4_ and (ii) all executed such Fund consents. The Company
shall not knowingly dissuade or impede any vote or other action necessary to
obtain any such Fund consents in anticipation of the Closing. In connection
with obtaining the Fund consents to be requested pursuant to subsections _(d)_
and _(e)_ of this _Section 5.4_, Parent shall have the reasonable
opportunity to review drafts of (A) in the case of the Regulated Fund, the
proxy solicitation materials contemplated by subsection _(d)_ of this
_Section 5.4_ or (B) in the case of any Non-Regulated Fund, the written
requests and notices contemplated by subsections _(e)(i)_ and _(ii)_ of this
_Section 5.4_, in each case in advance of dissemination by the applicable
member of the Subsidiary Adviser Group or Fund, and shall have its reasonable
comments reviewed in good faith prior to such dissemination. Parent shall
reasonably cooperate with the Company and the Subsidiary Adviser Group in
connection with obtaining the Fund consents to be requested by subsections
_(d)_ and _(e)_ of this _Section 5.4_.

(i) From the date of this Agreement until the Closing, the Company shall, and
shall cause its Representatives to, at the Parents expense, use reasonable

 



      
 

 



 

efforts to provide customary cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in
connection with obtaining the Debt Financing, including the following (it
being understood and agreed that in no event shall any party be required to
take any action in respect of the following to the extent that doing so would
be commercially unreasonable):

Financing in accordance with the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter as in
effect on the date hereof;

 



 

(5) requesting its independent accountants to cooperate with and assist in

(6) making available appropriate officers and employees, on reasonable advance
notice, to participate in a reasonable number of meetings with prospective

in connection with the consummation of the Debt Financing and to permit the
proceeds thereof to be made available to Parent at the Closing.

 



 

(ii) Nothing in this _Section 5.4(g)_ requires the Company, its Subsidiaries
and their respective Affiliates to:

 



       
 

 



 

(1) provide any assistance to the extent it would interfere with the ongoing
business or operations of the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective
Affiliates;

 



 

(2) encumber any of the assets of the Company, its Subsidiaries and their

organizational documents of the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective
Affiliates or impose any liability on the Company, its Subsidiaries and their
respective Affiliates;

 



 

(5) authorize, execute or deliver any definitive documentation or certificates

that none of the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates
shall, prior to the Closing, incur any liability to any Person under any Debt
Financing and that Parent will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its
Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates, and their respective directors,
officers, employees, representatives and advisors, from and against any and
all losses, damages, liabilities, claims, costs, expenses, judgments,
penalties and fines suffered or incurred by any of them arising in whole or in
part in connection with such cooperation, the Debt Financing and any
information utilized in connection therewith, other than incurred as a result
of such parties gross negligence, willful misconduct or intentional fraud.
The obligations of Parent in this _Section 5.4(g)_ shall survive the
termination of this Agreement.

permits and Consents necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including the Mergers; _provided_ , that prior to Closing,
without the prior written consent of the Company, none of Parent or its
Affiliates or their respective employees, directors, officers or agents shall,
directly or indirectly, contact or communicate with any Fund, any investor in
a Fund, any Affiliate of a Fund (including any member of the Regulated Fund
Board), any consultant or representative to a Fund, or any Portfolio Company
(or any officers, directors, employees, lenders or co-investors of any
Portfolio Company), regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) nothing in this
Agreement shall require either Parent and its Consolidated Subsidiaries or the
Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries to make payments or provide other
consideration for the repayment, restructuring or amendment of terms of

applicable, determines in good faith (after consultation with its independent
financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that such Competing Proposal (A)
either constitutes a Superior Proposal or would reasonably be expected to lead
to a Superior Proposal and (B) that failure to consider such Competing
Proposal would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary
duties of the directors of the Company or Parent, as applicable, under
Applicable Law; _provided_ , that (x) such Competing Proposal did not result

from such Person, to the extent such Person is not already subject to a
confidentiality agreement with the Company or Parent, as applicable, a
confidentiality agreement containing confidentiality terms that are not less
favorable in the aggregate to the Company or Parent, as the case may be, than
those contained in the Confidentiality Agreements (unless the Company or
Parent, as the case may be, offers to amend the Confidentiality Agreements to
reflect such more favorable terms) (it being understood and agreed that such
confidentiality agreement need not restrict the making of Competing Proposals
(and related communications) to the Company or the Company Board or to Parent
or the Parent Board, as the case may be) (an " **Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement** ") and (z) the Company or Parent, as the case may be, shall
(subject to the terms of any confidentiality agreement existing prior to the
date hereof) promptly provide or make available to the other party any
material written non-public information concerning it or its Consolidated
Subsidiaries that it provides to any Third Party given such access that was

Recommendation Change** "), (ii) the Company Board shall not approve or
recommend, or allow the Company or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries to
execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding or
definitive merger or similar agreement with respect to any Competing Proposal
(other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) and (iii) the Parent
Board shall not approve or recommend, or allow Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding or definitive merger or similar agreement with respect to any
Competing Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement).
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior
to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval (in the case of the
Company) or the Parent Stockholder Approval (in the case of Parent), the
Company Board or the Parent Board, as applicable, may (x) make an Adverse
Recommendation Change if the board of directors effecting the Adverse
Recommendation Change determines in good faith (after consultation with its
independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that a Competing
Proposal is a Superior Proposal and that the failure to take such action would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the
Company Board or the Parent Board, as applicable, under Applicable Law or (y),
if the Company or Parent, as the case may be, has received a Competing
Proposal that its board of directors has determined in good faith (after
consultation with its independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel)
constitutes a Superior Proposal, authorize, adopt or approve such Superior
Proposal and cause or permit the Company or Parent, as applicable, to enter
into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal
concurrently with the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Section 7.1(c)(iv)_ or _Section 7.1(d)(iv)_, as applicable, in each case,
only after providing the Notice of Adverse Recommendation or Notice of
Superior Proposal, as applicable, and entering into good faith negotiations as
required by _Section 5.6(f)_.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no Adverse
Recommendation Change may be made and no termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 5.6(e)_ may be effected, in each case until after the
fourth (4th) Business Day following receipt of written notice from the party
intending to effect any Adverse Recommendation Change to the other party
advising the other party that its board of directors intends to make an
Adverse Recommendation Change (a " **Notice of Adverse Recommendation** ") or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 5.6(e)_ (a " **Notice of
Superior Proposal** ") and specifying the reasons therefor, including, if the
basis of the proposed action is a Superior Proposal, the material terms and
conditions of any such Superior Proposal. At the option of the party not
seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 5.6(e)_, the parties
shall negotiate in good faith during such period to amend this Agreement in
such a manner that the offer that was determined to constitute a Superior
Proposal no longer constitutes a Superior Proposal. In determining whether to
make an Adverse Recommendation Change or in determining whether a Competing
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, the board of directors effecting an
Adverse Recommendation Change shall take into account any revisions to the
terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by the other party in response to
a Notice of Adverse Recommendation, a Notice of Superior Proposal or
otherwise. Any material amendment to such Superior Proposal shall require a
new Notice of Superior Proposal and the applicable party shall be required to
comply again with the requirements of this _Section 5.6(f)_.

 



      
 

 



 

(g) Nothing in this Agreement shall restrict the Company or Parent from taking
or disclosing a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 or 14e-2(a) under the
Exchange Act, or otherwise making disclosure to comply with Applicable Law (it
being agreed that a "stop, look and listen" communication by the Company Board
or Parent Board to its stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act or a factually accurate public statement by the Company or Parent
that describes the Companys or Parents receipt, as applicable, of a
Competing Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto
shall not be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change).

 



 

(h) For purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

(i) " **Competing Proposal** " shall mean any inquiry, proposal or offer made
by any Person or group of Persons (other than the Company, in the case of a
proposal affecting Parent and its Consolidated Subsidiaries, or Parent or
Acquisition Sub, in the case of a proposal affecting the Company and its
Consolidated Subsidiaries, or in each case, any Affiliate thereof) to purchase
or otherwise acquire, directly or indirectly, in one transaction or a series
of transactions (including any merger, consolidation, tender offer, exchange
offer, stock acquisition, asset acquisition, binding share exchange, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint venture or
similar transaction), (i) beneficial ownership (as defined under Section 13(d)
of the Exchange Act) of twenty percent (20%) or more of any class of equity
securities of the Company or Parent or (ii) any one or more assets or
businesses of the Company, its Consolidated Subsidiaries and the Subsidiary
Adviser Group or Parent and its Consolidated Subsidiaries that constitute
twenty percent (20%) or more of the revenues or assets of the Company, its
Consolidated Subsidiaries and the Subsidiary Adviser Group, taken as a whole,
or Parent and its Consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than, in
the case of the Company, the Mergers and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



 

(ii) " **Superior Proposal** " shall mean a bona fide written Competing
Proposal (with all percentages in the definition of Competing Proposal
increased to sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3 %) made by a Third Party
on terms that the Company Board or the Parent Board, as applicable, determines
in good faith, after consultation with its independent financial advisors and
outside legal advisors, and considering the likelihood and anticipated timing
of consummation, are more favorable to the Companys stockholders or to
Parents stockholders, as applicable, from a financial point of view than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any revisions to the
terms of this Agreement committed to by Parent to the Company in writing in
response to such Competing Proposal made to the Company under the provisions
of _Section 5.6(f)_ or by the Company to Parent in writing in response to
such Competing Proposal made to Parent under the provisions of _Section
5.6(f)_).

 



 

Section 5.7 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) Parent and Acquisition Sub agree that all rights to exculpation and
indemnification for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Company
Merger Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Company Merger Effective Time (including any matters arising in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby), now

 



      
 

 



 

existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers, managers or
employees (" **D andO Indemnified Parties**"), as the case may be, of the
Company or its Subsidiaries (including any member of the Subsidiary Adviser
Group) as provided in their respective organizational documents as in effect
on the date of this Agreement or in any Contract shall survive the Mergers and
shall continue in full force and effect. Parent shall indemnify, defend and
hold harmless, and advance expenses to DandO Indemnified Parties with respect to
all acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such at any time prior to
the Company Merger Effective Time (including any matters arising in connection
with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby), to the fullest
extent that the Company or its Subsidiaries (including any member of the
Subsidiary Adviser Group) would be permitted by Applicable Law and to the
fullest extent required by the organizational documents of the Company or its
Subsidiaries (including any member of the Subsidiary Adviser Group) as in
effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights
to indemnification in respect of any action pending or asserted or any claim
made within such period shall continue until the disposition of such action or
resolution of such claim. Parent shall cause its organizational documents to
contain provisions with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses
and limitation of director, officer and employee liability that are no less
favorable to the DandO Indemnified Parties than those set forth in the Companys
and its Subsidiaries (including the members of the Subsidiary Adviser
Groups) organizational documents as of the date of this Agreement, which
provisions thereafter shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in
any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the DandO
Indemnified Parties.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the provisions of _Section 5.7(a)_, to the fullest
extent that the Company and Parent would be permitted by Applicable Law to do
so, Parent shall: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each DandO Indemnified Party
against and from any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in
settlement in connection with any claim, Proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim,
Proceeding or investigation arises out of or pertains to: (A) any alleged
action or omission in such DandO Indemnified Partys capacity as a director,
officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including any
member of the Subsidiary Adviser Group) prior to the Company Merger Effective
Time or (B) this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii)
pay in advance of the final disposition of any such claim, Proceeding or
investigation the expenses (including attorneys fees) of any DandO Indemnified
Party upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such DandO Indemnified
Party to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such DandO
Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified by Applicable Law. Any
determination required to be made with respect to whether the conduct of any
DandO Indemnified Party complies or complied with any applicable standard shall
be made by independent legal counsel selected by the DandO Indemnified Party,
which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to Parent, and the fees of such
counsel shall be paid by Parent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this _Section 5.7(b)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, Parent
shall not settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or
otherwise seek termination with respect to any claim, Proceeding or
investigation, unless either (x) such settlement, compromise, consent or
termination includes an unconditional release of all of the DandO Indemnified
Parties covered by the claim, Proceeding or investigation from all liability
arising out of such claim, Proceeding or investigation or (y) the DandO
Indemnified

 



      
 

 



 

Parties covered by the claim, Proceeding or investigation consent to such
settlement, compromise, consent or termination.

 



 

(c) Unless the Company shall have purchased a "tail" policy prior to the
Company Merger Effective Time as provided below, for at least six (6) years
after the Company Merger Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, maintain in full force and effect, on terms and conditions no
less advantageous to the DandO Indemnified Parties, or any other Person entitled
to the benefit of this _Section 5.7_, as applicable, than the existing
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary insurance
maintained by the Company as of the date of this Agreement, covering claims
arising from facts, events, acts or omissions that occurred at or prior to the
Company Merger Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated hereby
( _provided_ , that Parent shall not be required to pay an annual premium for
such insurance in excess of two-hundred fifty percent (250%) of the aggregate
annual premiums currently paid by the Company on an annualized basis, but in
such case shall purchase as much of such coverage as possible for such
amount). Parent shall not, and shall not permit its Subsidiaries to, take any
action that would prejudice the rights of, or otherwise impede recovery by,
the beneficiaries of any such insurance, whether in respect of claims arising
before or after the Company Merger Effective Time. In lieu of such insurance,
prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, the Company may purchase a six (6)
year "tail" prepaid policy on such terms and conditions as reasonably
determined by the Company, or, prior to or at the Closing, Parent may purchase
a "tail" prepaid policy covering the six (6) year period following the Closing
on such terms and conditions that satisfy the first sentence of this _Section
5.7(c)_, in each case in which event Parent shall cease to have any
obligations under the first sentence of this _Section 5.7(c)_.

 



 

(d) The DandO Indemnified Parties to whom this _Section 5.7_ applies shall be
third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 5.7_. The provisions of this
_Section 5.7_ are intended to be for the benefit of each DandO Indemnified
Party and his or her successors, heirs or representatives. Parent shall pay
all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be
incurred by any DandO Indemnified Party in enforcing its indemnity and other
rights under this _Section 5.7_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, this _Section 5.7_ shall survive the consummation of the Mergers
indefinitely and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Parent, and
shall be enforceable by the DandO Indemnified Parties and their successors,
heirs or representatives.

 



 

Section 5.8 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Subject to Applicable Law, the
Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt
notice to the Company, of (a) any notice or other communication received by
such party from any Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement,
the Mergers or the transactions contemplated hereby, or from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection
with the Mergers or the transactions contemplated hereby and (b) any claims,
investigations or Proceedings commenced or, to such partys Knowledge,
threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party
or any of its Subsidiaries that relate to this Agreement, the Mergers or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 5.9 _Public Announcements_. Except as otherwise contemplated by
_Section 5.6 _(and, for the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein shall limit
the rights of the Company or the

 



      
 

 



 

Company Board under _Section 5.6_ or Parent or the Parent Board under
_Section 5.6_), prior to any Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company,
Parent and Acquisition Sub shall consult with each other before issuing any
press release or public announcement with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, and none of the parties or their Affiliates
shall issue any such press release or public announcement prior to obtaining
the other parties consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed), except that no such consent shall be necessary to the extent
disclosure may be required by Law, Order or applicable stock exchange rule or
any listing agreement of any party hereto so long as the disclosing party
gives notice to and consults with the other party prior to making such
disclosure to the extent practicable. The Company may, after consultation with
Parent and consideration of any views and comments of Parent, communicate to
its employees, customers, suppliers and consultants so long as such
communications are consistent with a communications plan previously agreed to
by Parent and the Company in which case such communications may be made
consistent with such plan.

 



 

Section 5.10 _Employee Benefits; Labor_.

 



 

(a) (i) Effective immediately prior to, and contingent upon the occurrence of,
the Adviser Merger Effective Time or Company Merger Effective Time, as
applicable, or, solely with respect to an employee who does not receive an
offer of employment from Parent External Adviser, IHAM or their respective
Affiliates pursuant to _Section 5.10(a)(ii)_ or who receives such an offer
but does not accept such offer within the time period prescribed by _Section
5.10(a)(ii)_, such earlier time as determined by the Company in its sole
discretion at any time sixty (60) days following the execution of this
Agreement, the Company shall cause the employment of each employee of the
Company, Subsidiary Adviser and their respective Consolidated Subsidiaries to
terminate and, upon such termination (subject to any delay required in order
to comply with Section 409A of the Code), the Company or Subsidiary Adviser
shall provide to any such terminated employee all severance, retention and
other payments or benefits as may become payable as a result of such
termination or the occurrence of the Adviser Merger Effective Time or Company
Merger Effective Time, as applicable, unless such employee has waived in
writing such payments or benefits; and (ii) on or prior to sixty (60) days
following the execution of this Agreement, Parent External Adviser, IHAM or
their respective Affiliates may, but shall be under no obligation to, make (or
cause any of its Affiliates to make) an offer of employment, effective as of
the Adviser Merger Effective Time or Company Merger Effective Time, as
applicable, or thereafter, to any employee of the Company, Subsidiary Adviser
or any of their respective Consolidated Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that any such offer of employment shall be contingent upon the Adviser Merger
Effective Time or Company Merger Effective Time, as applicable, actually
occurring and shall expire if the employee does not accept such offer within
thirty (30) days following the date such offer is made. From and after the
Closing, Parent shall, and shall cause the Company Merger Surviving
Corporation to, and IHAM shall, and shall cause the Adviser Merger Surviving
Entity to, honor obligations set forth in the preceding provisions of this
_Section 5.10(a)_ and all obligations as may be required by Applicable Law.

Effective Time shall constitute a "Change in Control" for purposes of all
Company Agreements and all Company Benefit Plans in which such term, or a
similar such term, is relevant.

 



       
 

 



 

(b) Promptly following the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall make
employees of the Company, Subsidiary Adviser and their respective Consolidated
Subsidiaries reasonably available to Parent External Adviser and IHAM, as
applicable, during regular business hours and shall provide Parent External
Adviser and IHAM, as applicable, with such personnel information as may be
reasonably requested by Parent External Adviser and IHAM, as applicable, for
purposes of identifying the employees to whom Parent External Adviser and
IHAM, as applicable, desire to make an offer of employment.

 



 

(c) If requested in writing by Parent to the Company at least five (5)
Business Days prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, the Company shall
take (or cause to be taken) all actions necessary or appropriate to terminate,
effective no later than the Company Merger Effective Time, any Company Benefit
Plan (other than the American Capital, Ltd. Retention Plan and any employment
or severance agreements). If the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
required to terminate any Company Benefit Plan, then the Company or its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall take such actions in furtherance of
terminating such Company Benefit Plan as Parent may reasonably request. As of
immediately prior to, but contingent on the occurrence of, the Company Merger
Effective Time, the Company shall vest payments and benefits under such
terminated Company Benefit Plans.

 



 

(d) Parent acknowledges that the Company or an applicable Subsidiary thereof
(i) shall be entitled to pay, immediately prior to the Company Merger
Effective Time, a pro rata portion of the annual cash performance-based
bonuses, calculated at target-level performance, to each bonus-eligible
employee of the Company, Subsidiary Adviser and their respective Consolidated
Subsidiaries in respect of the elapsed portion of the Companys 2016 fiscal
year regardless of the year in which the Company Merger Effective Time occurs
to the extent not then fully paid and (ii) shall be entitled to pay to such
employees immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time (if
applicable) a pro rata portion of their annual cash performance-based bonus,
calculated based on target-level performance, in respect of the elapsed
portion of the Companys 2017 fiscal year if the Company Merger Effective Time
occurs in such fiscal year.

 



 

(e) The Company shall be responsible for fulfilling all requirements under the
Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act or similar state or local
laws or ordinances (collectively, " **WARN** "), including but not limited to
issuing all notices required under WARN (the " **WARN Notices** ") and/or to
make any payments required to be made to any employee of the Company or the
Consolidated Subsidiaries under WARN; _provided_ , that Parent shall have an
opportunity to review and approve such WARN Notices no later than three (3)
Business Days before such WARN Notices will be issued to an employee of the
Company, Subsidiary Adviser or their respective Consolidated Subsidiaries,
such approval by Parent to not be unreasonably withheld.

 



 

(f) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in
this _Section 5.10_ with respect to employees of the Company, Subsidiary
Adviser and their respective Consolidated Subsidiaries are included for the
sole benefit of the respective parties hereto and shall not create any right
(i) in any other Person, including employees, former employees, any
participant or any beneficiary thereof, in any Company Benefit Plan, or (ii)
to continued employment with the Company, Subsidiary Adviser, Parent, Parent
External Adviser,

 



      
 

 



 

IHAM or their respective Consolidated Subsidiaries or Affiliates.
Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.10_ to the contrary, nothing in
this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall be treated as an amendment
or other modification of any Company Benefit Plan or any other employee
benefit plans of the Company, Subsidiary Adviser, Parent, Parent External
Adviser, IHAM or any of their respective Consolidated Subsidiaries or
Affiliates or shall prohibit Parent, Parent External Adviser, IHAM or any of
their Consolidated Subsidiaries or Affiliates from amending or terminating any
employee benefit plan.

Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions required in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to the terms of that
certain indenture, dated as of September 20, 2013, between the Company and

Agreement and (b) ensure that Acquisition Sub prior to the Company Merger
Effective Time, shall not conduct any business, or incur or guarantee any
Indebtedness or make any investments, other than as specifically contemplated
by this Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.13 _No Control of the Other Party s Business_.

 



 

(a) Except as set forth in this Agreement, nothing contained in this Agreement
is intended to give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control or
direct the operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries (including the
Subsidiary Adviser Group) prior to the Company Merger Effective Time. Prior to

the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision
over its and its Subsidiaries (including any member of the Subsidiary Adviser

respect to Company Common Stock) or acquisitions of Parent Common Stock
(including derivative securities with respect to Parent Common Stock)
resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act with respect to the Company or will become subject to such

promulgated under the Exchange Act, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law.

 



 

Section 5.15 _Section 15(f)_.

 



 

(a) Parent acknowledges that the Company is entering into this Agreement in
reliance upon the benefits and protections provided by Section 15(f) of the
Investment Company Act. Parent shall not take, and shall cause its Affiliates
not to take, any action that would have the effect, directly or indirectly, of
causing the requirements of any of the provisions of Section 15(f) of the
Investment Company Act not to be met in respect of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement with respect to the Regulated Fund, and shall
not fail to take, and, after the Closing, shall cause its Affiliates not to
fail to take, any action if the failure to take such action would have the
effect, directly or indirectly, of causing the requirements of any of the
provisions of Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act not to be met in
respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with respect to the
Regulated Fund. In that regard, Parent shall conduct its business and shall
cause each of its Affiliates to conduct its business, to the extent within its
reasonable control, so as to assure that:

 



 

(i) for a period of not less than three (3) years after the Closing, at least
seventy-five percent (75%) of the members of the boards of directors or
trustees of the Regulated Fund are not (A) "interested persons" (within the
meaning of Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act) of the investment
adviser of the Regulated Fund after the Closing or (B) "interested persons"
(within the meaning of Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act) of the
investment adviser of the Regulated Fund immediately prior to the Closing; and

 



 

(ii) for a period of not less than two (2) years after the Closing, there
shall not be imposed on the Regulated Fund an "unfair burden" (as set forth
and described in Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act) as a result of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any express or implied
terms, conditions or understandings applicable thereto.

 



 

(b) For a period of three (3) years from the Closing, Parent shall not engage,
and shall cause its Affiliates not to engage, in any transaction that would
constitute an "assignment" (as defined in the Investment Company Act) to a
Third Party of any Advisory Agreement between (i) either (A) Parent or any of
its Affiliates or (B) any member of the Subsidiary Adviser Group and (ii) the
Regulated Fund without first obtaining a covenant in all material respects the
same as that contained in this _Section 5.15_; _provided_ , that the
foregoing shall not apply in the event that Section 15(f) of the Investment
Company Act no longer applies to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
covenants of the parties hereto contained in this _Section 5.15_ are intended
only for the benefit of such parties and not for the benefit of any other
Person.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) The Company shall cause the members of the Subsidiary Adviser Group to
conduct their business, to the extent within their reasonable control, so as
to assure that, at Closing, at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the members
of the boards of directors or trustees of the Regulated Fund are not
"interested persons" (within the meaning of Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment
Company Act) of the investment adviser of the Regulated Fund.

 



 

Section 5.16 _Repayment of Indebtedness_. At least three (3) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent a draft copy of
a customary payoff letter (subject to delivery of funds as arranged by Parent)
from the "Administrative Agent" (as defined in the respective Existing Credit
Facilities) relating to the repayment of each Existing Credit Facility and the
release of related Liens (each, a " **Payoff Letter** "), and, on or prior to
the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent an executed copy of each
Payoff Letter to be effective upon the Closing. The Company shall, and shall
cause its Consolidated Subsidiaries to, deliver all the documents required for
the termination of commitments under each of the Existing Credit Facilities,
subject to the occurrence of the Closing and the repayment in full of all
obligations then outstanding thereunder, and shall deliver to Parent, no later
than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, any materials and
documentation about the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries and
Subsidiary Adviser Group required under applicable "know your customer" and
anti-money laundering rules, Laws and regulations (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing
Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001
(the "USA PATRIOT Act")) that are reasonably requested by Parent at least ten
(10) Business Days prior to Closing.

 



 

Section 5.17 _Certain Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) For United States federal income Tax purposes, each of the Company and
Parent intend for the Company Merger to be treated as a taxable acquisition of
the Company Common Stock (the " **Intended Tax Treatment** ").

 



 

(b) Each of the Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall use its reasonable
best efforts (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use their
reasonable best efforts) to cause the receipt of the Merger Consideration by
the Companys stockholders to qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment,
including by not taking any action that such party knows is reasonably likely
to prevent or impede such treatment. Each of the Company, Parent and
Acquisition Sub shall report the Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in a manner consistent with the Intended Tax
Treatment unless a contrary position is required by a final determination
within the meaning of Section 1313 of the Code.

 



 

Section 5.18 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in connection

official notice of issuance, at or prior to the Company Merger Effective Time.

 



 

Section 5.19 _Parent s Financing Activities_.

 



 

(a) Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things

 



      
 

 



 

necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and obtain the Debt Financing on
the terms and subject only to the conditions (including the market flex
provisions) set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, including using
reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect and comply with the Debt
Commitment Letter, (ii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with
respect to the Debt Financing on the terms (including any market flex
provisions) and subject only to the conditions contained in the Debt
Commitment Letter, so that such agreements are in effect as promptly as
practicable but in any event no later than the Closing Date, (iii) ensure the
accuracy of all representations and warranties of Parent, Acquisition Sub and
their respective Subsidiaries set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and
definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing, (iv) comply with the
covenants and agreements of Parent, Acquisition Sub and their respective
Subsidiaries set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and the definitive
agreements with respect to the Debt Financing, (v) satisfy or obtain a waiver
of, and cause Acquisition Sub and its other Subsidiaries to satisfy or obtain
a waiver of, on a timely basis all terms and conditions set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter and the definitive agreements relating to the Debt Financing
applicable to Parent, Acquisition Sub and their respective Subsidiaries, (vi)
upon satisfaction or waiver of such conditions and the other conditions set
forth in _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.2_ (other than those conditions that
by their nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing) consummate the Debt
Financing at or prior to the Closing (and in any event prior to the
Termination Date or Extension Date, as applicable), (vii) pay, or cause to be
paid, any and all commitment fees or other fees required by the Debt
Commitment Letter to be paid on or before the Closing and (viii) enforce its
rights under the Debt Commitment Letter and the definitive agreements relating
to the Debt Financing; _provided_ , _however_ , for the avoidance of doubt,
"reasonable best efforts" for purposes of this _Section 5.19_ shall not
require Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to commence a Proceeding against any
Financing Source to enforce the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter. Parent
will provide to the Company copies of all documents relating to the Debt
Financing and keep the Company informed of material developments in respect of
the financing process relating thereto on a current basis.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Closing, Parent will not agree to, or permit, any amendment,
modification, joinder, assignment, termination or waiver of the Debt
Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements with respect to the Debt
Financing without the prior written consent of the Company if such amendment,
modification, joinder, termination or waiver (i) reduces the aggregate amount
of the Debt Commitment Letter, (ii) imposes additional or new conditions
precedent to the availability of the Debt Financing or amends, modifies or
expands any of the conditions to the funding of the Debt Financing in a manner
that would reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the funding of the Debt
Financing on the Closing Date, (iii) adversely impacts the ability of Parent
to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter
or the definitive agreements with respect thereto, (iv) make it less likely
that the Debt Financing would be funded or (v) otherwise contravene the
limitations set forth in this _Section 5.19(b)_. Parent shall promptly
deliver to the Company copies of any amendment, modification, joinder,
assignment, supplement or waiver to or under any Debt Commitment Letter or the
definitive agreements relating to the Debt Financing entered into in
accordance with this _Section 5.19(b)_.

 



 

(c) Parent will give the Company prompt written notice (and, in any event,
within twenty-four (24) hours) after the occurrence of any of the following:
(i) of any termination of (A) the Debt Commitment Letter, (B) any definitive
agreement relating to the

 



      
 

 



 

Debt Financing or (C) any definitive agreement relating to a portion of the
Debt Financing, (ii) any actual or threatened material breach, default,
termination or repudiation of any provision of the Debt Commitment Letter or
the definitive agreement by any party thereto or any event or circumstance
that makes a condition precedent to the Debt Financing unable or unlikely to
be satisfied, in each case, of which Parent becomes aware or any termination
of the Debt Commitment Letter, (iii) the receipt of any notice or other
communication from any Person committing to fund the Debt Financing under the
Debt Commitment Letter or any other party to the Debt Commitment Letter or
definitive agreements (other than Parent or any of its Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives) with respect to the Debt Financing (including any
arrangers, administrative agents or trustees that are part of the Debt
Financing) (the " **Financing Sources** ") with respect to any (A) actual or
potential breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to the Debt
Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements of any provisions of the Debt
Commitment Letter or the definitive agreement, respectively, or (B) material
dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to the Debt Commitment
Letter or definitive agreements with respect to the obligation to fund the
Debt Financing or the amount of the Debt Financing to be funded at the
Closing, and (iv) if at any time for any reason Parent believes in good faith
that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Debt Financing on
the terms and conditions, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by
the Debt Commitment Letter. Parent will not, nor permit any of its Affiliates
to, without the prior written consent of the Company, take any action or enter
into any transaction that could reasonably be expected to impair, delay or
prevent consummation of all or any portion of the Debt Financing. As soon as
reasonably practicable, but in any event within twenty-four (24) hours
following the time the Company delivers to Parent a written request, Parent
will provide any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to
any circumstance referred to in clause (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of the
immediately preceding sentence.

 



 

(d) If, notwithstanding the obligations of Parent under this _Section 5.19_,
any Debt Financing or the Debt Commitment Letter (or any definitive agreement
relating thereto) expire or are terminated prior to the Closing, in whole or
in part, for any reason, Parent will (i) promptly notify (and, in any event,
within forty-eight (48) hours) the Company of such expiration or termination
and the reasons therefor and (ii) promptly obtain alternative financing (the "
**Alternative Financing** ") to replace the financing contemplated by such
expired or terminated commitments or agreements (on terms and conditions that
are not materially less favorable to Parent or Acquisition Sub, taken as a
whole, than the terms and conditions as set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter in effect on the date hereof, taking into account any "market flex"
provisions thereof). The Alternative Financing shall be in an amount
sufficient to pay all amounts not otherwise covered by cash on Parents
balance sheet that are required or necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and pay all related fees, costs and expenses
(collectively, the " **Required Financing Amount** "). The Alternative
Financing shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, include
any conditions precedent that are more onerous than or in addition to the
conditions precedent set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter. Parent will
deliver to the Company true and complete copies of all agreements including,
without limitation, fee letters ( _provided_ , that the fee amounts, pricing
caps and economic terms (other than covenants) set forth therein, none of
which could adversely affect the conditionality, enforceability, availability,
termination or aggregate principal amount of the Alternative Financing, may be
redacted) pursuant to which any Alternative Financing

 



      
 

 



 

source has committed to provide Parent with any portion of the Required
Financing Amount substantially concurrently with the execution thereof.

 



 

(e) If the Debt Commitment Letter is amended, replaced, supplemented or
otherwise modified, including as a result of obtaining Alternative Financing
in accordance with _Section 5.19(d)_, or if Parent substitutes other debt for
all or a portion of the Debt Financing, Parent will comply with its covenants
in this _Section 5.19_ with respect to the Debt Commitment Letter and all
definitive agreements executed in connection therewith as so amended,
replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified and with respect to such other
financing to the same extent that Parent would have been obligated to comply
with respect to the Debt Financing.

 



 

(f) Parent acknowledges and agrees that neither the obtaining of the Debt
Financing or any Alternative Financing, nor the completion of any issuance of
securities contemplated by the Debt Financing or any Alternative Financing, is
a condition to the Closing and reaffirms its obligation to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any ancillary agreements
related to this Agreement irrespective and independently of the availability
of the Debt Financing or any Alternative Financing, or the completion of any
such issuance, subject to the applicable conditions set forth in _Section
6.1_ and _Section 6.2_ and subject to the terms and conditions of _Article
VII_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, Parent shall not be deemed
to be in breach of this _Section 5.19_ or any applicable conditions set forth
in _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.3_ to the extent Parent reaffirms to the
Company that it is ready and able to consummate the Mergers irrespective of
the availability of the Debt Financing or any Alternative Financing.

 



 

Section 5.20 _Alternate Mortgage Manager Transaction_. In the event that the
Mortgage Manager Purchase Agreement is terminated prior to the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then the Company and Parent
shall use reasonable best efforts to negotiate a transaction (without any
legal obligation to consummate a transaction), whether by dividend, sale or
otherwise, including obtaining any necessary governmental or third party
consents and making any necessary filings, such that (a) Mortgage Manager is
not a direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Company on the Closing Date or (b)
Parent shall acquire the Mortgage Manager, in which case, in either clauses
(a) and (b), the Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to
obtain the consents required to effectuate such a transaction from the boards
of directors of the REITs and shall use reasonable best efforts to amend, as
appropriate, the investment management agreements between Mortgage Manager and
each respective REIT (any such transaction contemplated by this _Section
5.20_, an " **Alternate Mortgage Manager Transaction** ").

 



 

Section 5.21 _Restructuring_. Parent and the Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause the Restructuring to occur prior to the Closing.

 



 

Section 5.22 _Hard 8 Restructuring_. Parent and the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts, as soon as practicable following the date hereof, to
effect the Hard 8 Restructuring.

reasonable best efforts to obtain a $25,000,000 insurance policy (the "
**Mortgage Manager TSA Insurance** ") to cover, other than willful misconduct
and customary exclusions, any potential liability of the

 



      
 

 



 

Company under the transition services agreement (the " **Mortgage Manager
TSA** ") to be entered into in connection with the Mortgage Manager Purchase
Agreement. The Mortgage Manager TSA Insurance shall be purchased to cover acts
of the Company under the Mortgage Manager TSA through June 30, 2017. The cost
per share of Company Common Stock of the premium of the Mortgage Manager TSA
Insurance, calculated on a fully diluted basis using the treasury stock
method, shall be referred to as the " **Mortgage Manager TSA Insurance
Amount**."

of their respective former, current or future general or limited partners,
stockholders, members, managers, directors, officers, employees, agents,
Representatives or assignees (collectively, the " **Company Related Parties**
") for all losses and damages suffered as a result of the failure of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated or for a breach
or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of such
amounts, none of the Company Related Parties shall have any further liability
or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (except that the Company shall also be obligated with

Parent and its Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current or

or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of such
amounts, no Parent Related Party or Financing Source shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (except that Parent shall also be obligated
with respect to _Section 7.3(e)_ and _Section 7.6_).

while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which
amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision and (iii)
without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if the Company or Parent, as applicable, fails to timely pay any
amount due pursuant to this _Section 7.3_ and, in order to obtain such
payment, Parent or the Company, as applicable, commences a suit that results
in a judgment against the other for the payment of any amount set forth in
this _Section 7.3_, the Company or Parent, as applicable, shall pay the other
its costs and expenses in connection with such suit (including reasonable
attorneys fees), together with interest on such amount at an annual rate
equal to the prime rate as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on
the date such payment was required to be made through the date such payment
was actually received, or such lesser rate as is the maximum permitted by
Applicable Law.

 



 

(f) In the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section
7.1(b)(iii)_, then the Company shall pay Parent (by wire transfer of
immediately available funds) the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees
and expenses of counsel, accountants, investment bankers, experts and
consultants incurred by Parent and Acquisition Sub in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in an amount not
to exceed $15,000,000 (the " **Parent Expenses** "); _provided_ , that any
payment of the Parent Expenses shall not affect Parents right to receive any
Company Termination Fee otherwise due under _Section 7.3(a)_, but shall
reduce, on a dollar for dollar basis, any Company Termination Fee that becomes
due and payable under _Section 7.3(a)_.

 



 

(g) In the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section
7.1(b)(iv)_, then Parent shall pay the Company (by wire transfer of
immediately available funds) the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees
and expenses of counsel, accountants, investment bankers, experts and
consultants incurred by the Company in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in an amount not to exceed
$15,000,000 (the " **Company Expenses** "); _provided_ , that any payment of
the Company Expenses shall not affect the Companys right to receive any
Parent Termination Fee otherwise due under _Section_

 



      
 

 



 

 _7.3(b)_ , but shall reduce, on a dollar for dollar basis, any Parent
Termination Fee that becomes due and payable under _Section 7.3(b)_.

 



 

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, in
the event that the Company is obligated to pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent
the Company Termination Fee under _Section 7.3(a)_, the Company shall pay an
amount equal to the lesser of (i) the Company Termination Fee and (ii) the sum
of (A) the maximum amount that can be paid to Parent without causing Parent to
fail to meet the requirements of Section 851(b)(2) of the Code determined as
if the payment of such amount did not constitute income described in Section
851(b)(2) of the Code (" **Qualifying Income** "), as determined by Parents
independent certified public accountants, plus (B) in the event Parent
receives either (1) a letter from Parents counsel indicating that Parent has
received a ruling from the IRS holding that the receipt by Parent of the
Company Termination Fee would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be
excluded from gross income for purposes of Section 851 of the Code or (2) an
opinion from Parents outside counsel to the effect that the receipt by Parent
of the Company Termination Fee would either constitute Qualifying Income or
would be excluded from gross income for purposes of Section 851 of the Code,
an amount equal to the Company Termination Fee less the amount payable under
clause (A) above. The Company agrees to amend this _Section 7.3_ at the
reasonable request of Parent in order to (x) maximize the portion of the
Company Termination Fee that may be distributed to Parent hereunder without
causing Parent to fail to meet the requirements of Section 851(b)(2) of the
Code, (y) improve Parents chances of securing a favorable ruling described in
this _Section 7.3(h)_ or (z) assist Parent in obtaining a favorable legal
opinion from its outside counsel as described in this _Section 7.3(h)_.

 



 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company
(solely on behalf of itself) (i) waives any rights or claims and (ii) agrees
not to commence any Proceeding, in each case against any Financing Source in
connection with this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter, the Debt Financing
or in respect of any other document or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby or any theory of law or equity (whether in tort, contract or
otherwise) or in respect of any oral or written representations made or
alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith and agrees to cause any
such Proceeding caused by the Company (solely on behalf of itself) to be
dismissed and otherwise terminated. In furtherance and not in limitation of
the foregoing waiver, it is acknowledged and agreed that no Financing Source
shall have any liability for any claims or damages to the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any Company Related Party in connection with this Agreement,
the Debt Commitment Letter, the Debt Financing or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby; _provided_ , that nothing herein to the
contrary shall prohibit (A) Parent from enforcing its rights directly against
the Financing Sources under the Debt Commitment Letter or the Debt Financing
or causing the Financing Sources to fund (including by seeking specific
performance thereunder) pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter or the Debt
Financing (and Parent agrees to do so consistent with its covenants and
obligations in this Agreement), provided, however, that for the avoidance of
doubt, nothing in this _Section 7.3(i)_ shall require Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries to commence a Proceeding against any Financing Source to enforce
the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter, and (B) the Company and Subsidiary
Adviser from seeking specific performance pursuant to _Section 8.9_ to cause
Parent to consummate the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated
hereby.

 



      
 

 



 

(j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, each Financing
Source (solely on behalf of itself) (i) waives any rights or claims, other
than any rights or claims related to _Section 7.4_, _Section 8.5_, _Section
8.7_, _Section 8.8_, _Section 8.10_ and _Section 8.12_, and (ii) agrees not
to commence any Proceeding, in each case against the Company, due to any
breach or alleged breach of this Agreement or the Debt Commitment Letter.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Financing Source waives any defenses in
connection with any Proceeding commenced by any Person other than such
Financing Source. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing
waiver, but without altering the terms of the Debt Financing or affecting the
rights or remedies of the Financing Sources thereunder, it is acknowledged and
agreed that neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries prior to the
Company Merger Effective Time shall have any liability for any claims or
damages waived in this Agreement to such Financing Source in connection with
this Agreement or the Debt Commitment Letter.

 



 

Section 7.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of
the parties hereto in writing at any time before or after receipt of the
Company Stockholder Approval or Parent Stockholder Approval; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (a) after the Company Stockholder Approval or Parent
Stockholder Approval has been obtained, there shall not be any amendment that
by Applicable Law or in accordance with the rules of any stock exchange
requires further approval by the stockholders of the Company or Parent, as
applicable, without such further approval of such stockholders nor any
amendment or change not permitted under Applicable Law and (b) without the
prior written consent of the Financing Sources, no amendment shall be made to
this Agreement that would adversely affect the rights of the Financing Sources
as set forth in _Section 8.5_, _Section 8.7_, _Section 8.8_, _Section
8.10_ and _Section 8.12_.

 



 

Section 7.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Adviser Merger
Effective Time, subject to Applicable Law, any party hereto may (a) extend the
time for the performance of any obligation or other act of any other party
hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of the
other party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and
(c) waive compliance with any agreement or condition contained herein. Any
such extension or waiver shall only be valid if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company, Parent or Acquisition Sub
in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall
any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
of any other right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to
any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument
in writing signed on behalf of such party.

 



 

Section 7.6 _Expenses; Transfer Taxes_. Except as expressly set forth herein
(including _Section 7.3_), all expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by
the party incurring such expenses, whether or not the Mergers are consummated,
_provided_ , that Parent shall pay all costs and expenses in connection with
the filings of the notification and report forms under the HSR Act in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Other than
Taxes imposed upon holders of Company Common Stock, Company Options or Company
Incentive Awards, Parent shall pay all (i) transfer, stamp and documentary
Taxes or fees and (ii) sales, use, gains, real property transfer and other
similar Taxes or fees arising out of or in connection with this Agreement.

Section 8.3 _Interpretation; Certain Definitions_.

 



 

(a) The parties have participated collectively in the negotiation and drafting
of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted
collectively by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Disclosure of any fact, circumstance or information in any Section of the
Company Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to be
disclosure of such fact, circumstance or information with respect to any other
Section of the Company Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter,
respectively, if it is reasonably apparent that such disclosure relates to any
such other Section. The inclusion of any item in the Company Disclosure Letter
or Parent Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed to be an admission or evidence
of materiality of such item.

 



 

(c) The words "hereof," "herein," "hereby," "hereunder" and "herewith" and
words of similar import shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to
any particular provision of this Agreement. References to articles, sections,
paragraphs, exhibits, annexes and schedules are to the articles, sections and
paragraphs of, and exhibits, annexes and schedules to, this Agreement, unless
otherwise specified, and the table of contents and headings in this Agreement
are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by
the phrase "without limitation." Words describing the singular number shall be
deemed to include the plural and vice versa, words denoting any gender shall
be deemed to include all genders, words denoting natural

 



      
 

 



 

persons shall be deemed to include business entities and vice versa and
references to a Person are also to its permitted successors and assigns. The
phrases "the date of this Agreement" and "the date hereof" and terms or
phrases of similar import shall be deemed to refer to May 23, 2016, unless the
context requires otherwise. References to any statute shall be deemed to refer
to such statute as amended from time to time and to any rules or regulations
promulgated thereunder ( _provided_ , that for purposes of any representations
and warranties contained in this Agreement that are made as of a specific date
or dates, references to any statute shall be deemed to refer to such statute,
as amended, and to any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder, in each
case, as of such date). Terms defined in the text of this Agreement have such
meaning throughout this Agreement, unless otherwise indicated in this
Agreement, and all terms defined in this Agreement shall have the meanings
when used in any certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant
hereto unless otherwise defined therein. Any Law defined or referred to herein
or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such Law as
from time to time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the case of
statutes) by succession of comparable successor Laws ( _provided_ , that for
purposes of any representations and warranties contained in this Agreement
that are made as of a specific date or dates, references to any statute shall
be deemed to refer to such statute, as amended, and to any rules or
regulations promulgated thereunder, in each case, as of such date). All
references to "dollars" or "$" refer to currency of the United States.

 



 

Section 8.4 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of
this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority
to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions,
covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the Mergers
be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 



 

Section 8.5 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties
hereto (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other parties; _provided_ , that Parent may assign this
Agreement, effective at and after the Closing, to the Financing Sources and
any parties providing the Debt Financing pursuant to the terms thereof for
purposes of creating a security interest herein or otherwise assign as
collateral in respect of such Debt Financing. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the parties and their respective permitted successors and
assigns. Any attempted assignment in violation of this _Section 8.5_ shall be
null and void.

 



 

Section 8.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the exhibits,
annexes and appendices hereto) constitutes, together with the Company Support
Agreements, Elliott Support Agreement, Parent Support Agreements,
Confidentiality Agreements, Company Disclosure Letter and Parent Disclosure
Letter, the entire agreement, and supersedes all other prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with
respect to the subject matter hereof.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 8.7 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to
and shall not confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights
or remedies hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that it is specifically
intended that the DandO Indemnified Parties (with respect to _Section 5.7_ and
this _Section 8.7_ from and after the Company Merger Effective Time), Parent
External Adviser (with respect to _Article II_, _Section 3.29_, _Section
4.30_, _Section 4.31_, _Section 5.4(g)_, _Section 5.5(a)_ , _Section 5.9_,
_Section 5.10(a)_, _Section 5.10(b)_, _Section 5.10(f)_ and this _Section
8.7_) and the Financing Sources (with respect to _Section 7.4_, _Section
8.5_, this _Section 8.7_, _Section 8.8_, _Section 8.10_ and _Section
8.12_), regardless of whether the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter is consummated, are intended third-party beneficiaries
hereof.

 



 

Section 8.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all Proceedings (whether based
on contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or the actions of Parent, Acquisition Sub or the Company in the negotiation,
administration, performance and enforcement thereof, shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of laws provision or rule (whether of the
State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the parties agrees that any
interpretation of any commitment letters, including the Debt Commitment
Letter, or fee letters related to the Debt Financing and all matters relating
thereto, shall be governed and construed in accordance with the domestic laws
of the State of New York, without giving effect to any choice of law or
conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of New York or any
other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of New York.

 



 

Section 8.9 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage
for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy, would occur in the event that any party hereto does not perform the
provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are
required of it hereunder to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its
specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the parties
acknowledge and agree that, prior to any termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Article VII_ and subject to _Section 7.3(d)_, the parties shall
be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief
to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties agrees that it will not
oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable
relief on the basis that any other party has an adequate remedy at law or that
any award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason
at law or in equity. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with any such order or injunction.

 



 

Section 8.10 _Consent to Jurisdiction_.

 



 

(a) Each of the parties hereto hereby (a) expressly and irrevocably submits to
the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery or any
federal court sitting in the State of Delaware in the event any dispute arises
out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (b) agrees that
it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal

 



      
 

 



 

jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court, (c)
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby in any court other than the Delaware Court of
Chancery or any federal court sitting in the State of Delaware and (d) waives,
to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection
which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any Proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement. Each of Parent, Parent External
Adviser, Acquisition Sub and the Company agrees that a final and nonappealable
judgment in any Proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

 



 

(b) Each party irrevocably consents to the service of process outside the
territorial jurisdiction of the courts referred to in _Section 8.10(a)_ in
any such Proceeding by mailing copies thereof by registered or certified
United States mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to its address
as specified in or pursuant to _Section 8.2_. However, the foregoing shall
not limit the right of a party to effect service of process on the other party
by any other legally available method.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each of the
parties hereto agrees that it will not bring or support any action, cause of
action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description,
whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise,
against the Financing Sources and their respective current, former or future
directors, officers, general or limited partners, stockholders, members,
managers, controlling persons, Affiliates, employees or Representatives in any
way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the
Debt Financing or the performance thereof, in any forum other than the Supreme
Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable
law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York (and appellate courts
thereof).

 



 

Section 8.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts, all of which shall together be considered one and the same
agreement. Delivery of an executed signature page to this Agreement by
electronic transmission shall be as effective as delivery of a manually signed
counterpart of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 8.12 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. **EACH OF PARENT, PARENT EXTERNAL
ADVISER, ACQUISITION SUB AND THE COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT
TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON
CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
THE ACTIONS OF PARENT, ACQUISITION SUB OR THE COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT THEREOF, IN EACH CASE INCLUDING
ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING AGAINST ANY FINANCING SOURCE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE DEBT FINANCING.**
