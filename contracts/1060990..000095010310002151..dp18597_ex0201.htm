of days in such quarter.

relating to the distribution by KGS for the quarter immediately preceding the
quarter in which the Closing occurs (the "Preceding Quarter"), in addition to

(e) There are no voting trusts, proxies, agreements, commitments or
understandings of any character to which Seller or the Selling Subsidiaries
are bound with respect to the voting or transfer of the equity interests or
other securities of the KWK Entities. There are no voting trusts, proxies or
other agreements, commitments or understandings of any character to which any
KGS Entity is a party or by which any of them is bound with respect to the
holding, voting or disposition of any shares of capital stock or other equity
interests or securities of any KGS Entity.

  

  

Section 3.07. Ownership of KGS Note. Seller is the record and beneficial owner
of the KGS Note and will transfer and deliver to Buyer at the Closing valid

Section 3.08. Noncontravention. The execution, delivery and performance by
Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries of this Agreement and the other
Transactions Documents to which they are a party and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby do not and will not (i) violate
or conflict with the Organizational Documents of Seller, the Selling
Subsidiaries or any of the Sold Entities, (ii) assuming compliance with the
matters referred to in Section 3.03, violate or conflict with any Applicable
Law, (iii) require any consent or other action by any Person under, constitute
a default under, result in a violation of or conflict with, or give rise to
any right of termination, cancellation, modification or acceleration of any
right or obligation of Seller, the Selling Subsidiaries or any of the Sold
Entities or to a loss of any benefit to which Seller, the Selling Subsidiaries
or any of the Sold Entities is entitled under any provision of any Contract
binding upon Seller, the Selling Subsidiaries or any of the Sold Entities or
(iv) constitute (with or without the giving of notice or the passage of time
or both) an event which would result in the creation of any Lien (other than
Permitted Liens) upon any assets or properties of the Sold Entities, except in
the case of clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv), as have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect.

  

  

Section 3.09. KGS SEC Documents. KGS has timely filed with or furnished to the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") all reports, schedules, forms,
statements, prospectuses, registration statements and other documents required
to be filed or furnished by KGS since January 1, 2009 (collectively, together
with any exhibits and schedules thereto and other

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

18  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

information incorporated therein, and as the same may have been supplemented,
modified or amended since the time of filing, the "KGS SEC Documents"). As of
its filing date (and as of the date of any amendment), each KGS SEC Document
complied as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements
of the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act, as the case may be. As of its filing date
(or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date hereof, on the
date of such filing), each KGS SEC Document did not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact required to be stated therein or omit to state
any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

  

  

Section 3.10. Financial Statements; SOX Compliance. (a) The audited
consolidated financial statements and unaudited consolidated interim financial
statements of KGS included or incorporated by reference in the KGS SEC
Documents fairly present in all material respects, in conformity with GAAP
applied on a consistent basis (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto), the consolidated financial position of KGS and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and their consolidated results of
operations, partners' capital and cash flows for the periods then ended
(subject to normal year-end audit adjustments that are not expected to be,
individually or in the aggregate, material to KGS on a consolidated basis and
the absence of footnotes in the case of any unaudited interim financial
statements).

  

  

(b) KGS is and has been since January 1, 2009, in compliance in all material
respects with the provisions of SOX applicable to it and the certifications
provided pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 thereof were accurate when made.
None of KGS or the Subsidiaries has outstanding, or has arranged any
outstanding, "extensions of credit" to directors or executive officers within
the meaning of Section 402 of SOX.

  

  

(c) KGS and the Subsidiaries have established and maintain internal controls
over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and
15d-15(f) under the 1934 Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurances
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. KGS and
the Subsidiaries have designed and maintain disclosure controls and procedures
(as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the 1934 Act)
to ensure that material information required to be disclosed by KGS and the
Subsidiaries in the KGS SEC Documents, or in the documents to be filed or
furnished by Seller to the SEC, as applicable, that KGS or Seller, as
applicable, files or submits under the 1934 Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules
and forms and is accumulated and communicated to the KGS's or Seller's, as
applicable, officers

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

19  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

by others as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure in accordance with the requirements of the 1934 Act.

  

  

(d) KGS has disclosed, based on the most recent evaluation, to its auditors,
the audit committee of the Gas Services GP's Board of Directors and to Buyer,
and Seller has disclosed, based on the most recent evaluation, to its
auditors, the audit committee of its board of directors and to Buyer (i) all
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to
adversely affect any of KGS' and the Subsidiaries' ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial and information and (ii) any fraud, whether or
not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in the KGS' and the Subsidiaries' internal control over
financial reporting.

  

  

Section 3.11. Absence of Certain Changes. Since the Balance Sheet Date there

Section 5.04(c).

  

  

Section 3.12. No Undisclosed Material Liabilities. There are no liabilities of
any KGS Entity of any kind (whether accrued or fixed, absolute or contingent,

21

(c) As of the date hereof, each Contract required to be disclosed pursuant to
Section 3.13(b) or Section 3.17(b) (collectively, the "Material Contracts") is
a valid and binding agreement of a Sold Entity and is in full force and
effect. As of the date hereof, no Sold Entity or, to the knowledge of Seller,
any other party thereto is in default or breach in any respect under the terms
of any such Contract, except for any such defaults or breaches which would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material
to the Sold Entities, taken as a whole. Except as contemplated by the
Transaction Documents, as of the date hereof, no party to any Material
Contract has, to the knowledge of Seller, threatened or intends to cancel,
terminate or modify any Material Contract. Seller has made available to Buyer
prior to the date hereof a true and correct copy of each Material Contract.

  

  

Section 3.14. Litigation. There are no actions, suits, investigations or
proceedings pending against or, to the knowledge of Seller, threatened
(including any cease and desist letter and invitation to take a license)
against, Holdings LLC or Gas Services GP (other than in its capacity as

suit, investigation or proceeding pending against, or, to the knowledge of
Seller, threatened (including any cease and desist letter and invitation to
take a license) against, Gas Services GP (in its capacity as general partner
of KGS) or the KGS Entities before any Governmental Authority which is
reasonably likely to be, individually or in the aggregate, material to the KGS
Entities, taken as a whole, or which in any manner challenges or seeks to
prevent, enjoin, alter or materially delay the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents; provided that, for
purposes of Seller's indemnification obligations for Warranty Breaches
pursuant to Section 12.02(a), the representation and warranty made in the
second sentence of this Section 3.14 will be deemed to be made only as of the
date of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 3.15. Compliance with Laws and Court Orders. (a) Each Sold Entity is

or has been since January 1, 2009, in violation of (or has received any
notices of violation with respect to) any Applicable Law, except, in the case
of the KGS Entities and Gas Services GP in its capacity as general partner of
KGS, for

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

22  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

violations which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to be material to the Sold Entities, taken as a whole. None of the
Sold Entities, or any of their respective assets or properties, is, or has
been since January 1, 2009, subject to, or bound by, any order, injunction,
judgment, decree, ruling or other similar requirement (each, a "Legal
Requirement") enacted, adopted, promulgated or applied by a Governmental
Authority (other than Legal Requirements of general applicability) except, in
the case of the KGS Entities and Gas Services GP in its capacity as general
partner of KGS, such Legal Requirements as would not reasonably be expected to
be, individually or in the aggregate, material to the Sold Entities taken as a
whole, interfere in any material respect with the conduct of the business of
the Sold Entities taken as a whole, or materially delay or impair the ability
of Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries to consummate the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Documents.

  

  

(b) None of the Sold Entities are subject to regulation under any applicable
U.S. state laws or regulations (1) as a "public utility", "public service
company" or similar designation(s), or as a "holding company" or similar
designation of such regulated entity, or (2) respecting the rates charged by,
or the financial or organizational regulation of, public utilities, common
carriers or their affiliates. Neither the assets nor the business of the Sold
Entities as currently owned and operated is subject to regulation under the
Natural Gas Act or the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, as amended.

  

  

Section 3.16. Properties. (a) KGS and the Subsidiaries have good and valid fee
title to, or have valid interests by easement, Contract or otherwise in, all
property and assets (whether real, personal, tangible or intangible) reflected

material respects to all real and personal property that is necessary for KGS
and the Subsidiaries to conduct its business as currently being conducted. Gas
Services GP and each of the KWK Entities have good and valid fee title to, or
have valid rights of interests by easement, Contract or otherwise in, all
property and assets (whether real, personal, tangible or intangible) used in
the business of Gas Services GP or the KWK Entities, as applicable. None of
any of the aforementioned property or assets is subject to any Lien, except

taxes, assessments and similar charges that are not yet due or are being

Liens incurred in the ordinary course of business since the Balance Sheet Date
none of which are material to the ownership, use or operation of the assets of
the Sold Entities; or (vi) other Liens which are not, individually or in the

23  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

operation of the assets of the Sold Entities, taken as whole (clauses (i)
-(vi) of this Section 3.16 are, collectively, the "Permitted Liens").

  

  

(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect: (i) each Sold Entity has such easements,
licenses, rights-of-way, permits, servitudes, leasehold estates, instruments
creating an interest in real property, and other similar real estate interests
(each, a "Right-of-Way") that are necessary for the Sold Entities to own, use
and operate their respective assets and properties in the manner that such
assets and properties are currently owned, used and operated, and each such
Right-of-Way is valid and free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted
Liens), (ii) the Rights-of-Way grant the rights purported to be granted
thereby, (iii) each Sold Entity conducts its business and has and is being
operated in a manner that does not violate in any material respect any of the
Rights-of-Way, (iv) each Sold Entity has fulfilled and performed all of its
material obligations with respect to such Rights-of-Way and (v) no event has
occurred or circumstance exists that allows, or after the giving of notice or
the passage of time, or both, would allow limitation, revocation or
termination of any Right-of-Way or would result in any impairment of the
rights of the holder of any such Rights-of-Way. All pipelines operated by the
Sold Entities are subject to Rights-of-Way, and there are no gaps (including
any gap arising as a result of any breach by any Sold Entity of the terms of
any Rights-of-Way) in the Rights-of-Way other than gaps that have not and
would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate,
materially impair the conduct of the business of the Sold Entities, taken as a
whole, as currently, and as currently planned by the Sold Entities to be,
conducted.

  

  

(c) All tangible personal property owned, leased or licensed by the Sold
Entities is adequate for its present uses in all material respects.

  

  

Section 3.17. Intellectual Property. (a) Section 3.17(a) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedules contains a complete and accurate list, and identifies the
owner, of all material registrations and applications for registration
included in the Sold Entities Intellectual Property Rights. Except as would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect, the Sold Entities own, license or otherwise have a
valid right to use, free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens),
all Intellectual Property Rights necessary to the conduct of the business of
the Sold Entities as currently conducted.

  

  

(b) Section 3.17(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules sets forth a list of
all material agreements (excluding licenses for commercial off the shelf
software with annual fees of less than $100,000 that are generally available
on nondiscriminatory pricing terms) to which any of the Sold Entities is a
party and

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

24  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

pursuant to which any Sold Entity obtains the right to use any Licensed
Intellectual Property Right.

  

  

(c) No Sold Entities Intellectual Property Right is subject to any outstanding
judgment, injunction, order, decree or agreement restricting the use thereof
by any of the Sold Entities or restricting the licensing thereof by any of the
Sold Entities to any Person, except for any judgment, injunction, order,
decree or agreement which would not reasonably be expected to be, individually
or in the aggregate, material to the Sold Entities, taken as a whole.

  

  

(d) The conduct of each Sold Entity's business has not infringed or
misappropriated any Intellectual Property Right of any Third Party, except for
such infringements or misappropriations that would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

Environmental Laws;

  

  

(c) there is and has been no Release or threatened Release of any Materials of
Environmental Concern by any Sold Entity or, to the knowledge of Seller, any
other Person at, on, under or about any real property currently or, to the
knowledge of Seller, formerly owned, leased, or operated by any of the Sold
Entities (during the period owned, leased or operated by any of the Sold
Entities) or, to the knowledge of Seller, at any other location, in each case
that could reasonably be expected to give rise to any liability of any Sold
Entity under any Environmental Law;

  

  

(d) none of the Sold Entities has entered into any consent decree or other
written agreement with any Governmental Authority under any

organization, in each case with respect to such Business Employee's employment
by Seller or any of its Affiliates.

  

  

(b) Since the Balance Sheet Date, there has been no, and there currently is
no, labor strike, dispute, request for representation, union organization
attempt, walkout, slowdown or stoppage actually pending or, to Seller's
knowledge, threatened against or affecting Seller or any of its Affiliates

representation has been raised or is, to Seller's knowledge, threatened with
respect to the Business Employees.

Schedules sets forth a complete and correct list of each material Business
Employee Plan.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

26  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(b) Each Business Employee Plan (and each related trust, insurance contract or
fund) complies in all respects in form and in operation with the applicable
requirements of ERISA, the Code and all other Applicable Laws, and has been
administered in all respects in compliance with its terms except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to the
Sold Entities taken as a whole.

  

  

(c) Each Business Employee Plan which is intended to be qualified within the
meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified and has received a
favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service that such
plan is so qualified. To Seller's knowledge, nothing has occurred, whether by
action or failure to act, that could reasonably be expected to cause the loss
of such qualification. With respect to each Business Employee Plan, Seller has
provided to Buyer a current, accurate and complete copy (or, to the extent no
such copy exists, an accurate description) thereof and, to the extent
applicable: (i) any related trust agreement or other funding instrument and
(ii) the most recent determination letter, if applicable.

  

  

(d) Except as would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the
aggregate, be material to the Sold Entities, taken as a whole: no event has
occurred and no condition exists that would subject Seller or any of its
subsidiaries, including the Sold Entities, either directly or by reason of
their affiliation with any Person that, together with any of the Sold
Entities, is treated as a single employer under Section 414(b), (c), (m) or
(o) of the Code (an "ERISA Affiliate"), to any tax, fine, lien, penalty or
other liability imposed by ERISA, the Code or other Applicable Law.

knowledge of Seller, threatened, (ii) no facts or circumstances exist that
would give rise to any such actions, suits or claims and (iii) no
administrative investigation, audit or other administrative proceeding by the
Department of Labor, the Department of Treasury, the Internal Revenue Service
or other governmental agencies are pending or, to the knowledge of Seller,
threatened.

  

  

(f) No Business Employee Plan is subject to the requirements of Title IV of
ERISA. No Business Employee Plan is a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in
Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) and neither Seller, the Sold Entities nor any of
their ERISA Affiliates has at any time sponsored or contributed to, or has or
had any liability or obligation in respect of, any multiemployer plan. No
Business Employee Plan provides post-employment welfare (including health,
medical or life insurance) benefits and neither Seller nor any of its
subsidiaries, including the

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

27  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Sold Entities, has any obligation to provide any such post-employment welfare
benefits now or in the future, other than as required by Section 4980B of the
Code or any other Applicable Law. No Business Employee Plan provides short
term disability or similar benefits.

  

  

(g) No Business Employee Plan exists that, as a result of the execution and
delivery of the Transaction Documents, nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, will (alone or together with any
other event) (i) entitle any current or former employee or director of any of
the Sold Entities or any current or former Seconded Employee to severance,
termination, change in control, retention or any similar compensation,
benefits, or property, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or
increase the amount of any compensation due to, or in respect of, any current
or former employee or director of any of the Sold Entities or any current or
former Seconded Employee or (iii) result in or satisfy a condition to the
payment of compensation that would, in combination with any other payment,
result in an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of
the Code.

  

  

Section 3.21. Taxes. (a) All material Tax Returns required to be filed by or
with respect to the Sold Entities with respect to the Pre-Closing Tax Period
have been timely filed and to the best of Seller's knowledge, each such Tax
Return is true, complete and correct in all material respects. All material
Taxes whether or not shown to be due on any Tax Returns and all Taxes required
to be withheld by or with respect to the Sold Entities have been timely paid
or, if applicable, withheld and paid to the appropriate Governmental
Authority. Adequate provision has been made for any material Taxes not yet
due. There are (i) no asserted or threatened deficiencies or assessment of
Taxes from any taxing authority with respect to or attributable to the Sold
Entities, (ii) no ongoing audits or examinations of any of the Tax Returns
relating to or attributable to the Sold Entities and no such audit or
examination is threatened in writing, and (iii) the Sold Entities have not
granted any requests, agreements, consents or waivers to extend the statutory
period of limitations applicable to the assessment of any Taxes. No Sold
Entity has any material obligation under any Tax sharing or Tax indemnity
agreement or similar contract or arrangement. No closing agreement pursuant to
Section 7121 of the Code (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign
law) has been entered into by or with respect to any Sold Entity. No Sold
Entity has any material liability for Taxes of any other person as a
transferee or successor, by contract, or otherwise.

  

  

(b) There is no material lien for Taxes upon any of the assets of any of the
Sold Entities other than liens for Taxes that are not yet due and payable or

that the Board of Directors of Seller reasonably believes would be expected to
lead to a Superior Proposal, Seller may, directly or indirectly through its
Representatives, subject to compliance with this Section 5.04 and after
providing written notice to Buyer of its intention to take any such actions,

terms and conditions no less restrictive in the aggregate on such Third Party

"Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement"), (ii) furnish to such Third Party or
its Representatives or financing sources non-public information relating to
the Sold Entities pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, (iii)
engage in negotiations or discussions with any Third Party and its
Representatives and financing sources and (iv) subject to compliance with the

determines constitutes a Superior Proposal.

Agreement by Seller or any of its subsidiaries or its or their Representatives
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and conditions of

entitled to exercise its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
11.01(d) unless:

the date of this Agreement that was unsolicited and did not otherwise result
from a breach of Section 5.04(a) that the Board of Directors of Seller

respect thereto in accordance with Section 5.04(b)(iii)) reasonably determines
constitutes a Superior Proposal;

  

  

(ii) Seller has provided to Buyer three Business Days' prior written notice (a
"Notice") advising Buyer that Seller intends to take such action and
specifying the reasons therefor;

  

  

(iii) Seller has provided to Buyer all material documentation and information

in connection with such Acquisition Proposal (to the extent such documentation

Proposal that is the basis of the proposed termination by Seller (and that the
Board of Directors of Seller reasonably determines constitutes a Superior
Proposal) and the identity of the Third Party making the proposal (it being
understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or any
material amendment to any other material term of such Acquisition Proposal
shall require a new Notice and a new three Business Day period); (B) during
such three Business Day period, if requested by Buyer, Seller has engaged in
good faith negotiations with Buyer to amend this Agreement in such a manner
that such Acquisition Proposal which was determined to constitute a Superior
Proposal no longer is a Superior Proposal; and (C) at the end of such three
Business Day period, such Acquisition Proposal has not been withdrawn and the
Board of Directors reasonably believes that such Acquisition Proposal
continues to constitute a Superior Proposal (taking into account any changes
to the financial and other terms of this Agreement proposed by Buyer following
a Notice, as a result of the negotiations between Buyer and Seller pursuant to
clause (B) or otherwise).

Partner Units and Incentive Distribution Rights held by Gas Services GP) and
75% of Seller's aggregate ownership of Common Units and Subordinated Units and
(A) that the Board of Directors of Seller reasonably determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal and financial advisors) to be more
favorable to Seller from a financial point of view than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (after giving effect to any changes to the
financial terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such offer
or otherwise) and (B) which is, in the good faith judgment of the Board of
Directors of Seller, reasonably likely to be consummated on the terms set
forth in the proposal, taking into consideration (with respect to both
subsections (A) and (B) hereof) all financial, regulatory, legal, timing,
conditionality and other aspects of such proposal (including any break-up fee
and conditions to consummation) and the Person making the proposal.

  

  

Section 5.05. Litigation Cooperation. (a) Prior to any termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms, Seller shall give Buyer the
opportunity to participate in the defense of any shareholder litigation

relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents; provided, however, that no such settlement by Seller,
Gas Services GP or KGS of any such litigation shall be agreed to without
Buyer's prior consent (whether or not Buyer

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

40  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

is participating in the defense thereof), which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  

  

(b) In the event and for so long as Buyer or any of its Affiliates actively is
prosecuting, contesting or defending any action, suit, charge, proceeding or
demand by or against a Third Party in connection with any fact, situation,
circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event,
incident, action, failure to act, or transaction involving the Sold Entities,
Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries shall, and Seller shall cause its
subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to, cooperate with Buyer (or
its Affiliates, as applicable) and its counsel in the prosecution, contest or
defense, make available its personnel, and provide such testimony and access
to its books and records and facilities as shall be reasonably necessary in
connection with the prosecution, contest or defense, all at the sole control,
cost and expense of Buyer (unless Buyer is entitled to indemnification
therefor or Seller elects to assume the defense of such action under Article 8
or Article 12, as applicable).

  

  

Section 5.06. Financing Cooperation.

  

  

(a) Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries shall, and, prior to the Closing,
Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries shall cause the Sold Entities and its and
their Representatives to, provide such cooperation to Buyer as Buyer may
reasonably request in connection with the arrangements by Buyer to obtain the
Debt Financing (provided, that such cooperation does not unreasonably
interfere with the ongoing operations of Seller, the Selling Subsidiaries or
the Sold Entities or unreasonably interfere with or hinder or delay the
performance of their obligations hereunder or allow for any invasive sampling
or testing of any soil, surface water, groundwater, building materials or
other environmental testing without the prior written consent of Seller),
including by (i) participating in rating agency and bank investor meetings and
assisting Buyer in the preparation of a confidential information memorandum
and marketing materials for the Debt Financing, (ii) preparing and furnishing

reasonably requested by Buyer to provide for the settlement of the KGS Note
concurrently with but effective as of after the Closing, including submitting

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

41  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

matters relating thereto to the Conflicts Committee of the Board of Directors
of Gas Services GP.

  

  

Section 5.07. Non-Compete/Non-Solicit. (a) Except as provided in Section
5.07(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules or as permitted by the Transaction

use of an independent employment agency or search firm whose efforts are not
specifically directed at Current Employees or any employees of KGS or its
Affiliates.

  

  

(c) For a period of two years after the Closing Date, Buyer will cause KGS and
its controlled Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit or (ii)
hire or engage, as an officer, employee, consultant, independent contractor or
otherwise, any employee of Seller or any of its subsidiaries without the prior
written consent of Seller; provided, nothing in clause (i) of this Section
5.07(c) shall prohibit KGS or its controlled Affiliates from engaging in
general solicitations of employment to the public, general advertising or the
use of an independent employment agency or search firm whose efforts are not
specifically directed at such employees of Sellers and its subsidiaries.

  

  

(d) Each party hereto agrees and acknowledges that the other parties hereto do
not have any adequate remedy at law for the breach by the other party or any
of its Affiliates or its or their Representatives of the covenants and
agreements set forth in this Section 5.07 and that such breach would result in
irreparable injury to the non-breaching party. Each party agrees and
acknowledges that the other party may, in addition to the other remedies which
may be available to such party, file a suit in equity to enjoin the breaching
party or any of its controlled Affiliates from such breach, and consents to
the issuance of injunctive relief under this Agreement.

satisfactory to Buyer of the resignation, effective as of the Closing, of all
directors of Gas Services GP other than the persons set forth in Section 5.08
of the Seller Disclosure Schedules. Upon the request of Buyer, as specified by
Buyer reasonably in advance of the Closing, Seller and the Selling
Subsidiaries will seek to obtain the resignation of any or all directors of
the Sold Entities other than Gas Services GP and any and all officers of the
Sold Entities, in each case, effective at the Effective Time.

programs to the extent such coverage and limits are available under such
policies and programs; provided, that, except as otherwise expressly provided
herein, Buyer shall reimburse Seller or its Affiliates for the amount of any

Buyer agrees that:

  

  

Section 6.01. Confidentiality. All information provided or made available to
Buyer or any of its Representatives will be subject to the Confidentiality
Agreement dated as of September 10, 2009, between Seller and First Reserve XII
Advisors, L.L.C (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), which agreement shall
remain in full force and effect until the Closing and shall thereupon
terminate except that the disclosure, but not the use (to the extent necessary
to operate the Sold Entities in the ordinary course) of any Evaluation
Material (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) to the extent related
solely to Seller or its Affiliates (for the avoidance of doubt, other than the
Sold Entities) shall continue to be

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

43

Section 6.02. Access. Except as determined in good faith to be necessary to
(A) ensure compliance with any Applicable Law, or (B) preserve any applicable
privilege (including the attorney-client privilege), Buyer will, at Seller's
cost, cause the Sold Entities, on and after the Closing Date, to afford
promptly to Seller and its agents reasonable access to their properties,
books, records, employees and auditors to the extent necessary to permit
Seller to determine any matter relating to its rights and obligations
hereunder or to any period ending on or before the Closing Date; provided that
any such access by Seller shall not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of
the business of Buyer or the Sold Entities. Seller will hold, and will use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to hold, in confidence
all confidential information concerning the Sold Entities in accordance with
Section 5.03.

use of such Seller's Names and Marks by Sellers or its Subsidiaries preceding
the Closing. Buyer, for itself and its Affiliates, agrees that, after the
Closing Date, Buyer and its Affiliates will not do business or represent
themselves as Seller or any of its subsidiaries.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.03 to the contrary, nothing in
this Section 6.03 shall prevent Buyer from using descriptive elements of
Seller's Names and Marks or making any fair use of Seller's Names and Marks.

reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary or desirable under Applicable Law to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The parties hereto

Seller shall make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
as promptly as reasonably practicable and in any event within ten (10)
Business Days after the date hereof and shall supply as promptly as reasonably

(c) If any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby under the HSR Act or if any suit or proceeding is
instituted or threatened by any Governmental Authority or any private party
challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby as violative of the
HSR Act, each of Buyer and Seller shall use its best efforts to promptly
resolve such objections; provided that none of Seller nor any of its
Affiliates shall have any obligation to hold separate or divest any property

action, including agreeing to hold separate or to divest any of the businesses
or properties or assets of Buyer or any of its Affiliates and to terminate any
existing relationships and contractual rights and obligations, as may be

objections that such Governmental Authority may have to such transactions
under the HSR Act or (ii) by any court or other tribunal, in any action or
proceeding brought by a private party or Governmental Authority challenging
such transactions as violative of the HSR Act, in order to avoid the entry of,
or to effect

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

45  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

the dissolution, vacating, lifting, altering or reversal of, any order that
has the effect of restricting, preventing or prohibiting the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

Section 7.02. Certain Filings. The parties hereto shall cooperate with one
another (i) in determining whether any action by or in respect of, or filing
with, any Governmental Authority is required, or any actions, consents,
approvals or waivers are required to be obtained from parties to any material
Contracts, in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and (ii) in
taking such actions or making any such filings, furnishing information
required in connection therewith and seeking timely to obtain any such

Section 7.03. Public Announcements. Prior to and with respect to the Closing,
the parties agree to consult with each other before issuing any press release
or making any public statement with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby and, except for any press releases and public

release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation.

  

  

Section 7.04. Notice of Certain Events. Each party hereto shall promptly
notify the other of:

would result in) the inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement made or to be made by or to
be complied with by such notifying party at any time during the term hereof
and that would reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions set
forth in Article 10 not to be satisfied; provided, however, that no such
notification shall be deemed to cure any such breach of or inaccuracy in such
notifying party's representations and warranties or covenants and agreements
or in the Seller Disclosure Schedules for any purpose under this Agreement and
no such notification shall limit or otherwise affect the remedies available to
the other parties, including any right to indemnification;

  

  

(c) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

46  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(d) any proceedings, claims, actions or investigations commenced or threatened
in writing that would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
other Transaction Documents or materially impair the notifying party's ability
to perform its obligations under this Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents.

  

  

Section 7.05. Board of Directors. Buyer and Seller agree that immediately
after the Closing the Board of Directors of Gas Services GP will include no
fewer than 9 members and will, subject to the prior consent of Buyer, include
those individuals set forth in Section 5.08 of the Seller Disclosure Schedules
(unless any such Person declines or is otherwise unable to serve). Buyer
agrees that Seller shall be entitled to appoint one member to the Board of
Directors of Gas Services GP (or any successor general partner of KGS) until
the later of (x) the second anniversary of the Closing Date and (y) such time
as Seller and its controlled Affiliates cease to purchase goods and services
from KGS and the Subsidiaries which generate revenues constituting 50% or more
of the consolidated revenues of KGS and its subsidiaries in any fiscal year.

  

  

Section 7.06. Surety Bonds. As soon as practicable after the Closing, Buyer
will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain Seller's and any of its
Affiliates' release from any surety bonds of KGS and the Subsidiaries set

Texas limited partnership, to enter into, Second Amendment to Sixth Amended

Section 7.08. Master Services Agreements. Promptly after consummation of the
Closing, Seller will, to the extent so requested by Buyer in writing, use its
commercially reasonable efforts to assign to KGS all or that portion of any
master services agreement to which Seller or any of its subsidiaries is a
party and that is applicable to KGS or any of the Subsidiaries (each, a
"Master Services Agreement"). Seller shall not be required to assign all or
any portion of a Master Services Agreement if such assignment, without the
consent of a third party thereto, would constitute a breach or other
contravention of such Master Services Agreement or in any way adversely affect
the rights of Seller, KGS or any of their respective Affiliates thereunder.
Seller will, and Buyer will cause KGS to, use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts (but without any payment of money by Seller or Buyer) to
obtain the consent of the other parties to the assignment, in whole or in
part, of any Master Services Agreement. If such consent is not obtained, or if
an attempted assignment thereof would be ineffective or would adversely affect
the rights of Seller thereunder so that KGS would not in fact receive all such
rights, to the extent requested by Buyer in writing, Seller and Buyer will
cooperate in a mutually agreeable arrangement under which Buyer would cause
KGS to obtain the benefits and assume the obligations under the Master
Services Agreements, including sub-contracting, sub-licensing, or sub-leasing
to KGS, or under which Seller would enforce for the benefit of KGS, with Buyer
causing KGS to assume Seller's obligations and any and all rights of Seller
against a third party thereto.

  

  

Section 7.09. Real Estate Matters. (a) Promptly after the date hereof, Buyer
and Seller shall negotiate in good faith and use commercially reasonable
efforts to enter into a lease effective as of Closing pursuant to which KGS
will lease office space on commercially reasonable terms in the building owned
by Seller in Glen Rose, Texas; provided that failure to enter into any such
lease shall have no impact on the satisfaction of the conditions to Closing
set forth in Article 10.

  

  

(b) Prior to Closing, Seller will assign to KGS a portion of the lease set
forth on Section 7.09(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules pursuant to which
KGS will lease approximately 16,000 square feet of space on substantially the
same terms as set forth in the such lease; provided that failure to assign
such lease shall have no impact on the satisfaction of the conditions to
Closing set forth in Article 10.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

48  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Section 7.10. Automobiles. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to work together in good faith with Buyer to
identify any leased or owned motor vehicles used by a Current Employee. Seller
and Buyer shall cooperate in good faith to implement an arrangement so that
(i) from, or as promptly as practicable after, the Closing Date, each Current
Employee may continue to use the leased or owned motor vehicle used by each
such Current Employee immediately prior to the Closing and (ii) on, or as
promptly as practicable after, the Closing Date, title (in the case of owned
vehicles) and the applicable leases (in the case of leased vehicles) are
transferred to KGS. If the parties are unable to transfer title (in the case
of owned vehicles) or the applicable leases (in the case of leased vehicles),
Seller shall, and Buyer shall cause KGS to, work together in good faith to
pass the economic benefits and burdens of title (in the case of owned
vehicles) and the applicable leases (in the case of leased vehicles) to KGS
on, or as promptly as practicable after, the Closing Date.

Section 8.01. Allocation of Tax Items. Seller and Buyer acknowledge and agree
that (i) the sale of the Holdings LLC Interests by the Selling Subsidiaries to
Buyer will result in a "technical" termination of Holdings LLC and KGS (the
"Terminating Partnerships") under Section 708(b)(1)(B) of the Code, and (ii)
such termination will result in the closing of the taxable years of the
Terminating Partnerships under Section 706(c)(1) of the Code. Seller and Buyer
agree that the Terminating Partnerships shall determine the allocation of all
items for tax purposes between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing

Partnership as of the Closing Date.

  

  

Section 8.02. Tax Returns. (a) Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared,
file or cause to be filed when due, all Tax Returns of the KWK Entities and

shall reasonably cooperate in preparing and filing all such Tax Returns,
including using reasonable best efforts to maintain and make available all
records necessary in connection therewith.

  

  

(b) Not later than 30 Business Days prior to the due date, including
extensions, of any Tax Return covering a Pre-Closing Tax Period, Buyer shall
deliver to Seller for its review a copy of such Tax Return and, with respect
to any KWK Entity, a statement setting forth Buyer's calculation of the amount
of Tax shown as due on such Tax Return that is allocable to the Pre-Closing
Tax Period

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

49  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

under Section 8.01. Subject to Buyer's approval, not to be unreasonably
withheld, Buyer shall make or cause to be made such changes in such Tax
Returns as Seller may reasonably request, which changes shall be delivered to
Buyer at least 10 Business Days prior to the due date, including extensions.
Not later than 5 Business Days prior to the due date of any such Tax Return of
a KWK Entity, Seller shall pay to Buyer (or Buyer pay to Seller, if
appropriate) the amount of Tax shown as due on such Tax Return that is
allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period. Buyer shall file or cause to be filed
all such Tax Returns and shall pay all Taxes shown to be due thereon.

  

  

(c) Buyer shall not file any amended Tax Returns with respect to any KWK
Entity or KGS Entity that includes a period ending on or before the Closing
Date without Seller's written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld.

  

  

Section 8.03. Transfer Taxes. All Transfer Taxes shall be borne 50% by Buyer
and 50% by Seller. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 8,
any Tax Returns that must be filed in connection with Transfer Taxes shall be
prepared and filed when due by the party primarily or customarily responsible
under the applicable local law for filing such Tax Returns, and such party
will use reasonable best efforts to provide such Tax Returns to the other
party at least ten days prior to the due date, including extensions, for such
Tax Returns. Upon the filing of Tax Returns in connection with Transfer Taxes,
the filing party shall provide the other party with evidence satisfactory to
the other party that such Transfer Taxes have been filed and paid.

  

  

Section 8.04. Tax Indemnification. (a) Effective at and after the Closing,
Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer from and against, and
reimburse each such Person for, any loss or damage (including any interest or
penalty, reasonable expenses of investigation and reasonable attorney's fees
and expenses in connection with any action, suit or proceeding whether
involving a third party claim or a claim solely between the parties hereto)
("Tax Damages") with respect to (i) any Taxes imposed on the KWK Entities for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period (for the portion of any Straddle Period ending on
or before the Closing Date, as determined in accordance with the allocations
under Section 8.04(g)), or (ii) any failure by Seller or any of its Affiliates
to perform any of its covenants or agreements set forth in this Article 8.

  

  

(b) Effective at and after the Closing, Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Seller from and against, and reimburse each such Person for, any loss
or damage (including any interest or penalty, expenses of investigation and
attorney's fees and expenses in connection with any action, suit or proceeding
whether involving a third party claim or a claim solely between the parties
hereto) with respect to (i) any Taxes imposed on the KWK Entities for any
Post-Closing Tax Period (for the portion of any Straddle Period ending on or
before the Closing

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

50  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Date, as determined in accordance with the allocations under Section 8.04(g)),
or (ii) any failure by Buyer or any of its Affiliates to perform any of its
covenants or agreements set forth in this Article 8.

  

  

(c) Buyer shall cause the KWK Entities to pay to Seller any amounts recovered
from any Governmental Authority on account of Taxes imposed on the KWK
Entities paid with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, and Buyer agrees to
cooperate with Seller in any reasonable effort to seek any such recovery;
provided that, in no instance shall Buyer be required to take any action that
Buyer reasonably determines would subject Buyer or any Sold Entity to an
unreimbursed cost.

  

  

(d) Buyer or Seller, as the case may be (the "Tax Indemnified Party") will
promptly notify the other party (the "Tax Indemnifying Party") of the receipt
by the Tax Indemnified Party or any Affiliate of the Tax Indemnified Party of
any written communication from any taxing authority concerning Taxes for which
indemnification may be claimed from the Tax Indemnifying Party pursuant to the
provisions of this Section 8.04. In addition, the Tax Indemnified Party will
notify the Tax Indemnifying Party at least 15 Business Days prior to the date
on which the Tax Indemnified Party or any Affiliate of the Tax Indemnified
Party intends to make a payment of any Taxes that are indemnifiable by the Tax
Indemnifying Party pursuant to the provisions of this Section 8.04. The
failure by the Tax Indemnified Party to notify the Tax Indemnifying Party
pursuant to this Section 8.04 will not constitute a waiver of any claim to
indemnification under this Section 8.04 except to the extent that the Tax
Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure.

  

  

(e) Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 8.04(e), the Tax
Indemnifying Party will have the right to control any audit or other
administrative or judicial proceeding relating to any of the KWK Entities in
respect of any Tax liability with respect to which the Tax Indemnifying Party
provides indemnification under this Section 8.04. The Tax Indemnifying Party
shall (i) consult with the Tax Indemnified Party and(ii) permit the Tax
Indemnified Party, at its expense, to participate in the defense of such
audit, controversy or other proceeding. Neither the Tax Indemnifying Party nor
the Tax Indemnified Party shall enter into any settlement or other resolution
of any audit or other administrative or judicial proceeding with respect of
any Tax liability without the consent of the other party, such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld. Any audit or other administrative or judicial
proceeding relating to any of the KWK Entities in respect of any Straddle Tax
Period shall be jointly controlled by Buyer and Seller.

  

  

(f) If the Tax Indemnifying Party's indemnification obligation under this
Section 8.04 arises in respect of the payment of any Tax Damages which

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

51  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

makes allowable to the Tax Indemnified Party, any of its Affiliates or, in the
case of Buyer, effective upon the Closing, a Sold Entity any deduction,
amortization, exclusion from income or other allowance which would not, but
for the payment of such Tax Damages, be allowable, then the Tax Indemnified
Party shall pay to the Tax Indemnifying Party an amount equal to the Tax
benefit resulting therefrom if, as and when such Tax benefit is actually
realized in cash or a reduction in Taxes otherwise due.

  

  

(g) For purposes of this Section 8.04, in the case of any Straddle Tax Period,
the amount of Taxes allocable to the portion of such taxable period ending on
the Closing Date shall be deemed to be: (i) in the case of Taxes imposed on a
periodic basis (such as real or personal property Taxes), the amount of such
Taxes for the entire period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an
arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period)
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar
days in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which is the number
of calendar days in the entire relevant taxable period and (ii) in the case of
Taxes not described in the previous sentence (such as franchise Taxes, Taxes
that are based upon or related to income or receipts, based upon occupancy or
imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or assignment of
property (real or personal, tangible or intangible)), the amount of any such
Taxes shall be determined as if such taxable period ended as of the close of
business on the Closing Date.

  

  

Section 8.05. Survival; Exclusivity. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, (i) the covenants and agreements under this Article 8 shall
survive until the close of business on the 60th day following the expiration
of the applicable statute of limitations (giving effect to any waiver,
mitigation or extension thereof), and (ii) Section 8.04 shall be the exclusive
provision relating to indemnification for matters relating to Taxes of the KWK

ARTICLE 9

  

EMPLOYEE MATTERS

  

  

Section 9.01. Employee Matters. (a) Except as set forth in the Transition
Services Agreement, as of the Closing Date, each Business Employee shall cease
to accrue future benefits under the Business Employee Plans. Except as set
forth in the Transition Services Agreement, Seller and its Affiliates shall
retain sponsorship of, shall remain solely responsible for and shall retain
all liabilities, obligations and commitments under, the Business Employee
Plans, whether arising before, on or after the Closing Date other than as
specifically provided in this Article 9. Except as set forth in the Transition
Services Agreement, Buyer shall not, and from and after the Closing Date the
Sold Entities shall not, except to the extent provided herein, assume
sponsorship of, contribute to or maintain, or

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

52  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

have any responsibility, liability, obligation or commitment with respect to,
the Business Employee Plans.

  

  

(b) On or before the Closing Date, Buyer shall, or shall cause any of its
Affiliates to, offer employment, effective as of the Closing, to each Business
Employee who is not an Inactive Business Employee as of the Closing Date, on
the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 9.01. Those Business
Employees who accept such offers of employment on the Closing Date and all
Inactive Business Employees who return to active employment with Buyer or one
of its Affiliates on or prior to 180 days following the Closing Date, once
actively employed again, shall herein be referred to as the "Current
Employees". Effective immediately prior to the Closing or the Effective Hire
Date, as applicable, Seller or the applicable Affiliate of Seller shall
terminate the employment of each Current Employee. For purposes of
clarification, (i) Buyer shall be solely responsible for any and all severance
liabilities relating to the termination of employment of any Current Employee
by Buyer or its Affiliates after the Closing Date and (ii) Seller and its
Affiliates, as applicable, shall be solely responsible for any and all
severance liabilities relating to the termination of employment of any
employees of Seller and its Affiliates, including without limitation, any
Business Employees who do not become Current Employees, on or prior to the
Closing Date.

  

  

(c) For the duration of the period commencing on the Effective Hire Date and
ending on the first anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Relevant Period"),
Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, provide (i) to each Current
Employee who is employed by Buyer or any of its Affiliates base wages or
salaries, as applicable, at least equal to those provided to such Current
Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii) to Current Employees
in the aggregate variable incentive compensation opportunities (excluding
equity-based compensation and change in control and retention and benefits),
annual bonus opportunities and employee benefit plans, programs, policies and
arrangements that are not less favorable in the aggregate (excluding for these
purposes any tax treatment applicable to such benefits, programs, policies or
arrangements which has or may change as a result of material changes in
Applicable Law) to the variable incentive compensation opportunities
(excluding equity-based compensation and change in control and retention and
benefits), annual bonus opportunities and employee benefit plans, programs,
policies and arrangements that are provided Current Employees immediately
prior to the Closing Date and disclosed in Section 3.20(a) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedules. Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to provide
severance benefits to any Current Employee whose employment with Buyer or its
Affiliates is terminated by Buyer or its Affiliates during the Relevant Period
for a reason other than cause (as reasonably determined by Buyer or its
Affiliates in good faith), that are no less favorable than

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

53  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

the severance benefits provided to such Current Employee immediately prior to
the Closing and disclosed in Section 3.20(a) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedules.

  

  

(d) For Current Employees, effective as of their Effective Hire Date, Buyer
shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, cause each compensation or employee
benefit plan, program, or arrangement maintained or contributed to by Buyer or
any of its Affiliates and in which any Current Employee becomes eligible to
participate, to treat the prior service of such Current Employee with Seller
or any of its Affiliates as service rendered to Buyer or its Affiliates, as
the case may be, for all purposes (including vesting, eligibility, level of
benefit (including for purposes of severance and vacation/paid time off
benefits)) and future benefit accrual purposes, to the extent that such prior
service was recognized under the applicable Business Employee Plan immediately
prior to such Current Employee's Effective Hire Date, to the extent that such
service credit does not result in duplication of benefits for the same service
period of service.

  

  

(e) Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to (i) waive any limitation on
health and welfare coverage of any Current Employee and his or her eligible
dependents due to pre-existing conditions and/or waiting periods, active
employment requirements, and requirements to show evidence of good health
under the applicable health and welfare plan of Buyer or any Affiliate of
Buyer to the extent such Current Employee and his or her eligible dependents
is covered under a health and welfare benefit plan of Seller or any of its
Affiliates (as the case may be), and such conditions, periods or requirements
are satisfied or waived under such plan, immediately prior to the Closing
Date; provided that Seller has provided to Buyer a "Certificate of Creditable
Coverage" with respect to each such Current Employee and his or her eligible
dependents and (ii) credit each Current Employee and his or her eligible
dependents with all deductible payments, co-payments and co-insurance paid by
such employee and covered dependents under the medical employee benefit plan
of Seller or any of its Affiliates (as the case may be) during the year prior
to the applicable Effective Hire Date for the purpose of determining the
extent to which any such employee and his or her dependents have satisfied
their deductible and whether they have reached the out-of-pocket maximum under
any medical plan of Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer for such year.

  

  

(f) With respect to each Inactive Business Employee, any such employee on
long-term disability leave shall remain on Seller's long-term disability plan
in accordance with the terms of the applicable Business Employee Plan.

  

  

(g) Effective from and after the Closing Date, except as otherwise provided
for in the Transition Services Agreement, with respect to any claims for
hospital, medical, dental or other health, disability, life insurance or
accidental

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

54  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

death or dismemberment benefits, expenses or other reimbursement provided to
or in respect of any Current Employee (or his or her eligible dependents), (i)
Seller shall remain responsible and liable for any such claims incurred by
such Current Employee on or prior to the Closing Date and (ii) Buyer or its
Affiliates shall assume responsibility and liability under Buyer's plans for
any such claims incurred by such Current Employee after the Closing Date. For
purposes of the foregoing, claims for medical, dental or other health or
disability benefits shall be considered incurred when the services are
rendered or supplies are provided, and not when the condition arose or the
applicable claim was submitted, claims for hospitalization shall be considered
incurred at the time of hospital admission and claims for life insurance or
accidental death or dismemberment benefits shall be considered incurred on the
date of death or dismemberment.

  

  

(h) For the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the last day of
the calendar year in which the Closing occurs, Buyer shall or shall cause its
Affiliates to provide for planned and unplanned time-off policies for Current
Employees that are no less favorable to such employees than planned and
unplanned time-off policies provided by Buyer or its Affiliates to their
similarly situated employees. Buyer shall or shall cause its Affiliates to,
credit each Current Employee with all paid time off accrued and unused by such
Current Employee through the Closing Date, solely to the extent such paid time
off was properly reserved on the balance sheet.

  

  

(i) During the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the last day
of the calendar year in which the Closing occurs, except as otherwise provided
for in the Transition Services Agreement, Buyer shall or shall cause its
Affiliates, as the case may be, to (i) maintain health care, limited purpose
healthcare spending and dependent care flexible spending accounts established
under Section 125 of the Code (the "Buyer FSA"), (ii) permit the Current
Employees to participate in the Buyer FSA to the extent coverage under such
Buyer FSA replaces coverage under a comparable Benefit Plan or other benefit
plan of Seller or its Affiliates in which such Current Employee participated
immediately before the Closing (the "Seller FSA"), (iii) credit Current
Employees under the Buyer FSA immediately following their Effective Hire Date
with amounts available for reimbursement equal to such amounts as were
credited under the Seller FSA with respect to such person immediately prior to
their Effective Hire Date and (iv) give effect under the Buyer FSA to any
elections made by such Current Employees with respect to the Seller FSA for
the year in which the Closing occurs. As soon as reasonably practicable
following the Closing, except as otherwise provided for in the Transition
Services Agreement, if the net difference between (x) the aggregate employee
contributions under the Buyer FSA made under the Seller FSA as of the Closing
Date made during the year of the Closing Date and (y) the aggregate employee
reimbursements under the Buyer FSA made under the Seller FSA as of the Closing
Date made during the

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

55  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

year of the Closing Date, in each case with respect to Current Employees for
the 2010 plan year, (the "Assumed FSA Balance") is (1) a positive number, then
Seller shall transfer to Buyer an amount, in cash, equal to the Assumed FSA
Balance or (2) a negative number, then Buyer shall transfer to Seller an
amount, in cash, equal to the positive value of the Assumed FSA Balance. The
parties hereto agree to make reasonable, good faith efforts to implement the
provisions of this Section 9.01(i) to take into account the complexity of
transferring flexible spending accounts.

  

  

(j) In the event that a Current Employee makes a voluntary election pursuant
to Section 401(a)(31) of the Code to roll over his or her account balance in
Seller's tax-qualified defined contribution plan to a tax-qualified defined
contribution plan sponsored by Buyer or one of its Affiliates, Buyer agrees to
cause such tax-qualified defined contribution plan to accept such rollovers in
cash or in instruments evidencing participant loans.

  

  

(k) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, except as otherwise
provided for in the Transition Services Agreement, Seller agrees to reimburse
Buyer or one of its Affiliates, within 30 days following the end of the
calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs, for a pro-rata portion of the
profit-sharing contribution Current Employees would otherwise be entitled to
receive under the terms of Seller's tax-qualified defined contribution plan
for the year in which the Closing Date occurs. As soon as practicable
following the date hereof, Seller agrees to amend the applicable Employee
Benefit Plan to reflect the provisions of this Section 9.01(k), to the extent
required. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer or one of its Affiliates, as
applicable, agrees to contribute the amounts provided by Seller under this
Section 9.01(k) to the applicable tax-qualified defined contribution plan for
the benefit of Current Employees, to the extent not previously contributed.

  

  

(l) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, except as otherwise
provided for in the Transition Services Agreement, Seller shall pay to the
Current Employees, as soon as administratively feasible following the Closing
Date, a pro-rated portion of the bonus amounts otherwise payable to the
Current Employees in respect of the year in which the Closing Date occurs
under the Employee Benefit Plan(s) that are cash incentive plan(s), determined
in accordance with the terms of the applicable plan(s), based upon performance
and the percentage of the applicable fiscal year that shall have elapsed
through the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall not assume
any obligation in respect of such plan(s).

  

  

(m) Seller and Buyer hereby agree to follow the standard procedure for
employment tax withholding as provided in Section 4 of Rev. Proc. 2004-53,
I.R.B. 2004-35. Accordingly, Seller shall have employment tax reporting

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

responsibilities for the wages and other compensation it pays with respect to
the Current Employees and Buyer shall have employment tax reporting
responsibilities for the wages and other compensation it pays with respect to
the Current Employees.

  

  

(n) In the event that Buyer determines to terminate any Current Employee
during the 90-day period following the Closing Date, Buyer and Seller agree to
cooperate and exchange such data and information as is reasonably necessary to
determine whether such terminations would reasonably be expected to result in
liability to Buyer or Seller under WARN. Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller,
on the other hand, hereby agrees to indemnify and hold the other and its
Affiliates harmless from and against any and all damages arising out of or
otherwise in respect of any suit or claim of violation brought against such
other party or any of its Affiliates under WARN for any actions taken by, as
applicable, Buyer after the Closing Date with respect to any facility, site or
operating unit of the Current Employees or Seller prior to the Closing Date
with respect to any facility, site or operating unit of the Business
Employees.

  

  

(o) Effective from and after the Closing Date, with respect to any workers
compensation claims of any Current Employee (or his or her eligible
dependents), (i) Seller shall remain responsible for any such claims incurred
by such Current Employee on or prior to the Closing Date and (ii) Buyer shall
assume responsibility for any such claims incurred by such Current Employee
after the Closing Date. For purposes of the foregoing, a claim for workers
compensation benefits shall be deemed to be incurred when the event giving
rise to the claim occurs.

  

  

(p) Seller shall be responsible for providing any Business Employee (and such
Business Employee's "qualified beneficiaries" within the meaning of Section
4980B(f) of the Code) whose "qualifying event," within the meaning of Section
4980B(f) of the Code, occurs on or prior to the Closing Date with the
continuation of group health coverage required by Section 601 et. seq. of
ERISA and Section 4980B(f) of the Code ("Continuation Coverage") under the
terms of a health plan maintained by Seller or any of its Affiliates. Except
as otherwise provided for in the Transition Services Agreement, Buyer shall be
responsible for providing Continuation Coverage for any Current Employee (and
such Current Employee's qualified beneficiaries) whose qualifying event occurs
after the Closing Date.

  

  

(q) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller
or its Affiliates against all liabilities or losses which Seller or its
Affiliates may suffer or incur as a result of any claim, action or other
proceeding made by any Current Employee against Seller or its Affiliates from
and after the Closing Date arising from any breach of the obligations of Buyer
and its Affiliates

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

57  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

under this Section 9.01. Except as otherwise expressly provided for herein,
from and after the Closing, Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and
its Affiliates against all liabilities or losses which Buyer or its Affiliates
may suffer or incur as a result of any claim, action or other proceeding: (i)
related to the Business Employee Plans, (ii) made by any current or former
employee of Seller or any of its Affiliates or any current or former Seconded
Employee (including any Current Employee) against Buyer or its Affiliates from
and after the Closing Date arising from any breach of the obligations of
Seller and its Affiliates under this Section 9.01 or (iii) relating to any
current or former employee of Seller or any of its Affiliates or any current
or former Seconded Employee (including any Current Employee) arising on or
prior to the Closing Date.

  

  

(r) Without limiting the generality of Section 13.08, the provisions of this
Section 9.01 are for the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and
nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be construed to
confer upon or give to any person (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
Current Employee or other current or former employee of Seller or any of its
Affiliates, other than the parties hereto and their respective permitted
successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or remedies
(including with respect to the matters provided for in this Section 9.01)
under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement. Nothing in this Section
9.01 shall amend, or be deemed to amend (or prevent the amendment or
termination of) any Benefit Plan or any compensation or benefit plan of Seller
or Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates. Nothing in this Section 9.01
is intended to represent a guarantee of employment or otherwise restrict the
authority of Buyer or any of its Affiliates to terminate the employment of any
Current Employee, subject to Applicable Laws.

(the

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

62  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

"Indemnifying Party") of the assertion of any claim or the commencement of any
suit, action or proceeding by any third party ("Third-Party Claim") in respect
of which indemnity may be sought under Section 12.02. Such notice shall set
forth in reasonable detail such Third-Party Claim and the basis for
indemnification (taking into account the information then available to the
Indemnified Party). The failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations or liability hereunder,
except to the extent such failure shall have actually adversely prejudiced the
Indemnifying Party.

  

  

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of
any Third-Party Claim and, subject to the limitations set forth in this
Section 12.03, shall be entitled to control and appoint lead counsel for such
defense, in each case at its own expense; provided, that the Indemnified Party
is hereby authorized, prior to the Indemnifying Party's delivery of a written
election to the Indemnified Party of its agreement to defend such Third-Party
Claim, to file any motion, answer or other pleading that it shall reasonably
deem necessary to protect its interests or those of the Indemnifying Party.

  

  

(c) If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of any such Third
Party Claim, it shall within 30 days notify the Indemnified Party in writing
of its intent to do so. The Indemnifying Party will have the right to assume
control of such defense of the Third-Party Claim only for so long as it
conducts such defense with reasonable diligence. The Indemnifying Party shall
keep the Indemnified Parties advised of the status of such Third-Party Claim
and the defense thereof on a reasonably current basis and shall consider in
good faith the recommendations made by the Indemnified Parties with respect
thereto. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the control of the defense of any
Third-Party Claim in accordance with the provisions of this Section 12.03, (i)
the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) before entering into any settlement of such Third-Party Claim, if (A)
the settlement does not release the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates from
all liabilities and obligations with respect to such Third-Party Claim, (B)
the amount of any damages to be paid with respect to the settlement of such
Third Party Claim is in excess of the $75,000,000 cap, (C) the settlement
imposes injunctive or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party or
any of its Affiliates, or (D) the Indemnifying Party does not agree in writing
to pay such amounts payable pursuant to such settlement, and (ii) the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any such
Third-Party Claim and to employ, at its expense, separate counsel of its
choice for such purpose; provided, that if the Indemnifying Party assumes the
defense of any such Third-Party Claim but fails to diligently prosecute such
claim, or if the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of any such
claim, the Indemnified Party may assume control of such defense and the
Indemnifying

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

63  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Party will bear the reasonable costs and expenses of such defense (including
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses); and provided, further, that
notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall pay the reasonable
costs and expenses of such defense (including reasonable attorneys' fees and
expenses) of the Indemnified Party if (x) the Indemnified Party's counsel
shall have reasonably concluded and advised that there are defenses available
to such Indemnified Party that are different from or additional to those
available to the Indemnifying Party, or (y) the Indemnified Party's counsel
shall have advised the Indemnified Party that there is a conflict of interest
that could make it inappropriate under applicable standards of professional
conduct to have common counsel for the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Indemnifying Party will not be permitted to settle, compromise, take any
corrective or remedial action or enter into an agreed judgment or consent
decree, in each case, that subjects the Indemnified Party to any criminal
liability, requires an admission of guilt or wrongdoing on the part of the
Indemnified Party or imposes any continuing obligation on or requires any
payment from the Indemnified Party without the Indemnified Party's prior
written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  

  

(d) Each party shall reasonably cooperate, and cause their respective
Affiliates to reasonably cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any
Third-Party Claim and shall furnish or cause to be furnished such records,
information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings,
hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection
therewith.

  

  

Section 12.04. Direct Claim Procedures. If the Indemnified Party has a claim
for indemnity under Section 12.02 against the Indemnifying Party that does not
involve a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party agrees to give prompt
notice in writing of such claim to the Indemnifying Party. Such notice shall
set forth in reasonable detail such claim and the basis for indemnification
(taking into account the information then available to the Indemnified Party).
The failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent such
failure shall have adversely prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.

  

  

Section 12.05. Calculation of Damages. (a) The amount of any Damages payable
under Section 12.02 by the Indemnifying Party shall be net of any amounts
actually recovered by the Indemnified Party under applicable insurance
policies or from any other Person alleged to be responsible therefor. If the
Indemnified Party receives any amounts under applicable insurance policies, or
from any other Person alleged to be responsible for any Damages, subsequent to
an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified
Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any payment made or

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

64  

  

 

 

 

  

  

expense incurred by the Indemnifying Party in connection with providing such
indemnification payment up to the amount actually received by the Indemnified
Party, net of any expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in collecting
such amount. The Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to collect any amounts available under insurance coverage, or from any other
Person alleged to be responsible, for any Damages payable under Section 12.02.

  

  

(b) If the Indemnifying Party's indemnification obligation under Section 12.02
arises in respect of the payment of any Damages which makes allowable to the
Indemnified Party, any of its Affiliates or, in the case of Buyer, effective
upon the Closing, a Sold Entity any deduction, amortization, exclusion from
income or other allowance which would not, but for the payment of such
Damages, be allowable, then the Indemnified Party shall pay to the
Indemnifying Party an amount equal to the Tax benefit resulting therefrom if,
as and when such Tax benefit is actually realized in cash or a reduction in
Taxes otherwise due.

  

  

(c) The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under Section 12.02 for any (i)
consequential, punitive or indirect or special Damages or (ii) Damages for
lost profits, except with respect to Damages for lost profits, to the extent a
court of competent jurisdiction determined that lost profits is the
appropriate measure of direct damages with respect to the matters giving rise
to the claim for Damages (it being understood and agreed that such calculation
of Damages shall not be based on any application of revenue or earnings
multiples to direct damages); provided that nothing herein shall prevent any
Indemnified Party from recovering for all components of awards against them in
Third Party Claims for which recovery is provided under this Article 12,
including consequential, punitive or indirect or special Damages and Damages
for lost profits.

  

  

(d) The Indemnified Party must mitigate in accordance with Applicable Law any
loss for which the Indemnified Party seeks indemnification under this
Agreement. If the Indemnified Party mitigates losses after the Indemnifying
Party has paid the Indemnified Party under any indemnification provision of
this Agreement in respect of that loss, the Indemnified Party must notify the
Indemnifying Party and pay to the Indemnifying Party the extent of the value
of the benefit to the Indemnified Party of that mitigation (less the
Indemnified Party's reasonable costs of mitigation) promptly after the benefit
is received.

  

  

(e) Seller shall have no obligation to indemnify Buyer or its Affiliates
pursuant to Section 12.02 to the extent the related Damages result or arise
from any action (including disclosure or other communication to any
Governmental Authority or other third party or any invasive sampling or
testing of any soil, surface water, groundwater, building materials or other
environmental media) by or on behalf of Buyer or any of its Affiliates that is
not required by an Applicable Law.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

65  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Section 12.06. Assignment of Claims. If the Indemnified Party receives any
payment from an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Damages pursuant to
Section 12.02 and it is reasonably likely that the Indemnified Party could
have recovered all or a part of such Damages from a third party (a "Potential
Contributor") based on the underlying claim asserted against the Indemnifying
Party, the Indemnified Party shall assign such of its rights to proceed
against the Potential Contributor as are necessary to permit the Indemnifying
Party to recover from the Potential Contributor the amount of such payment.

  

  

Section 12.07. Exclusivity.

  

  

(a) After the Closing and except as otherwise set forth in Section 8.05 with
respect to matters relating to Taxes, Section 12.02 will (in the absence of
fraud) provide the exclusive remedy for each of the parties hereto for any
misrepresentation, breach of warranty, covenant or other agreement or other
claim arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
(other than equitable remedies as they relate to breaches of covenants or
other agreements contained herein to the extent such covenants or agreements
are to be performed after the Closing).

  

  

(b) Except as specifically set forth in this Agreement, effective as of the
Closing, Buyer waives any rights and claims Buyer may have against Seller,
whether in law or equity, relating to claims for contribution and other rights
of recovery arising out of or relating to any Environmental Law (whether now
or hereinafter in effect).

be amended or waived if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing
and is signed, in the case of an amendment, by each party to this Agreement,

Section 13.03. Expenses. (a) Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the
party incurring such cost or expense. If this Agreement is terminated by
Seller pursuant to Section 11.01(d), then Seller shall (i) pay to Buyer in
immediately available funds $23,340,000 (the "Termination Fee"), concurrently

obligated to provide to Buyer the notice of an Acquisition Proposal as
contemplated by Section 5.04(b) and (iii) within 90 days of such termination,
Seller enters into definitive documentation with respect to an Alternative

the date, if any, that such transaction is consummated and shall reimburse
Buyer and its Affiliates, no later than five Business Days after Buyer's
submission of reasonable documentation thereof, for 100% of Buyer's and its
Affiliates' reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses

damages, against Seller or any of Seller's subsidiaries or any of their
respective directors, officers, employees, partners, managers, members,
shareholders or Affiliates or their respective Representatives in connection
with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

Section 13.04. Successors and Assigns. The provisions of this Agreement shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns; provided that no party may assign, delegate
or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement
without the consent of each other party hereto; provided, however, that
notwithstanding the foregoing Buyer may assign all or any portion of this
Agreement to any subsidiary or Affiliate of Buyer provided that no such
assignment by Buyer shall in any way affect Buyer's obligations or liabilities
under this Agreement.

  

  

Section 13.05. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the law of the State of Delaware, without regard
to the conflicts of law rules thereof.

  

  

Section 13.06. Jurisdiction. The parties hereto (i) agree and consent that any
suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on
any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be subject to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Delaware Chancery Court in Wilmington, Delaware, or, if
such court shall not have jurisdiction, any federal court located in the State
of Delaware or other Delaware state court (and, in each case, of the
appropriate appellate courts therefrom), and (ii) irrevocably waive, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that they may now or hereafter
have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any
such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such
court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit,
action or proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether
within or without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the
foregoing, each party agrees that service of process on such party as provided
in Section 13.01 shall be deemed effective service of process on such party.
Each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not, and will not permit its
Affiliates to, bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-
claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in
equity, whether

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

69  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing Sources in any way
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including with respect to any dispute arising out of or relating in
any way to the Debt Financing or the performance thereof, in any forum other

hereof shall be applicable to any such proceeding.

  

  

Section 13.07. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY.

  

  

Section 13.08. Counterparts; Effectiveness; Third-Party Beneficiaries. This
Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be
an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were
upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each
party hereto shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by the other
parties hereto. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof
signed by the other parties hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no
party shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any
other oral or written agreement or other communication). No provision of this
Agreement is intended to confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations,
or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than the parties hereto and
their respective successors and assigns, except, with respect to Section
13.13, Davis Polk and Wardwell LLP, and provided that the Financing Sources
shall have the right to enforce their rights under Sections 13.06 and 13.07.

  

  

Section 13.09. Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to
the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both oral and written, between the parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 13.10. Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

70  

  

 

 

 

  

  

so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in
an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be
consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

  

  

Section 13.11. Disclosure Schedules. Seller has set forth information on the
Seller Disclosure Schedules in a section thereof that corresponds to the
section of this Agreement to which it relates. A matter set forth in one
section of the Seller Disclosure Schedules need not be set forth in any other
section so long as its relevance to such other section of the Seller
Disclosure Schedules or section of this Agreement is reasonably apparent on
the face of the information disclosed therein to the Person to which such
disclosure is being made. The parties acknowledge and agree that (a) the
Seller Disclosure Schedules may include certain items and information solely
for informational purposes for the convenience of Buyer and (b) the disclosure
by Seller of any matter in the Seller Disclosure Schedules shall not be deemed
to constitute an acknowledgment by Seller that the matter is required to be
disclosed by the terms of this Agreement or that the matter is material.

  

  

Section 13.12. Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof, in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. If, prior
to the Termination Date, either party brings any action to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement by
the other party, the Termination Date shall automatically be extended by (i)
the amount of time during which such action is pending, plus 20 Business Days,
or (ii) such other time period established by the court presiding over such
action.

  

  

Section 13.13. Waiver of Conflicts; Attorney-Client Privilege. (a) Buyer
waives and will not assert, and Buyer agrees to cause its Affiliates to waive
and not to assert, any conflict of interest arising out of or relating to the
representation, after the Closing (the "Post-Closing Representation"), of
Seller or any of its Affiliates or any shareholder, officer, employee or
director of Seller or any of its Affiliates (any such Person, a "Designated
Person") in any matter involving this Agreement or any other agreements or
transactions contemplated thereby, by any legal counsel currently representing
Seller or any of its Affiliates in connection with this Agreement or any other
agreements or transactions contemplated thereby (the "Current
Representation").

  

  

(b) Buyer waives and will not assert, and Buyer agrees to cause its Affiliates
to waive and not assert, any attorney-client privilege with respect to any
communication between any legal counsel and any Designated Person occurring

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

71  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

during the Current Representation in connection with any Post-Closing
Representation, including in connection with a dispute with Buyer or any of
its Affiliates, it being the intention of the parties hereto that all such
rights to such attorney-client privilege and to control such attorney-client
privilege shall be retained by Seller; provided that the foregoing waiver and
acknowledgement of retention shall not extend to any communication not
involving this Agreement or any other agreements or transactions contemplated
thereby, or to communications with any Person other than the Designated
Persons.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

72  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be duly
executed by their respective authorized officers as of the date first written
above.

including supporting documentation) the Unconnected Well Volumes for the
Initial Earn-Out Period or the Subsequent Earn-Out Period (as applicable).

  

  

(b) No later than 30 days after Seller's delivery to Buyer of a Well Report,
Buyer shall deliver to Seller a written report (each such written report, an
"Earn-Out Statement") specifying in reasonable detail (and including
supporting documentation) (i) Average Daily Volumes for the Initial Earn-Out
Period or the Subsequent Earn-Out Period (as applicable); (ii) Third Party

Unconnected Well Volumes contained in the applicable Well Report and
specifying in reasonable detail Buyer's grounds for such disagreement. Buyer
shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items and amounts contained in
such Well Report. If Buyer objects to any of Seller's calculations in such
Well Report, Buyer's calculation of the applicable Earn-Out Payment(s)
contained in such Earn-Out Statement shall be calculated based on Buyer's
calculation of Unconnected Well Volumes. Otherwise Buyer's calculations of the
applicable Earn-Out Payment(s) shall be made using the calculation of
Unconnected Well Volumes set forth in such Well Report.

  

  

(c) If Seller agrees with Buyer's calculations contained in an Earn-Out
Statement, Seller shall notify Buyer of such agreement in writing (each such
written notice, an "Agreement Notice") and Buyer shall, upon the date that is
the later of the date that is five Business Days after receipt of an Agreement
Notice and February 15th of the relevant year in which such payment is
payable, pay to Seller the amount of the Initial Earn-Out Payment or
Subsequent Earn-Out Payment (as applicable) set forth in such Earn-Out
Statement. If no Agreement Notice or Disagreement Notice (as defined below) is
delivered by Seller within 30 days of Seller's receipt of an Earn-Out
Statement, Seller shall be deemed to have agreed with all items and amounts
contained in such Earn-Out Statement and Buyer shall, upon the date that is
the later of the date that is five Business Days after expiration of such 30
day period and February 15th of the relevant year in which such payment is
payable, pay to Seller the amount of the Initial Earn-Out Payment or
Subsequent Earn-Out Payment (as applicable) set forth in such Earn-Out
Statement. The Third Earn-Out Payment is payable hereunder, if at all, within
5 Business Days of February 15, 2014.

  

  

(d) If Seller disagrees with any of Buyer's calculations contained in an Earn-
Out Statement, Seller may, within 30 days after receipt of such Earn-Out
Statement, deliver a written notice to Buyer disagreeing with such
calculations and specifying in reasonable detail (and including supporting
documentation) Seller's calculation of the applicable Earn-Out Payment(s)
(each such written notice, a "Disagreement Notice"). Any Disagreement Notice
shall specify those items or amounts as to which Seller disagrees, and Seller
shall be deemed to have

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

3  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

agreed with all other items and amounts contained in the applicable Earn-Out
Statement. If a Disagreement Notice shall be duly delivered pursuant to this
Section 4(d), Buyer and Seller shall, during the 15 days following such
delivery, use their best efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or
amounts in order to determine the amount of the applicable Earn-Out
Payment(s), which amount shall not be less than the amount thereof set forth
in the applicable Earn-Out Statement nor more than the amount thereof set
forth in the applicable Disagreement Notice. If Buyer and Seller are able to
reach agreement during such period, Buyer shall promptly (and in no event
later than five days after such agreement) pay to Seller the agreed amount of
the applicable Earn-Out Payment(s). If Buyer and Seller are unable to reach
such agreement during such period, Buyer and Seller shall promptly cause
independent accountants of nationally recognized standing reasonably
satisfactory to Buyer and Seller (who shall not have any material relationship
with Buyer or Seller) promptly to review the Agreement, this Exhibit B, the
applicable Earn-Out Statement and the applicable Disagreement Notice for the
purpose of calculating the applicable Earn-Out Payment(s), which amount in
each case shall not be less than the amount thereof set forth in the
applicable Earn-Out Statement nor more than the amount thereof set forth in
the applicable Disagreement Notice. In making such calculation, such
independent accountants shall consider only those items or amounts in the
Earn-Out Statement as to which Seller has disagreed. Such independent
accountants shall deliver to Buyer and Seller, as promptly as practicable, a
report (the "Final Report") setting forth the calculation of the applicable
Earn-Out Payment(s). Such report shall be final and binding upon Buyer and
Seller, and Buyer shall promptly (and in no event later than 5 Business Days
after receipt of the Final Report (unless receipt of such Final Report is
prior to February 15 in the year in which such Earn-Out Payment is payable, in
which case on February 15) pay to Seller the amount of the Earn-Out Payment(s)
contained in the applicable Final Report.

  

  

(e) Buyer and Seller agree that each will cooperate and make available books,
records, work papers and personnel as reasonably requested by the independent
accountant in connection with the preparation of the Final Report.

  

  

5. Late Payments. Any Earn-Out Payments or portions thereof due hereunder which are not paid when due shall bear interest at a rate equal to the lesser of (x) the thirty (30) day U.S. dollar LIBOR rate effective for the Business Day immediately following the date such Earn-Out Payment or portion thereof was due, as published by The Wall Street Journal, U.S. Internet Edition at www.wsj.com, plus an additional five percent (5%) and (y) the maximum rate permitted by Applicable Law, in each case calculated based on the number of days such Earn-Out Payment or portion thereof is delinquent. This Section 5 shall in no way limit any other remedies available to Seller.
