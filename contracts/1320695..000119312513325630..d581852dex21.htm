(i) an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Partnership, as at the end
of the day on the day prior to the Closing Date, which balance sheet shall be

basis consistent with the preparation of the Financial Statements (and where
generally accepted accounting principles provide for a range of alternatives,
past practices shall govern) (the "Draft Closing Date Balance Sheet" and, as
finally determined pursuant to the provisions of this Section 2.6, the
"Closing Date Balance Sheet"); and (ii) a statement of Working Capital as at
the end of the day on the day prior to the Closing Date (the "Draft Closing
Date Working Capital Statement" and, as finally determined pursuant to the
provisions of this Section 2.6, the "Closing Date Working Capital Statement")
based on the Draft Closing Date Balance Sheet, which such Draft Closing Date
Working Capital Statement shall set out draft Working Capital as at the end of
the day on the day prior to the Closing Date (such draft Working Capital as
of the Closing Date, as finally determined pursuant to the provisions of this
Section 2.6, referred to as the "Closing Date Working Capital") to
be calculated on a basis consistent with the calculation of Estimated Closing
Date Working Capital in Section 2.2(b) (including Schedule 2.6(a) (and, for
greater certainty, none of the Credit Facility Debt Amount, the Total Seller
Note Amount or any other component of Closing Indebtedness, the Transaction
Expenses or the Transaction Employment Taxes shall be a liability for this
purpose), in each case, to be prepared and delivered to the Sellers Agent.
The Sellers Agent shall reasonably cooperate with the Purchaser and its
accountants to the extent required to prepare the Draft Closing Date Balance
Sheet and the Draft Closing Date Working Capital Statement (collectively, the
"Draft Closing Statements").

(b) During the period from the date the Draft Closing Statements are delivered
by the Purchaser to the Sellers Agent through the date such statements are
finally determined in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.6, the
Purchaser shall and shall cause each of the Purchasers, the Acquired
Companies and the Subsidiaries respective Representatives to reasonably
cooperate with the Sellers Agent and the Sellers Agents Representatives and
to provide the Sellers Agent and the Sellers Agents Representatives
full access to the work papers of the Purchaser relating to the Acquired
Companies and the Subsidiaries, the Acquired Companies and the Subsidiaries
and their respective Representatives in connection with the review of the
Draft Closing Statements, and the Purchaser shall make reasonably available
to the Sellers Agent and the Sellers Agents Representatives individuals
responsible for the preparation of the Draft Closings Statements in order to
respond to inquiries of the Sellers Agent related thereto.

 



23 (c) If the Sellers Agent notifies the Purchaser that the Sellers agree with
any of the Draft Closing Statements within forty-five (45) days after receipt
thereof or fails to deliver notice to the Purchaser of its disagreement
therewith within such forty-five (45) day period, any such Draft Closing
Statements shall be conclusive and binding on the Sellers and the Purchaser
and the parties shall be deemed to have agreed thereto, in the first case, on
the date the Purchaser receives the notice and, in the second case, on such
forty-fifth (45th) day. If the Sellers Agent disagrees with any of the Draft
Closing Statements or the calculation of Closing Date Working Capital as set
forth therein, then the Sellers Agent shall notify the Purchaser of its
disagreement (the "Dispute Notice") within such forty-five (45) day period
together with reasonable particulars of the basis of such dispute, including
the Sellers Agents position on the amounts in dispute (and the resulting
Sellers Agent position on the amount of the Closing Date Working Capital).
In such event, the Sellers Agent and the Purchaser shall work expeditiously
and attempt, in good faith, to resolve their differences with respect thereto
within fifteen (15) days after the receipt by the Purchaser of the Dispute
Notice and make any amendments to the Draft Closing Statements as mutually
agreed to by the parties.

(d) Any dispute over any of the Draft Closing Statements or the calculation of
Closing Date Working Capital as set forth in the Dispute Notice not resolved
by the Purchaser and the Sellers Agent within such fifteen (15) day period
after receipt of the Dispute Notice (or such other period as the parties may
agree) shall be submitted to the Independent Auditor to determine such
dispute, and such determination shall be final and binding on the parties.
The Independent Auditor shall allow the Purchaser and the Sellers Agent to
present their respective positions regarding the dispute (provided that, for
greater certainty, such presentations are limited to matters described in the
Dispute Notice) and each of the Purchaser and the Sellers Agent shall have
the right to present additional documents, materials and other information,
and make an oral presentation to the Independent Auditor, regarding such
dispute and the Independent Auditor shall consider such additional documents,
materials and other information and such oral presentation. Any such other
documents, materials or other information shall be copied to each of the
Purchaser and the Sellers and each of the Sellers and the Purchaser shall be
entitled to attend any such oral presentation. The Independent Auditor shall
determine, based solely on such presentations from the Sellers Agent and the
Purchaser and not by independent review, only those issues in dispute
specifically set forth in the Dispute Notice and shall render a written report
(the "Adjustment Report") to the Sellers, the Sellers Agent and the Purchaser
in which the Independent Auditor shall, after considering all matters set
forth in the Dispute Notice, determine what adjustments, if any, should be
made to the Draft Closing Date Balance Sheet, the Draft Closing Date Working
Capital Statement and the Closing Date Working Capital. The Adjustment Report
shall set forth, in reasonable detail, the Independent Auditors determination
with respect to each of the disputed items or amounts specified in the Dispute
Notice, and the revisions, if any, to be made to any of the Draft Closing
Statements and/or the Closing Date Working Capital, together with supporting
calculations, and the parties shall make such revisions to the Draft Closing
Statements, as applicable. In resolving any disputed item, the Independent
Auditor: (i) shall be bound to the principles of this Section 2.6 (including
Schedule 2.6(a)), (ii) shall limit its review to matters specifically set
forth in the Dispute Notice, and (iii) shall not 

 



24  assign a value to any item higher than the highest value for such item
claimed by either party or lower than the lowest value for such item claimed
by either party. The parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Independent Auditor to complete its work and render its
determination within thirty (30) calendar days of its engagement. The costs,
fees and expenses of the Independent Auditor shall be allocated to and borne
by the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Sellers as a group, on the other
hand, (with each Seller responsible only for its Pro Rata Share of the
Sellers portion) based on the inverse of the percentage that the
Independent Auditors determination (before such allocation) bears to the
total amount of the total items in dispute as originally submitted to the
Independent Auditor. For example, should the items in dispute total in amount
to $1,000 and the Independent Auditor awards $600 in favor of the Purchasers
position, 60% of the costs of the Independent Auditors review would be borne
by Sellers as a group, (with each Seller responsible only for its Pro Rata
Share of such costs) and 40% of the costs would be borne by the Purchaser.

(e) For greater certainty, each of the Closing Date Working Capital, Closing
Date Working Capital Statement, Draft Closing Date Working Capital Statement,
Estimated Closing Date Working Capital and Target Working Capital are to be
calculated and prepared in a manner consistent, and in accordance with, the
indicative Working Capital calculation set forth in Schedule 2.6(a).

Section 2.7 Payment of Purchase Price Adjustments.

 

(a) On the fifth (5th) Business Day following the date on which the last of
the Draft Closing Statements has been finalized in accordance with Section
2.6 (whether by agreement of the parties, deemed agreement or by determination
made by the Independent Auditor pursuant to Section 2.6(d)) (such date, the
"Settlement Date"), the payments contemplated by Section 2.7(b) shall be
made.

(b) On the Settlement Date,

 



     | (i) | if the Closing Date Working Capital is greater than the
Estimated Closing Date Working Capital, the Purchaser shall pay such surplus
amount to the Sellers Agent on behalf of the Sellers to be distributed to
each Seller in accordance with its Pro Rata Share; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | if the Closing Date Working Capital is less than the
Estimated Closing Date Working Capital, the Sellers shall severally, and not
jointly or jointly and severally, pay such deficiency to the Purchaser in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Share. 
---|---|--- 

Section 2.8 Payments and Location of Closing.

Any reference in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this
Agreement to payment shall mean payment by wire transfer of immediately
available funds in Canadian dollars to the bank account or accounts designated
by the recipient of such payment in writing to the Purchaser or to the
Sellers Agent (and in the case of any Optionholder Seller or Management
Shareholder, as previously designated to the Sellers Agent by each such
Person), as the case may be, not less than two (2) Business Days prior to the
date of such payment. The Closing shall be held at the offices of Torys LLP,
Suite 3000, 79 Wellington Street West, TD Centre, Toronto, Ontario M5K 1N2 at
10:00 a.m. (Toronto time) on the Closing Date or such other place or time as
may be agreed by the Purchaser and Sellers Agent.

 



25 Section 2.9 Withholding.

 

(a) The Sellers, the Purchaser, the Acquired Companies and the Subsidiaries
will be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amount payable pursuant to
this Agreement (including payments of Purchase Price and releases of amounts
held in the Indemnity Escrow Account) such amounts as the Sellers, the
Purchaser, the Acquired Companies, the Subsidiaries (or any Affiliate
thereof) shall determine in good faith they are required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the ITA, the Code or
any other provision of applicable Laws. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by the Sellers, the Purchaser, the Acquired Companies or the
Subsidiaries, such withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction
and withholding were made.

 

(b) In respect of each Optionholder that is a resident of Canada for the
purposes of the ITA, the applicable Acquired Company or Subsidiary shall file
an election with the Canada Revenue Agency, in the manner set out in the ITA,
the effect of which will be to prevent the applicable Acquired Company or
Subsidiary or Affiliate not dealing at arms length with the Acquired Company
or Subsidiary from deducting any portion of the Purchase Price paid to such
Optionholders under this Agreement in computing its income under the ITA. To
the extent the applicable Acquired Company or Subsidiary so elects, it shall
provide a copy of such election to the Optionholders.

individual who shall have served as a director or officer of any of the
Acquired Companies and/or the Subsidiaries prior to the Closing to be
indemnified by such corporations in respect of their serving in such
capacities at or prior to the Closing.

(c) The provisions of this Section 7.4 shall survive the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents until the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing Date and are
intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each
individual referred to in this Section 7.4, his or her heirs and successors
and his or her legal representatives (collectively, the "Directors and
Officers"). The Acquired Companies and the Subsidiaries agree to pay from
time to time as necessary all expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees,
that may be incurred by the Directors and Officers in enforcing the indemnity
and other obligations provided for in this Section 7.4. 

(d) If any of the Acquired Companies, any of the Subsidiaries or any of their
respective successors or assigns shall (i) amalgamate, consolidate with or
merge or wind up into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving entity, or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its prospective
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of the Purchaser, the Acquired
Companies or any of the Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall assume all of the
obligations set forth in this Section 7.4.

 

Section 7.5 Preservation of Books and Records.

The Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Acquired Companies and the
Subsidiaries to, preserve and keep the records held by them relating to the
respective businesses of the Acquired Companies and the Subsidiaries prior to
the Closing Date for a period of seven (7) years from the Closing Date (or
longer if required by applicable Law) and shall make such records and
personnel available to the Sellers (including the right to make
copies thereof), at the Sellers own

 



60  cost and expense and to the extent not unreasonably burdensome to the
Acquired Companies and the Subsidiaries, as may be reasonably required by the
Sellers in connection with any insurance claims by, Legal Proceedings
(including with respect to the enforcement of this Agreement) or Tax audits
against or investigations by any Governmental Authority of the Sellers or any
of their Affiliates with respect to their ownership of the Acquired Companies
and the Subsidiaries or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the other Transaction Documents.

 

Section 7.6 Change of Control Payment.

The Purchaser shall cause the Acquired Companies or a Subsidiary, as
applicable, to pay James DiMatteos Change of Control Payment (net of any
applicable withholding Taxes which the Purchaser shall cause the Acquired
Companies or a Subsidiary, as applicable, to pay on or prior to the date such
amounts are due to the applicable Governmental Authority) when due and payable
in accordance with the terms of the applicable Change of Control Agreement.

Section 7.7 Assignment to Canadian Acquire Co.

 

The Purchaser shall, prior to the Closing Date, assign all of its rights and
obligations hereunder to a corporation organized under the laws of Canada or
a Province therein in accordance with Section 13.13(b). The Purchaser
acknowledges and agrees that such assignee shall purchase the Purchased
Securities in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement;
provided that no such assignment shall release the Purchaser from any of its
obligations hereunder.

(a) Subject to the other terms of this Agreement, the Sellers agree that,
upon written request by Purchaser in accordance with clause (c) hereunder, the
Sellers shall, and shall cause any of the Acquired Companies and the
Subsidiaries to, use their commercially reasonable efforts to (i) effect such
reorganizations of its business, operations and assets and the integration of
other affiliated businesses as set forth in and in accordance with Schedule
8.1, which such Schedule 8.1 shall not be amended without the prior written
consent of the Sellers Agent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned (the "Pre-Closing Reorganization") and (ii) co-operate
with the Purchaser and its advisors (A) in order to effect the Pre-Closing
Reorganization and (B) determine any potential amendments to Schedule 8.1 that
might be undertaken and the manner in which such amendments may most
effectively be undertaken.

 

(b) The Purchaser agrees that the Sellers Agent shall not be required to
agree to any amendments to Schedule 8.1 and the Sellers, the Acquired
Companies and the Subsidiaries shall not be required to effect the Pre-Closing
Reorganization or undertake to provide any cooperation or assistance to the
Purchaser in connection therewith, in each case, to the extent the Pre-
Closing Reorganization, such amendments, or such cooperation or assistance
will:

 



61 transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including by giving rise to

---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the
Acquired Companies and the Subsidiaries; 
---|---|---

or indirect, equityholders, including in the event the Closing does not

     | (iv) | prejudice or have adverse consequences for (after taking

---|---|--- 



     | (vi) | result in an unreimbursed cost, expense or Tax for the

---|---|--- 



     | (vii) | result or reasonably be expected to result in any
violation of applicable Law or Order. 
---|---|--- 
 

(c) The Purchaser shall provide written notice to the Sellers of its intention
to effect the Pre-Closing Reorganization at least twenty (20) Business Days
before the Closing Date and shall provide the Sellers Agent with drafts of
all documentation related or required to effect the Pre-Closing Reorganization
within fifteen (15) Business Days before the Closing Date and the Purchaser
shall consider in good faith all reasonable comments to such documentation
provided by the Sellers Agent (it being understood that the Purchaser shall
deliver the Sellers final copies of all such documentation within three (3)
Business Days of the Closing Date). Upon receipt of such notice, the Purchaser
and the Sellers shall work cooperatively and use commercially reasonable
efforts to prepare, before the Closing Date, all documentation necessary and
do such other acts and things as are necessary to give effect to the Pre-
Closing Reorganization.

(d) The Parties shall seek to have the Pre-Closing Reorganization made
effective as of the last moment of the day ending immediately before the
Closing Date, or such other time as the Purchaser reasonably requests (but, in
any event, after the satisfaction of the Closing conditions); provided, that
any such Pre-Closing Reorganization shall not take place until such time as
the Sellers Agent determines, in its sole discretion, that the transactions
contemplated herein are likely to be completed on the terms and
conditions contemplated by this Agreement.

(e) If the Closing does not occur, the Purchaser shall indemnify, hold
harmless and reimburse (promptly, and in any event within thirty (30) days,
upon receipt of reasonable documentation) the Sellers, the Acquired Companies
and the Subsidiaries for any and all (A) out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including any out-of-pocket costs and expenses for filing fees

 



62  and for external counsel, auditors, accountants or other professional
advisors) and Pre-Closing Reorganization Taxes (other than, for greater
certainty, the Reorg Indemnified Taxes, if any) incurred by the Sellers (and
any investor or Affiliate of the Sellers), the Acquired Companies and the
Subsidiaries in effecting the Pre-Closing Reorganization and (B) out-of-pocket
costs and expenses (including any out-of-pocket costs and expenses for filing
fees and for external counsel, auditors, accountants or other professional
advisors) and any Taxes incurred by the Sellers (and any investor or Affiliate
of the Sellers), the Acquired Companies and the Subsidiaries in the reversing
or unwinding of the Pre-Closing Reorganization (or portion thereof) that was
effected prior to the termination of this Agreement (other than, solely with
respect to Taxes, reversing any portion of the Pre-Closing Reorganization
involving paying (or capitalizing) the Intercompany Notes) (provided that
such reversal or unwinding must occur in the most tax-efficient manner which
is commercially reasonable under the circumstances). The obligations of the
Purchaser pursuant to this Section 8.1(e) will be in addition to any other
payment obligations of the Purchaser under this Agreement and, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, will survive termination of this
Agreement.

 

(f) If the Closing does occur, the Purchaser shall indemnify, hold harmless
and reimburse (promptly, and in any event within thirty (30) days, upon
receipt of reasonable documentation) the Sellers for any and all (A) out-of-
pocket costs and expenses (including any out-of-pocket costs and expenses for
filing fees and for external counsel, auditors, accountants or
other professional advisors) to the extent such out-of-pocket costs and
expenses (x) are included in the computation of the Closing Date Working
Capital, as finally determined or (y) have been paid by any of the Acquired
Companies or a Subsidiary prior to the Closing, and (B) Pre-Closing
Reorganization Taxes (other than, for greater certainty, the Reorg Indemnified
Taxes, if any) incurred by the Sellers (and any investor or Affiliate of the
Sellers, but not including the Acquired Companies or the Subsidiaries). The
obligations of the Purchaser pursuant to this Section 8.1(f) will be in
addition to any other payment obligations of the Purchaser under this
Agreement and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
will, with respect to any Pre-Closing Reorganization Taxes, survive until
sixty (60) days after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
(after giving effect to any extension, waiver, tolling, or
mitigation thereof). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Seller shall have any
right to be indemnified (or otherwise paid) by the Purchaser or any Affiliate
(including the Acquired Companies or any Subsidiary) for any Pre-Closing
Reorganization Taxes relating to, arising out of or in connection with (x)
any failure to in good faith follow in all material respects the steps
reasonably requested by the Purchaser in order to carry out the Pre-Closing
Reorganization as set forth on Schedule 8.1 or (y) any material inaccuracy in
the information as set forth in Schedule 8.1.

(g) For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that (x) none of the
representations and warranties of the Acquired Companies and the Sellers
contained in this Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents take into
account the Pre-Closing Reorganization or any change or effect
arising therefrom or incidental thereto, (y) for all purposes of this
Agreement and the Transaction Documents the representations and warranties of
the Acquired Companies and the Sellers contained in this Agreement or any of
the Transaction Documents shall be qualified in all respects by the Pre-
Closing Reorganization and (z) in no event shall Indemnified Taxes or any
other obligation of the Sellers to indemnity the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
hereunder include any Pre-Closing Reorganization Taxes (other than, for
greater certainty, the Reorg Indemnified Taxes, if any) or Losses relating to,
arising out of or in connection with the Pre-Closing Reorganization.

 



63 Section 8.2 Regulatory Filings and Other Actions.

 

(a) In addition to and not in limitation of the covenants contained in Section
6.3 and Section 7.2, the Acquired Companies and the Purchaser shall prepare
and file, as promptly as practicable (i) and in any event within ten (10)
Business Days after the date of this Agreement all filings and submissions
that are required, or that in the opinion of the Purchaser are advisable, in
order to obtain Competition Act Clearance, and (thereafter) the Acquired
Companies and the Purchaser will use their commercially reasonable efforts to
satisfy (as soon as reasonably practicable) all requests for additional
information and documentation received under or pursuant to those filings,
submissions or under applicable competition legislation, including any
requests made by any Governmental Entity under such legislation and (ii) in
any event within twenty (20) Business Days after the date of this Agreement,
such other filings, notices and applications that may be required to in order
to obtain the consents, approvals and authorizations from Persons and
Governmental Authorities that are necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents.

(b) Subject to Section 7.2(c), each of the Acquired Companies and the
Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to oppose, lift or rescind
any injunction or restraining or other order seeking to stop, or otherwise
adversely affecting its ability to consummate, this Agreement, the other
Transaction Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby or under the
other Transaction Documents and to defend, or cause to be defended, any
proceedings to which it is a party or brought against it or its directors or
officers challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or under the other Transaction Documents.

Section 8.3 Further Assurances.

From time to time after the date hereof, including after the Closing, and
without further consideration, the parties shall execute and deliver, or
arrange for the execution and delivery of, such other instruments of
conveyance and transfer and take or arrange for such other actions as may be
reasonably requested by the other party to more effectively complete any of
the transactions provided for in this Agreement or any document contemplated
hereby.

Section 8.4 Tax Matters.

(a) Except as required by Law, without the prior written consent of the
Sellers Agent, none of the Purchaser, the Acquired Companies or any of the
Subsidiaries shall take any position on (including making or changing any Tax
election), amend, re-file or otherwise modify (or grant any extension of any
applicable statute of limitation with respect to) any Tax Return (including
any amendment thereto) for, or agree to any settlement relating to, any
Sellers Tax Period.

 



64 (b) The Sellers Agent shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, all income Tax
Returns required to be filed by any of the Acquired Companies or the
Subsidiaries after the Closing Date for any tax period ending on or before the
Closing Date ("Seller Tax Returns"). Each Seller Tax Return shall be prepared
in accordance with existing procedures and practices and accounting methods
of the Acquired Companies or applicable Subsidiary except as required under
applicable Law. The Purchaser shall be given the opportunity to review,
comment upon and suggest changes or corrections to any Seller Tax Returns (it
being understood that the Sellers Agent shall consider in good faith all
reasonable changes or corrections to any Seller Tax Returns) prior to the
filing thereof (but in no event less than thirty (30) days prior to such
filing). The Sellers Agent shall not amend a Seller Tax Return following the
Closing Date without the prior written consent of the Purchaser (which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). The Purchaser shall
cause the Acquired Companies or applicable Subsidiary to file each Seller Tax
Return, in (i) the form prepared by Sellers Agent, if the Purchaser has no
comments, (ii) the form agreed to by Sellerss Agent and the Purchaser, if
the Purchaser has comments, or (iii) the form determined by the Independent
Accountant, if the Purchaser and Sellers Agent are unable to agree on the
form of such Seller Tax Return. The Purchaser shall prepare, or caused to be
prepared all Tax Returns required to be filed by any of the Acquired Companies
or the Subsidiaries after the Closing Date which are not Seller Tax Returns
(collectively, "Purchaser Tax Returns"). Each Purchaser Tax Return, to the
extent that it relates to a Sellers Tax Period, shall be prepared in
accordance with existing procedures and practices and accounting methods of
the Acquired Companies or applicable Subsidiary, unless, as reasonably
determined by the Purchaser, such procedure, practice, accounting method or
other contemplated treatment is not permitted under applicable Law. For
greater certainty, any Transaction Expenses and Transaction Employment Taxes
incurred by the Acquired Companies or the Subsidiaries shall be deducted in
the Seller Tax Returns or the Purchaser Tax Returns, as the case may be, in
accordance with the ITA, for the benefit of the Sellers (such benefit shall be
considered a Refund pursuant to Section 8.4(e)). The Sellers Agent shall be
given the opportunity to review, comment upon and suggest changes or
corrections to any Purchaser Tax Returns (it being understood that the
Purchaser shall consider in good faith all reasonable changes or corrections
to any Purchaser Tax Returns) that shows an Indemnified Tax or an amendment
to any Seller Tax Return prior to the filing thereof (but in no event less
than thirty (30) days prior to such filing); provided, however, the failure or
delay in meeting such thirty (30) day period shall not reduce or otherwise
affect the obligation or liabilities of the Sellers for such Indemnified
Taxes, except to the extent such failure or delay actually prejudices the
Sellers. The Purchaser shall cause the Acquired Companies or applicable
Subsidiary to file each Purchaser Tax Return in the form prepared by the
Purchaser, if the Sellers Agent has no comments, the form agreed to by the
Purchaser and the Sellers Agent, if the Sellers Agent has comments, or the
form determined by the Independent Accountant, if the Purchaser and the
Sellers Agent are unable to agree on the form of such Purchaser Tax Return.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sellers and the Purchaser agree, that the
Purchaser, at the request of either the Seller or the Purchaser shall cause
the Acquired Companies and its Subsidiaries to make an election pursuant to
subsection 256(9) of the ITA in respect of their taxation year ending
immediately prior to the acquisition of control of the Acquired Companies and
its Subsidiaries by the Purchaser. Without limiting the generality of Section
6.2 and Section 7.5, the Purchaser shall, and the Purchaser shall cause the
Acquired Companies and the Subsidiaries to, fully cooperate with each other
(including allowing access by the Sellers Agent and its Representatives to
the Company Books and Records and allowing the Sellers Agent (and its
Representatives) to make copies thereof) in connection with (i) the
preparation of any Seller Tax Returns or amendments thereto or (ii) the review
by the Sellers Agent of any Purchaser Tax Returns or amendments, and the
Sellers 

 



65  Agent (and its Representatives) shall not be charged with any cost or
expense for the assistance rendered by the Purchaser, the Acquired Companies
and the Subsidiaries and the Purchaser shall not be charged with any costs
and expenses for the assistance by the Sellers Agent, in connection therewith
(other than reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of third parties incurred by the
Purchaser or its Affiliates or the Sellers Agent). In the event of any
dispute regarding the matters set forth in this Section 8.4(a), the Purchaser
(in the case of a dispute regarding a Seller Tax Return) or the Sellers Agent
(in the case of a dispute regarding a Purchaser Tax Return) shall provide the
Sellers Agent or Purchaser, as the case may be, with written notice thereof
within fourteen (14) days of its access to such Seller Tax Returns or
Purchaser Tax Return, as applicable, or amendments, and the parties shall act
in good faith to resolve such dispute. If the parties cannot resolve such
dispute within fourteen (14) days of notice thereof, the Independent Auditor
shall be requested to make a determination resolving any such dispute and such
determination shall be final and binding. The Independent Auditor shall allow
the Purchaser and the Sellers Agent to present their respective positions
regarding the dispute (provided that, for greater certainty, such
presentations are limited to matters described in the Purchasers or Sellers
Agent dispute notice, as the case maybe, referred to above), and each of the
Purchaser and the Sellers Agent shall have the right to present additional
documents, materials and other information and to make an oral presentation
to the Independent Auditor regarding such dispute and the Independent Auditor
shall consider such additional documents, materials and other information and
such oral presentation. Any such other documents, materials or other
information shall be copied to each of the Purchaser and the Sellers Agent
and each of the Sellers Agent and the Purchaser shall be entitled to attend
any such oral presentation. The parties shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Independent Auditor to complete its work within fourteen
(14) calendar days of its engagement. The costs, fees and expenses of the
Independent Auditor shall be allocated to and borne by the Purchaser, on the
one hand, and the Sellers as a group, on the other hand, (with each Seller
responsible only for its Pro Rata Share of the Sellers portion) based on the
inverse of the percentage that the Independent Auditors determination
(before such allocation) bears to the total amount of the total items in
dispute as originally submitted to the Independent Auditor. For example,
should the items in dispute total in amount to $1,000 and the Independent
Auditor awards $600 in favor of the Purchasers position, 60% of the costs of
the Independent Auditors review would be borne by Sellers as a group, (with
each Seller responsible only for its Pro Rata Share of such costs) and 40% of
the costs would be borne by the Purchaser.

(c) The Purchaser shall timely pay or cause the Acquired Companies or the
applicable Subsidiary to timely pay all Taxes shown as being payable on any
Seller Tax Return or Purchaser Tax Return that are not Indemnified Taxes. The
Sellers shall timely pay, or timely reimburse the Purchaser or applicable
Acquired Company or Subsidiary for, any Taxes shown on a Seller Tax Return or
Purchaser Tax Return that are Indemnified Taxes, in each case, first from the
Indemnity Escrow Account and to the extent such account is insufficient to pay
such amounts, the remainder in accordance with Article 11. 

(d) The Purchaser and the Sellers shall for all Canadian and foreign Tax
purposes report the purchase and sale hereunder and the transactions
contemplated herein or under the other Transaction Documents in accordance
with their form and structure as set out herein and none of the Sellers shall
make any available Tax elections inconsistent therewith (other than
as contemplated as part of a Pre-Closing Reorganization and set forth on
Schedule 8.1).

 



66 (e) If a refund of Taxes (including Transaction Employment Taxes, but
excluding refunds of Transfer Taxes, which shall be allocated in the same
manner as Transfer Taxes are allocated under _Section 8.4(h)_) (to the extent
not reflected in the Closing Date Working Capital Statement) (the "Refund") is
received by or credited to the account of either of the Acquired Companies or
any of the Subsidiaries in respect of any Sellers Tax Period, the Purchaser
shall, or shall cause the Acquired Companies or any of the Subsidiaries, as
applicable, to pay, within thirty (30) days of receipt, the amount of the
Refund (net of any Taxes (including Taxes incurred on repatriating the amount
of such refund to the Purchaser) and any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
that the Purchaser, the Acquired Companies, or any of the Subsidiaries incur
(or has or will incur) with respect to such Refund) to the Sellers Agent on
behalf of the Sellers to be allocated in accordance with their Pro Rata Share.
For purposes of this Section 8.4(e), "Refund" shall include actual receipt of
a refund or interest, as well as a credit or offset of or against any other
actual or estimated Tax liability or any interest or penalties on such Tax
liability. Any amounts payable under this Section 8.4(e) shall constitute an
adjustment in the Purchase Price. Nothing in this Section 8.4(e) shall require
that the Purchaser make any payment with respect to any Refund (and such
Refunds shall be for the benefit of the Purchaser, the Acquired Companies and
the Subsidiaries) that is with respect to (A) any refund of Tax that is the
result of the carrying back of any net operating loss, non-capital loss or
other Tax attribute or Tax credit incurred in any Purchasers Tax Period; (B)
any refund of Tax resulting from the payments of Taxes made on or after
Closing Date to the extent the Sellers have not (x) indemnified the Purchaser,
the Acquired Companies, or the applicable Subsidiary for such Taxes, (y)
included such Tax in the computation of the Closing Date Working Capital or
(z) in the case of any Transaction Employment Taxes, included in the
computation of the Estimated Purchase Price; (C) any refund for Tax that
gives rise to a payment obligation by the Acquired Companies or a Subsidiary
to any Person under applicable Law or pursuant to a provision of a contract or
other agreement entered (or assumed) by the Acquired Companies or a Subsidiary
on or prior to the Closing Date, other than an obligation to pay Sellers
Agent for any Tax refunds that are for the benefit of Sellers pursuant to this
Section 8.4(e); or (D) any refund of Pre-Closing Reorganization Taxes (other
than, for greater certainty, the Reorg Indemnified Taxes, if any).

(f) For Tax purposes, any income, gain, deduction, loss or credit of the
Partnership or ABLP, as the case may be, for a Straddle Period shall be
allocated to each partner of the Partnership or ABLP (which, for greater
certainty, includes a partner at any time in the taxation year of the
Partnership or ABLP in which the Closing Date occurs) on the basis that the
Straddle Period consisted of two taxable periods, one that ended at the close
of business on the day immediately before the Closing Date and the other that
began on the Closing Date, and such income, gain, deduction, loss or credit
shall be allocated between two such periods on a "closing of the books basis";
provided, however, that (i) in the case of a Tax imposed in respect of
property or other similar Taxes imposed on a periodic basis and that applies
ratably to a Straddle Period, the amount of Tax allocable to a portion of the
Straddle Period shall be the total amount of such Tax for the entire Straddle
Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days
in such portion of such Straddle Period and the denominator of which is the
total number of days in such Straddle Period and (ii) in the case of sales,
value-added, withholding and similar transaction-based Taxes and employment
Taxes, such Taxes shall be allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period in
which the relevant transaction occurred. For greater certainty, any
Transaction Expenses and Transaction Employment Taxes incurred by the
Partnership or ABLP, as the case may be, in a Straddle Period shall be
allocated to and deducted in the determination of income in the first taxable
period that ended at the close of business on the day immediately before the
Closing Date.

 



67 (g) All Taxes and Tax liabilities (and Refunds) with respect to any Acquired
Company or Subsidiary other than the Partnership or ABLP (the "Acquired
Corporate Companies") that relate to a Straddle Period shall be apportioned
between the Sellers as a group, on the one hand (with each Seller responsible
only for its Pro Rata Share of the Sellers portion), and the Purchaser, on
the other hand, on the basis that the Straddle Period consisted of two taxable
periods, one that ended at the close of business on the day immediately before
the Closing Date and the other that began on the Closing Date, and such Taxes
shall be allocated between two such periods in the following manner: (i) in
the case of Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to income, sales,
gross receipts, wages, capital expenditures, expenses or any similar Tax
base, the amount of Tax allocable to a portion of the Straddle Period shall be
the total amount of such Tax for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in such portion of
such Straddle Period and the denominator of which is the total number of days
in such Straddle Period and (ii) in the case of any Tax based upon or related
to income, sales, gross receipts, wages, capital expenditures, expenses,
withholding taxes or any similar Tax base, the amount of such Tax that is
allocable to the portion of such Straddle Period that ends before the Closing
Date shall be deemed to be equal to the amount that would be payable if the
relevant Straddle Period had ended at the close of business on the day
immediately before the Closing Date. All determinations necessary to give
effect to the foregoing allocations (including amortization and depreciation
deductions) will be made in a manner consistent with prior practice of the
Acquired Corporate Companies. For greater certainty, any Transaction Expenses
and Transaction Employment Taxes incurred by the Acquired Corporate Companies
in a Straddle Period shall be allocated to and deducted in the determination
of income in the first taxable period that ended at the close of business on
the day immediately before the Closing Date.

(h) The Acquired Companies or applicable Subsidiary shall control any audit or
other Legal Proceeding in respect of any Tax Return or Taxes of the Acquired
Companies or a Subsidiary (a "Tax Contest"); _provided_ , _however_ , that
(A) the Sellers Agent, at the Sellers sole cost and expense, shall have the
right to participate in any such Tax Contest to the extent it relates to a
Sellers Tax Period and (B) the Purchaser shall not allow the Acquired
Companies or any Subsidiary to settle or otherwise resolve any Tax Contest if
such settlement or other resolution relates to Taxes for a Sellers Tax Period
without the prior written permission of the Sellers Agent (which will not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if any Tax Contest relates solely to any Seller Tax Returns, the
Sellers Agent, at the Sellers sole cost and expense, shall control such Tax
Contest; _provided_ , _however,_ (A) the Sellers Agent shall control such
contest diligently and in good faith as if the Sellers were solely responsible
for all resulting Taxes; (B) the Sellers Agent shall keep the Purchaser
reasonably informed regarding the status of such Tax Contest; (C) the
Purchaser shall have the right to participate, or cause the applicable
Acquired Company or applicable Subsidiary to participate in such Tax Contest;
and (D) the Sellers Agent shall not settle, resolve, or abandon (and shall
not allow the Acquired Companies or the Subsidiaries to settle, resolve, or
abandon) such Tax Contest without the prior written permission of the
Purchaser (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed)
if such settlement, resolution, or abandonment could result in the Acquired
Companies, any Subsidiary, or any other Purchaser Indemnified Party incurring
a Tax that is not an Indemnified Tax.

 



68 (i) The Sellers shall pay fifty percent (50%) and the Purchaser shall pay
fifty percent (50%) of all Transfer Taxes incurred in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereunder or under the other
Transaction Documents.

(j) Prior to the Closing Date, ABUS shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain from each "disqualified individual" (as defined in Code Section
280G(c)) a waiver of all payments or other benefits that ABUS is obligated to
pay or provide, that could, as reasonably determined by ABUS, in whole or in
part, not be deductible under Code Section 280G or subject to an excise Tax
under Code Section 4999 as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement " _Section 280G Waived Payments_ "). Prior to the Closing Date, and
after receiving, if required, the waivers provided for in this _Section
8.4(j)_, ABUS shall submit, accompanied by adequate disclosure, for
shareholder approval all Section 280G Waived Payments (and all other payments
or other benefits that ABUS plans to pay that could, in whole or in part, be
nondeductible under Code Section 280G or subject to an excise Tax under Code
Section 4999) in a manner such that if more than seventy five percent (75%) of
ABUS voting shareholders approve such payments or benefits, such approval
shall satisfy the requirements of Code Section 280G(b)(5)(B) (and Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder) and no Section 280G Waived Payments or any
other payments or benefits provided by ABUS to any "disqualified individual"
will be nondeductible under Code Section 280G or subject to an excise Tax
under Code Section 4999 as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. ABUS shall provide to the Purchaser drafts of any waivers,
disclosure documents and other relevant documents relating to the waiver and
vote. ABUS shall incorporate any reasonable comments made by the Purchaser
prior to obtaining the waivers and soliciting the vote no later than three (3)
days prior to obtaining the waivers. All costs and expenses of ABUS in
obtaining the waivers and soliciting the vote (and computing the amounts
related thereto) pursuant to this Section 8.4(j) shall be treated as
Transaction Expenses.

 

Section 8.5 Notice of Developments.

(a) Each party will, as soon as reasonably practicable, advise the other of

date hereof and which if existing and known at the date of this Agreement
would have been required to be set forth or disclosed in or pursuant to this

in this Agreement impossible, or which (if existing and known at the time of

Agreement not to be fully satisfied.

of any Knowledge of the Acquired Companies of any fact or occurrence after
the date hereof which would reasonably result in the termination or

covenant or agreement made by Purchaser herein.

Section 11.5 Limitations on Amount of Indemnification by Purchaser.

 

Notwithstanding anything provided in this Agreement to the contrary, no
indemnification shall be payable by the Purchaser pursuant to Section 11.4
with respect to any claim asserted by a Seller Indemnified Party after the

warranty or covenant in Section 11.1. Any liability of the Purchaser
to indemnify

 



75  a Seller Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 11.4 for a breach of a

of any of the Purchaser Fundamental Reps, subject to the following sentence.
In no event shall the aggregate liability of the Purchaser for
indemnification payable under this Article 11 exceed an amount equal to the
Base Purchase Price.

 

Section 11.6 Notice and Defense of Claims.

(a) In the event that any Person shall incur or suffer any Losses in respect
of which indemnification may be sought by such Person pursuant to the
provisions of this Article 11 (including any Losses to which the Deductible
is applicable), the Person seeking to be indemnified hereunder (the
"Indemnified Party") shall assert a claim for indemnification by written
notice to the Person from whom indemnification is sought (the "Indemnifying
Party") stating with reasonable specificity the nature and basis of such claim
(including the breach, inaccuracy, nonperformance or provision of the
Agreement to which such claim relates), a reasonable estimate of the amount
of such claim and including copies of all relevant pleadings and other demands
(a "Notice"). In the case of Losses arising by reason of any third party
claim, the Notice shall be given within thirty (30) days of the filing or
other written assertion of any such claim against the Indemnified Party and in
all other cases with reasonable promptness, but the failure of the Indemnified
Party to give the Notice within such time period shall not relieve
the Indemnifying Party of any liability that the Indemnifying Party may have
to the Indemnified Party unless the Indemnifying Party can demonstrate actual
loss or prejudice as a result of such failure.

 

(b) The Indemnified Party shall provide to the Indemnifying Party on request
all information and documentation reasonably necessary to support and verify
any Losses which the Indemnified Party believes give rise to a claim for
indemnification hereunder and shall give the Indemnifying Party reasonable
access to all premises, books, records and personnel in the possession or
under the control of the Indemnified Party which would have bearing on such
claim.

(c) In the case of any third party claims for which indemnification is
sought, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon written notice to
the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Notice, to:
(i) conduct and control (subject to the limitations set forth herein) at its
expense any proceedings or negotiations with such third party, (ii) take steps
to settle or defend any such claim (provided that the Indemnifying Party shall
not settle any such claim without the consent of the Indemnified Party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless the
settlement includes a complete and unconditional release of the Indemnified
Party with respect to the claim), (iii) employ counsel to contest any
such claim or liability; provided that the Indemnified Party shall have the
right to approve such counsel, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld and (iv) retain the consultant performing any remediation required by
Environmental Laws, provided that the Indemnified Party shall have the right
to approve such consultant, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.
In the event the Indemnifying Party elects to conduct and control any
proceedings itself, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to fully
participate at its own cost and expense and by its own separate counsel in any
proceedings relating to any third-party claim, except that the Indemnifying
Party shall pay the costs and expenses of such separate counsel if 

 



76  (x) in the Indemnified Partys good faith judgment, it is advisable, based
on the advice of counsel, for the Indemnified Party to be represented by
separate counsel because a conflict or potential conflict exists between the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party or (y) the named parties to such
third party claim include both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party and the Indemnified Party determines in good faith, based on the advice
of counsel, that defenses are available to it that are unavailable to the
Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall, within thirty (30) days
after delivery of the Notice to Indemnifying Party (the "Dispute Period"),
notify the Indemnified Party of its intention as to the conduct and control of
the defense of such claim, provided that the Indemnified Party and its counsel
shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel. Until the
Indemnified Party has received notice of the Indemnifying Partys election
whether to defend any claim, the Indemnified Party shall take reasonable steps
to defend (but may not settle) such claim. If the Indemnifying Party shall
decline to assume the defense of any such claim, or the Indemnifying Party
shall fail to notify the Indemnified Party within the Dispute Period of the
Indemnifying Partys election to defend such claim, the Indemnified Party
shall defend against such claim (provided that the Indemnified Party shall
not settle such claim without the consent of the Indemnifying Party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)). The
expenses of all proceedings, contests or lawsuits in respect of such claims
shall be borne by the Indemnifying Party but only if the Indemnifying Party is
responsible pursuant hereto to indemnify the Indemnified Party in respect of
the third party claim and, if applicable, only to the extent required by
Section 11.3 and Section 11.5, as the case may be, and subject to the
limitations of this Section 11.6 and Section 11.7. Regardless of whether the
Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense of the
claim, the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party agree to cooperate
fully with one another in connection therewith and to keep each other
reasonably informed of the status of the claim and any related proceeding and
the Indemnified Party shall take no action or make any admissions or
statements not required by applicable Law which would adversely affect the
defense of any such claim.

(d) If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party that it does not
dispute its liability to the Indemnified Party with respect to any claim under
this Article 11 or fails to notify the Indemnified Party within the Dispute
Period, the Losses arising from any such claim shall, subject to the
provisions of Section 11.3, Section 11.5 and Section 11.7, be conclusively
deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnifying Party
shall, subject to the provisions of Section 11.3, Section 11.5 and Section
11.7, pay the amount of such Loss to the Indemnified Party on demand following
the final determination thereof. If the Indemnifying Party has timely
disputed its liability with respect to such claim, the Indemnifying Party and
the Indemnified Party shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of
such dispute and, if not resolved through negotiations, either party may seek
a resolution of such dispute by litigation in a court of competent
jurisdiction.

(e) To the extent that there is an inconsistency between this _Section 11.6_
and _Section 8.4_ as it relates to a Tax Claim or a Tax Contest, the
provisions of _Section 8.4_ shall govern.

 



77 Section 11.7 Further Limitations and Qualifications on Indemnification. 

(a) _Damages_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
Indemnified Party shall have no right to indemnification with respect to (A)
any Losses to the extent not the reasonably foreseeable result of any breach
by the Indemnifying Party of a representation and warranty or covenant
contained in this Agreement, or (B) punitive or exemplary damages, unless
finally awarded to be payable to a third party by a court of competent
jurisdiction or related to any claim or cause of action for or based upon
fraud.

 

(b) _Tax Benefit_. If the payment of the amount for which indemnification is
provided under Section 11.2 or Section 11.4 gives rise to a currently
realizable Tax Savings (as defined below) to the Indemnified Party, the
indemnity payment shall be reduced by the amount of the Tax Savings available
to the Indemnified Party. To the extent such amount does not give rise to a
currently realizable Tax Savings, if such amount gives rise to a Tax Savings
to the Indemnified Party that are currently realizable (as defined below) in
any of the three (3) years following the payment of the amount, such
Indemnified Party shall refund to the Indemnifying Party the amount of such
Tax Savings when, as and if realized. For the purposes of this Agreement, any
subsequently realized Tax Savings in any of the three (3) years following
payment of the amount shall be treated as though it were a reduction in the
amount of the initial indemnity payment, and the Liabilities of the parties
shall be re-determined as though both occurred at or prior to the time of the
indemnity payment. For purposes of this Section 11.7(b), a "Tax Savings"
means an amount by which the Tax liability of the Indemnified Party (or
Affiliates of or group of corporations including the Indemnified Party) is
reduced (including without limitation, by deduction, reduction of income by
virtue of increased tax basis or otherwise, entitlement to refund, credit or
otherwise) plus any related interest received from the relevant Tax
Governmental Authority. Where an Indemnified Party has other
losses, deductions, credits or items available to it, the Tax Savings from
any losses, deductions, credits or items relating to the indemnity payment
shall be deemed to be realized first before any other losses, deductions,
credits or items are realized. For the purposes of this Section 11.7(b), a
Tax Savings is "currently realizable" to the extent that such Tax Savings will
actually be realized in the current taxable period or year (including through
a carryback to a prior taxable period). In the event that there should be a
determination disallowing the Tax Savings, the Indemnifying Party shall be
liable to refund to the Indemnified Party the amount of any related reduction
previously allowed or payments previously made to the Indemnifying Party
pursuant to this Section 11.7(b). The amount of the refunded reduction or
payment shall be deemed a payment under Section 11.6(d) of this Agreement.

 

(c) _Right to Recover_. The Indemnifying Party shall make any indemnification
payments determined to be payable to the Indemnified Party hereunder without
regard to any expectation that the Indemnified Party (including, for this
Section 11.7(c) in the case of the Purchaser, the Acquired Companies and the
Subsidiaries) will recover insurance proceeds or other amounts (whether by
payment, discount, credit, relief, insurance or otherwise) as a result of the
matter giving rise to the claim for which indemnification payments are to be
made. The Indemnified Party will use commercially reasonable efforts to
promptly seek to recover or make a claim for insurance proceeds or other
amounts available (including pursuant to any indemnification rights of the
Acquired Companies or the Subsidiaries under any APA) as a result of any
matter giving rise to an indemnification claim of the Indemnified Party
against the Indemnifying Party. In addition, the Indemnifying Party shall, to
the extent of any indemnification payment made by it, be subrogated to all
rights of the Indemnified Party against any third party in respect of the
claim to which the indemnification payment relates. If the Indemnified Party
receives any insurance proceeds or other amounts (including pursuant to any

 



78  indemnification rights of the Acquired Companies or the Subsidiaries under
any APA) as a result of the matter giving rise to any indemnification claim of
the Indemnified Party prior to the date upon which the Indemnifying Party is
given notice of the claim, the Indemnifying Partys indemnification obligation
with respect to such claim shall be reduced by the amount of any such
insurance proceeds or other amounts (including any amounts recovered pursuant
to the exercise of any indemnification rights of the Acquired Companies or the
Subsidiaries under any APA) actually received by the Indemnified Party. If the
Indemnified Party receives any insurance proceeds or other amounts (including
any amounts recovered pursuant to the exercise of any indemnification rights
of the Acquired Companies or the Subsidiaries under any APA) as a result of
the matter giving rise to any indemnification claim of the Indemnified Party
against the Indemnifying Party after the Indemnifying Party has paid such
indemnification claim to the Indemnified Party, then the Indemnified Party
shall promptly turn over any such insurance proceeds or other amounts received
to the Indemnifying Party to the extent of the payments made by the
Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party on the claim.

(d) _Exclusive Remedies_. Subject to the rights of the parties pursuant to
Section 13.6, from and after Closing, except with respect to matters covered
by Section 2.6 and Section 8.1, the sole recourse and exclusive remedy of the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties and the Seller Indemnified Parties arising out
of this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents or the transactions
contemplated hereunder or thereunder, whether based on tort, contract,
statutory or common law remedy or equitable remedy or otherwise, including
any misrepresentation, breach of warranty, non-fulfillment or failure to
perform and covenant or agreement or otherwise, shall be to assert a claim for
indemnification under the indemnification provisions of this Article 11 and
the Purchaser and the Sellers each covenant that it (and the Indemnified
Parties) will not seek to obtain any remedy except as provided in this Article
11, other than a claim of fraud. No Person who was an officer, director,
employee, limited partner, general partner or shareholder (other than the
Sellers in accordance with Article 11) of any of the Acquired Companies or any
of the Subsidiaries prior to the Closing shall have any liability in its
capacity as officer, director, employee, limited partner, general partner or
shareholder to make any payment in respect of any breach of any representation
or warranty or non-performance of any covenant or agreement made in or
pursuant to this Agreement. 

(e) _Duration of Claim_. The indemnification obligations of the Indemnifying
Party pursuant to this Agreement with respect to a specific claim for which
indemnification is provided under this Agreement shall extend beyond the time
period for indemnification set forth herein with respect to such specific
claim until it has been fully discharged or resolved or settled; provided,
however, a Notice shall have been given to the Indemnifying Party on or prior
to the end of such time period.

(f) _Mitigation of Losses_. The Indemnified Party shall take all commercially
reasonable steps to mitigate any Losses upon and after becoming aware of any
event, fact or circumstance which could reasonably be expected to give rise
to Losses. To the extent the Indemnified Party shall fail to take such steps,
then the Indemnifying Party shall not be required to indemnify any Indemnified
Party for the Losses that could have been avoided if the Indemnified Party
had taken such steps to mitigate the Losses.

 



79 Section 11.8 Indemnification Adjustment to Purchase Price.

 

To the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any amounts payable
under this Article 11 shall constitute an adjustment in the Purchase Price.

     | (ii) | by the Acquired Companies, if the Acquired Companies and
the Sellers are not in material breach of this Agreement and the Purchaser
shall have breached any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement, which breach (i) would give rise to
the failure of a condition set forth in Section 10.1 or 10.2, and (ii) remains
uncured on the earlier of (x) the date which is thirty (30) days following
the Purchasers receipt of written notice thereof from the Company and (y) the

or, in the case of the Acquired Companies, the Acquired Companies or the
Sellers breach of this Agreement results in the failure to close by such
date; provided, that, if on the Outside Date the only condition to Closing
which has not been satisfied is the receipt of Competition Act Clearance (and

extend the Outside Date to November 30, 2013.

83 Section 13.3 Amendments and Waivers.

 

No amendment to this Agreement may be made unless agreed to by the parties in
writing. The parties hereto may, by an instrument in writing signed on behalf
of such party, waive compliance by any other party with any term or provision
of this Agreement that such other party was or is obligated to comply with or
perform. No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. No waiver of any of the
provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed, or shall constitute, a waiver
of any other provision of this Agreement, whether or not similar, nor shall
such waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly
provided.

 

Section 13.4 Disclosure Schedule and Exhibits.

(a) The Schedules shall be deemed to be attached hereto and made a part
hereof. All references herein to this Agreement shall include the Schedules.

 

(b) Nothing in the Schedules is intended to broaden the scope of any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement. The Schedules and the
information and disclosures contained therein are intended only to qualify and
limit the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the
Sellers, the Acquired Companies or the Purchaser, as the case may be,
contained in this Agreement and shall not be deemed to expand in any way the
scope or effect of any of such representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements.

(c) The disclosure of any item in any Schedule (or section thereof) shall be
made with respect to all Schedules in the Agreement calling for disclosure of
such information if it is reasonably apparent on the face of such Schedules
that such disclosure is applicable.

(d) No reference to or disclosure of any item or other matter in any Schedule
(or any section thereof) shall be construed as an admission or indication that
such item is required to be referred to or disclosed in any Schedule (or any
section thereof). Inclusion of any item in a Schedule (or any
section thereof) does not constitute a determination by the representing
party that such item is material and shall not be deemed to establish a
standard of materiality. No disclosure in a Schedule (or any section thereof)
relating to any possible breach or violation of any Contract, Law or any
potential adverse contingency shall be construed as an admission or indication
that any such breach or violation exists or has actually occurred or that such
adverse contingency will actually occur.

 

Section 13.5 Disclaimer of Other Representations; Projections.

 

The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that, except for the representations and
warranties made by the Acquired Companies or the Sellers expressly set forth
in Article 3, Article 4 and the Transaction Documents, respectively, none of
the Sellers, the Acquired Companies or any of their respective Affiliates or
Representatives has made, and shall not be construed as having made, to the
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or Representatives, any representation or
warranty of any kind, express or implied, written or oral, at law or in
equity, in respect of the Sellers, the Acquired Companies or any of the
Subsidiaries, the Purchased Securities or any of the assets, properties,
liabilities, business, operations or affairs of the Sellers,

 



84  the Acquired Companies or any of the Subsidiaries, including with respect to
(i) merchantability or fitness for any particular purpose, (ii) the operation
of the Acquired Companies and the Subsidiaries by the Purchaser after the
Closing, or (iii) the probable success or profitability of the Acquired
Companies and the Subsidiaries after the Closing. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and notwithstanding any otherwise express
representations and warranties made by the Acquired Companies or the Sellers
in Article 3 and Article 4, respectively, the Purchaser agrees that (A)
neither the Sellers, the Acquired Companies or any of their
respective Affiliates or Representatives makes or has made any representation
or warranty to the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or Representatives with
respect to, and (B) other than the indemnification obligations set forth in
Article 11, none of the Sellers, the Acquired Companies or any of their
respective Affiliates or Representatives shall have or be subject to any
liability or indemnification obligation to the Purchaser or to any other
Person resulting from the distribution to Purchaser or its Affiliates or
Representatives of, or the Purchasers use of:



     | (i) | (A) any projections, financial models, estimates, forecasts
or budgets contained in that certain confidential offering memorandum relating
to the Acquired Companies or any of the Subsidiaries (the "Confidential
Memorandum") or (B) any projections, financial models, estimates, forecasts or
budgets relating to the business of either of the Acquired Companies or any of
the Subsidiaries otherwise heretofore or hereafter delivered to, presented to
(including, for greater certainty, in any management presentation) or made
available to the Purchaser or its Representatives or Affiliates; and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | any other information, statement or documents heretofore or
hereafter delivered to, presented to (including, for greater certainty, in any
management presentation) or made available to the Purchaser or its
Representatives or Affiliates, whether orally or in writing (including in the
Confidential Memorandum, the "data room", functional "break-out" discussions,
responses to questions submitted on behalf of the Purchaser or otherwise),
with respect to the Sellers, the Acquired Companies or any of the
Subsidiaries, the Purchased Securities or any of the assets, properties,
liabilities, business, operations or affairs of the Sellers, the Acquired
Companies or any of the Subsidiaries, except to the extent and as expressly
covered by a representation and warranty contained in Article 3 or Article 4. 
---|---|--- 
 

Section 13.6 Enforcement of Agreement.

The parties agree that irreparable damage to the parties for which monetary
damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement (including the failure by any party
to take such actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents) was not performed in accordance with its specified terms or
was otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the non-breaching party
shall be entitled to an injunction or other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in any court of competent jurisdiction, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which the non-breaching party are entitled at
Law or in equity, and any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond
in connection with the obtaining of any such injunctive or other equitable
relief is hereby waived.

 



85 Section 13.7 Severability.

 

Wherever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in
such a manner as to be effective and valid under applicable Law. If any
portion of this Agreement is declared invalid for any reason in any
jurisdiction, such declaration shall have no effect upon the remaining
portions of this Agreement which shall continue in full force and effect as if
this Agreement had been executed with the invalid portions thereof deleted;
provided, however, if such severability will negate in any material respect
the monetary terms of this Agreement, then the parties shall negotiate in good
faith to amend the invalid terms in a manner so that such terms shall not be
invalid and will not modify in any material respect the monetary terms of this
Agreement unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. Furthermore, the entirety
of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect in all other
jurisdictions.

Section 13.8 Entire Understanding.

 

This Agreement, including the Schedules and Exhibits hereto, and the other
Transaction Documents sets forth the entire agreement and understanding
between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes
any and all prior discussions, negotiations, letters of intent or agreements
in principle between them, other than the Confidentiality Agreement which
shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement in accordance with
its terms.

Section 13.9 Binding Effect; No Third Party Beneficiaries.

Except for the provisions of Article 11 relating to the Seller Indemnified
Parties and Purchaser Indemnified Parties and Section 7.4 relating to the
Directors and Officers, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure
to the exclusive benefit of the parties and their respective heirs, executors,
administrators, legal representatives, successors and permitted assigns and
nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to, nor shall it, confer in
any other Person any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. The parties agree that, for
the purpose of giving enforceable rights under this Agreement: (i) to the
Seller Indemnified Parties who are not party to this Agreement, the Sellers
Agent is contracting as the agent of such Persons and will hold the rights of
such Persons in trust for them, (ii) to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties who
are not party to this Agreement, the Purchaser is contracting as the agent of
such Persons and will hold the rights of such Persons in trust for them and
(iii) the Directors and Officers who are not party to this Agreement, the
Sellers Agent is contracting as the agent of such Persons and will hold the
rights of such Persons in trust for them.

 

Section 13.10 Governing Law.

This Agreement is and shall be deemed to be a contract entered into and made
pursuant to the laws of the Province of Ontario and the laws of Canada
applicable therein and shall in all respects be governed, construed, applied
and enforced in accordance with said laws, without reference to applicable
conflict of laws rules or principles.

 



86 Section 13.11 Choice of Forum and Consent to Jurisdiction.

 

Any action arising out of or under this Agreement, any other document,
instrument or agreement contemplated herein or delivered pursuant hereto, or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the other Transaction
Documents or any of such other documents, instruments or agreements, shall be
brought only in a federal or provincial court having jurisdiction and venue in
Ontario, Canada, each of the parties hereby irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of such courts and agrees that venue in Ontario is
proper. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, final judgment against such
party (a certified copy of which shall be conclusive evidence of the fact and
of the amount of any indebtedness of such party hereunder) in any such legal
action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on an unsatisfied judgment or similar proceeding. Each
of the parties hereby irrevocably waives and agrees not to assert, by way of
motion, as a defense, or otherwise, in any legal action or proceeding, any
defense or any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of
the above-named courts for any reason, including claims that such party may be
immune from the above-described legal process (whether through service or
notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution,
or otherwise), or that such proceeding is brought in an inconvenient or
otherwise improper forum or that this Agreement or any of the other
aforementioned documents, instruments or agreements, or the subject matter
hereof or thereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts, or that the same
are governed by the laws of a jurisdiction other than Ontario. Each of the
parties hereby specifically agrees that it shall not bring any actions, suits
or proceedings arising out of or under this Agreement, any other document,
instrument or agreement contemplated herein or delivered pursuant hereto, or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the other Transaction
Documents or any of such other documents, instruments or agreements, in the
courts of any jurisdiction other than the above-named courts of Ontario, that
any such action brought by any party shall be dismissed upon the basis of the
agreements, terms and provisions set forth in this Section 13.11, and that
any order or judgment obtained in any such action from a court other than the
courts of Ontario, Canada shall be void _ab initio_ ; _provided_ , that, for
greater certainty, the foregoing shall not prevent any party from bringing an
action in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce a judgment rendered
in any federal or provincial court having jurisdiction and venue in Ontario,
Canada.

Section 13.12 Waiver of Trial by Jury.

EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
LAW, ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM, SUIT, LITIGATION,
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED UPON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER
TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. THE
PARTIES AGREE THAT ANY OF THEM MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS PROVISION WITH ANY
COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE KNOWING, VOLUNTARY AND BARGAINED
FOR AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY TO WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY, AND
THAT SUCH PROCEEDING WHATSOEVER BETWEEN THEM SHALL INSTEAD BE TRIED BY A COURT
OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION BY A JUDGE SITTING WITHOUT A JURY.

 



87 Section 13.13 Assignability.

 

(a) Except as set forth below, no party hereto shall sell, pledge, assign or
otherwise transfer its rights under this Agreement without the prior written
consent of the other parties and any attempt to do so shall be void.

(b) The Purchaser may, without the consent of the other parties hereto (i)
assign its rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement to any of
its wholly-owned subsidiaries, if such subsidiary delivers to the Sellers an
instrument in writing that it is bound by and shall perform the obligations
of the Purchaser under this Agreement as if it were an original signatory
hereto or (ii) assign its rights or interests under this Agreement as
collateral to any financial or lending institution providing financing to the
Purchaser in connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder;
_provided_ , that, in each case, no such assignment shall release the
Purchaser from any of its obligations hereunder. In the event of an assignment
contemplated by this Section 13.13(b), any reference in this Agreement to the
"Purchaser" shall be deemed to include its subsidiary transferee.

Section 13.14 Counterparts; Delivery by Electronic Transmission.

 

This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (including by facsimile or
other means of electronic transmission, such as by electronic mail in " _pdf_
" form), all of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and
all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by
facsimile transmission or other electronic transmission shall be as effective
as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

Section 13.15 Public Announcements.

No public announcements or other publicity (including any communication to
employees, customers or suppliers of the Acquired Companies or any of the
Subsidiaries) regarding the transactions referred to herein shall be made by
the Purchaser, the Sellers, the Acquired Companies or any of the Subsidiaries
at any time prior to the Closing without the prior written consent of the
other parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed) as to form, content, timing and manner of distribution
or publication, except (i) that any party may make any public disclosure to
the extent it believes in good faith that it is required by applicable Law or
any listing or trading agreement or the rules and regulations of any
securities exchange or automated securities quotation system concerning its
publicly-traded securities (in which case the disclosing Party will, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, any such listing or trading agreement,
rules or regulations, use its commercially reasonable efforts to advise the
other Party prior to making the disclosure, deliver a copy of such proposed
disclosure to the other party (and accept any reasonable comments provided by
such other party) and use commercially reasonable efforts to seek
confidential treatment of such disclosure), and (ii) each party may disclose
to its current and prospective banks, shareholders, partners, investors and
advisors the name of the other party, the date of the transaction, the price
and the key terms

 



88  under this Agreement. The parties shall also obtain the other parties prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed) of any press release to be issued immediately following (i) the
execution of this Agreement and (ii) the Closing announcing the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents.

 

Section 13.16 Appointment of Sellers Agent

(a) By execution of this Agreement, each Seller has appointed the Sellers
Agent as its true and lawful agent and attorney-in-fact such that Sellers
Agent has the authority, for and on behalf of such Seller, to take such
actions and exercise such discretion as are required of such Seller pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and any
related document or instrument, and any such actions shall be binding on such
Seller, including, without limitation, the following:



     | (i) | to receive, hold, execute and deliver to the Purchaser, on
behalf of such Seller, securities powers, assignment agreements and the
certificates representing the Purchased Securities held by such Seller, and
any other documents relating thereto;

     | (v) | to receive payments on behalf of such Seller due and owing
pursuant to this Agreement and acknowledge receipt thereof;

such amendment, supplement, change or waiver applies to all Sellers;

     | (vii) | to receive service of process on behalf of such Seller in
connection with any claims under this Agreement, the other Transaction
Documents or any related document or instrument;

---|---|--- 



     | (ix) | to take all actions necessary or appropriate in the
judgment of Sellers Agent to accomplish any of the foregoing. 
---|---|--- 
 



89 (b) Each Seller agrees that upon payment of the Purchase Price being made to
the Sellers Agent for such Sellers Purchased Securities in accordance with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, all right, title, benefit and
interest of such Seller in such Purchased Securities shall be deemed to have
been transferred to the Purchaser and the Purchaser shall be entitled to have
such shares registered in its name in the registry of the Acquired Companies,
as applicable, even where such Seller fails to deliver at closing the
certificates, if applicable, representing such Sellers Purchased Securities,
or other document otherwise contemplated herein to be delivered at closing by
such Seller.

(c) The Sellers Agent shall not be liable for any act done or omitted to be
taken as Sellers Agent except expressly as set forth herein. By execution of
this Agreement, each Seller shall have and shall be deemed to have agreed
that the Sellers shall severally and not jointly and severally indemnify and
hold harmless the Sellers Agent and its partners, stockholders, Affiliates,
directors, officers, fiduciaries, employees and agents and each of the
partners, stockholders, Affiliates, directors, officers, fiduciaries,
employees and agents of each of the foregoing (each a "Agent Indemnified
Party") from and against all losses, liabilities, claims or expenses incurred
or suffered by the Agent Indemnified Parties as a result of, or arising out
of, or relating to any and all actions taken or omitted to be taken by the
Sellers Agent under this Agreement or in connection with the incurrence,
payment, discharge or settlement of any of the obligations of the Sellers,
except for any such losses, liabilities, claims or expenses that arise on
account of the Sellers Agents fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct
as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final adjudication.
None of the Agent Indemnified Parties shall be liable to any Seller in respect
of such arrangements or actions or omissions in connection therewith, except
to the extent that such acts or omissions constitute fraud, gross negligence
or willful misconduct. A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Sellers
Agent shall constitute a decision for all Sellers hereunder, and shall be
final, binding and conclusive upon each Seller and the Purchaser and the
Acquired Companies may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or
instruction of Sellers Agent as being the decision, act, consent or
instruction of such Seller and treat such Sellers Agent as the
duly appointed attorney-in-fact of each Seller and as having the duties,
power and authority provided for in this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.
The Purchaser and the Acquired Companies are hereby relieved from any
liability to any Person for any acts done by them in accordance with such
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Sellers Agent.

(d) The Sellers Agent shall be entitled (x) at any time and from time to
time to reimbursement from the Sellers for any Sellers Agent Expenses and (y)
to withhold any amounts from the proceeds delivered to it under Section
2.3(ii) as it deems reasonably necessary to satisfy any adjustments
contemplated by Section 2.7; it being understood that following the
determination of such adjustment, the Sellers Agent shall pay to the Sellers
their Pro Rata Share of any amounts not paid to the Purchaser pursuant
thereto.

(e) The Sellers Agent will at all times be entitled to rely on
any directions received from the Sellers (acting by an affirmative vote of
the Sellers whose aggregate Pro Rata Share immediately prior to the date
hereof was greater than 50%); provided, however, that the Sellers Agent shall
not be required to follow any such direction, and shall be under no
obligation to take any action in its capacity as the Sellers Agent, unless
the Sellers Agent has been provided with the funds, security or indemnities
which, in the sole determination of the Sellers Agent, are sufficient to
protect the Sellers Agent against the costs, expenses and liabilities which
may be incurred by the Sellers Agent in responding to such direction or
taking such action.

 



90 (f) If the Sellers Agent becomes unable to serve as Sellers Agent, such
other Person or Persons may be designated by the Sellers (acting by an
affirmative vote of the Sellers whose aggregate Pro Rata Share immediately
prior to the date hereof was greater than 50%), and such Person or Persons
shall succeed as Sellers Agent.

(g) Any notice given to the Sellers Agent hereunder in accordance with
Section 13.2 or under the Escrow Agreement will constitute notice to each and
all of the Sellers at the time notice is given to the Sellers Agent (other
than notice to a Seller for service of process relating to a Legal Proceeding
before a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction, which notice must
be given to such Seller individual, as applicable). Any action taken by, or
notice or instruction received from, the Sellers Agent hereunder in
accordance with Section 13.2 or under the Escrow Agreement will be deemed to
be action by, or notice or instruction from, each and all of the Sellers. The
Purchaser and the Acquired Companies may, and the Escrow Agent will, disregard
any notice or instruction received from any one or more individual Sellers,
other than the Sellers Agent.

(h) The Sellers Agent shall have the discretion to take such action as
the Sellers Agent shall determine to be in the best interests of all of the
Sellers; provided, however, that in any event, all Sellers are treated in a
substantially proportionate manner.

 

(i) All of the indemnities, immunities and powers granted to the Sellers
Agent under this Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

Section 13.17 Mutual Drafting.

 

The parties hereto are sophisticated and have been represented by lawyers who
have carefully negotiated the provisions hereof. As a consequence, the
parties do not intend that the presumptions of any laws or rules relating to
the interpretation of contracts against the drafter of any particular clause
should be applied to this Agreement and therefore waive their effects. 

Section 13.18 Legal Representation

The Purchaser, the Sellers and the Acquired Companies hereby agree, on their
own behalf and on behalf of their directors, shareholders, members, partners,
officers, employees and Affiliates, and each of their successors and assigns
(all such parties, the "Waiving Parties"), that (i) Torys LLP may represent
any of the Sellers and each of their Affiliates, other than the Acquired
Companies and the Subsidiaries (individually and collectively, the "Seller
Group"), on the one hand, and the Acquired Companies and the Subsidiaries, on
the other hand, in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the other documents contemplated hereunder and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereunder or under the other
Transaction Documents (such representation, the "Current Representation"), and
(ii) Torys LLP (or any successor) may represent the Seller Group or any
member of the Seller Group or any director, shareholder, member, partner,
officer, employee or Affiliate of the Seller Group or any member of the Seller
Group, other than the Acquired Companies and the Subsidiaries, in each case
in connection with any dispute, litigation, claim, proceeding or obligation
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents
and the other documents contemplated hereunder and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereunder or under the other Transaction Documents
(any such

 



91  representation, the "Post-Closing Representation") notwithstanding such
representation (or any continued representation) of the Acquired Companies or
the Subsidiaries, and each of the Purchaser and the Acquired Companies on
behalf of itself and the Waiving Parties hereby consents thereto and
irrevocably waives (and will not assert) any conflict of interest or any
objection arising therefrom or relating thereto. Each of the Purchaser and
the Acquired Companies acknowledge that the foregoing provision applies
whether or not Torys LLP provides legal services to either of the Acquired
Companies or any of the Subsidiaries after the Closing Date. Each of the
Purchaser and the Acquired Companies, for itself and the Waiving Parties,
hereby irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that all communications between the
Seller Group and their counsel, including Torys LLP, made in connection with
the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and performance under, or
any dispute or proceeding arising out of or relating to, this Agreement, the
other Transaction Documents and the other documents contemplated hereunder and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereunder or under the
other Transaction Documents, or any matter relating to any of the foregoing,
are privileged communications between the Seller Group and such counsel and
none of the Purchaser, the Acquired Companies, or any Person purporting to
act on behalf of or through the Purchaser or the Acquired Companies or any of
the Waiving Parties, will seek to obtain the same by any process. From and
after the Closing, each of the Purchaser and the Acquired Companies, on behalf
of itself and the Waiving Parties, waives and will not assert any attorney-
client privilege with respect to any communication between Torys LLP and the
Acquired Companies or any Person in the Seller Group occurring during the
Current Representation in connection with any Post-Closing Representation.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 13.18, neither the
Sellers Agent nor any Seller may assert (or cause to be asserted on their
behalf) the attorney-client privilege with respect to any communication that
reflects any fraud with respect to the transactions contemplated hereunder or
under the other Transaction Documents. Further, in the event that a dispute
arises between the Purchaser, the Acquired Companies or any of the
Subsidiaries and a third party other than a party to this Agreement after the
Closing, the Acquired Companies and the Subsidiaries may assert the attorney-
client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential communications by Torys
LLP (or any successors), the Sellers Agent or any of Sellers to such third
party; provided, however, that the Acquired Companies and the Subsidiaries may
not waive such privilege without the prior written consent of the Sellers
Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

Section 13.19 Limited Partnership. 

GP Co, in its capacity as the sole general partner of the Partnership, shall
cause the Partnership to perform all of its obligations under this Agreement.

 



92 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the parties has executed or caused this Agreement
to be executed by its duly authorized officer as of the date first written
above.
