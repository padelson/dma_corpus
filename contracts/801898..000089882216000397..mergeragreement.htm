ARTICLE II 
  
  
  EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES AND BOOK-ENTRY SHARES

  

  

SECTION 2.01 _Effect of Merger on Capital Stock_.

  

  

(a) _Treatment of Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub
or any holder of shares of Company Common Stock:

  


  (i) Cancellation of Treasury and Certain Other Stock. Each share of common
stock, $1.00 par value, of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") that is
owned by the Company as treasury stock, if any, each share of Company Common
Stock that is owned by a wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company, if any, and
each share of Company Common Stock that is owned, directly or indirectly, by
Parent or Merger Sub, if any, immediately prior to the Effective Time shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and no consideration or payment shall be delivered in
exchange therefor or in respect thereof;

  

  

(ii) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to Section 2.01(b) and
except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each share of Company Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (except
for shares to be canceled and retired or converted in accordance with Section
2.01(a)(i) and the Dissenting Shares) shall be converted automatically into
the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest) equal to the Merger
Consideration, payable as provided in Section 2.02, and, when so converted,
shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist; and

  

  

  

  

 

3  

  

(iii) Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock. Each share of common stock, par
value $1.00 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock, $1.00
par value, of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and
after the Effective Time, all certificates representing the common stock of
Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares
of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in
accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

  

  

(b) _Adjustments to Merger Consideration_. If at any time during the period
between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company (or any other securities
convertible therefor or exchangeable thereto) shall occur as a result of any
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), combination,
exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or stock
distribution with a record date during such period, or any similar event, the
Merger Consideration and any other similarly dependent items shall be
equitably adjusted to provide to Parent, Merger Sub, and the holders of
Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such action.

  

  

SECTION 2.02 _Payment for Shares_.

  

  

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall
mutually agree upon and appoint a bank or trust company to act as paying agent
(the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging shares of Company
Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section
2.01(a)(ii). Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall irrevocably deposit or
cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent, in trust for the benefit of the
holders of Company Common Stock contemplated by Section 2.01(a)(ii), cash in
an amount equal to the aggregate amount of the Merger Consideration pursuant
to Section 2.01(a)(ii) (the " _Payment Fund_ ") and shall provide written
evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company of the completion of such
deposit. The Paying Agent shall deliver the Merger Consideration to be paid
pursuant to Section 2.01(a) out of the Payment Fund. Except as provided in
Section 2.02(e), the Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

  

  

    

(b)

  |  

 _Payment Procedures_.

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

(i) Promptly after the Effective Time (but no later than two (2) Business Days
after the Effective Time), the Paying Agent will mail to each holder of record
of a certificate representing outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time (a " _Certificate_ ") and to each
holder of uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock represented by book
entry immediately prior to the Effective Time (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), in
each case, whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(a)(ii):

  

 

4  

  

(1) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and that risk of loss and title to Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
held by such holder will pass, only upon delivery of such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and which shall be in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Company, and

  

  

(2) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration with respect to
such shares.

  

  

(ii) Upon surrender to, and acceptance in accordance with Section 2.02(b)(iii)
by, the Paying Agent of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share, the holder thereof
will be entitled to the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the number
of shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share surrendered under this Agreement.

  

  

(iii) The Paying Agent will accept Certificates or Book-Entry Shares upon
compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent may
impose to effect an orderly exchange of the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares
in accordance with customary exchange practices.

  

  

(iv) From and after the Effective Time, no further transfers may be made on
the records of the Company or its transfer agent of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares, and if any Certificate or Book-Entry Share is presented to the Company
for transfer, such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be canceled against
delivery of the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share.

  

  

(v) If any Merger Consideration is to be remitted to a name other than that in
which a Certificate or Book-Entry Share is registered, no Merger Consideration
may be paid in exchange for such surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share,
unless:

  

  

(1) either (A) the Certificate so surrendered is properly endorsed, with
signature guaranteed, or otherwise in proper form for transfer or (B) the
Book-Entry Share is properly transferred; and

  

  

(2) the Person requesting such payment shall (A) pay any transfer or other
Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share or (B) establish to the
satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.

  

 

5  

  

(vi) At any time after the Effective Time until surrendered as contemplated by
this Section 2.02, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share as contemplated by Section
2.01(a)(ii). No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares.

  

  

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_.

  

  

(i) At the Effective Time, each holder of a Certificate, and each holder of
Book-Entry Shares, will cease to have any rights with respect to such shares
of Company Common Stock, except, to the extent provided by Section 2.01, for
the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares
of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares upon surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance
with Section 2.02(b) (subject to Section 2.04 in respect of Dissenting
Shares);

  

  

(ii) The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender or exchange of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with this Section 2.02 will be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares.

  

  

(d) _Termination of Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent will deliver to the
Surviving Corporation, upon the Surviving Corporation\'s demand, any portion
of the Payment Fund (including any interest and other income received by the
Paying Agent in respect of all such funds) which remains undistributed to the
former holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares upon expiration of the
period ending six (6) months after the Effective Time. Thereafter, any former
holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares prior to the Merger who has not
complied with this Section 2.02 prior to such time, may look only to the
Surviving Corporation for payment of his, her or its claim for Merger
Consideration to which such holder may be entitled.

  

  

(e) _Investment of Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash in
the Payment Fund if and as directed by Parent; _provided_ that such investment
shall be in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States of America, in
commercial paper obligations of issuers organized under the Law of a state of
the United States of America, rated A‑1 or P‑1 or better by Moody\'s Investors
Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor\'s Ratings Service, respectively, or in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers\' acceptances
of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10,000,000,000, or in mutual funds
investing in such assets. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be paid to, and be the property of, Parent. No investment
losses resulting from investment of the Payment Fund shall diminish the rights
of any of the Company\'s stockholders to receive the Merger Consideration or
any other payment as provided herein. To the extent there are losses with
respect to such investments or the Payment Fund diminishes for any other
reason below the level required to make prompt cash payment of the aggregate
funds required to be paid pursuant to the terms hereof, Parent shall
reasonably and promptly replace or restore the cash in the Payment Fund, so as
to ensure that the Payment Fund is at all times maintained at a level
sufficient to make such cash payments.

  

 

6  

  

  

(f) _No Liability_. None of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of
any portion of the Payment Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  

  

(g) _Withholding Taxes_. Each of Parent, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the amount otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts for Taxes that the Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent, as applicable is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under applicable Tax Law. Amounts so
deducted and withheld shall be timely paid over to the appropriate taxing
authority, and shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or
withholding was made. Parent, the Company the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent, as relevant, shall provide advance notice of any requirement to
withhold and deduct Taxes.

  

  

(h) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate formerly
representing shares of Company Common Stock has been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent,
the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable and customary amount
as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall deliver and pay,
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 2.03 _Equity Awards_.

  

  

(a) _Company Options_. At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or
unvested, shall be cancelled by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holder thereof, in consideration for the right to receive, as
promptly as practicable (but not later than 3 Business Days) following the
Effective Time, a cash payment (without interest and less applicable
withholding Taxes) with respect thereto equal to the product of (i) the number
of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the excess, if any, of the
Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

  

(b) _Company RSU Awards and Company Performance Share Awards_.

Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01 and Section 2.02, and the
holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to only such rights as are
granted by Section 262 of the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such

been converted into, and have become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time,
the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in accordance with
Section 2.01 and Section 2.02, without any interest thereon.

  

  

(b) The Company shall promptly notify Parent of any notices of intent,

accordance with GAAP, (ii) that receipts and expenditures of Company and its
Subsidiaries are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and the Board, and (iii) regarding prevention or timely detection

management or other employees who have a significant role in the Company\'s
internal controls over financial reporting.

and cause to be terminated all existing discussions, solicitation or
negotiations with or of any Person (except for with Parent and Parent\'s
Affiliates and their respective Representatives) conducted heretofore with
respect to any Company Takeover Proposal, or any inquiry or proposal that
would reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Takeover Proposal, request
the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously
furnished and terminate all physical and electronic data room access
previously granted to any such Person or its Representatives. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, in response to the receipt of a bona fide, unsolicited
written Company Takeover Proposal made after the date of this Agreement that
does not result from a breach of this Section 5.02(a) by the Company and that
the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisor) constitutes or could reasonably
be expected to lead to a Superior Company Proposal, the Company and its
Representatives may (1) furnish information with respect to the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries to the Person making such Company Takeover Proposal
(and its Representatives) ( _provided_ that all such information has
previously been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent prior to or
substantially concurrently with the provision of such information to such
Person) pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement that is no less
favorable in the aggregate to the Company than the Confidentiality Agreement
(a copy of which shall be promptly (in all events within twenty-four (24)
hours) provided for informational purposes only to Parent) and (2) participate
in discussions regarding the terms of such Company Takeover Proposal,
including terms of a Company Acquisition Agreement with respect thereto, and
the negotiation of such terms with the Person making such Company Takeover
Proposal (and such Person\'s Representatives), but in each case referred to in
the foregoing clauses (1) and (2), only if (A) the Company Board determines in
good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisor) that the failure to take such action could reasonably likely be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to stockholders under applicable Law
and (B) the Company shall have delivered to Parent a prior written notice
advising Parent that it intends to take such action. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein, the Company may grant a waiver, amendment or release
under any confidentiality or standstill agreement solely to the extent
necessary to allow a confidential Company Takeover Proposal to be made to the
Company or the Company Board.

manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation, (ii) adopt,
approve or recommend, or propose publicly to adopt, approve or recommend, any
Company Takeover Proposal, (iii) fail to include in the Proxy Statement the

a recommendation against such offer or a "stop, look and listen" communication
of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) or (v)
resolve or agree to take any of the foregoing actions (any action in the
foregoing clauses (i)-(v) being referred to as a " _Company Adverse
Recommendation Change_ "). Except as set forth in Section 5.02(a), Section
5.02(c), _Section 5.02(d)_ and Section 5.02(f), neither the Company Board nor
any committee thereof shall authorize, permit, approve or recommend, or
propose publicly to authorize, permit, approve or recommend, or allow the
Company or any of its Affiliates to execute or enter into, any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, agreement or
commitment constituting, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Company Takeover Proposal, or requiring the Company to abandon or terminate
this Agreement (a " _Company Acquisition Agreement_ ").

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, at any time prior to
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(c)(i) only if the Company receives a
bona fide, unsolicited written Company Takeover Proposal that does not result
from a breach of Section 5.02(a) by the Company and the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and financial advisor and after taking into account any changes to the terms
of this Agreement proposed by Parent during the three (3) Business Day period
referred to in clause (3) below) that such Company Takeover Proposal
constitutes a Superior Company Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company Board may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(c)(i),
unless (1) the Company Board has provided prior written notice to Parent (a "
_Superior Proposal Notice_ ") that it is prepared to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.01(c)(i) in response to a Superior Company Proposal,
which notice shall include the material terms and conditions of such Superior
Company Proposal, (2) if requested by Parent, during the three (3) Business
Day period after delivery of the Superior Proposal Notice, the Company and its
Representatives negotiate in good faith with Parent and its Representatives
regarding any revisions to this Agreement committed to in writing by Parent
and (3) at the end of such three (3) Business Day period and taking into
account any changes to the terms of this Agreement committed to in writing by
Parent (it being understood and agreed that if Parent has committed in writing
to any changes to the terms of this Agreement and there has been any
subsequent amendment to any material term of such Superior Company Proposal,
the Company Board shall provide a new Superior Proposal Notice and an
additional two (2) Business Day period from the date of such notice shall
apply), the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with
its outside legal counsel and financial advisor) that the failure to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(c)(i) as a result of such Superior
Company Proposal would reasonably likely be inconsistent with the Company
Board\'s fiduciary duties under applicable Law. In determining whether to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(c)(i), the Company Board
shall take into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by
Parent in response to such a Superior Proposal Notice.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, at any time prior to
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change if (i) a Company Intervening Event has
occurred or (ii) the Company has received a Superior Company Proposal that
does not result from a breach of Section 5.02(a) by the Company and, in each
case, if the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with
its outside legal counsel and financial advisor and after taking into account
any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent during the three
(3) Business Day period referred to in clause (3) below) that the failure to
effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change as a result of the occurrence
of such Company Intervening Event or in response to the receipt of such
Superior Company Proposal, as the case may be, would reasonably likely be
inconsistent with the Company Board\'s fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Board may not make such Company
Adverse Recommendation Change, unless (1) the Company Board has provided three
(3) Business Days prior written notice to Parent (a " _Recommendation Change
Notice_ ") that it is prepared to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change in response to the occurrence of a Company Intervening Event or the
receipt of a Superior Company Proposal, which notice shall, in the case of a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change as a result of an Intervening Event,
identify such event or in response to the receipt of a Superior Company
Proposal, include the material terms and conditions of such Superior Company
Proposal, (2) if requested by Parent, during the three (3) Business Day period
after delivery of the Recommendation Change Notice, the Company and its
Representatives negotiate in good faith with Parent and its Representatives
regarding any revisions to this Agreement committed to in writing by Parent
and (3) at the end of such three (3) Business Day period and taking into
account any changes to the terms of this Agreement committed to in writing by
Parent (it being understood and agreed that if Parent has committed in writing
to any changes to the terms of this Agreement and there has been any
subsequent amendment to any material term of such Superior Company Proposal,
the Company Board shall provide a new Recommendation Change Notice and an
additional two (2) Business Day period from the date of such notice shall
apply), the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with
its outside legal counsel and financial advisor) that the failure to make such
a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would reasonably likely be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to stockholders under applicable Law.

the business, properties, assets, books or records of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by any third party (other than by any Governmental Entity or in
connection with obtaining the Required Statutory Approvals), the material
terms and conditions of any such Company Takeover Proposal or request
(including any changes thereto) and the identity of the Person making any such
Company Takeover Proposal or request, and (ii) any Company Intervening Event
or any facts and circumstances that would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Company Intervening Event. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed
in all material respects on a reasonably current basis of the material terms
and status (including any change to the material terms thereof) of any Company
Takeover Proposal or request and, in the case of a Company Intervening Event,
keep Parent informed in all material respects on a current basis of the facts
and circumstances related to such Company Intervening Event.

faith judgment of the Company Board (after consultation with outside legal
counsel) failure to so disclose would reasonably likely be inconsistent with
its obligations under applicable Law.

Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation and indemnification
for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (including any
matters arising in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), now existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers
or employees, as the case may be, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(each, a " _Company Indemnified Party_ " and together, the " _Company
Indemnified Parties_ ") as provided in the Organizational Documents of the
Company and each Subsidiary of the Company shall survive the Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. For a period
of not less than six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and advance
expenses to, the Company Indemnified Parties with respect to all acts or
omissions by them in their capacities as such at any time prior to the

of the Company or the Organizational Documents for each Subsidiary of the
Company as in effect on the date of this Agreement and applicable Law.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(b)

  |  

Without limiting the provisions of Section 6.09(a), from and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, in
each case, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law: (i) indemnify,
defend and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
each Company Indemnified Party from and against any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages, penalties, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement (including, in
each case, any interest or assessments thereon) in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation arises out of or pertains to any action or
omission or alleged action or omission in such Company Indemnified Party\'s
capacity as a director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time; and (ii) pay the expenses (including
reasonable attorneys\' fees) of any Company Indemnified Party incurred in
connection with any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation upon
receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Company Indemnified Party to
repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such Company
Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified, in each case, to the
extent that such Persons are indemnified or have the right to advancement of
expenses as of the date of this Agreement by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to the Organizational Documents of the Company or the
Organizational Documents for each Subsidiary of the Company or applicable Law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company Indemnified Parties as a group may
retain only one law firm to represent them (and local counsel in each
necessary jurisdiction) with respect to each such matter unless there is,
under applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict on any
significant issue between the positions of any two or more Company Indemnified
Parties.

49  

  

    

(c)

  |  

For a period of six years after the Closing and at all times subject to
applicable Law, (i) the Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation
shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation,
indemnification of and advancement of expenses to Company Indemnified Parties
for periods at or prior to the Effective Time than are currently set forth in
the Company Articles and the Company Bylaws and (ii) Parent shall not (and
shall not cause or permit the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries
or any of Parent\'s other Subsidiaries or Affiliates to) amend or modify in
any way adverse to the Company Indemnified Parties, or to the beneficiaries
thereof, the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expense
provisions set forth in the Organizational Documents of the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries to make them less favorable to the Company
Indemnified Parties or the beneficiaries thereof than the provisions that are
currently provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries. In addition, Parent
shall provide, or cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, for a period of
not less than six years after the Effective Time, the Company Indemnified
Parties who are insured under the Company\'s directors\' and officers\'
insurance and indemnification policy with an insurance and indemnification
policy that provides coverage for events occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance_") that is no less favorable than the
existing policy of the Company; _provided_ that Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO
Insurance in excess of 250% of the annual premium paid as of the date hereof
by the Company for such insurance; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual
premiums of such insurance coverage at any time exceed such amount, Parent or
the Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy which, in its good faith
determination, provides the greatest coverage available for a cost not
exceeding such amount. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Company may and at Parent\'s request shall purchase a "tail"
directors\' and officers\' insurance and indemnification policy; _provided_
that payment for insurance coverage provided by such "tail" directors\' and
officers\' insurance policy shall not exceed 250% of the annual premium paid
as of the date hereof by the Company. Any such "tail" directors\' and
officers\' insurance policy will satisfy Parent\'s obligations under this
Section 6.09(c) to provide DandO Insurance.

The Company Indemnified Parties to whom this Section 6.09 applies shall be

binding, jointly and severally, on all successors and assigns of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, and shall be enforceable by the
Company Indemnified Parties and their successors, heirs or representatives. In
the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other Person and
shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all or a majority of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that such other Person or the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
succeed to its obligations set forth in this Section 6.09.

SECTION 6.10 _Employee Matters_.

  

  

    

(a)

  |  

During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the one year
anniversary of the Effective Time (the " _Continuation Period_ "), except as
would be inconsistent with applicable Law, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, provide each individual who is employed by the
Company or a Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time, who
remains employed thereafter by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of
their Subsidiaries (each, a " _Company Employee_ "), and who, in each case, is
not represented by a union, labor organization, or works council with respect
to such employment, with (i) a base salary or wage rate that is no less
favorable than that provided to such Company Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (ii) aggregate incentive compensation opportunities and
employee benefits that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to
those cash-based and equity-based incentive compensation opportunities and
employee benefits provided to such Company Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time (but not taking into account any Retention Program established
pursuant to Section _6.10(d)_ and recognizing that equity-based compensation
may be replaced with other forms of long-term compensation). During the one-
year period immediately following the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide each Company Employee in a
jurisdiction identified on _Section 6.10(a)(1)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule who experiences a termination of employment other than for cause with
the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their Subsidiaries with severance
benefits that are no less favorable than those set forth in the severance plan
applicable to such jurisdiction as in effect on the date hereof, as identified
on _Section 6.10(a)(1)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

    

(b)

  |  

With respect to all employee benefit plans of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries, including any "employee benefit
plan" (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) (including any vacation, paid
time-off and severance plans), each Company Employee\'s service with the
Company or any Company Subsidiary (as well as service with any predecessor
employer of the Company or any such Company Subsidiary) shall be treated as
service with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries as
applicable, for all purposes, including determining eligibility to
participate, level of benefits, vesting and benefit accruals, except (i) for
purposes of any defined benefit retirement plan, any retiree welfare benefit
plan, any grandfathered or frozen plan or any plan under which similarly
situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries do not receive credit for
prior service or (ii) to the extent that such recognition would result in any
duplication of benefits for the same period of service.

   
---|--- 
  

  

 

51  

  

  

    

(c)

  |  

With respect to any employee benefit plan maintained by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries in which Company Employees are
eligible to participate following the Effective Time and that provides
medical, dental or vision insurance benefits, for the plan year in which such
Company Employee is first eligible to participate, Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause any preexisting condition
limitations or eligibility waiting periods under such plan to be waived with
respect to such Company Employee to the extent such limitation would have been
waived or satisfied under the Company Benefit Plan in which such Company
Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) credit
each Company Employee for any co-payments or deductibles incurred by such
Company Employee in such plan year for purposes of any applicable deductible
and annual out-of-pocket expense requirements under any such Post-Closing Plan
and (iii) cause such credited expenses to count toward any annual or lifetime
limits, treatment or visit limits or similar limitations that apply under the
terms of the applicable plan.

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

    

(d)

  |  

The Company may establish a cash-based retention program in the aggregate
amount of $5 million to promote retention, to incentivize efforts to
consummate the Closing and to provide for a transition for a reasonable period
of time following the Closing (the " _Retention Program_ "). Awards under the
Retention Program may be allocated by the Chief Executive Officer of the
Company (or his designee(s)) among employees of the Company; _provided_ that
no awards may be granted to an individual who is covered by a change in
control agreement and any award in excess of $100,000 shall be subject to the
prior approval by Parent, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. Each retention award under the Retention Program will vest and be
paid fifty percent (50%) immediately prior to the Effective Time, twenty-five
percent (25%) on the date that is ninety (90) days after the Effective Time
and twenty-five percent (25%) on the date that is one hundred eighty (180)
days after the Effective Time subject to continued employment through the
applicable payment date; _provided_ , _however_ , that any unpaid portion of
an award will vest in full and be paid upon an earlier Qualifying Termination
subject, in the event of a Qualifying Termination, to the employee providing a
general release of claims against the Company and its affiliates (including
Company Personnel) in the form used by the Company in the ordinary course. If
a retention award under the Retention Program is forfeited by a participant
prior to the Effective Time, the Chief Executive Officer of the Company (or
his designee(s)) may reallocate (subject to the parameters set forth in this
_Section 6.10(d)_ ) the retention award to existing employees or new hires of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries. The Company may enter into a
retention letter agreement with each recipient of a retention award under the
Retention Program setting forth the amount and terms of such award. The
Company has provided to Parent a schedule reflecting its good faith
expectations regarding grants under the Retention Program, it being understood
that, subject to the parameters set forth in this _Section 6.10(d)_ , there
may be additional award recipients under the Retention Program and award
amounts under the Retention Program may be higher or lower than those set
forth in the schedule.

52  

  

  

    

(e)

  |  

The Company may pay to each employee of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries actively employed on the last day of the Company\'s 2016 fiscal
year (ending October 28, 2016), a full bonus under the applicable Company
Benefit Plan that is an annual bonus plan (an " _Annual Bonus Plan_ ") in
respect of the Company\'s 2016 fiscal year based on actual performance during
such fiscal year, such payment to be made at the earlier of (x) immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and (y) in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice. The Company may establish awards for employees
of the Company under an Annual Bonus Plan in respect of the Company\'s 2017
fiscal year (ending October 27, 2017) and the related performance goals, in
each case, in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past
practice. If the Effective Time occurs during the Company\'s 2017 fiscal year,
Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, to each Company Employee who
participated in an Annual Bonus Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time
and who experiences a Qualifying Termination at or following the Effective
Time and prior to payment of such bonus (subject to the employee providing a
general release of Claims against the Company and its Affiliates, including
Company Personnel, in the form used by the Company in the ordinary course) a
bonus equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the Company Employee\'s
full year bonus entitlement under all such Annual Bonus Plans for the
Company\'s 2017 fiscal year based on actual performance, and (ii) a fraction
(not to exceed 1), the numerator of which equals the number of days that have
elapsed during such fiscal year through the date of the Qualifying Termination
and the denominator of which equals 365, with such bonus being paid at the
same time as bonuses to Company Employees who remain in the employ of the
Company, but in any event not later than the 15th day of the third month
following the later of (A) the end of calendar year of the Qualifying
Termination and (B) the end of the Company\'s fiscal year in which the
Qualifying Termination occurs.

(f)

  |  

Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change of control" (or similar phrase)
within the meaning of the Company Benefit Plans will occur at or prior to the
Effective Time, as applicable.

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

    

(g)

  |  

Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Company Employee or other
service provider any right to continue in the employ or service of Parent, the
Surviving Company or any of their Affiliates, or shall interfere with or
restrict in any way the rights of Parent, the Surviving Company or any of
their Affiliates, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or
terminate the services of any Company Employee or other service provider at
any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause. In no event shall
the terms of this Agreement be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any
Company Benefit Plan or any "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3)
of ERISA, or any other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement
maintained or sponsored by Parent, Surviving Company, of any of their
Affiliates or (ii) alter or limit the ability of Parent, the Surviving Company
or any of their Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any Company Benefit
Plan or any other compensation or benefit or employment plan, program,
agreement or arrangement after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding any provision
in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this _Section 6.10_ shall create
any third-party beneficiary rights in any Company Employee or current or
former service provider of the Company or its Affiliates (or any beneficiaries
or dependents thereof).

promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement.

parties to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each Party and

in Section 7.01, Section 7.02(a) or Section 7.02(b), as applicable, and (2) is
not reasonably capable of being cured by Parent or Merger Sub by the End Date
(as it may be extended pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(i)) or is not cured by

tender or exchange offer (provided that the issuance by the Company of any

(c)

  |  

The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in _Section 8.02(b)_ are

without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement.
Without limiting any rights of either Party under _Section 9.10_ prior to the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01_ , if this Agreement
is validly terminated under circumstances in which the Company is obligated to
pay the Company Termination Fee or Parent is obligated to pay the Parent
Termination Fee, upon payment of the Company Termination Fee or the Parent
Termination Fee, as applicable, the Company or Parent and Merger Sub (as
applicable) shall have no further liability with respect to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby to the other Parties or any of their
respective Affiliates or Representatives, and payment of the Company
Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee (as applicable) shall be deemed to
be liquidated damages and shall be Parent\'s or the Company\'s (as applicable)
sole and exclusive remedy for any Claims, losses, liabilities, damages,
judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including
attorneys\' fees and disbursements, suffered or incurred by Parent or the
Company (as applicable), each Party\'s Subsidiaries and any other Person in
connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby (and the
termination thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and
Parent and Merger Sub or the Company (as applicable) shall not have, and each
expressly waives and relinquishes, any other right, remedy or recourse
(whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, or whether at law (including at
common law or by statute) or in equity); _provided_ that, regardless of
whether Parent or the Company pays or is obligated to pay the Parent
Termination Fee or Termination Fee (as applicable), nothing in this _Section
8.02(c)_ will release any Party from liability for a willful breach of this
Agreement. While a Party may pursue both a grant of specific performance in
accordance with _Section 9.10_ and the payment of the Parent Termination Fee
or Company Termination Fee (as applicable), under no circumstances shall a
Party be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance
that results in the Closing and payment of any portion of the Parent
Termination Fee or Company Termination Fee (as applicable). The Parties
acknowledge and agree that in no event shall the Company be required to pay
the Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion, and in no event shall
Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than one
occasion.

SECTION 8.03 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the Parties at any
time before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (a) after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, there
shall be made no amendment that by Law requires further approval by the
stockholders of the Company, without the further approval of such
stockholders, (b) no amendment shall be made to this Agreement after the
Effective Time and (c) except as provided above, no amendment of this
Agreement shall require the approval of the stockholders of Parent or the
stockholders of the Company. This Agreement may not be amended, except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the Parties.

  

  

SECTION 8.04 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
Parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations
or other acts of the other Parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant to this Agreement, (c) subject to Section 8.03 _(a)_ , waive
compliance with any covenants and agreements contained herein or (d) waive the
satisfaction of any of the conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the
part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party. The failure
of any Party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

  

  

SECTION 8.05 _Procedure for Termination, Amendment, Extension or Waiver_. A
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01, an amendment of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.03 or an extension or waiver pursuant to
Section 8.04 shall, in order to be effective, require, in the case of the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub, action by its respective board of directors or
the duly authorized designee of its board of directors. Termination of this
Agreement prior to the Effective Time shall not require the approval of the
stockholders of the Company. The Party desiring to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.01 shall give written notice of such termination to the
other Parties in accordance with Section 9.02, specifying the provision of
this Agreement pursuant to which such termination is effected.

SECTION 9.10 _Specific Enforcement_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this

injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce

being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity. The Parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific
enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any
reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an
adequate remedy for any such breach. If any Party brings any Claim to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement
when expressly available to such Party pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the End Date
shall automatically be extended by the period of time between the commencement

to the laying of venue of Claim arising out of this Agreement in such court

the respective addresses set forth in Section 9.02 hereof shall be effective

other request for leave from any such court, and agrees not to plead or claim
any objection to the laying of venue in any such court or that any judicial
proceeding in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum, (iii)

GUARANTY

  

  

To induce the Company to enter into this Agreement, Komatsu Ltd. (the "
_Guarantor_ "), as primary obligor and not merely as a surety, hereby
absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees full and timely payment
and performance of the duties, obligations and responsibilities of Parent and
Merger Sub specified in this Agreement or arising out of or relating to this
Agreement as and when required to be performed hereunder, including the
obligation of Parent, subject to the terms and satisfaction of the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, to, at or prior to the Effective Time, make
available or cause to be made available to the Paying Agent cash in an amount
equal to the Payment Fund and to pay any fees and expenses of Parent or Merger
Sub, any damages arising from the breach by Parent or Merger Sub of their
obligations under this Agreement and any other obligations of Parent or Merger
Sub (collectively, the " _Guaranteed Obligations_ "), and shall be deemed to
have made, and shall be liable for, all of the representations and warranties,
covenants and other agreements of Parent contained herein.

  

  

The Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that this guaranty is a primary
obligation of the Guarantor, and that the Company shall be entitled to make
any demand hereunder, and pursue all of its rights and remedies, against all
or any of the Guarantor, Parent and Merger Sub, whether or not the Company has
made any demand or pursued any remedies against Parent or Merger Sub. This is
a guarantee of payment and performance, and not merely of collectability. The
obligations of the Guarantor under this guaranty shall be enforceable against
the Guarantor to the same extent as if the Guarantor were the primary obligor
(and not merely a surety) under this Agreement.

  

  

The Guarantor hereby waives as to itself promptness, diligence, notice of the
acceptance of this guarantee and of the Guaranteed Obligations, presentment,
demand for payment, notice of non-performance, default, dishonor and protest,
notice of any Guaranteed Obligations incurred, all defenses which may be
available by virtue of any valuation, stay, moratorium law or other similar
law now or hereafter in effect, and all suretyship defenses.

  

  

The Guarantor agrees that the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder shall not
be released or discharged, in whole or in part, or otherwise affected by (i)
the failure or delay on the part of the Company to assert any claim or demand
or to enforce any right or remedy against Parent or Merger Sub; (ii) any
change in the time, place or manner of payment of any of the Guaranteed
Obligations or any waiver, compromise, consolidation or other amendment or
modification of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement made in
accordance with the terms thereof or any agreement evidencing, securing or
otherwise executed in connection with any of the Guaranteed Obligations; (iii)
any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of the
Guarantor, Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person interested in the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iv) the adequacy of any other
means the Company may have of obtaining payment related to any of the
Guaranteed Obligations, (v) any voluntary or involuntary liquidation,
dissolution, sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the
assets, marshalling of assets and liabilities, receivership, insolvency,
bankruptcy, assignment for the benefit of creditors, reorganization,
arrangement, composition with creditors or readjustment, or other similar
proceeding or any other inability to pay or perform affecting the Guarantor,
Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person interested in the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; (vi) the existence of any claim, set-off or
other right which Guarantor may have at any time against the Company, Parent,
Merger Sub or any other Person interested in the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, whether in connection with such transactions or otherwise;
(vii) the adequacy of any other means the Company may have of obtaining
payment of the Guaranteed Obligations or (viii) the value, genuineness,
validity, regularity, illegality or enforceability of this Agreement or any
agreement or instrument related to this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Guarantor shall be entitled to all rights, defenses and counterclaims
of Parent and/or Merger Sub with respect to any Claim for enforcement of this
Guaranty.

  

   

  

  

This Guaranty may not be revoked or terminated and shall remain in full force
and effect and shall be binding on Guarantor, its successors and assigns until
all amounts payable by Guarantor under this Guaranty with respect to the
Guaranteed Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full.

  

  

The Guarantor acknowledges that it will receive substantial direct and
indirect benefits from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
that the waivers by the Guarantor set forth in this Guarantee are knowingly
made in contemplation of such benefits. For the avoidance of doubt, if Parent
or Merger Sub is obligated to consummate the Merger pursuant to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, no further act or thing need occur to establish
the Guarantor\'s liability hereunder, and no act or thing, except full
performance of the Guaranteed Obligations, shall in any way exonerate or
discharge the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder or modify, limit or
release the Guarantor\'s liability hereunder. The Company may, at any time,
take any and all actions available hereunder or under applicable law to
enforce Guarantor\'s obligations hereunder, regardless of whether action is
brought against Parent or Merger Sub or whether Parent or Merger Sub is joined
in any such action or actions.

  

  

All payments by the Guarantor pursuant to this Guaranty shall be made in
lawful money of the United States in immediately available funds. Guarantor
promises and undertakes to make all payments hereunder free and clear of any
deduction, offset, defense, claim or counterclaim of any kind. In the event
that any payment hereunder is rescinded or must otherwise be returned for any
reason whatsoever, Guarantor shall remain liable hereunder as if such payment
had not been made.

  

  

The Guarantor may not assign or delegate its rights, interests or obligations
hereunder to any other person (by operation of law or otherwise) without the
prior written consent of the Company.

  

The terms of _Sections 9.02_ , _9.07_ and _9.11_ of this Agreement shall apply
to this Guaranty mutatis mutandis.
