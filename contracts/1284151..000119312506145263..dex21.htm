parties or pursuant to investment management activities in the ordinary
course of business), shall be converted into and become one share of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation.

3.02 _Exchange Procedures_.

(a) Acquiror shall designate an exchange agent to act as agent (the "Exchange
Agent") for purposes of conducting the exchange procedure described in this
Section 3.02. At the Effective Time, for the benefit of the holders of
Certificates, Acquiror shall deliver to the Exchange Agent the aggregate
Merger Consideration payable pursuant to this Article III in exchange for
Certificates.

(b) Promptly following the Effective Time, but in no event more than three
Business Days thereafter, Acquiror shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to
each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates the following: (i) a
letter of transmittal specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent, which shall be in a form and contain any
other provisions as Acquiror and MortgageIT may determine; and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates in exchange
for the aggregate Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 3.01 hereof. Upon the proper surrender of a Certificate to
the Exchange Agent, together with a properly completed and duly executed
letter of transmittal, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor a check representing the aggregate Merger
Consideration which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the
Certificate surrendered pursuant to Section 3.01 hereof, and the Certificate
so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or
accrued on the Merger Consideration. In the event of a transfer of ownership
of any shares of MortgageIT Common Stock not registered in the transfer
records of MortgageIT, a check for the aggregate Merger Consideration to which
the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to Section 3.01 hereof may be issued
to the holder if the Certificate representing such MortgageIT Common Stock is
presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by documents sufficient, in the
reasonable discretion of Acquiror and the Exchange Agent, (i) to evidence
and effect such transfer and (ii) to evidence that all applicable stock
transfer taxes have been paid.

(c) The Exchange Agent and Acquiror, as the case may be, shall not be
obligated to deliver the aggregate Merger Consideration to which a holder of
MortgageIT Common Stock would otherwise be entitled as a result of the Merger
until such holder surrenders the Certificate or Certificates representing the
shares of MortgageIT Common Stock for exchange as provided in this Section
3.02, or, in default thereof, an appropriate affidavit of loss and indemnity
agreement and/or a bond in an amount as may be reasonably required in each
case by Acquiror.

(d) Any portion of the cash delivered to the Exchange Agent by
Acquiror pursuant to Section 3.02(a) that remains unclaimed by the
stockholders of MortgageIT for six months after the Effective Time (as well as
any proceeds from any investment thereof) shall be  



 

11  delivered by the Exchange Agent to Acquiror. Any stockholders of MortgageIT
who have not theretofore complied with Section 3.02(b) shall thereafter
look only to Acquiror for the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect of
each share of MortgageIT Common Stock such shareholder holds as determined
pursuant to this Agreement without any interest thereon. If outstanding
Certificates for shares of MortgageIT Common Stock are not surrendered or the
payment for them is not claimed prior to the date on which such payment would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any governmental unit or
agency, the unclaimed items shall, to the extent permitted by abandoned
property and any other applicable law, become the property of Acquiror (and to
the extent not in its possession shall be delivered to it), free and clear of
all claims or interest of any person previously entitled to such property.
Neither the Exchange Agent nor any party to this Agreement shall be liable to
any holder of stock represented by any Certificate for any consideration paid
to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar laws. Acquiror and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon
the stock transfer books of MortgageIT to establish the identity of those
persons entitled to receive the Merger Consideration, which books shall be
conclusive with respect thereto. In the event of a dispute with respect to
ownership of stock represented by any Certificate, Acquiror and the Exchange
Agent shall be entitled to deposit any Merger Consideration represented
thereby in escrow with an independent third party and thereafter be relieved
with respect to any claims thereto.

3.03 _Rights as Shareholders; Stock Transfers_. At the Effective
Time, holders of MortgageIT Common Stock shall cease to be, and shall have no
rights as, stockholders of MortgageIT other than to receive the consideration
provided under this Article III. After the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of MortgageIT or the Surviving
Corporation of shares of MortgageIT Common Stock which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

3.04 _Withholding Rights_. Acquiror (through the Exchange Agent, if
applicable) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares
of MortgageIT Common Stock such amounts (including Taxes) as Acquiror is
required under the Code or any state, local or foreign tax law or regulation
thereunder to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment.
Any amounts so withheld shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement
as having been paid to the holder of MortgageIT Common Stock in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by Acquiror.

3.05 _MortgageIT Options and Restricted Stock_.

(a) Prior to and effective as of the Effective Time, MortgageIT shall have
taken all such action as is necessary to terminate, subject to compliance with
this Section 3.05(a), the MortgageIT Stock Option Plans and shall have
provided written notice to each holder of a then-outstanding MortgageIT Option
(whether or not such MortgageIT Option is then vested or exercisable), that
such MortgageIT Option shall be, as of the date of such notice, exercisable
in full, that such MortgageIT Option shall terminate at the Effective Time
and that, if such MortgageIT Option is not exercised or otherwise terminated
on or before the Effective Time, such holder shall be entitled to receive in
cancellation of such MortgageIT  



 

12  Option a cash payment from MortgageIT at the Closing in an amount equal to
the excess of the Merger Consideration over the per share exercise price of
such MortgageIT Option, multiplied by the number of shares of MortgageIT
Common Stock covered by such MortgageIT Option, subject to any required
withholding of Taxes. MortgageIT shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain the written acknowledgement of each holder of a then-outstanding
MortgageIT Option with regard to the cancellation of such MortgageIT Option
and the payment therefor in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
Subject to the foregoing, the MortgageIT Stock Option Plans and all
MortgageIT Options issued thereunder shall terminate at the Effective Time.

(b) As of the Effective Time, each share of restricted MortgageIT Common
Stock which was issued pursuant to the MortgageIT Stock Option Plans or
otherwise and which has been Previously Disclosed, whether in book-entry or
certificated form, shall become fully vested and shall be converted into, and
shall be canceled in exchange for, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration.

in a provision hereof or as an exception to one or more representations or
warranties contained in Section 5.03, 5.04 or 5.05 or to one or more of its
covenants contained in Article IV; provided, however, that the mere inclusion
of an item in a Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or
warranty shall not be deemed an admission by a party that such item represents
a material exception or fact, event or circumstance or that, absent such
inclusion in the Disclosure Schedule, such item is or would be reasonably
likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

5.02 [Intentionally Omitted].

validly existing in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization and is duly qualified to do business and in good standing in the
jurisdictions where its ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of

judgment, decree, order, memorandum of understanding, commitment letter,

Authority. Except as Previously Disclosed, neither MortgageIT nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to any order, judgment or decree, nor has any order,
judgment or decree been outstanding against MortgageIT or any of its

reports required to be filed by any law, regulation or order of any federal
or state governmental agency charged with the supervision or regulation of
mortgage companies generally or MortgageIT and/or its Subsidiaries in
particular (collectively, the "MortgageIT Regulatory Authorities"). Neither
MortgageIT nor its Subsidiaries have done or caused to be done, or have

not complied with the



 

21 applicable underwriting standards with respect to the Loans sold by MortgageIT
or any Subsidiary to an Investor or Agency, or (B) imposed restrictions on
the activities (including commitment authority) of MortgageIT or any
Subsidiary.

(ii) Except as Previously Disclosed, neither MortgageIT nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor any of their respective properties is a party to or is
subject to any order, decree, agreement, memorandum of
understanding, supervisory agreement, cease and desist order or similar
arrangement with, or a commitment letter or similar submission to, or
supervisory letter from, any MortgageIT Regulatory Authorities.

(iii) Except as Previously Disclosed, neither MortgageIT nor any of its
Subsidiaries has been advised by, nor does it have any knowledge of facts
which could give rise to an advisory notice by, any MortgageIT Regulatory
Authority that such MortgageIT Regulatory Authority is contemplating issuing
or requesting (or is considering the appropriateness of issuing or requesting)
any such order, decree, agreement, memorandum of understanding, supervisory
agreement, cease and desist order, commitment letter, supervisory letter or
similar submission.

(j) _Compliance With Laws_. Except as Previously Disclosed, each of MortgageIT
and its Subsidiaries:

(i) is, and at all times since the later of December 31, 2003 or the date such
entity was formed has been, in material compliance with all applicable
federal, state, local and foreign statutes, laws, regulations, ordinances,
rules, judgments, orders, decrees or Applicable Permits (as defined below)
applicable thereto or to the employees conducting such businesses;

 

(ii) has, and at all times since the later of December 31, 2003 or the date
such entity was formed has had, all material permits, licenses,
authorizations, orders and approvals of, and has made all material filings,
applications and registrations with, all Governmental Authorities that are
required in order to permit it to own or lease its properties and to conduct
its business as presently conducted ("Applicable Permits"); all such material
permits, licenses, certificates of authority, orders and approvals are in full
force and effect and, to MortgageITs knowledge, no suspension or cancellation
of any of them is threatened; and

(iii) has received since December 31, 2003, no notification or communication
from any Governmental Authority (A) asserting that MortgageIT or any of its
Subsidiaries is not in compliance with any of the statutes, regulations or
ordinances, including licensing requirements, which such Governmental
Authority enforces or (B) threatening to revoke any license, franchise,
permit or governmental authorization (nor, to MortgageITs knowledge, do any
grounds for any of the foregoing exist).

(k) _Material Contracts; Defaults_.

(i) Except for documents listed as exhibits to MortgageITs Securities
Documents or as Previously Disclosed, neither MortgageIT nor any of its



 

22 Subsidiaries is a party to, bound by or subject to any agreement, contract,
arrangement, commitment or understanding (whether written or oral) (A) with
respect to the employment of any of its directors, officers, employees or
consultants, (B) which would entitle any present or former director, officer,
employee or agent of MortgageIT or any of its Subsidiaries to indemnification
from MortgageIT or any of its Subsidiaries, (C) which is a material contract
(as defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC) to be performed
after the date of this Agreement, (D) relating to the indebtedness by
MortgageIT or its Subsidiaries for borrowed money or any guaranty of
indebtedness for borrowed money in excess of $10 million, (E) that by its
terms limits the payment of dividends or other distributions by MortgageIT,
(F) relating to the acquisition or disposition of any business (whether by
merger, sale of stock, sale of assets or otherwise) or material assets, (G)

respect to any material agreement relating to any Intellectual Property, (I)
with respect to material leasehold interests in real property, (J) which
materially restricts the conduct of any business by MortgageIT or by any of
its Subsidiaries or (K) with respect to any material joint venture,
partnership agreement or similar agreement (collectively, "Material
Contracts"). MortgageIT has Previously Disclosed and made available to
Acquiror true and correct copies of each such Material Contract.
Each Material Contract is a valid and binding obligation of MortgageIT or one
its Subsidiaries, as applicable, and, to MortgageITs knowledge, of each other
party thereto, and is enforceable against MortgageIT or one of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, in accordance with its terms.

(ii) Except as Previously Disclosed, neither MortgageIT nor any of
its Subsidiaries, and to MortgageITs knowledge, no counterparty thereto, is
in material default under any contract, agreement, license, commitment,
arrangement, lease, insurance policy or other instrument to which it is a
party, by which its respective assets, business, or operations may be bound
or affected, or under which it or its respective assets, business, or
operations receives benefits, and there has not occurred any event that, with
the lapse of time or the giving of notice or both, would constitute such a
default.

(l) _No Brokers_. No action has been taken by MortgageIT or any of
its Subsidiaries that would give rise to any valid claim against any party
hereto for a brokerage commission, finders fee or other like payment with
respect to the Transaction other than the Previously Disclosed fees to be paid
to Lehman Brothers Inc.

(m) _Employee Benefit Plans_.

(i) All benefit and compensation plans, contracts, policies or arrangements
covering current or former employees of MortgageIT and its Subsidiaries (the
"Employees") and current or former directors of MortgageIT and its
Subsidiaries including, but not limited to, "employee benefit plans" within
the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA, and deferred compensation, stock
option, stock purchase, stock



 

23 appreciation rights, stock based incentive and bonus plans (the "Benefit
Plans"), have been Previously Disclosed. True and complete copies of (A) all
Benefit Plans including, but not limited to, any trust instruments and
insurance contracts forming a part of any Benefit Plans and all amendments
thereto; (B) the most recent annual report (Form 5500), together with all
schedules, as required, filed with the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") or
Department of Labor (the "DOL"), as applicable, and any financial statements
and opinions required by Section 103(e)(3) of ERISA with respect to each
Benefit Plan; (C) for each Benefit Plan which is a "top-hat" plan, a copy of
filings with the DOL; (D) the most recent determination letter or opinion
letter issued by the IRS for each Benefit Plan that is intended to be
"qualified" under Section 401(a) of the Code; (E) the most recent summary plan
description and any modifications for each Benefit Plan; (F) the most recent
actuarial report, if any relating to each Benefit Plan; (G) the most recent
actuarial valuation, study or estimate of any retiree medical and life
insurance benefits plan or supplemental retirement benefits plan; and (H) the
most recent summary annual report for each Benefit Plan required to provide
summary annual reports by Section 104 of ERISA, have been provided or made
available to Acquiror.

(ii) Except as Previously Disclosed, each Benefit Plan has been administered
to date in all material respects in accordance with the applicable provisions
of ERISA, the Code and applicable law and with the terms and provisions of
all documents, contracts or agreements pursuant to which such Benefit Plan is
maintained. Each Benefit Plan which is an "employee pension benefit plan"
within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a "Pension Plan") and which is
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, has received a
favorable determination letter or opinion letter from the IRS. There is no
material pending or, to MortgageITs knowledge, threatened litigation
relating to the Benefit Plans. To MortgageITs knowledge, neither MortgageIT
nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction with respect to any
Benefit Plan or Pension Plan that, assuming the taxable period of
such transaction expired as of the date hereof, could subject MortgageIT or
any of its Subsidiaries to a tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of
the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA in an amount which would be material.
To MortgageITs knowledge, there are no matters pending before the IRS, DOL
or other governmental agency with respect to any Benefit Plan.

(iii) No liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of ERISA has been or is
expected to be incurred by MortgageIT or any of its Subsidiaries with respect
to any ongoing, frozen or terminated "single-employer plan," within the
meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or formerly maintained by
any of them or the single-employer plan of any entity which is considered one
employer with MortgageIT under Section 4001 of ERISA or Section 414 of the
Code (an "ERISA Affiliate"). Neither MortgageIT nor any of its Subsidiaries
has incurred, and neither MortgageIT nor any of its Subsidiaries expects to
incur, any withdrawal liability with respect to a multiemployer plan under
Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA (regardless of whether based on contributions
of an ERISA Affiliate). No notice of a "reportable event," within the meaning
of Section 4043 of ERISA for which the 30-day reporting requirement has not
been waived, has been required to be filed for any Pension Plan or by any
ERISA Affiliate within the l2-month period ending on the date hereof or will
be required to be filed in connection with the Transaction.



 

24 (iv) All contributions required to be made under the terms of any Benefit Plan
have been timely made or have been reflected in the consolidated financial
statements of MortgageIT included in MortgageITs Securities Documents.
Neither any Pension Plan nor any single-employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate
has an "accumulated funding deficiency" (whether or not waived) within the
meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA and no ERISA
Affiliate has received or is subject to an outstanding funding waiver. Neither
MortgageIT nor any of its Subsidiaries has provided, and is required to
provide, security to any Pension Plan or to any single-employer plan of an
ERISA Affiliate pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code.

(v) Neither MortgageIT nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligations for
retiree health and life benefits under any Benefit Plan, other than coverage
as may be required under Section 4980B of the Code or Part 6 of Title I of
ERISA, or under the continuation of coverage provisions of the laws of any
state or locality. To MortgageITs knowledge, no event or condition
exists with respect to a Benefit Plan that could subject MortgageIT to a
material tax under Section 4980B of the Code.

(vi) None of the execution of this Agreement, shareholder approval of this
Agreement or consummation of the Transaction will, except as Previously
Disclosed, (A) entitle any employees of MortgageIT or any of its Subsidiaries
to severance pay or any increase in severance pay upon any termination of
employment after the date hereof, (B) accelerate the time of payment or
vesting or trigger any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or
otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, increase the amount payable or
trigger any other material obligation pursuant to, any of the Benefit Plans,
(C) result in any breach or violation of, or a default under, any of the
Benefit Plans or (D) result in any payment that would be a "parachute
payment" to a "disqualified individual" as those terms are defined in Section
280G of the Code, without regard to whether such payment is reasonable
compensation for personal services performed or to be performed in the
future.

(vii) MortgageIT has Previously Disclosed as of the latest practicable date
prior to the date of this Agreement an accurate list of the names, titles,
base salaries and the amount of the prior years bonus of each person who is
an employee of MortgageIT or any of its Subsidiaries as of such date.

(n) _Labor Matters_. Neither MortgageIT nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party
to or is bound by any collective bargaining agreement, contract or other
agreement or understanding with a labor union or labor organization, nor is
MortgageIT or any of its Subsidiaries the subject of a proceeding asserting
that it has committed an unfair labor practice (within the meaning of the
National Labor Relations Act) or seeking to compel MortgageIT or any of its
Subsidiaries to bargain with any labor organization as to wages or conditions
of employment, nor is there any strike or other labor dispute involving it or
any of its Subsidiaries pending or, to MortgageITs knowledge, threatened,
nor is MortgageIT or any of its Subsidiaries aware of any activity involving
its employees seeking to certify a collective



 

25 bargaining unit or engaging in other organizational activity. With respect to
this Transaction, any notice required under any law or collective bargaining
agreement has been given, and all bargaining obligations with any employee
representative have been, or prior to the Closing Date will be, satisfied.
Except as Previously Disclosed, within the past three years, MortgageIT has
not implemented any plant closing or layoff of employees that could implicate
the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988, as amended, or
any similar foreign, state, or local law, regulation, or ordinance, and no
such action will be implemented without advance notification to Acquiror.

(o) _Environmental Matters_.

(i) MortgageIT and its Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material respects
with applicable Environmental Laws; (ii) to MortgageITs knowledge, no real
property (including buildings or other structures) currently or formerly owned
or operated by MortgageIT or any of its Subsidiaries, or any property in which
MortgageIT or any of its Subsidiaries has held a security interest, Lien or a
fiduciary or management role ("MortgageIT Loan Property"), has been
contaminated with, or has had any release of, any Hazardous Substance that has
resulted, or would reasonably be expected to result, in a Material Adverse
Effect with respect to MortgageIT; (iii) neither MortgageIT nor any of its
Subsidiaries could be deemed the owner or operator of, nor has it participated
in the management regarding Hazardous Substances of, any MortgageIT Loan
Property which has been contaminated with, or has had any release of, any
Hazardous Substance that has resulted, or would reasonably be expected to
result, in a Material Adverse Effect with respect to MortgageIT; (iv) neither
MortgageIT nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability for any Hazardous
Substance disposal or contamination on any third party property; (v) neither
MortgageIT nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to MortgageITs knowledge, any
Person whose liability MortgageIT or any of its Subsidiaries has assumed
whether contractually or by operation of law, has received any notice, demand
letter, claim or request for information alleging any material violation of,
or material liability under, any Environmental Law; (vi) neither MortgageIT
nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any order, decree, injunction or
other agreement with any Governmental Authority or any third party relating to
any Environmental Law; (vii) to MortgageITs knowledge, there are no
circumstances or conditions (including the presence of asbestos, underground
storage tanks, lead products, polychlorinated biphenyls, prior manufacturing
operations, dry-cleaning, or automotive services) involving MortgageIT or any
of its Subsidiaries, any currently or formerly owned or operated property, any
MortgageIT Loan Property, or, to MortgageITs knowledge, any Person whose
liability MortgageIT or any of its Subsidiaries has assumed whether
contractually or by operation of law, that could reasonably be expected to
result in any material claims, liability or investigations against MortgageIT
or any of its Subsidiaries, result in any material restrictions on the
ownership, use, or transfer of any property pursuant to any Environmental Law,
or adversely affect the value of any MortgageIT Loan Property; and (viii)
MortgageIT has Previously Disclosed and made available to Acquiror copies of
all environmental reports or studies, sampling data, correspondence and
filings in its possession or reasonably available to it relating to
MortgageIT, its Subsidiaries and any currently or formerly owned or operated
property.

withholding of Taxes and (I) except as Previously Disclosed, none of
MortgageIT or any its Subsidiaries has waived any statutes of limitation

no power of attorney granted by either MortgageIT or any of its Subsidiaries
with respect to any Taxes is currently in force. 

(ii) MortgageIT has made available to Acquiror true, correct and complete
copies of the United States federal and state income Tax Returns filed by
MortgageIT and any of its Subsidiaries for each of the three most recent
taxable years for which such returns have been filed.



 

27 (iii) Neither MortgageIT nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability with
respect to any Taxes that accrued on or before the end of the most recent

MortgageIT nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written notice of any
claim made by a Tax or other Governmental Authority in a jurisdiction where
MortgageIT or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, does not file a Tax
Return, that MortgageIT or such Subsidiary is or may be subject to taxation by
that jurisdiction. No officer or employee of MortgageIT or any of its
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, responsible for Tax matters of MortgageIT or
such Subsidiary, reasonably expects any Tax Authority to assess any additional
Taxes with respect to MortgageIT or any of its Subsidiaries.

857(b), 860(c) or 4981 of the Code, IRS Notice 88-19, Treasury Regulation
Section 1.337(d)-5, or Treasury Regulation Section 1.337-6 (or any provision
of similar effect) including any Tax arising from a prohibited transaction
described in Section 857(b)(6) of the Code. No event has occurred, and no
condition or circumstance exists (including the current holding by MortgageIT
or any MortgageIT Subsidiary of any asset the disposition of which would be
subject to provisions of this Section 5.03(p)(x)) which presents a risk that
any Tax described in the preceding sentence will be imposed on MortgageIT or
any MortgageIT Subsidiary.

(xi) MortgageIT (i) has operated since August 4, 2004 to the date hereof, and
will continue to operate in such a manner as to permit it to qualify as a REIT
within the meaning of Section 856 of the Code through the Effective Time,
and (ii) has not taken (or failed to take) any action that could reasonably
be expected to result in a challenge to its qualification as a REIT and no
challenge to MortgageITs qualification as a REIT is pending or to
MortgageITs knowledge, is or has been threatened. Each direct or indirect
MortgageIT Subsidiary which is a partnership, joint venture or limited
liability company has since its acquisition by MortgageIT (A) been classified
and treated for federal income tax purposes as a partnership or disregarded
entity and not as a corporation or a "publicly traded partnership" within the
meaning of Section 7704(b) of the Code that is treated as a corporation under
Section 7704(a) of the Code, and (B) not owned any assets (including
securities) that would cause MortgageIT to violate Section 856(c)(4) of the
Code. Each MortgageIT Subsidiary which is a corporation, and each other issuer
of securities in which MortgageIT holds securities (within the meaning of
Section 856(c) of the Code but excluding securities of issuers described in
Section 856(m) of the Code) having a value of more than 10 percent of the
total value of the outstanding securities of such issuer has since its
acquisition by MortgageIT been a REIT, a qualified REIT subsidiary of
MortgageIT under Section 856(i) of the Code, or a taxable REIT subsidiary of
MortgageIT under Section 856(l) of the Code. Section 5.03 of MortgageITs
Disclosure Schedule lists all the MortgageIT Subsidiaries which are (i)
"taxable REIT subsidiaries" within the meaning of Section 856(l) of the Code
or (ii) "qualified REIT subsidiaries" within the meaning of Section 856(i) of
the Code.

(xii) Neither MortgageIT nor any MortgageIT Subsidiary has (A) agreed to make
nor is it required to make any adjustment under Section 481(a) of the



 

29 Code by reason of a change in accounting method or otherwise; or (B)
distributed stock of another person, or has had its stock distributed by
another person, in a transaction that was purported or intended to be governed
in whole or in part by Section 355 of the Code. Neither MortgageIT nor any of
the MortgageIT Subsidiaries has disposed of any property in a transaction
intended to qualify for tax deferred treatment under Section 1031 or 1033 of
the Code in which MortgageIT or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be,
has yet to acquire a replacement property.

(xiii) Schedule 5.03(p)(xiii) of MortgageITs Disclosure Schedule sets forth
(i) a true, accurate and complete list of the net operating loss
carryforwards, capital loss carryforwards and other similar tax attributes
(collectively, the "Tax Attributes") of MortgageIT and any of its
Subsidiaries; (ii) the taxable years of expiration of any of the
Tax Attributes and (iii) any limitation on the utilization of any of the Tax
Attributes (including under Section 382 of the Code).

(xiv) MortgageIT does not have any earnings and profits attributable to it or
any other corporation in any non-REIT year within the meaning of Section 857
of the Code. To its knowledge, MortgageIT (A) is a "domestically controlled
REIT" within the meaning of Section 897(h) of the Code and (B) has not been at
any time a "United States real property holding corporation" as such term is
defined in Section 897(c)(2) of the Code.

(xv) Neither MortgageIT nor any MortgageIT Subsidiary has participated in any
"reportable transaction" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section
1.6011-4(b).

(q) _Risk Management Instruments_. (i) All Derivative Contracts whether
entered into for the account of MortgageIT or any of its Subsidiaries or for
the account of a customer of MortgageIT or any of its Subsidiaries, were
entered into in the ordinary course of businesses consistent with
past practice and in accordance with applicable rules, regulations and
policies of all applicable Governmental Authorities and with counterparties
believed to be financially responsible at the time and are legal, valid and
binding obligations of MortgageIT or one of its Subsidiaries and, to the
knowledge of MortgageIT, each of the counterparties thereto, and are
enforceable in accordance with their terms, and are in full force and effect,
(ii) MortgageIT or its Subsidiaries and, to the knowledge of MortgageIT, the
counterparties thereto, have duly performed their obligations thereunder to
the extent that such obligations to perform have accrued, and (iii) to
MortgageITs knowledge, there are no material breaches, violations or
defaults or allegations or assertions of such by any party thereunder.

(r) _Loans; Nonperforming Assets_.

(i) Each Loan on the books and records of MortgageIT and its Subsidiaries was
made and has been serviced in all material respects in accordance with their
customary lending and servicing standards in the ordinary course of business,
is evidenced in all material respects by appropriate and sufficient
documentation and, to the knowledge of MortgageIT, constitutes the legal,
valid and binding obligation of the obligor named therein, subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and
similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditors rights or by general equity principles.



 

30 (ii) Each Loan sold by MortgageIT and its Subsidiaries was made in all
material respects in accordance with the customary lending standards in the
ordinary course of business and, as of the date each Loan was sold, was
evidenced in all material respects by appropriate and sufficient documentation
and, to the knowledge of MortgageIT, constituted the legal, valid and binding
obligation of the obligor named therein, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and similar laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights or by general equity
principles.

(iii) MortgageIT has Previously Disclosed as to MortgageIT and each
MortgageIT Subsidiary as of the latest practicable date prior to the date of
this Agreement: (A) any written or, to MortgageITs knowledge, oral Loan under
the terms of which the obligor is 60 or more days delinquent in payment of
principal or interest (using the Mortgage Bankers Associations calculation
of delinquency), or to MortgageITs knowledge, in default of any other
material provision thereof; and (B) a listing of the OREO acquired by
foreclosure or by deed-in-lieu thereof, including the book value thereof.

(iv) The information set forth in each Mortgage Loan Tape is complete, true
and correct in all material respects as of the date specified in the Mortgage
Loan Tape. For purposes of this Section 5.03(r), "Mortgage Loan Tapes" means
all mortgage loan tapes delivered to Acquiror by MortgageIT or its
representatives prior to the date hereof in connection with the Transaction.

(s) _Properties_. Except for OREO, neither MortgageIT nor any of its
Subsidiaries owns any real property. All real and personal property (including
Intellectual Property) owned or leased by MortgageIT or a Subsidiary of
MortgageIT or presently used by any of them in their respective business
is sufficient to carry on its business in the ordinary and usual course
consistent with past practice. MortgageIT and its Subsidiaries have good and
marketable title free and clear of all Liens to all of the properties and

and filings referred to in the preceding paragraph and expiration of the
related waiting periods, the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Liquidation by Acquiror

breach or violation of, or a default under, or give rise to any Lien, any
acceleration of remedies or any right of termination or loss of a material
benefit under, (i) any law, rule or regulation or any judgment, decree, order,
memorandum of understanding, commitment letter, extraordinary supervisory
letter, governmental permit or license, or (ii) agreement, indenture or

before any arbitrator, court or Governmental Authority is pending against

proceeding which in the good faith judgment of Acquiror will not have a
Material Adverse Effect with respect to Acquiror. Neither Acquiror nor any of

funds necessary to consummate the Transaction and pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration to holders of MortgageIT Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.01
hereof.

6.01 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each of MortgageIT, Holdco, Acquiror and Merger Subsidiary agrees
to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or desirable, or
advisable under applicable laws, so as to permit consummation of the

adjournment or postponement, the "MortgageIT Meeting"). Except with the prior
approval of Acquiror, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, no other
matters shall be submitted for the approval of the MortgageIT stockholders at
the MortgageIT Meeting. The MortgageIT Board shall at all times prior to and
during such meeting recommend such approval and shall take all reasonable
lawful action to solicit such approval by its stockholders; provided that
nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the MortgageIT Board from withholding,
withdrawing, amending or modifying its recommendation if the MortgageIT Board
determines, after consultation with its outside counsel, that such action is
legally required in order for the directors to comply with their fiduciary
duties to the MortgageIT stockholders under applicable law; provided,
further, that Section 6.06 shall govern the withholding, withdrawing,
amending or modifying of such recommendation in the circumstances described
therein.

6.03 _Proxy Statement; Regulatory Filings_.

(a) MortgageIT agrees to promptly prepare and file with the SEC proxy
materials which will be utilized in soliciting stockholder approval of this
Agreement and the Transaction (the "Proxy Statement") and to mail the Proxy
Statement and an accompanying form of proxy to its stockholders promptly
following SEC clearance of such materials or SECs communication that it will
not be reviewing such materials. MortgageIT shall provide Acquiror a
reasonable opportunity to review the Proxy Statement and any amendments
or supplements thereto prior to MortgageITs distribution of such materials
to the stockholders of MortgageIT.



 

36 (b) Each of Acquiror and MortgageIT agrees that none of the information
supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference
in the Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto shall, at the
date(s) of mailing to MortgageITs stockholders and at the time of the
MortgageIT Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein not misleading. Each of Acquiror and MortgageIT further
agrees that if such party shall become aware prior to the Effective Time of
any information furnished by such party that would cause any of the statements
in the Proxy Statement to be false or misleading with respect to any material

therein not false or misleading, to promptly inform the other parties thereof
and to take the necessary steps to correct the Proxy Statement.

(c) Each of Acquiror and MortgageIT shall cooperate and use their respective
reasonable best efforts to prepare all documentation, to effect all filings
and to obtain all permits, consents, approvals, waivers and authorizations of
all third parties and Governmental Authorities necessary to consummate the
Transaction; and any initial filings with Governmental Authorities shall

party or any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transaction. In
exercising the foregoing right, each of such parties agrees to act reasonably
and as promptly as practicable. Each party hereto agrees that it shall consult

as applicable, to any third party or Governmental Authority.

6.04 _Press Releases_. MortgageIT and Acquiror shall consult with each other
before issuing any press release with respect to the Transaction or this
Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public
statements without the prior consent of the other party, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that a party may, without the prior
consent of the other party (but after such consultation, to the extent
practicable under the circumstances), issue such press release or make such
public statements as may upon the advice of outside counsel be required by
law, court process or the rules or regulations of the New York Stock Exchange
or any regulatory or self regulatory authorities. MortgageIT and Acquiror

appropriate management available at presentations related to the Transaction
as reasonably requested by the other party.



 

37 6.05 _Access; Information_.

(a) MortgageIT agrees that upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable
laws relating to the exchange of information, it shall afford Acquiror and
Acquirors officers, employees, counsel, accountants and other authorized
representatives such access during normal business hours throughout the period
prior to the Effective Time to the books, records (including,
without limitation, Tax Returns and work papers of independent auditors),
properties and personnel of MortgageIT and its Subsidiaries and to such other
information relating to MortgageIT and its Subsidiaries as Acquiror may
reasonably request. Without limiting the foregoing, MortgageIT agrees that it
shall provide Acquiror and Acquirors officers, employees, counsel,
accountants and other authorized representatives with all of the information
(including Tax workpapers and Tax-related books and records) necessary, and
shall make its authorized representatives available for regular consultations,
in order to determine the amount of dividends or distributions required or
permitted to be made to holders of MortgageIT Common Stock pursuant to
Section 4.01(c) and 6.12 hereof and to determine the tax basis of the assets
of MortgageIT and its Subsidiaries.

(b) Neither MortgageIT nor its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide
access to, or disclose, information where such access or disclosure would
jeopardize any attorney-client privilege or contravene any law, rule,
regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement
entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. MortgageIT will make
appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which
the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

(c) The parties acknowledge that MortgageIT and Acquiror have previously
executed a letter dated May 23, 2006 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), which
Confidentiality Agreement will continue in full force and effect in accordance
with its terms. Acquiror will hold any "Evaluation Materials" (as defined in
the Confidentiality Agreement) confidential in accordance with the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement.

(d) The parties agree that all non-public, proprietary or confidential
information relating to Acquiror and any of its affiliates that has been
disclosed to MortgageIT or its representatives by Acquiror or its
representatives will be held in confidence by MortgageIT to the same extent
as Acquiror is obligated to hold in confidence "Evaluation Materials"
pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement.

6.06  _Acquisition Proposals_. MortgageIT agrees that it shall not, and that
it shall direct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its directors,
officers, employees, agents and representatives not to, directly or
indirectly, initiate, solicit, encourage or otherwise facilitate any
inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal. MortgageIT shall immediately cease any discussions or
negotiations existing as of the date hereof with any third party relating to
any proposed Acquisition Proposal, and shall request that all confidential
information furnished on behalf of MortgageIT to any such Persons be returned.
MortgageIT further agrees that it shall not, and that it shall direct and
use its reasonable best efforts to cause its directors, officers, employees,
agents and representatives not to, directly or indirectly, engage in any
negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential information or data to,
or have any discussions with, any Person relating to an Acquisition Proposal,
or



 

38 otherwise facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement an Acquisition
Proposal; provided, however, that nothing contained in this Agreement shall
prevent MortgageIT or the MortgageIT Board from (A) complying with its
disclosure obligations under federal or state law; (B) prior to the MortgageIT
Meeting, providing information in response to a request therefor by a Person
who has made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal if the
MortgageIT Board receives from the Person so requesting such information an
executed confidentiality agreement on terms no less favorable to
MortgageIT than the Confidentiality Agreement; (C) prior to the MortgageIT
Meeting, engaging in any negotiations or discussions with any Person who has
made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal or (D) prior to the
MortgageIT Meeting, recommending such an Acquisition Proposal to the
stockholders of MortgageIT, if and only to the extent that, in each such case
referred to in clause (B), (C) or (D) above, (i) MortgageIT is not in
violation of the terms of this Section 6.06, (ii) the MortgageIT Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that
such action would be required in order for its directors to comply with their
respective fiduciary duties under applicable law and (iii) the MortgageIT
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor), taking into account all legal, financial and regulatory aspects of
the proposal and the Person making the proposal, that such Acquisition
Proposal, (x) if accepted, is reasonably likely to be consummated on the terms
proposed and is not subject to any financing contingencies, and (y) would, if
consummated, result in a transaction more favorable to MortgageITs
stockholders from a financial point of view than the Merger. An Acquisition
Proposal (except that references in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal"
to "10%" shall be replaced with "50%") which is received and considered by
the MortgageIT Board in compliance with this Section 6.06 and which meets the
requirements set forth in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of the preceding
sentence is herein referred to as a "Superior Proposal." From and after the
execution of this Agreement, MortgageIT shall as promptly as reasonably
practicable notify Acquiror of any request for information or any inquiries,
proposals or offers relating to an Acquisition Proposal, indicating, in
connection with such notice, the name of such Person making such request,
inquiry, proposal or offer and the material terms and conditions of any
proposals or offers. MortgageIT shall keep Acquiror informed on a reasonably
current basis of the status of any Acquisition Proposal, including with
respect to the status and terms of any such proposal or offer and whether any
such proposal or offer has been withdrawn or rejected.

6.07 _Certain Policies_. Prior to the Effective Date, to the extent requested
by Acquiror, each of MortgageIT and its Subsidiaries shall, consistent with
GAAP and the rules and regulations of the SEC, modify or change its loan,
OREO, accrual, reserve, tax, litigation, hedging and real estate valuation
policies and practices (including loan classifications and levels of reserves)
so as to be applied on a basis that is consistent with that of Acquiror;
provided, however, that no such modifications or changes need be made prior to
the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Sections 7.01(a) and (b); and
further provided that in any event, no accrual or reserve made by MortgageIT
or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to this Section 6.07 shall constitute or
be deemed to be a breach, violation of or failure to satisfy any
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement, condition or other provision
of this Agreement or otherwise be considered in determining whether any such
breach, violation or failure to satisfy shall have occurred. The recording of
any such adjustments shall not be deemed to imply any misstatement of
previously furnished financial statements or information and shall not be
construed as concurrence of MortgageIT or its management with any such
adjustments. MortgageIT shall



 

39 cooperate and shall take all action reasonably requested by Acquiror in
connection with the accounting treatment of those debt and REMIC mortgage-
backed securitization transactions identified by Acquiror, which shall not be
effective earlier than the Closing Date.

6.08 _Indemnification_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Acquiror (the "Indemnifying
Party") agrees that all indemnification rights of each present and former
director, officer and employee of MortgageIT or a MortgageIT Subsidiary,
determined as of the Effective Time (the "Indemnified Parties") against any
costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of matters existing or occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time, arising in whole or in part out of or pertaining to
the fact that he or she was a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent
of MortgageIT or a MortgageIT Subsidiary or is or was serving at the request
of MortgageIT or a MortgageIT Subsidiary as a director, officer, employee,
fiduciary or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust
or other enterprise, including without limitation matters related to the
negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement or consummation of
the Transaction, shall survive the Transaction and shall be assumed by
Acquiror and shall continue in full force and effect to the fullest extent
which such Indemnified Parties would be entitled to indemnification under the
MortgageIT Articles and the MortgageIT Bylaws or equivalent documents of any
MortgageIT Subsidiary, or any agreement, arrangement or undertaking which has
been Previously Disclosed by MortgageIT pursuant to this Section, in each case
as in effect on the date hereof (which right to indemnification shall include
the advancement of reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the
final disposition of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation upon
receipt from an Indemnified Party of any required undertaking to the extent
provided therein).

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section
6.08, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party, but the failure
to so notify shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability it may
have to such Indemnified Party if such failure does not actually prejudice
the Indemnifying Party. In the event of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective
Time), (i) the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the defense
thereof and the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to such Indemnified
Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses
subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with the
defense thereof, except that if the Indemnifying Party elects not to assume
such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Parties advises that there are
issues which raise conflicts of interest between the Indemnifying Party and
the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel which is
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnifying Party
shall pay, promptly as statements therefor are received, the reasonable fees
and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties, (ii) the
Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter, (iii)
the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement effected without
its prior written consent and (iv) the Indemnifying Party shall 



 

40 have no obligation hereunder in the event that a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine that indemnification of an Indemnified Party in
the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable laws and
regulations.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, Acquiror shall cause the persons serving as
directors and officers of MortgageIT and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to
the Effective Time to be covered by the directors and officers
liability insurance policy maintained by MortgageIT for a period of six years
after the Effective Time (provided that Acquiror may substitute therefore
policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions which are not materially less advantageous than such policy or
single premium tail coverage with policy limits equal to MortgageITs existing
coverage limits) with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time which were committed by such directors and officers in their
capacities as such, provided that in no event shall Acquiror be required to
expend for any one year an amount in excess of 250% of the annual premium
currently paid by MortgageIT for such insurance (the "Insurance Amount"), and
further provided that if Acquiror is unable to maintain or obtain the
insurance called for by this Section 6.08(c) as a result of the preceding
provision, Acquiror shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
most advantageous coverage as is available for the Insurance Amount.

(d) If Acquiror or any of its successors or assigns shall consolidate with or
merge into any other entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving
entity of such consolidation or merger or shall transfer all or substantially
all of its assets to any other entity, then and in each case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successor and assign of Acquiror shall
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.08.

(e) The provisions of this Section 6.08 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by each of the Indemnified Parties and their
respective heirs and representatives.

6.09 _Benefit Plans and Employment Matters_.

(a) As soon as administratively practicable after the Effective Time, Acquiror
shall take all reasonable action so that employees of MortgageIT and its
Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time who remain employed by Acquiror or its
Subsidiaries ("Continuing Employees") shall be entitled to participate in (i)
each employee benefit plan, program or arrangement of Acquiror of general
applicability (the "Acquiror Benefit Plans") to the same extent as similarly-
situated employees of Acquiror and its Subsidiaries or (ii) employee benefit
plans, programs or arrangements established by Acquiror for the benefit of
Continuing Employees ("New Benefit Plans"), provided the terms and conditions
of such New Benefit Plans shall be substantially similar in the aggregate to
those corresponding Benefit Plans of MortgageIT (it being understood that
inclusion of Continuing Employees in the Acquiror Benefit Plans or the New
Benefit Plans may occur at different times with respect to different plans),
provided that coverage shall be continued under corresponding Benefit Plans of
MortgageIT and its Subsidiaries until such employees are permitted to
participate in either the Acquiror Benefit Plans or the New Benefit Plans.
Acquiror shall cause each Acquiror Benefit Plans or New Benefit Plans in which
such employees of MortgageIT and its Subsidiaries are eligible to participate
to recognize, for purposes of determining eligibility to participate in, the



 

41 vesting of benefits and for all other purposes (but not for accrual of pension
benefits) under the Acquiror Benefit Plans or New Benefit Plans, the service
of such employees with MortgageIT and its Subsidiaries to the same extent as
such service was credited for such purpose by MortgageIT. Except for the
commitment to continue those Benefit Plans of MortgageIT and its Subsidiaries
that correspond to Acquiror Benefit Plans until employees of MortgageIT and

or policies of MortgageIT and its Subsidiaries which are Previously

(c) At such time as employees of MortgageIT and its Subsidiaries become
eligible to participate in a medical, dental or health plan of Acquiror or
its Subsidiaries, Acquiror shall cause each such plan to (i) waive any

otherwise apply to employees covered under the applicable medical, health or
dental plans of Acquiror or its Subsidiaries, (ii) provide full credit under
such plans for any deductibles, co-payment and out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by the employees and their beneficiaries during the portion of the calendar

such employee on or after the Effective Time to the extent such employee had
satisfied any similar limitation or requirement under an analogous Benefit
Plan prior to the Effective Time.

(d) A Continuing Employee (excluding any Continuing Employee who is party to
an employment agreement, change-in-control agreement or any other agreement
which provides for severance payments and excluding any Continuing Employee
who is employed in a loan production personnel position) whose employment is
terminated following the Effective Time shall be entitled to receive severance

as in effect as of the date hereof and as it may be generally amended from

or any of its Subsidiaries as reasonably requested by Acquiror for the
purpose of complying with Acquirors employment policies.

6.10  _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each of MortgageIT and Acquiror
shall give prompt notice to the other of any fact, event or circumstance known
to it that (i) is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all
other facts, events and circumstances known to it, to result in any Material
Adverse Effect with respect to it or (ii) would cause or constitute a material
breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained herein. 

6.11 _Assumption of Indenture Obligations_. In connection with the Merger,
Acquiror and Holdco acknowledge that the indentures contemplate the execution
of such supplemental indentures and provision of such documents including,

or consolidation of MortgageIT under the indentures, trust
agreements, guarantee agreements and other agreements entered into by
MortgageIT or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the issuance of
debentures and capital securities by MortgageIT and its Subsidiaries,
including MortgageIT Capital Trust I, MortgageIT Capital Trust II and

6.12 _Final Dividend_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, and to the
extent necessary for MortgageIT to satisfy the requirements of Section

1, 2006 and, if applicable, the preceding taxable year (and to allow
MortgageIT to distribute 100% of its "real estate investment trust
taxable income" (as such term is used in Section 857(a) of the Code and
taking into account any dividends previously paid during the tax year that
give rise to a dividends-paid deduction for such tax year, but before
reduction for the dividend contemplated by this Section 6.12(a)) and to
eliminate any of the earnings and profits of MortgageIT through the Effective
Date in order to avoid the payment of any tax with respect to undistributed
income or gain and to ensure that no amounts will be included in the income
of Acquiror pursuant to the Liquidation), MortgageIT shall declare a dividend
to holders of MortgageIT Common Stock, the record date for which shall precede
the Closing Date, in an amount equal to the minimum dividend sufficient to
permit MortgageIT to satisfy such requirements. The amount and timing of any
dividends payable hereunder to holders of MortgageIT Common Stock shall be as
determined in Section 6.12(b) and in all events shall be paid prior to
the Closing Date.

(b) MortgageIT and Acquiror (and their authorized representatives) shall
consult in good faith with respect to the timing and amount of any dividends
or distributions to be made to the holders of MortgageIT Common Stock pursuant

written consent of Acquiror (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld).



 

43 6.13 _Certain Tax Matters_.

(a) MortgageIT shall take all actions, and refrain from taking all actions, as
are necessary to ensure that MortgageIT will qualify for taxation as a REIT
for U.S. federal income tax purposes for its tax year beginning on January 1,

all reasonable requests of the Acquiror with respect to maintenance of
MortgageITs REIT status for MortgageITs tax year beginning on January 1,
2006.

(b) MortgageIT shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed all Tax Returns for MortgageIT and each MortgageIT Subsidiary required
to be filed on or prior to the Closing Date, including applicable extensions.
Any such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the
historic Tax accounting practices of MortgageIT (except as may be required
under applicable Tax law). MortgageIT shall duly and timely pay in full all
Taxes shown as due on such Tax Returns. MortgageIT shall provide to the
Acquiror copies of such Tax Returns that are to be filed on or prior to the
Closing Date at least 10 Business Days prior to the due date of such Tax
Returns (including applicable extensions). MortgageIT shall accept any and all
reasonable comments of the Acquiror with respect to such Tax Returns.

6.14 _Net Worth Certificate_. Within 30 calendar days following the end of
each calendar month commencing with the month of July 2006, MortgageIT shall
deliver to Acquiror a certificate duly executed by MortgageITs Chief
Financial Officer certifying as to the calculation of MortgageITs Net Worth
as of the last day of such preceding calendar month, together with
reasonable supporting documentation of such calculation. With respect to each
certificate delivered to Acquiror pursuant to this Section 6.14, MortgageIT
shall provide Acquiror and its accountants and other authorized
representatives access to all information, books and records required or used
by MortgageIT or its advisors to prepare such certificate.

MortgageIT will permit the Acquiror to bid for all bulk sales of Loans by
MortgageIT or its Subsidiaries to third parties (other than to MortgageIT) and
will sell any such Loans to Acquiror to the extent Acquirors bid is on the
same or better terms (including price) as the best third party bid.

6.16 _Standstill Agreements; Confidentiality Agreements_. During the period
from the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, MortgageIT shall
not terminate, amend, modify or waive any provision of any confidentiality or
standstill agreement to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party and
which relates to the confidentiality of information regarding MortgageIT or
its Subsidiaries or which relates to securities of MortgageIT. During such
period, MortgageIT shall use reasonable best efforts to enforce, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable law, the provisions of any such
agreement, including by using reasonable best efforts to obtain injunctions to
prevent any breaches of such agreements and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions thereof in any court having jurisdiction.

some other date shall be true and correct as of such date), except for such
failures to be true and correct (without regard to Material Adverse Effect,

Effect with respect to Acquiror, and MortgageIT shall have received a
certificate, dated the Effective Date, signed on behalf of Acquiror, Holdco

true and correct as of such date), except for such failures to be true and
correct (without regard to Material Adverse Effect, materiality or knowledge

46 ARTICLE VIII

TERMINATION

8.01 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated, and the Transaction may
be abandoned:

(a) _Mutual Consent_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, by the mutual
written consent of Acquiror and MortgageIT.

(b) _Breach_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, provided that the
terminating party (or if Acquiror is the terminating party, Merger
Subsidiary) is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained therein, by Acquiror or MortgageIT, in the
event of: (i) a breach by Acquiror, Holdco or Merger Subsidiary on the one
hand or MortgageIT on the other hand, as the case may be, of any
representation or warranty contained herein, which breach cannot be or has not
been cured within 30 days after the giving of written notice to the breaching
party or parties of such breach; or (ii) a breach by Acquiror, Holdco or
Merger Subsidiary on the one hand or MortgageIT on the other hand, as the case
may be, of any of the covenants or agreements contained herein, which
breach cannot be or has not been cured within 30 days after the giving of
written notice to the breaching party or parties of such breach, which breach
(whether under (i) or (ii)) would be reasonably expected, individually or in
the aggregate with other breaches, to result in a failure of any of the
conditions set forth in Article VII to be satisfied.

(c)  _Delay_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, by Acquiror or
MortgageIT, in the event that the Merger is not consummated by the nine month
anniversary of the date hereof, except to the extent that the failure of the
Merger then to be consummated arises out of or results from the knowing
action or inaction of (i) the party seeking to terminate pursuant to this
Section 8.01(c) to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such
party (or Holdco or Merger Subsidiary, in the case of Acquiror), set forth in
this Agreement or (ii) any of the Shareholders (if MortgageIT is the party
seeking to terminate) to perform or observe their respective obligations under

Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall have
been denied by final nonappealable action of such Governmental Authority or an
application therefor shall have been permanently withdrawn at the request of
a Governmental Authority; provided, however, that no party shall have the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01(d) if such
denial shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate
this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such
party (or Holdco or Merger Subsidiary, in the case of Acquiror) set forth
herein; provided, further, that MortgageIT shall not have the right to
terminate the Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01(d) until Acquiror has
not confirmed to MortgageIT Acquirors willingness to waive the receipt of
such approval of a Governmental Authority.



 

47 (e) _No Shareholder Approval_. By either Acquiror or MortgageIT, if any
approval of the stockholders of MortgageIT contemplated by this Agreement
shall not have been obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the required
vote at the MortgageIT Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof.

recommendation or modified or changed such recommendation in a manner adverse
in any respect to the interests of Acquiror or (iii) MortgageIT shall have
materially breached its obligations under Section 6.02 by failing to call,
give notice of, convene and hold the MortgageIT Meeting in accordance with
Section 6.02.

(g) _Certain Tender or Exchange Offers_. By Acquiror if a tender offer or
exchange offer for 20% or more of the outstanding shares of MortgageIT Common
Stock is commenced (other than by Acquiror or a Subsidiary thereof), and the
MortgageIT Board recommends that the stockholders of MortgageIT tender their
shares in such tender or exchange offer or otherwise fails to recommend that
such stockholders reject such tender offer or exchange offer within the ten-
Business Day period specified in Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act.

(h) _Superior Proposal_. At any time prior to the MortgageIT Meeting, by
MortgageIT in order to concurrently enter into an acquisition agreement or
similar agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal which has been received
and considered by MortgageIT and the MortgageIT Board in compliance with
Section 6.06 hereof, provided, however, that this Agreement may be terminated
by MortgageIT pursuant to this Section 8.01(h) only after the fifth Business
Day following MortgageITs provision of written notice to Acquiror advising
Acquiror that the MortgageIT Board is prepared to accept a Superior Proposal,
and only if, during such five-Business Day period, Acquiror does not, in its
sole discretion, make an offer to MortgageIT that the MortgageIT Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial and legal
advisors, is at least as favorable as the Superior Proposal.

8.02 Effect of Termination and Abandonment.

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the
Merger pursuant to this Article VIII, no party to this Agreement shall have
any liability or further obligation to any other party hereunder, except (i)
as set forth in this Section 8.02 and Section 9.01 and (ii) nothing contained
herein shall relieve any party hereto from liability for willful breach of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement.

(b) In recognition of the efforts, expenses and other opportunities foregone
by Acquiror while structuring and pursuing the Merger, the parties hereto
agree that MortgageIT shall pay Acquiror the sum of $12.9 million (the
"Termination Fee") if this Agreement is terminated as follows:

(i) if this Agreement is terminated (x) by Acquiror pursuant to Section
8.01(f) or (g), payment shall be made to Acquiror on the second Business Day
following the termination of this Agreement or (y) by MortgageIT pursuant to
Section 8.01(h), payment shall be made to Acquiror concurrently with, and as
a condition to the effectiveness of, such termination of this Agreement; or



 

48 (ii) if (x) this Agreement is terminated (A) by Acquiror pursuant to Section
8.01(b), (B) by either Acquiror or MortgageIT pursuant to Section 8.01(c) and
at the time of such termination no vote of MortgageIT stockholders
contemplated by this Agreement at the MortgageIT Meeting shall have occurred
or (C) by either Acquiror or MortgageIT pursuant to Section 8.01(e), and in
the case of any termination pursuant to clause (A), (B) or (C), an Acquisition
Proposal shall have been publicly announced or otherwise communicated or
made known to the senior management of MortgageIT or the MortgageIT Board (or
any Person shall have publicly announced, communicated or made known an
intention, whether or not conditional, to make an Acquisition Proposal) at any
time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the taking of the vote of
the stockholders of MortgageIT contemplated by this Agreement at the
MortgageIT Meeting, in the case of clause (C), or the date of termination, in
the case of clause (A) or (B), and (y) within 12 months after such
termination MortgageIT enters into an agreement with respect to a Control
Transaction (as defined below) or consummates a Control Transaction, then
MortgageIT shall pay to Acquiror the Termination Fee on the date of execution
of such agreement or consummation of a Control Transaction which is the
subject of an Acquisition Proposal, provided that if the date of execution of
such agreement is after 9 months but within 12 months after such termination
of this Agreement, the Termination Fee shall be payable by MortgageIT to
Acquiror only upon consummation of a Control Transaction which is the subject
of an Acquisition Proposal, regardless whether such consummation occurs within
12 months after termination of this Agreement. As used in this Section
8.02(b)(ii), a "Control Transaction" means the acquisition by purchase,
merger, consolidation, sale, transfer or otherwise, in one transaction or any
related series of transactions of a majority of the voting power of the
outstanding securities of MortgageIT or substantially all of the consolidated
assets of MortgageIT.

Any amount that becomes payable pursuant to this Section 8.02(b) shall be paid
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by
Acquiror.

(c) MortgageIT and Acquiror agree that the agreement contained in paragraph
(b) of this Section 8.02 is an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, that without such agreement Acquiror would not have entered
into this Agreement and that such amounts do not constitute a penalty or
liquidated damages in the event of a breach of this Agreement by MortgageIT.
If MortgageIT fails to pay Acquiror the amounts due under paragraph (b) above
within the time periods specified therein, MortgageIT shall pay the costs and
expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by
Acquiror in



 

49 connection with any action in which Acquiror prevails, including the filing of
any lawsuit, taken to collect payment of such amounts, together with interest
on the amount of any such unpaid amounts at the prime lending rate prevailing
during such period as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ , calculated on a
daily basis from the date such amounts were required to be paid until the
date of actual payment.

ARTICLE IX

MISCELLANEOUS

9.01 _Survival_. No representations, warranties, agreements and covenants

MortgageIT Meeting no amendment shall be made which by law requires further
approval by the stockholders of MortgageIT without obtaining such approval. No

other provisions hereof by any such party, nor shall any such waiver be deemed
a continuing waiver of any provision hereof by such party.

liabilities or damages arising out of the other partys willful breach of any
provision of this Agreement.

9.06 _Notices_. All notices, requests and other communications hereunder to a
party shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if personally delivered,

9.07 _Entire Understanding; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement, the
Agreement and Plan of Merger and Liquidation, the Shareholder Agreements and
the Confidentiality Agreement represent the entire understanding of the
parties hereto and thereto with reference to the Transaction, and this
Agreement, the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Liquidation, the Shareholder
Agreements and the Confidentiality Agreement supersede any and all other oral
or written agreements heretofore made. Except for the Indemnified Parties
right to enforce Acquirors obligations under Section 6.08 hereof, which are
expressly intended to be for the irrevocable benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and
representatives, nothing in this Agreement is intended to confer upon any
Person, other than the parties hereto or their respective successors, any
rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this
Agreement.

9.08 _Severability_. Except to the extent that application of this Section
9.08 would have a Material Adverse Effect on MortgageIT or Acquiror, any term
or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of
such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or
unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or
affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of
this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement
is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be
only so broad as is enforceable. In all such cases, the parties shall use
their reasonable best efforts to substitute a valid, legal and enforceable
provision that, insofar as practicable, implements the original purposes and
intents of this Agreement.

9.09 _Enforcement of the Agreement_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any
court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

9.10 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections,
Annexes, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to a Section of, or
Annex, Exhibit or Schedule to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The
table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and are not part of this Agreement. Whenever the words
"include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be
deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." Whenever the words
"as of the date hereof" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
mean the day and year first above written.



 

52 9.11 _Assignment_. No party may assign either this Agreement or any of its
rights, interests or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval
of the other parties, provided that to the extent the conditions of Section
9.12(i), (ii) and (iii) below are satisfied, such consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

9.12 _Alternative Structure_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, Acquiror may at any time modify the structure of
the acquisition of MortgageIT set forth herein, subject to the prior written
consent of MortgageIT, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, provided that (i) the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders
of MortgageIT Common Stock is not thereby changed in kind or reduced in
amount as a result of such modification, (ii) such modification will not

FORM OF

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND LIQUIDATION OF

MORTGAGEIT HOLDINGS, INC.

BY TITAN HOLDINGS CORP.

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND LIQUIDATION (this "Agreement") agreed to
this  _ _ day of _ _2006, between TITAN HOLDINGS
CORP., a Maryland corporation ("Holdco"), and MORTGAGEIT HOLDINGS, INC., a
Maryland corporation ("MortgageIT").

WHEREAS, Holdco owns all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of
MortgageIT;

WHEREAS, Holdco wishes to approve, authorize, and consent to (i) the merger
of MortgageIT with and into Holdco pursuant to the Maryland General
Corporation Law (the "MCGL") and (ii) by virtue of the Merger, the voluntary
liquidation of MortgageIT in accordance with Section 332 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("Code"), in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the related Agreement and
Plan of Reorganization, dated as of July 11, 2006, among DB Structured
Products, Inc. (the "Acquiror"), Holdco, Titan Acquisition Corp., a Maryland
corporation ("Merger Subsidiary"), and MortgageIT ("Plan of Merger"); and

WHEREAS, Merger Subsidiary, a former subsidiary of Holdco, previously merged
with and into MortgageIT pursuant to the Plan of Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows:

1\. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
on the Effective Date (as defined below), MortgageIT shall merge with and into
Holdco (the "Merger"), the separate corporate existence of MortgageIT shall
cease and Holdco shall survive and continue to exist as a Maryland corporation
(Holdco, as the surviving corporation in the Merger, is sometimes referred to
herein as the "Surviving Corporation") with all its rights, privileges,
immunities, powers and franchises continuing unaffected by the Merger.

2\. The name of the Surviving Corporation shall be changed to "MortgageIT
Holdings, Inc."

3\. The charter and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the
Merger shall remain the Holdco Charter ("Holdco Charter") and the Holdco
Bylaws as in effect immediately prior to the Merger, except that the Holdco
Charter shall be amended by the Articles of Merger referred to in Section 7
hereof to implement the foregoing name change.



 

A-1 4\. The directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Merger
shall remain the directors of Holdco immediately prior to the Merger. The
executive officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Merger
shall remain the executive officers of Holdco immediately prior to the Merger.

5\. The authorized capital stock of the Surviving Corporation shall be
unchanged by the Merger.

6\. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in
accordance with the MGCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of MortgageIT shall vest in the
Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions,
disabilities and duties of MortgageIT shall become the debts, liabilities,
obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

7\. The parties shall cause Articles of Merger to be filed with the Maryland
Department of Assessments and Taxation pursuant to the MGCL on the Effective
Date. The Merger provided for herein shall become effective upon such filings
or on such date as may be specified therein. The date of such filings or such
later effective date is herein called the "Effective Date." The "Effective
Time" of the Merger shall be the time of such filings or as set forth in such
filings.

8\. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of a holder of shares of MortgageITs common stock, each share of
MortgageITs common stock owned by Holdco or its affiliates shall be converted
into and become one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

9\. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of a holder of shares of Holdcos common stock, each share of
Holdcos common stock owned by Acquiror or its affiliates shall be converted
into and become one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

10\. The boards of directors of MortgageIT and Holdco approved and authorized
the merger and liquidation of MortgageIT.

11\. The parties agree that the Merger and this Agreement shall be deemed a
plan of liquidation in accordance with the provisions of Section 332 of the
Code.



 

A-2 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement and Plan of
Merger and Liquidation to be executed by their respective duly authorized
officers as of the day and year first above written.

A-3 ANNEX B

SHAREHOLDER AGREEMENT

SHAREHOLDER AGREEMENT (the "Agreement"), dated as of July 11, 2006, among _
_, a shareholder ("Shareholder") of MortgageIT Holdings, Inc., a Maryland
corporation ("MortgageIT"), and DB Structured Products, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Acquiror"). All terms used herein and not defined herein shall
have the meanings assigned thereto in the Merger Agreement (defined below).

WHEREAS, Acquiror, Titan Holdings Corporation, a Maryland corporation, Titan
Acquisition Corp., a Maryland corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of
Acquiror ("Merger Subsidiary"), and MortgageIT are entering into an Agreement
and Plan of Reorganization, dated as of the date hereof (the "Merger
Agreement"), pursuant to which Merger Subsidiary will merge with and
into MortgageIT on the terms and conditions set forth therein (the "Merger")
and, in connection therewith, outstanding shares of MortgageIT Common Stock
will be converted into cash in the manner set forth therein; and

WHEREAS, Shareholder owns the shares of MortgageIT Common Stock identified on
Exhibit I hereto (such shares, together with all shares of MortgageIT Common
Stock subsequently acquired by Shareholder during the term of this Agreement,
being referred to as the "Shares"); and

WHEREAS, in order to induce Acquiror to enter into the Merger Agreement,
Shareholder, solely in such Shareholders capacity as a shareholder of
MortgageIT and not in any other capacity, has agreed to enter into and perform
this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt, sufficiency
and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

1\. _Agreement to Vote Shares_. Shareholder agrees that at any meeting of
the stockholders of MortgageIT, or in connection with any written consent of
the stockholders of MortgageIT, Shareholder shall:

(i) appear at each such meeting or otherwise cause the Shares to be counted
as present thereat for purposes of calculating a quorum; and

(ii) vote (or cause to be voted), in person or by proxy, or deliver a written
consent (or cause a consent to be delivered) covering, all the Shares (whether
acquired heretofore or hereafter) that are beneficially owned by Shareholder
or as to which Shareholder has, directly or indirectly, the right to vote or
direct the voting, (x) in favor of adoption and approval of the Merger
Agreement and the Merger; and (y) against any Acquisition Proposal.



 

B-1 2\. _Transfer of Shares_.

A. _Transferee of Shares to be Bound by this Agreement_. Shareholder hereby
agrees that prior to the MortgageIT Meeting, Shareholder shall not
sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of the Shares (or any securities
convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Shares) unless each person
to which any of such Shares (or any securities convertible into or exercisable
or exchangeable for Shares) is so transferred has agreed in writing to hold
such Shares (or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable
for Shares) subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and to
perform all of the Shareholders obligations hereunder with respect to such
Shares.

B. _Transfer of Voting Rights_. Shareholder hereby agrees Shareholder shall
not deposit any Shares in a voting trust, grant any proxy or enter into any
voting agreement or similar agreement or arrangement in contravention of the
obligations of Shareholder under this Agreement with respect to any of the
Shares.

3\. _Representations and Warranties of Shareholder_. Shareholder represents
and warrants to and agrees with Acquiror as follows:

A. _Capacity_. Shareholder has all requisite capacity and authority to enter
into and perform his, her or its obligations under this Agreement. 

B. _Binding Agreement_. This Agreement constitutes the valid and legally
binding obligation of Shareholder, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and to general equity
principles.

C. _Non-Contravention_. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Shareholder does not, and the performance by Shareholder of his, her or
its obligations hereunder and the consummation by Shareholder of the
transactions contemplated hereby will not, violate or conflict with, or
constitute a default under, any agreement, instrument, contract or other
obligation or any order, arbitration award, judgment or decree to which
Shareholder is a party or by which Shareholder is bound, or any statute, rule
or regulation to which Shareholder is subject or, in the event that
Shareholder is a corporation, partnership, trust or other entity, any
charter, bylaw or other organizational document of Shareholder.

4\. _Specific Performance and Remedies_. Shareholder acknowledges that it
will be impossible to measure in money the damage to Acquiror if Shareholder
fails to comply with the obligations imposed by this Agreement and that, in
the event of any such failure, Acquiror will not have an adequate remedy at
law or in equity. Accordingly, Shareholder agrees that injunctive relief or
other equitable remedy, in addition to remedies at law or in damages, is the
appropriate remedy for any such failure and will not oppose the granting of
such relief on the basis that Acquiror may have an adequate remedy at law.
Shareholder agrees that Shareholder will not seek, and agrees to waive any
requirement for, the securing or posting of a bond in connection with
Acquirors seeking or obtaining such equitable relief. In addition, after
discussing the matter with Shareholder, Acquiror shall have the right to
inform any third party that Acquiror reasonably believes to be, or to be
contemplating, participating with Shareholder or receiving



 

B-2 from Shareholder assistance in violation of this Agreement, of the terms of
this Agreement and of the rights of Acquiror hereunder, and that
participation by any such persons with Shareholder in activities in violation
of Shareholders agreement with Acquiror set forth in this Agreement may give
rise to claims by Acquiror against such third party.

5\. _Term of Agreement; Termination_.

A. The term of this Agreement shall commence on the date hereof.

B. This Agreement shall terminate upon the date, if any, of termination of
the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms. Upon such termination, no
party shall have any further obligations or liabilities hereunder; provided,
however, such termination shall not relieve any party from liability for
any willful breach of this Agreement prior to such termination.

C. If the Merger Agreement is not terminated in accordance with its
terms, this Agreement (except for the provisions of Sections 3 and 8, which
shall survive the Effective Time) shall terminate upon the Effective Time.
Upon such termination, no party shall have any further obligations or
liabilities under this Agreement; provided, however, such termination shall
not relieve any party from liability for any willful breach of such Section
prior to such termination.

6\. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements,
written or oral, among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter
hereof and contains the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be amended, supplemented or
modified, and no provisions hereof may be modified or waived, except by an
instrument in writing signed by each party hereto. No waiver of any provisions
hereof by any party shall be deemed a waiver of any other provisions hereof
by any such party, nor shall any such waiver be deemed a continuing waiver of
any provision hereof by such party.

7\. _Notices_. All notices, requests, claims, demands or other communications
hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given when delivered
personally, upon receipt of a transmission confirmation if sent by facsimile
or like transmission and on the next business day when sent by a reputable
