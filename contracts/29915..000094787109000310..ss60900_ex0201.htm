Initial Closing Statement, together with a reasonably detailed description of
the reasons for its objections to each such item or amount, and a calculation
of the Purchase Price, Company Indebtedness and Closing Working Capital based
on such objections ("Notice of Disagreement"). If the Seller delivers to the

the earlier of the date of delivery of such Notice of Acceptance or the
Objection Deadline Date, the Initial Closing Statement shall be deemed to be
the Final Closing Statement. If the Seller timely delivers a Notice of
Disagreement, only those matters specified in such Notice of Disagreement

Initial Closing Statement shall be final and binding upon the Purchaser and
the Seller.

 

 

(e) The objections set forth on the Notice of Disagreement shall be resolved
as follows:

 

 

(i) The Seller and the Purchaser shall first use reasonable efforts to
resolve such objections.

delivery of such Notice of Disagreement, the Seller and the Purchaser shall,
within 30 days following the expiration of such 30-day period, engage the
Neutral Accountant, pursuant to an engagement agreement, including customary
indemnities in favor of the Neutral Accountant if so requested, executed by
the Seller, the Purchaser and the Neutral Accountant, to resolve any
Unresolved Objections. The Neutral Accountant shall be engaged as expert not
arbitrator.

 

 

(iv) The Neutral Accountant shall be instructed only to resolve the
Unresolved Objections and shall, in its sole discretion, be permitted to
engage an independent actuary to assist in the resolution of, or to resolve,
any of the Unresolved Objections, including, but not limited to, the
determination of the Pension Deficit Amount and the Post-

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Retirement Welfare Amount. The Purchaser and the Seller shall cause the
Neutral Accountant to make a final determination (which determination shall
be binding on the parties hereto) of the Purchase Price, Company Indebtedness
and the Closing Working Capital within 30 days from the date the Unresolved
Objections were submitted to the Neutral Accountant, and such final
determination shall be deemed the Final Closing Statement. During the 30-day
review by the Neutral Accountant, the Purchaser and the Seller shall each
make available to the Neutral Accountant such individuals and such
information, books and records as may be reasonably required by the Neutral
Accountant to make its final determination.

 

 

(v) The resolution by the Neutral Accountant of the Unresolved Objections
shall be conclusive and binding upon the Seller and the Purchaser. The
Seller and the Purchaser agree that the procedure set forth in this Section
2.06(e) for resolving disputes with respect to the calculation of the Final
Closing Statement shall be the sole and exclusive method for resolving any
such disputes.

 

 

(vi) The Seller and the Purchaser shall share the fees and expenses of the
Neutral Accountant and any independent actuary engaged by the Neutral
Accountant in the ratio determined by such Neutral Accountant which ratio
shall reflect the inverse of the extent to which the relative position of the
Purchaser in the Initial Closing Statement and the Seller in the Notice of
Disagreement are reflected in the Final Closing Statement.

 

 

(f) The Initial Closing Statement shall be deemed to be the Final Closing
Statement and binding on the Purchaser and the Seller for the purposes of
this Section 2.06 upon the earliest of (x) the delivery by the Seller of the
Notice of Acceptance or the failure of the Seller to deliver the Notice of
Disagreement by the Objection Deadline Date pursuant to Section 2.06(d), (y)
the resolution of all disputes by the Seller and the Purchaser pursuant
to Section 2.06(e)(ii) and (z) the resolution of all disputes pursuant
to Section 2.06(e)(iv) by the Neutral Accountant. Within five Business Days
after the Final Closing Statement becomes or is deemed final and binding
on the parties hereto, a payment shall be made as follows:

 

 

(i) If the Purchase Price, calculated in accordance with Section 2.02(a),
using the amounts of Company Indebtedness and of Closing Working Capital as
shown on the Final Closing Statement, exceeds the Estimated Purchase Price
(such difference, the "Closing Underpayment"), the Purchaser shall deliver
to the Seller payment of an amount equal to such Closing Underpayment by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the Purchase Price Bank Account.

 

 

(ii) If the Purchase Price, calculated in accordance with Section 2.02(a),
using the amounts of Company Indebtedness and of Closing Working Capital as
shown on the Final Closing Statement, is less than the Estimated Purchase
Price (such difference, the "Closing Overpayment"), the Seller shall deliver
to the Purchaser payment of an amount equal to such Closing Overpayment by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account designated in
writing by Purchaser (such designation to be made at least three (3) Business
Days prior to such payment).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(g) Any payment required to be made by the Seller or the Purchaser pursuant
to this Section 2.06 shall bear interest from the Closing Date through the
date of payment at the interest rate per annum equal to the prime rate as
published in The Wall Street Journal on the Friday before the payment is to
be made.

 

 

(h) If the delivery deadline date for the Initial Closing Statement or the
Objection Deadline Date is a day that is not a Business Day, the applicable
delivery deadline date shall be the immediately following Business Day.

 

 

SECTION 2.07. Designated Purchaser. After the date of this Agreement but
not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Purchaser
may, upon prior written notice to the Seller, designate (a "Designation")
either one or more wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Purchaser, whether or not
existing as of the date hereof, as a "Designated Purchaser" hereunder (each
such Person, a "Designated Purchaser"). The Designation shall set forth:
(a) the name of the Designated Purchaser, (b) the jurisdiction of
organization of the Designated Purchaser, (c) the Company Shares or Holdco
Shares that the Designated Purchaser shall acquire at the Closing and (d) an
acknowledgment of the Designation by the Designated Purchaser in accordance
with the following sentence. Upon the Designation, each Designated Purchaser
shall be deemed a "Purchaser" for purposes of this Agreement in connection
with the acquisition of such Shares (and any reference to "Purchaser" herein
in connection therewith shall automatically be deemed to include reference to
such Designated Purchaser) and such Designated Purchaser shall automatically
be assigned the rights and obligations under this Agreement necessary in
connection with such Designation; provided, that following such Designation:
(i) the Purchaser shall be jointly and severally liable with each such
Designated Purchaser (on the one hand) to the Seller (on the other hand) for
all such rights and obligations so assigned to such Designated Purchaser and
(ii) the Purchaser shall cause each Designated Purchaser to appoint either
the Purchaser or another Designated Purchaser (or in the event there is only
one Designated Purchaser, such Designated Purchaser) as its agent in
connection with the exercise of its rights and remedies under this Agreement.
No such Designation shall relieve the Purchaser of its obligations hereunder.

binding and, to Seller's Knowledge, enforceable leasehold interest in the
Leased Real Property of which such Morton Entity is the lessee, sublessee or
licensee, free and clear of all Encumbrances, except Permitted Encumbrances,
and none of the Morton Entities have received written notice that they are in
breach of or default under any such lease, sublease or license, and, to

Property are in material compliance with all applicable building, zoning,
subdivision, health and safety, other land use and all other related Laws,
except where the failure or omission to so comply would not, individually or
in the aggregate, be material to the Morton Entities, taken as a whole, and,
to the Seller's Knowledge, the current use and occupancy of the Owned Real
Property and the Leased Real Property do not materially violate any such
Laws.

or other benefits (through insurance or otherwise) for any Person or any
dependent or beneficiary of any Person after such Person's retirement or
other termination of employment except as may be required by the Consolidated
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended, Section 4980B of the
Code, Title I Part 6 of ERISA, and any similar state group health plan
continuation law, together with all regulations promulgated thereunder.

 

 

(f) Each Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code or Section 401(k) of the Code has timely received a favorable
determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service covering all of the
provisions applicable to the Plan for which determination letters are
currently available that the Plan is so qualified and each trust established
in connection with any Plan which is intended to be exempt from federal
income taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code has received a determination
letter from the Internal Revenue Service that it is so exempt, and no fact or
event has occurred since the date of such determination letter or letters

collective bargaining agreement assumed by Purchaser at Closing, neither any
Morton Entity, the Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall incur, or could
reasonably be expected to incur, by operation of law or otherwise, any
liability with respect to, or in any way related to, any plan subject to
Title IV of ERISA (including without limitation, any multiemployer plan) or

SECTION 3.23. Mines. (a) Except as would not be material to the Morton
Entities taken as whole, (i) the Mines are all of the locations, at which,
the Morton Entities engage in the mining or extracting of Salt, or for which
the Morton Entities have the right to explore for and/or extract Salt, and
(ii) with respect to each of the Mines, the Morton Entities possess either
good and valid fee simple title or a valid leasehold interest, and a valid
mineral right to the Salt being mined or extracted, if required, free and
clear of any Encumbrance other than Permitted Encumbrances.

 

 

(b) The Morton Entities' current reserves of Salt will, assuming the due and
proper maintenance and upkeep by the owner or operator of the Mines in
accordance with sound industry practices, and barring future unforeseen
events beyond the control of Seller, provide sufficient sources of
recoverable Salt at current rates of extraction until at least the tenth
anniversary of the date of this Agreement at each such Mine. Except as would
not be material to the Morton Entities taken as whole, there are no
deficiencies in title to the Salt or to the interest that gives rise to the
right of the Morton Entities to mine the Salt with respect to that part of
the Mines upon or in which mining operations are conducted that would, in
each case, in accordance with their terms, prevent the Morton Entities from
continuing to mine the Mines as such mining is currently conducted.

 

 

(c) Each Morton Entity (i) possesses all material Permits necessary to carry
out its mining operations, (ii) is in compliance with such material Permits
and with Law, in all material respects, in respect of its mining operations
and (iii) none of the Morton Entities have received any notice of proceedings
relating to the revocation or modification of any such Permits or has
received notice of the revocation or cancellation of, or any intention to
revoke or cancel, any of the material contracts relating to the Mines, nor,
to the Seller's Knowledge, are any such proceedings, revocations,
modifications, or any cancellations threatened.

 

 

(d) There are no material property payments, royalties, fees or monies
payable or required to be paid to any Person, other than material amounts
payable that have arisen since the Reference Balance Sheet Date in the
ordinary and usual course of business with regard to the Mines and there are
no outstanding contracts relating to or options to acquire any part of, or
all of, any of the Mines.

Affiliates.

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

 

 

SECTION 5.01. Conduct of Business Prior to the Closing. The Seller
covenants and agrees that, except as described in Section 5.01 of the
Disclosure Schedule or contemplated, permitted or required by this Agreement,
between the date of this Agreement and the Closing, the Seller: (i) shall
cause each Morton Entity to conduct its business in the ordinary course and
in all material respects in a manner consistent with past practice, and (ii)
shall use its reasonable best efforts to preserve intact in all material
respects the business organization, rights, franchises and goodwill of each
Morton Entity, and the relationships between each Morton Entity and
its employees, customers, lenders, suppliers, regulators and others having
business relationships with such Morton Entity. Except as described
in Section 5.01 of the Disclosure Schedule or as expressly permitted
or required by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, the Seller
covenants and agrees that no Morton Entity shall, between the date of this
Agreement and the Closing, without the prior written consent of the
Purchaser:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

35  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(a) issue, sell, transfer or create any Encumbrance (that will not be removed
prior to Closing) over or amend the terms of any capital stock, notes, bonds
or other securities of any Morton Entity (or any option, warrant or other
right to acquire the same) or redeem or repurchase any of the capital stock
of any Morton Entity;

 

 

(b) amend or restate the certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or similar
organizational documents) of any Morton Entity;

 

 

(c) grant or announce any increase in the salaries, bonuses or other benefits

into any material new (or materially amend any existing) employment,
retention, severance or other agreement or arrangement with any director,
officer, employee, agent or consultant of any Morton Entity;

 

 

(e) other than in the ordinary course of business (including preparation of
Tax Returns) or as not inconsistent with past practice from time to time,
make, revoke or change any material Tax election, method of tax accounting or
reporting where applicable law permits a choice between two or more
alternative methods, file any amended return, or settle or compromise any
material Tax liability, if such action would reasonably be expected to cause
Tax to be materially lower for a taxable period or portion thereof ending on
or prior to the Closing Date and correspondingly higher for a period ending
after the Closing Date; provided, however, that nothing herein shall preclude
the Seller and its Affiliates from claiming a deduction for any depreciation,
amortization, depletion or similar amount and, provided, further, that
the Seller must also provide written notice of its intent to settle or
compromise any Tax liability of more than $2,500,000 or make any Tax election
affecting Tax liability in any year by more than $2,500,000. For purposes of
this Section 5.01(e), an item of Tax will be considered to be materially

amend in any material respect any existing Plan covering Morton Employees
except for amendments required by Law (following notice to the Purchaser);

 

 

(g) change any method of accounting or accounting practice or policy used by
any of the Morton Entities, other than (following notice to the Purchaser)
such changes as are required by GAAP or a Governmental Authority or as are
necessary to conform with the accounting practice or policy used by the Dow
Consolidated Group (it being understood that any such change shall not affect
the basis of preparation of the Initial Closing Statement or the Final
Closing Statement);

 

 

(h) fail to exercise any rights of renewal with respect to any Leased Real
Property that by its terms would otherwise expire;

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

36  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(i) compromise or settle any Action (A) resulting in an obligation of any
Morton Entity to pay more than $1,000,000 in respect of compromising or
settling such Action, (B) in respect of any claim of any Morton Entity to
receive any payment of more than $1,000,000 in respect of settling any such
Action or (C) that is otherwise material to the conduct of the business of
the Morton Entities taken as a whole;

 

 

(j) acquire (by merger or stock or asset purchase or otherwise) any
corporation, partnership, other business organization or any business or
division thereof;

 

 

(k) incur, create, assume or otherwise become liable for any Indebtedness, or

any Liability of any Person, except for any Indebtedness, guarantee or
responsibility that will be repaid, cancelled or discharged in full prior to
the open of business on the Closing Date;

 

 

(l) factor any accounts receivable in any material amounts, other than on
commercial terms and in the ordinary course of business;

 

 

(m) enter into, renew, extend, materially amend, fail to renew, cancel or
terminate any Material Contract or agreement which if entered into prior to
the date hereof would be a Material Contract, other than customer or supplier
contracts in the ordinary course of business;

 

 

(n) abandon, assign or grant any security interest in any material Owned
Intellectual Property, other than in the ordinary course of business; or

 

 

(o) agree to take any of the actions specified in Sections 5.01(a)-(n).

 

 

The Seller further covenants and agrees that between the date of this
Agreement and Closing it shall procure that each Morton Entity shall make
capital expenditures and investments in the ordinary course of business.

 

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, subject to
compliance with applicable Law and contractual obligations, the Morton
Entities shall be permitted to declare and pay any dividends or make
distributions or cash transfers (including in connection with any "cash
sweep" arrangements with the Seller or its Affiliates) prior to the Closing
Date. The Seller agrees to procure that the Company and the Subsidiaries
shall have at Closing an aggregate balance of cash and cash equivalents of
not less than $5,000,000 and not greater than $25,000,000. The Seller agrees
to procure that Morton Bahamas Limited and Inagua General Store Ltd. shall
have at Closing an aggregate balance of cash and cash equivalents equal to
zero.

 

 

SECTION 5.02. Access to Information and Employees. (a) From the date of
this Agreement until the Closing, upon reasonable notice, the Seller shall,
and shall cause each Morton Entity and each of their respective
officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, accountants and
counsel to (i) afford the Purchaser and its officers, employees and
authorized agents and representatives reasonable access to, and the right to
inspect, the offices, properties

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

37  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and books and records, contracts and other documents and data of each Morton
Entity and reasonable access to the employees of each Morton Entity, and (ii)
furnish to the Purchaser and its officers, employees and authorized agents
and representatives such additional financial and operating data and
other information regarding the Morton Entities (or copies thereof) as the
Purchaser may from time to time reasonably request; provided, however, that
any such access or furnishing of information shall be conducted at the
Purchaser's expense, during normal business hours, under the supervision of
the Seller's personnel and in such a manner as not to unreasonably interfere
with the normal operations of the Morton Entities. The access referenced in
the immediately preceding sentence shall include access to conduct
environmental site assessments of any Owned Real Property and, subject to the
rights of any landlord, any real property leased, subleased, used or occupied
by any Morton Entity; provided, however, that the Purchaser shall not
conduct any sampling and analysis of any environmental media or building
material without the consent of the Seller, such consent to be withheld at
the absolute discretion of the Seller. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the Seller shall not be required to disclose any
information to the Purchaser if, after consultation with its counsel, the
Seller determines in good faith that such disclosure would (i) cause
significant competitive harm to the Morton Entities if the transactions
contemplated hereby are not consummated, (ii) jeopardize any attorney-client
or other legal privilege or (iii) contravene any applicable Laws, fiduciary
duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement.
When accessing any of Seller's properties, Purchaser and its officers,
employees and authorized agents and representatives shall comply with all of
Seller's safety and security requirements for the applicable property. No
investigation by the Purchaser or information made available by the Purchaser
(whether before or after the date hereof) shall operate as a waiver or
otherwise affect any of its rights under this Agreement, including pursuant
to Articles VIII, IX and X hereof, or any representation, warranty or
agreement of the Seller in this Agreement nor shall any such investigation or
information be deemed to amend or supplement the Disclosure Schedule.

 

 

(b) In order to facilitate the resolution of any claims made against or
incurred by the Seller or its Affiliates relating to the Morton Entities,
Holdco or the JV Entities and for purposes of compliance by the Seller and
its Affiliates with securities, environmental, employment and other Laws,
until the later of the seventh anniversary of the Closing or the expiration
of the relevant period for the statutes of limitations (including any
extensions thereof), the Purchaser shall (i) retain the books and records
relating to the Morton Entities, Holdco and the JV Entities for periods prior
to the Closing, and (ii) upon reasonable notice, at the Seller\'s expense,
afford the officers, employees, agents and representatives of the Seller
reasonable access (including the right to make, at the Seller's expense,
copies), during normal business hours, to such books and records; provided,
that any such access or furnishing of information shall be conducted in such
a manner as not to unreasonably interfere with the normal operations of the
Morton Entities.

 

 

(c) In order to facilitate the resolution of any claims made against or
incurred by the Purchaser or any Morton Entity, Holdco or the JV Entities
relating to any Morton Entity, Holdco or JV Entity and for purposes of
compliance with securities, environmental, employment and other Laws, until
the later of the seventh anniversary of the Closing or the expiration of the
relevant period for the statutes of limitations (including any extensions
thereof), the Seller shall (i) retain the books and records relating to the
Morton Entities, Holdco and the JV Entities, relating to periods prior to the
Closing which shall not otherwise have been delivered to the

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

38  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Purchaser and (ii) upon reasonable notice, at the Purchaser\'s expense,
afford the officers, employees, agents and representatives of the Purchaser
reasonable access (including the right to make, at the Purchaser's expense,
copies), during normal business hours, to such books and records; provided,
that any such access or furnishing of information shall be conducted in such
a manner as not to unreasonably interfere with the normal operations of the
Morton Entities.

 

 

SECTION 5.03. Confidentiality. (a) The terms of the letter agreement, dated
as of March 18, 2009 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), between the Seller
and Purchaser are hereby incorporated herein by reference and shall continue
in full force and effect until the Closing and shall survive the Closing and
remain in full force and effect until their expiration in accordance with the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement; provided, however, that upon the
Closing, the confidentiality obligations contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate in respect of that portion of the
Information (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) exclusively
relating to the Morton Entities, Holdco and any JV Entity, and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If this Agreement is, for any
reason, terminated prior to the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall
nonetheless continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

 

 

(b) Nothing made available to the Purchaser pursuant to Section 5.02(a) shall
in any way amend or diminish the Purchaser's obligations under the
Confidentiality Agreement. The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that any
Information made available to the Purchaser pursuant to Section 5.02(a) or
otherwise by any of the Seller, the Morton Entities or any officer, director,
employee, agent, representative, accountant or counsel thereof shall be
subject to the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

 

(c) From and after Closing, the Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
to, hold, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its or their
representatives to hold, in confidence any and all information, whether
written or oral, concerning the Morton Entities except to the extent that
such information (i) is generally available to and known by the public
through no fault of the Seller, or any of its Affiliates or their respective
representatives, or (ii) is lawfully acquired by the Seller, any of its
Affiliates or their respective representatives from and after Closing from
sources other than the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, and any Morton
Entity which, to the knowledge of the Seller, are not prohibited from
disclosing such information by a legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation.
If the Seller or any of its Affiliates or their respective representatives
are compelled to disclose any information by judicial or administrative
process or by other requirements of Law, the Seller shall promptly notify the
Purchaser in writing, and in so far as is practicable, consult with the
Purchaser regarding the disclosure of such information, and shall disclose
only that portion of such information which the Seller is advised by its
counsel is legally required to be disclosed; provided, that the Seller shall
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any appropriate protective order or
other reasonable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded
such information.

 

 

SECTION 5.04. Regulatory and Other Authorizations; Notices and Consents.
 (a) The Purchaser shall (i) promptly obtain all authorizations, consents,
orders and approvals of all Governmental Authorities and officials that may
be or become necessary for its execution and delivery of, and the performance
of its obligations pursuant to, this Agreement, (ii) cooperate fully with
the Seller in promptly seeking to obtain all such authorizations, consents,
orders and

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

39  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approvals and (iii) provide such other information to any Governmental
Authority as such Governmental Authority may reasonably request in
connection herewith. Each party hereto agrees to make promptly (but in no
event later than five Business Days after the date of this Agreement) its
respective filing, if necessary, pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to supply as promptly as
practicable to the appropriate Governmental Authorities any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the
HSR Act. Each party hereto agrees to make as promptly as practicable (but in
no event later than ten Business Days after the date of this Agreement) its
respective filings and notifications, if any, under any other applicable
antitrust, competition, or trade regulation Law and to supply as promptly as
practicable to the appropriate Governmental Authorities any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the
applicable antitrust, competition, or trade regulation Law. The Purchaser
will pay all fees or make other payments to any Governmental Authority in
order to obtain any such authorizations, consents, orders or approvals.

 

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of the Purchaser's undertaking pursuant
to Section 5.04(a), the Purchaser agrees to use its best efforts and to
take any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment under any antitrust, competition or trade regulation Law that may
be asserted by any antitrust or competition Governmental Authority or any
other party so as to enable the parties hereto to close the transactions
contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable, and in any event prior to the
Termination Date, including proposing, negotiating, committing to and
effecting, by consent decree, hold separate orders, or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture or disposition of such of its assets, properties or businesses or
of the assets, properties or businesses to be acquired by it pursuant hereto
(a "Divestiture Action"), and the entrance into such other arrangements, as
are necessary or advisable in order to avoid the entry of, and the
commencement of litigation seeking the entry of, or to effect the dissolution
of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or
proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of preventing the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or of delaying such
consummation until after the Termination Date. In addition, the Purchaser
shall defend through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in court by
any party in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any
decree, order or judgment (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that
would prevent the Closing prior to the Termination Date; provided, however,
that such litigation in no way limits the obligation of the Purchaser to use
its best efforts, and to take any and all steps necessary to eliminate each
and every impediment under any antitrust, competition or trade regulation Law
to close the transactions contemplated hereby prior to the Termination Date.

 

 

(c) The Purchaser shall be entitled to direct the antitrust defense of the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement in any investigation or litigation
by, or negotiations with, any Governmental Authority or other Person relating
to the Agreement or regulatory filings under any applicable antitrust,
competition, or trade regulation Law, including any communications with any
Governmental Authority relating to any contemplated or proposed
Divestiture Action. Without limiting the foregoing and subject to
applicable legal limitations and the instructions of any Governmental
Authority, each party to this Agreement shall promptly notify the other party
hereto of any communication it or any of its Affiliates receives from any
Governmental Authority relating to the matters that are the subject of this
Agreement and permit the other party to review in advance any proposed
communication by such party to any

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Governmental Authority. Neither of the parties to this Agreement shall agree
to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Authority in respect of
any filings, investigation (including any settlement of the
investigation), litigation or other inquiry unless it consults with the other
party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority,
gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate at such
meeting. The parties to this Agreement will coordinate and cooperate fully
with each other in exchanging such information and providing such assistance
as the other party may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing
and in seeking early termination of any applicable waiting periods, including
under the HSR Act. The parties to this Agreement will provide each other
with copies of all correspondence, filings or communications between them or
any of their representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority
or members of its staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however,
that materials may be redacted (x) to remove references concerning the
valuation of the Morton Entities, (y) as necessary to comply with
contractual arrangements, and (z) as necessary to address reasonable
attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality concerns. Without
limiting the parties' mutual obligations in this Section 5.04, the Seller and
its counsel shall not communicate with any Governmental Authority regarding
Purchaser's obligations under Section 5.04(b) or regarding any proposed or
possible divestitures or any other settlement by the Purchaser with the
Governmental Authority in connection with the HSR Act or the Competition Act.

 

 

(d) The Purchaser shall not enter into any transaction, or any agreement to
effect any transaction (including any merger or acquisition) that might
reasonably be expected to make it more difficult, or to increase the time
required, to (i) obtain the expiration or termination of the waiting period
under the HSR Act, or any other applicable antitrust, competition, or trade
regulation Law, applicable to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) avoid the entry of, the commencement of litigation seeking
the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary
restraining order or other order that would materially delay or prevent the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or (iii) obtain all
authorizations, consents, orders and approvals of Governmental Authorities
necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

 

(e) From the date of this Agreement until Closing, the Seller shall as
promptly as reasonably practicable notify the Purchaser in writing of: (i)
any notice from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may
be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; or (ii) any Action commenced or, to the Seller's Knowledge,
threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting the
Seller or the Morton Entities that, if pending on the date of this Agreement,
would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to Section 3.09 or
that relates to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

 

(f) The Purchaser's receipt of information pursuant to this Section 5.04
shall not operate as a waiver or otherwise affect any right of the Purchaser
under this Agreement, including pursuant to Articles VIII, IX and X hereof,
or any representation, warranty or agreement of the Seller in this Agreement
and shall not be deemed to amend or supplement the Disclosure Schedule.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

41  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

SECTION 5.05. Transition Services. From and after Closing, the Seller (or
one or more of its Affiliates) shall provide to the Purchaser transition
services reasonably requested by the Purchaser. The scope of such transition
services shall be consistent with the services currently provided by the
Seller to the Morton Entities. The term of the transition services shall be
based on a reasonable amount of time that will be necessary for the Morton
Entities to make arrangements for such services with third parties or with
the Purchaser or its Affiliates, but shall not exceed 12 months. The fees for
the provision of each transition service shall be equal to the internal cost
of the Seller in providing such service. Without prejudice to the
foregoing, prior to the Closing Date, the parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith an agreement setting out the detailed scope and term of such
transition services (the "Transition Services Agreement").

 

 

SECTION 5.06. Insurance. From and after Closing, the Morton Entities shall
cease to be insured by the Seller's or its Affiliates' insurance policies or
by any of their self-insured programs, other than by any third party
insurance policies acquired directly by and in the name of any Morton Entity
or self-insurance programs of the Morton Entities directly. The Seller shall
provide, at the sole cost and expense of Purchaser, such assistance as the
Purchaser may reasonably request between the date of this Agreement and
Closing to assist the Purchaser in obtaining insurance policies and programs
with respect to the Morton Entities (or any Purchaser Reorganization
Transferee) at Closing. Prior to Closing, the Seller shall cause the third
party insurance policies (and/or the rights to coverage thereunder) of the
Morton Entities solely relating to the Non-Business Assets or Non-Business
Liabilities or Pre-Closing Environmental Liabilities to the extent not
relating to the Business (the "Non-Business Insurance") to be transferred,
conveyed or otherwise assigned to the Seller or one or more of its Affiliates
to the extent practicable. With respect to events or circumstances relating
to the Morton Entities (i) that are covered by such Non-Business Insurance,
the Morton Entities and any Purchaser Reorganization Transferee may, during
the period from Closing until the last day for exercise of the Post-Closing
Legal Entity Transfer Right (the "MII Transfer End Date"), cause the Seller
to make claims (on behalf, and for the benefit, of the Purchaser) under such
Non-Business Insurance to the extent such coverage and limits are available
under such Non-Business Insurance and to the extent such claims are not
covered by insurance policies or self-insurance programs of any of the Morton
Entities and (ii) that existed prior to the Closing Date that are covered by
the Seller's or its Affiliates' occurrence based third party liability
insurance policies (the "Occurrence Policies"), the Morton Entities may,
during the period described in (i) above, make claims under such policies;
provided, in each case however, that by making any such claims, the Purchaser
agrees to reimburse, or cause the Morton Entities to reimburse, the Seller
and its Affiliates for any increased insurance costs incurred by the Seller
or any of its Affiliates as a result of such claims, including any premium
adjustments associated with such policies, as such amounts are determined in
accordance with those policies and programs generally applicable from time to
time to the Seller and its Affiliates; and provided, further, that the
Purchaser or the Morton Entities shall bear (and the Seller and
its Affiliates shall have no obligation to repay or reimburse the Purchaser
or the Morton Entities for) a proportionate amount of any "deductibles"
associated with claims under such policies. As of the MII Transfer End Date,
the Purchaser and the Morton Entities shall no longer be permitted to make
any claims under such Non-Business Insurance or under the
Occurrence Policies. For the avoidance of doubt, the Seller and its
Affiliates shall retain all rights to control its insurance policies and
programs, including the right to exhaust, release, commute, buy-back or
otherwise remove its insurance policies and programs, and to settle or
otherwise resolve any disputes (provided any

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

42  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

such settlement or resolution is reasonable with respect to any claim by
the Purchaser) notwithstanding whether any such policies or programs apply to
any Liabilities of the Purchaser. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, neither the Morton Entities nor the Purchaser shall make
any claims under any other insurance policies (including any claims-
based insurance policies) or any other self-insured programs of the Seller or
its Affiliates.

 

 

SECTION 5.07. Privileged Matters. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree
that the legal advice or services that have been or will be provided prior to
the Closing Date for the benefit of both (a) the Seller and its Affiliates
(other than the Morton Entities and Holdco) and (b) the Morton Entities and
Holdco shall be subject to a shared privilege between the Seller and its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Morton Entities and Holdco, on the other
hand, and the Seller and its Affiliates, and the Morton Entities and Holdco
shall have equal right to assert all such shared privileges in connection
with privileged information under any applicable Law and no such shared
privilege may be waived by (i) any of the Seller or its Affiliates without
the prior written consent of the Purchaser or (ii) by any of the Morton
Entities, Holdco or the Purchaser without the prior written consent of the
Seller, except as may be required or permitted by Law; provided, however, that
any legal advice or services provided, whether before or after the Closing
Date, with respect to any matter for which the Indemnifying Party agrees in
writing that, with respect to such matters, it has an indemnification
obligation hereunder, shall be subject to the sole and separate privilege of
the Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to
control the assertion or waiver of all such separate privileges under any
applicable Law in connection with any privileged information, whether or not
such information is in the possession of or under the control of any of the
Indemnified Parties.

 

 

SECTION 5.08. Further Action. From time to time after the Closing, without
additional consideration, each party hereto will (or, if appropriate, will
cause its Affiliates to) execute and deliver such further instruments and
take such other action as may be reasonably requested by the other party to
make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements and, without prejudice to the foregoing, enter into good
faith discussions with respect thereto. The Seller shall provide and shall
cause the Morton Entities to provide, at the sole cost and expense of
Purchaser, such assistance as the Purchaser may reasonably request between
the date of this Agreement and Closing to assist the Purchaser in replacing
any outstanding Indebtedness (other than the Credit Sensitive Debentures) or
letters of credit of the Morton Entities. Without limiting the foregoing,
upon reasonable request of the Purchaser, the Seller shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates to, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such further
assurances, deeds, assignments, consequences, powers of attorney and other
instruments and papers as may be required to sell, transfer, assign, convey
and deliver to the Purchaser, the Morton Entities or any Purchaser
Reorganization Transferee, all right, title and interest in and to the Shares
and to assets, rights and properties of the Business. In addition, if any of
the Seller and its Affiliates (on the one hand), and the Purchaser and its
Affiliates (on the other hand) shall, following the Closing, have in their
possession any property, asset or right, which under this Agreement should be
in the possession of the other, such Person shall promptly deliver such
property, asset or right as contemplated by this Agreement to such party.

 

 

SECTION 5.09. Intercompany Obligations; Third Party Assurances. (a)
Except with respect to the arrangements contemplated by the Ancillary
Agreements, all obligations or agreements between the Morton Entities and
Holdco, on the one hand, and the Seller and its

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

43  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Affiliates (other than the Morton Entities and Holdco), on the other hand,
and, subject to receipt of notice from the Purchaser within 30 days of the
date hereof, any long-term Indebtedness in the amount of at least $25,000,000
owed between any two Morton Entities or between any Morton Entity and Holdco,
shall, at the Seller's discretion after reasonable consultation with the
Purchaser be either terminated, repaid, capitalized or cancelled, as
applicable, prior to the open of business on the Closing Date, such that at
Closing no such obligations or agreements are outstanding.

 

 

(b) The Seller shall use its reasonable efforts to ensure that as soon as
reasonably practicable after Closing, each Morton Entity, Holdco and each JV
Entity are released from all Third Party Assurances (including those listed
in Section 5.09(b) of the Disclosure Schedule) given by such Morton Entity or
Holdco or such JV Entity in respect of obligations of the Seller or any of
its Affiliates. Pending release of any such Third Party Assurance,
the Seller shall indemnify the Purchaser and each of its Affiliates against
any and all Losses arising after Closing under or by reason of any such Third
Party Assurance.

 

 

(c) Except with respect to the Credit Sensitive Debentures, the Purchaser
shall use its reasonable efforts to ensure that as soon as reasonably
practicable after Closing, the Seller and any of the Seller\'s Affiliates are
released from all Third Party Assurances given by the Seller or any Affiliate
of the Seller in respect of obligations of any Morton Entity and listed in
Section 5.09(c) of the Disclosure Schedule and such other Third Party
Assurances disclosed to the Purchaser prior to Closing, to the extent such
Third Party Assurances are not material. Pending release of any such Third
Party Assurance, the Purchaser shall indemnify the Seller or such Affiliate
of the Seller against any and all Losses arising after Closing under or by
reason of any such Third Party Assurance.

 

 

(d) The Seller shall at Closing on behalf of itself and each of its
Affiliates (other than the Morton Entities, Holdco and the JV Entities)
irrevocably waive any right of subrogation, contribution or reimbursement or
any claim against the Morton Entities, Holdco or the JV Entities in respect
of any guarantee, indemnity or undertaking by the Seller or any such
Affiliate in respect of any Indebtedness of or for the benefit of any Morton
Entity, Holdco or any JV Entity. The Seller shall and shall cause each of its
Affiliates (other than the Morton Entities, Holdco and JV Entities) to
execute any release, termination statement or waiver reasonably requested by
the Purchaser to give effect to the foregoing.

 

 

SECTION 5.10. Seller Reorganization. Prior to Closing, (i) the Seller shall
sell, assign, transfer, convey and deliver all of the Non-Business Assets,
(including the assets listed on Section 5.10 of the Disclosure Schedule and
described as the "Retained Real Property"), to a controlled Affiliate of the
Seller that upon Closing shall not be a Morton Entity, Holdco or any JV
Entity (the "Seller Reorganization Transferee") and (ii) the Seller shall
cause the Seller Reorganization Transferee to assume and agree to pay,
perform and discharge all of the Non-Business Liabilities and Pre-Closing
Environmental Liabilities to the extent they are not related to the Business
and, to the maximum extent allowable by Law, the Company shall be released
from any Liability with respect thereto (the "Seller Reorganization"). Prior
to effecting such Seller Reorganization, the Seller shall, giving reasonable
notice, consult with the Purchaser with respect to the steps and
documentation for such Seller Reorganization. Prior to Closing, the Seller
and the Purchaser agree to mutually cooperate to subdivide the Weeks Island,
Louisiana,

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

44  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property (as described on Schedule 5.10 of the Disclosure Schedule) so as
to separate the Non-Business Assets from the Business and if such subdivision
is legally impossible or economically unfeasible, the parties will
thereafter negotiate in good faith so as to cause a division of the Weeks
Island property in a manner that will preserve and protect the Seller's
interest in the Non-Business Assets and the Purchaser's interest in the
remaining Weeks Island property. The Seller shall procure that no Morton
Entity nor Holdco shall provide or agree to any representation, warranty,
covenant or other agreement with respect to the Seller Reorganization or
incur any Liability with respect thereto other than any obligation of such
Person to sell, assign, transfer, convey and deliver all of the Non-Business
Assets.

 

 

SECTION 5.11. Retained Names and Marks. (a) The Purchaser hereby
acknowledges that all right, title and interest in and to the "ROHM AND HAAS"
name, together with all variations and acronyms thereof and all trademarks,
service marks, Internet domain names, trade names, trade dress, company names
and other identifiers of source or goodwill to the extent containing or
incorporating any of the foregoing (the "Retained Names and Marks") are owned
exclusively by the Seller, and that, except as expressly provided below, any
and all right of the Morton Entities, Holdco and each JV Entity to use the
Retained Names and Marks shall terminate as of the Closing and shall
immediately revert to the Seller, along with any and all goodwill associated
therewith. The Purchaser further acknowledges that it has no rights, and is
not acquiring any rights, to use the Retained Names and Marks, except as
expressly provided herein.

 

 

(b) The Purchaser shall, as soon as practicable after the Closing, but in no
event later than ten (10) Business Days thereafter, cause Holdco to submit to
appropriate Governmental Authorities amended articles of incorporation (or
similar organizational documents) changing its corporate name, "doing
business as" name, trade name and any other similar corporate identifier to a
corporate name, "doing business as" name, trade name or any other similar
corporate identifier that does not contain any Retained Names and Marks, and
to supply promptly any additional information, documents and materials that
may be requested by the Seller with respect to such submissions and the
Seller shall provide such reasonable assistance to the Purchaser as the
Purchaser shall request in connection therewith.

 

 

(c) Each of the Morton Entities, Holdco and each JV Entity shall, for a
period of 90 calendar days after the date of the Closing, with respect to (i)
below and until March 31, 2010, with respect to (ii) below, be entitled to
use, solely in connection with the operation of the Business as operated
immediately prior to the Closing, all of (i) its existing signage and stocks
of signs, letterheads, invoice stock, advertisements and promotional
materials, and other documents and materials ("Existing Stock") and (ii)
inventory, in each case, containing the Retained Names and Marks, after which
periods the Purchaser shall cause each such entity to remove or obliterate
all Retained Names and Marks from such Existing Stock or cease using such
Existing Stock.

 

 

(d) Except as expressly provided in this Section 5.11, no other right to use
the Retained Names and Marks is granted by the Seller to the Purchaser or its
Affiliates (including, for purposes of this Section 5.11, the Morton
Entities, Holdco and each JV Entity), whether by implication or otherwise,
and nothing hereunder permits the Purchaser or its Affiliates to use the
Retained Names and Marks in any manner other than in connection with Existing
Stock. The Purchaser shall ensure that all its uses of the Retained Names and
Marks as provided in this

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

45  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 5.11 shall be only with respect to goods and services of a level of
quality equal to or greater than the quality of goods and services with
respect to which the Retained Names and Marks were used in the Business prior
to the Closing. Any and all goodwill generated by the use of the
Retained Names and Marks under this Section 5.11 shall inure solely to the
benefit of the Seller. In no event shall the Purchaser or its Affiliates use
the Retained Names and Marks in any manner that may damage or tarnish the
reputation of the Seller or the goodwill associated with the Retained Names
and Marks.

 

 

(e) The Purchaser agrees that the Seller shall have no responsibility for
claims by third parties arising out of, or relating to, the use by Purchaser
or its Affiliates of any Retained Names and Marks after the Closing.
In addition to any and all other available remedies, the Purchaser shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Seller and its Affiliates, and their
officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns, from and
against any and all such claims that may arise out of the use of the Retained
Names and Marks by the Purchaser or its Affiliates (i) in accordance with the
terms and conditions of this Section 5.11, other than such claims that the
Retained Names and Marks infringe the Intellectual Property rights of any
third party, or (ii) in violation of or outside the scope permitted by this
Section 5.11. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
the Purchaser hereby acknowledges that in the event of any breach or
threatened breach of this Section 5.11, the Seller, in addition to any other
remedies available to it, shall be entitled to a preliminary injunction,
temporary restraining order or other equivalent relief restraining the
Purchaser and any of its Affiliates from any such breach or threatened
breach.

 

 

SECTION 5.12. Credit Sensitive Debentures. From and after Closing, the
Seller shall pay, on behalf of the Company (for purposes of this Section
5.12, as defined in Section 5.12 of the Disclosure Schedule), to the
indenture trustee of the Credit Sensitive Debentures, or directly to
the holders thereof to the extent provided in the Credit Sensitive
Debentures, any and all amounts due to the indenture trustee and to the
holders thereof (whether principal, interest (including accrued and unpaid
interest at Closing) or, subject to the penultimate paragraph of Section 5.12
of the Disclosure Schedule, other amounts provided for in the Credit
Sensitive Debentures when such amounts are due and payable), not later than
three (3) Business Days prior to such amounts being due and payable to the
indenture trustee or holders of the Credit Sensitive Debentures, as the case
may be. The Seller shall enter into a note in favor of the Company prior to
the Closing (the "Replacement Note") which shall reflect the covenants in the
prior sentence, contain the terms and conditions set forth in Section 5.12 of
the Disclosure Schedule and contain such other terms and conditions as the
parties reasonably agree..

 

 

SECTION 5.13. Non-Solicitation. The Seller shall procure that neither it nor
any of its Affiliates shall (whether alone, jointly with another, directly or
indirectly), for two (2) years after the Closing Date, offer to employ or to
solicit any managerial employee of the Morton Entities (each, a "Relevant
Purchaser Employee"); provided, that the foregoing provisions shall not
operate to prevent the Seller or any of its Affiliates from employing: (A)
any Relevant Purchaser Employee who makes initial contact with the Seller or
such Affiliate or who responds to an advertisement for employment that is
placed by or on behalf of the Seller or any such Affiliate in a medium of
general circulation, or any Relevant Purchaser Employee who is recruited
through an employment agency; provided, that in each case such advertisement
or recruitment is not specifically targeted at such Relevant Purchaser
Employee, or (B) any

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

46  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Person (including any Relevant Purchaser Employee) whose employment has been
terminated by the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the Morton
Entities), prior to such offer of employment.

 

 

SECTION 5.14. Transaction Fees and Expenses. The Seller shall cause the
Morton Entities to pay in full, prior to the Closing, any (i) transaction
costs to third parties incurred by the Morton Entities in the course of the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) sale or other bonuses,
retention or severance payments or any other kind of monetary awards
or amounts resulting from the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including but not limited to any sale bonus to Greenbrier
Consulting Group, LLC pursuant to that certain Consulting Agreement by and
among the Seller, Greenbrier Consulting Group, LLC and Wes Clark, dated
August 1, 2008).

 

 

SECTION 5.15. 2008 Company Financial Statements. On or prior to the date
that falls seven Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Seller shall
deliver to the Purchaser the 2008 Company Financial Statements.

 

 

SECTION 5.16. MII Legal Entity Agreement. On or prior to the Closing Date,
the Purchaser and the Seller shall enter into an agreement in the form of
Exhibit 5.16 (the "MII Legal Entity Agreement").

 

 

SECTION 5.17. Canadian Filing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, Purchaser agrees to timely file an accurate and complete CRA Form
T2062CE (and a comparable form for provincial income tax purposes) under
subsection 116(5.02) of the Income Tax Act (Canada) (and the corresponding
provision of nay Canadian provincial statute) with respect to the purchase of
the Company Shares and the Seller agrees to certify and sign any such form as
appropriate (and, otherwise provide the Purchaser with such assistance and
co-operation as is necessary in that regard).

 

 

ARTICLE VI

 

 

EMPLOYEE MATTERS

 

 

SECTION 6.01. Terms of Employment. For a period of two years following the
Closing Date, the Purchaser shall provide, or shall cause its Affiliates to
provide, each Morton Employee who was in active employment status (including
Morton Employees who are on authorized leave of absence, short-term
disability, workers' compensation leave or vacation leave) as of the Closing
Date, and Morton Employees who are on long-term disability on the Closing
Date upon their return to work (each such individual, an "Active
Morton Employee") with (a) at least the same salary or wage level and the
same bonus opportunity as in effect immediately prior to the Closing, (b)
severance benefits (for Active Morton Employees who terminate after Closing)
in accordance with the severance practice of the Seller and its Affiliates as
in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date and (c) employee benefit
plans and arrangements that are not less favorable in the aggregate than
those that are in effect immediately prior to the Closing. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Purchaser shall not be obligated to provide
comparable compensation or benefits under the provisions of any individual
employment agreement or arrangement, consulting, severance (other than as
required by

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

47  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) above), change in control, retention or sale bonus agreement. Nothing in
this Section 6.01 shall be construed in any way to relieve the Purchaser or
the Morton Entities from their respective obligations under the terms of
the Transferred Plans, whether before, during or after the two-year period
described in this Section 6.01. In addition, nothing contained in
this Agreement shall confer upon any Morton Employee any right to
continued employment with Purchaser or its Affiliates, nor shall anything
herein interfere with the right of Purchaser or its Affiliates to relocate or
terminate the employment of any of the Morton Employees at any time after the
Closing Date.

 

 

SECTION 6.02. Employee Benefits. (a) As of the Closing, each Active Morton
Employee shall cease to be an active participant under the Plans (other than
the Transferred Plans), and each Active Morton Employee shall be entitled to
participate in the employee benefit plans and arrangements maintained by the
Purchaser and its Affiliates, subject to applicable Law and the terms of such
plans and arrangements. Each Active Morton Employee shall receive credit for
service with the Seller, the Morton Entities and their Affiliates and
predecessors under such employee benefit plans and arrangements of the
Purchaser and its Affiliates for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit
accrual (other than benefit accrual under any pension or retirement plan that
is not a Transferred Plan); provided, however, that in no event shall such
credit result in the duplication of benefits or the funding thereof. In
addition, the Purchaser shall waive, or shall cause to be waived, any
limitations as to pre-existing conditions, evidence of
insurability, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation
and coverage requirements for such Active Morton Employees under such plans
(to the extent that such conditions, evidence of insurability, exclusions and
waiting periods had been satisfied or waived under the Plans as of the
Closing Date) and shall credit such Active Morton Employees for co-payments
and deductibles paid on or prior to the Closing Date during the year in which
the Closing Date occurs in satisfying any deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements.

 

 

(b) The Purchaser shall assume from the Seller and shall be responsible for,
and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller and its Affiliates against
the actual cost of all hospital, medical, dental, vision, workers'
compensation, unemployment compensation and other welfare expenses and
benefits for Active Morton Employees, including, if applicable, continuation
coverage provided under Section 4980B(f) of the Code (COBRA) with respect to
claims incurred by Active Morton Employees or their covered dependents on and
after the Closing Date. For purposes of this Section 6.02(b), claims for
services will be incurred on each date the service giving rise to the claim
is performed and claims for workers' compensation will be incurred on each
date the claim is paid.

 

 

(c) The Purchaser shall assume, or shall cause its Affiliates to assume, the
liability of the Seller for the provision of retiree health and welfare
benefits, in accordance with the eligibility provisions of the relevant Plans
of the Seller as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date, to (i) all
Morton Employees employed at Morton Entities outside of the US (and their
covered dependents) regardless of such Morton Employees' dates of retirement
and (ii) Active Morton Employees employed at Morton Entities in the US who
retire on and after the Closing Date (and their covered dependents). The
Seller shall retain and shall remain liable for the provision of retiree
health and welfare benefits to Morton Employees employed at Morton Entities
in the US who retire prior to the Closing Date (and their covered dependents)
under the retiree health and welfare benefit plans of the Seller and its
Affiliates.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

48  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

SECTION 6.03. Pension Plans; 401(k) Plan. (a) Except as otherwise expressly
set forth in this Agreement, effective as of the Closing Date, the Morton
Employees shall be considered terminated participants under the defined
benefit and defined contribution pension plans (including the employee stock
ownership plan and all deferred compensation plans) of the Seller and
its Affiliates (other than the Morton Entities) (the "Seller Pension Plans")
and shall cease to accrue benefits thereunder. In addition, the Seller and
its Affiliates shall amend the Seller Pension Plans to provide that the
Morton Employees be fully vested in all benefits under such Seller Pension
Plans as of the Closing Date. The Seller and its Affiliates shall amend or
shall effect such other modifications as may be appropriate to each Seller
Pension Plan to provide that, effective as of the Closing Date, none of the
Morton Entities shall be a contributing sponsor thereto.

 

 

(b) Effective as of the Closing Date, the Purchaser or one of its Affiliates
shall assume the sponsorship of the Canadian Salt Company Limited Employees'
Pension Plan, the Canadian Salt Company Limited Excess Pension Plan and the
related trust agreement (hereinafter collectively referred to as the
"Canadian Pension Plans") and the Pension Plan for the Morton Bahamas Limited
Employees and the related trust agreement (the "Bahamas Pension Plan"). The
Purchaser or its Affiliates shall as of the Closing Date assume, and be
liable for the payment of, all benefits (whether existing on the Closing Date
or arising in the future) provided for in the Canadian Pension Plans and the
Bahamas Pension Plan. The employment of any Morton Employee who continues in
the employ of the Purchaser as of the Closing Date shall not be deemed to
have been severed or terminated for any purpose under the Canadian Pension
Plans or the Bahamas Pension Plan by reason of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

 

 

(c) Effective as of the Closing Date, contributions under the Seller 401(k)
Employee Stock Ownership and Savings Plan, or any successor plan (the "Seller
401(k)/ESOP Plan") in respect of the Morton Employees who participated in
such plan (the "Participants") shall cease. As soon as practicable after the
Closing Date, the Participants shall be permitted to transfer their
individual account balances from the Seller 401(k)/ESOP Plan (including any
promissory notes held in such accounts) in a direct rollover distribution to
a defined contribution plan sponsored by the Purchaser and its Affiliates in
which the Participants are eligible to participate and that meets the
qualification requirements of Section 401(a) of the Code; provided, however,
that nothing contained herein shall compel the Purchaser to accept rollover
contributions in the form of common stock or other securities.

 

 

SECTION 6.04. Collective Bargaining Agreements. Purchaser shall recognize,
and shall cause the Morton Entities to recognize, each bargaining unit
applicable to the Morton Employees and shall cause the Morton Entities to
perform all obligations under each collective bargaining agreement set forth
in Section 3.14 of the Disclosure Schedule. The Purchaser shall honor, and
shall cause the Morton Entities to honor, the obligations under the National
Labor Relations Act. On or prior to the Closing, Seller shall, or shall cause
the Morton Entities to, provide any required notice of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to each bargaining unit set forth in Section
3.14 of the Disclosure Schedule.

 

 

SECTION 6.05. Transferred Plans. Effective as of the Closing Date, the
Seller or one of its Affiliates shall take all actions necessary to transfer
any and all assets of any funded

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

49  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Transferred Plan to a Morton Entity. To the extent such assets are held in
a master trust, the amounts shall be transferred in cash or such other form
as acceptable to the Purchaser.

 

 

ARTICLE VII

 

 

TAX MATTERS

 

 

SECTION 7.01. Tax Indemnities. (a) From and after the Closing, the Seller
agrees to indemnify and hold the Purchaser and its Affiliates harmless
against any Excluded Taxes, for any breach of the warranties contained in
Section 3.15(e), (j), (k) and (l) of this Agreement, and for any Taxes for
which the Purchaser is liable under section 116 of the Income Tax Act
(Canada), or sections 1094 and 1102.4 of the Taxation Act (Quebec), as
a result of the purchase of the Company Shares from the Seller.
The Purchaser shall be responsible for and shall indemnify and hold the
Seller and its Affiliates harmless against the Relevant Proportion of all
Taxes imposed on or relating to the Morton Entities, Holdco other than
Excluded Taxes. The parties hereto agree that all payments by the
Purchaser pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence shall be made to the
Seller or its designee.

 

 

(b) In the case of Taxes with respect to a Straddle Period, the portion of
any such Tax that is allocable to the portion of the taxable period ending on
the Closing Date shall be:

 

 

(i) in the case of Taxes that are either (x) based upon or related to income
or receipts or (y) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer
or assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible) (other
than Conveyance Taxes covered by Section 7.06), deemed equal to the amount
which would be payable (after giving effect to amounts which may be deducted
from or offset against such Taxes) if the taxable period ended on the Closing
Date; and

 

 

(ii) in the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis with respect to the
assets of any Morton Entity, Holdco or any JV Entity, or otherwise measured
by the level of any item, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the
entire Straddle Period (after giving effect to amounts which may be deducted
from or offset against such Taxes) (or, in the case of such Taxes determined
on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding
period), multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of
days in the period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is
the number of days in the entire Straddle Period.

 

 

Any credit or refund resulting from an overpayment of Taxes for a Straddle
Period shall be prorated based upon the method employed in this
paragraph (b) taking into account the type of Tax to which the
refund relates. In the case of any Tax based upon or measured by
capital (including net worth or long-term debt) or intangibles, any amount
thereof required to be allocated under this Section 7.01(b) shall be computed
by reference to the level of such items on the Closing Date.

 

 

(c) Payment by the Indemnifying Party of any amount due under this Section
7.01 shall be made within 30 days following written notice by the Indemnified
Party that

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

50  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

payment of such amounts to the appropriate taxing authority is due; provided,
that the Purchaser shall comply with its obligation to promptly notify the
Seller under Section 7.03(a) and provided, further, that the Indemnifying
Party shall not be required to make any payment earlier than two Business
Days before it is due to the appropriate taxing authority. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, if the Seller receives an assessment or
other notice of Taxes due with respect to any Morton Entity, Holdco or any JV
Entity for which the Seller is not responsible, in whole or in part, pursuant
to paragraph (a) of this Section 7.01, then the Purchaser shall pay such
Taxes, or if the Seller pays such Taxes, then the Purchaser or any Morton
Entity, Holdco or any JV Entity shall pay to the Seller the amount of such
Taxes for which the Seller is not responsible within five days following such
payment (but in no event less than 30 days of receiving notice of such Tax).
In the case of a Tax that is contested in accordance with the provisions of
Section 7.03, payment of the Tax to the appropriate taxing authority will be
considered to be due no earlier than the date a final determination to such
effect is made by the appropriate taxing authority or court.

 

 

SECTION 7.02. Tax Refunds and Tax Benefits. (a) Any Tax refund, credit or
similar benefit (including any interest paid or credited with respect
thereto) relating to Excluded Taxes or any period prior to the Closing Date
shall be the property of the Seller, and if received by the Purchaser, any
Morton Entity or Holdco, shall be paid over promptly to the Seller; provided,
that any such amounts shall be net of any reasonable costs of obtaining such
refund or credit and any net Tax borne by the Purchaser on account of the
receipt of such refund and/or the payment of such amounts to the Seller.
The Purchaser shall, if the Seller so requests and at the Seller's expense,
cause the relevant Morton Entity or Holdco to file for and use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain and expedite the receipt of any refund to which the
Seller would be entitled under this Section 7.02. Any Tax refund, credit or
similar benefit (including any interest paid or credited with
respect thereto) of a Morton Entity or Holdco relating to any period
beginning after the Closing shall be for the account of the Purchaser, and if
received by the Seller, shall be paid over promptly to the Purchaser;
provided, that any such amounts shall be net of any reasonable costs of
obtaining such refund or credit and any net Tax borne by the Seller on
account of the receipt of such refund and/or the payment of such amounts to
the Purchaser

 

 

(b) Any amount otherwise payable under Section 7.01 shall be reduced by any
Tax benefit for the current, or any prior, taxable year available to the
other party or its Affiliates arising in connection with any underlying
adjustment resulting in the obligation of the other party or its Affiliates
to pay Taxes or other amounts for which the payee party is responsible under
Section 7.01 or the accrual or payment of such Taxes. Any amount paid
under Section 7.01 shall be refunded to the extent any such Tax benefit
becomes available to the other party or its Affiliates in a subsequent
taxable year as and when such Tax benefit is realized.

 

 

SECTION 7.03. Contests. (a) After the Closing, the Purchaser shall promptly
notify the Seller in writing of the proposed assessment or the commencement
of any Tax audit or administrative or judicial proceeding or of any demand or
claim on the Purchaser, its Affiliates or any of the Morton Entities which,
if determined adversely to the taxpayer or after the lapse of time, could be
grounds for indemnification by the Seller under Section 7.01 (a "Claim").
Such notice shall contain factual information (to the extent known to the
Purchaser, its Affiliates or any Morton Entity) describing the Claim in
reasonable detail and shall include copies of any notice or other document
received from any taxing authority in respect of any such Claim. If the

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

51  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Purchaser fails to give the Seller prompt notice of a Claim as required by
this Section 7.03, then the Seller shall not have any obligation to
indemnify for any Loss arising out of such Claim, but only to the extent that
failure to give such notice results in a detriment to the Seller.

 

 

(b) In the case of a Tax audit or administrative or judicial proceeding (a
"Contest") that relates to taxable periods ending on or before the Closing
Date, the Seller shall have the sole right, at its expense, to control the
conduct of such Contest.

 

 

(c) With respect to Straddle Periods, the Seller may elect to direct and
control, through counsel of its own choosing, any Contest involving any
asserted Tax liability with respect to which Seller acknowledges liability
indemnity may be sought from the Seller pursuant to Section 7.01. If the
Seller elects to direct a Contest, the Seller shall within 60 days of receipt
of the notice of asserted Tax liability notify the Purchaser of its intent to
do so, and the Purchaser shall cooperate and shall cause the Morton Entities
to fully cooperate, at the Seller's expense, in each phase of such Contest.
If the Seller elects not to direct the Contest, the Purchaser or any Morton
Entity may assume control of such Contest (at the Purchaser's expense).
However, in such case, none of the Purchaser or any Morton Entity may settle
or compromise any asserted liability without prior written consent of the
Seller; provided, however, that consent to settlement or compromise shall not
be unreasonably delayed or withheld. In any event, the Seller may
participate, at its own expense, in the Contest.

 

 

(d) The Purchaser and the Seller agree to cooperate, and the Purchaser agrees
to cause the Morton Entities to cooperate, in the defense against or
compromise of any Claim or Contest.

 

 

SECTION 7.04. Preparation of Tax Returns. (a) The Seller shall prepare and
file (or cause the Morton Entities or Holdco to prepare and file) all Tax
Returns relating to the Morton Entities and Holdco for any Pre-Closing
Period. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared on a basis consistent with those
prepared by the Seller or Dow for prior taxable periods unless a different
treatment of any item is required by Law. With respect to any such Tax Return
required to be filed with respect to any Morton Entity or Holdco after the
Closing Date, the Seller shall provide the Purchaser and its authorized
representative with a copy of such completed Tax Return at least 30 Business
Days prior to the due date (including any extension thereof) for filing of
such Tax Return, and the Purchaser and its authorized representative
shall have the right to review and comment on such Tax Return prior to the
filing of such Tax Return. The Seller and the Purchaser agree to consult and
to attempt in good faith to resolve any issues arising as a result of the
review of such Tax Return by the Purchaser or its authorized representative.

 

 

(b) The Purchaser shall prepare and file (or cause the Morton Entities or
Holdco to prepare and file) all Tax Returns that relate to any Morton Entity
or Holdco for any Straddle Period, it being understood that all Taxes shown
as due and payable on such Tax Returns shall be the responsibility of the
Purchaser, except for such Taxes which are the responsibility of the Seller
pursuant to Section 7.01 which the Seller shall pay in accordance with this
Article VII. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared on a basis consistent with
those prepared for prior taxable periods unless a different treatment of any
item is required by Law. With respect to any Tax Return required to be filed
with respect to any Morton Entity or Holdco after

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

52  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Closing Date and as to which the Taxes due (or a portion thereof) are
Excluded Taxes, the Purchaser shall provide the Seller and its authorized
representative with a copy of such completed Tax Return and a statement (with
which the Purchaser will make available supporting schedules and information)
certifying the amount of Tax shown on such Tax Return that is included in
Excluded Taxes pursuant to Section 7.01 at least 30 Business Days prior to
the due date (including any extension thereof) for filing of such Tax Return,
and the Seller and its authorized representative shall have the right to
review and comment on such Tax Return and statement prior to the filing of
such Tax Return. The Seller and the Purchaser agree to consult and to
attempt in good faith to resolve any issues arising as a result of the review
of such Tax Return and statement by the Seller or its
authorized representative.

 

 

SECTION 7.05. Tax Cooperation and Exchange of Information. The Seller and
the Purchaser shall provide each other with such cooperation and information
as either of them reasonably may request of the other (and the Purchaser
shall cause the Morton Entities to provide such cooperation and information)
in filing any Tax Return, amended Tax Return or claim for refund, determining
a liability for Taxes or a right to a refund of Taxes or participating in or
conducting any audit or other proceeding in respect of Taxes. Such
cooperation and information shall include providing copies of relevant Tax
Returns or portions thereof, together with related work papers and documents
relating to rulings or other determinations by taxing authorities. The Seller
and the Purchaser shall make themselves (and their respective employees)
reasonably available on a mutually convenient basis to provide explanations
of any documents or information provided under this Section 7.05.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.02, each of the Seller
and the Purchaser shall retain all Tax Returns, work papers and all material
records or other documents in its possession (or in the possession of its
Affiliates) relating to Tax matters of any Morton Entity for any taxable
period that includes the Closing Date and for all prior taxable periods until
the later of (i) the expiration of the statute of limitations of the taxable
periods to which such Tax Returns and other documents relate, or (ii) six
years following the due date (without extension) for such Tax Returns. After
such time, before the Seller or the Purchaser shall dispose of any such
documents in its possession (or in the possession of its Affiliates), the
other party shall be given an opportunity, after 90 days prior written
notice, to remove and retain all or any part of such documents as such other
party may select (at such other party's expense). Any information obtained
under this Section 7.05 shall be kept confidential, except as may be
otherwise necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or claims
for refund or in conducting an audit or other proceeding.

 

 

SECTION 7.06. Conveyance Taxes. Any Conveyance Taxes imposed upon, or
payable or collectible or incurred in connection with, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party upon which such
Conveyance Taxes are imposed and the other party shall indemnify the party
paying such Conveyance Taxes for an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of
such Conveyance Taxes; such indemnification to be made not less than two (2)
Business Days before the date payment of the Conveyance Taxes is due to the
applicable Governmental Authority. The Purchaser and the Seller agree to
cooperate in the execution and delivery of all instruments and certificates
necessary to enable the appropriate party to comply with any pre-Closing
filing requirements.

 

 

SECTION 7.07. Tax Covenants. (a) Neither the Purchaser nor any Affiliate of
the Purchaser shall take, or cause or permit any Morton Entity to take, any
action outside of the

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

53  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ordinary course of business or omit to take any action which is reasonably
likely to increase the Seller's or any of its Affiliates' liability for Taxes
without the prior written consent of the Seller (such consent not to be
unreasonably delayed or withheld).

 

 

(b) Neither the Purchaser nor any Affiliate of the Purchaser shall amend,
refile or otherwise modify, or cause or permit any Morton Entity to amend,
refile or otherwise modify, any Tax election or Tax Return with respect to
any taxable period (or portion of any taxable period) ending on or before the
Closing Date without the prior written consent of the Seller (such consent
not to be unreasonably delayed or withheld). For the avoidance of
doubt, neither the Purchaser nor any Affiliate (including, after the Closing
Date, the Morton Entities) shall carryback any tax attribute from any tax
period after the Closing Date.

 

 

SECTION 7.08. Miscellaneous. (a) For Tax purposes, the parties hereto agree
to treat all payments made pursuant to any indemnification obligation under
this Agreement (including, without limitation, pursuant to this Article VII)
as adjustments to the Purchase Price.

 

 

(b) This Article VII shall be the sole provision governing indemnities for
Taxes under this Agreement; provided, however, that the Purchaser shall not
be precluded by this Section 7.08(b) from making a claim under Article IX for
breach of the representation contained in Section 3.06(c).

 

 

(c) For purposes of this Article VII, all references to the Purchaser, the
Seller, Affiliates and any Morton Entity, Holdco or any JV Entity
include successors.

 

 

(d) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the
covenants and agreements of the parties hereto contained in this Article VII
shall survive the Closing and shall remain in full force until thirty days
after the expiration of the applicable statutes of limitations for the Taxes
in question (taking into account any extensions or waivers thereof).

 

 

(e) Any Tax sharing agreement or arrangement between any of the Seller or any
of its Affiliates (other than the Morton Entities), on the one hand, and any
of the Morton Entities, on the other hand, shall have been terminated.
After the Closing Date, no party shall have any rights or obligations under
any such Tax sharing agreement or other similar contract.

 

 

(f) Payments by the Seller under this Article VII shall be limited to the
amount of any liability or damage that remains after deducting therefrom any
indemnity, contribution or other similar payment recovered by the Purchaser
or any of the Morton Entities or any Affiliates of the Purchaser from any
third party with respect thereto.

 

 

(g) For purposes of this Article VII, all references to the Seller shall be
deemed to include any designee of the Seller designated by the Seller from
time to time or for certain purposes.

 

 

(h) If the Company Shares are "loss shares" for purposes of Regulations
Section 1.1502-36, and if a reduction in tax attributes of the Company would
otherwise be required under Regulations Section 1.1502-36(d), the Seller
shall, if directed by the

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

54  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Purchaser, make an election pursuant to Regulations Section
1.1502-36(d)(6)(i)(A) to reduce the basis in such Shares.

 

 

(i) While the Purchaser acknowledges that the purchase of the Shares pursuant
to this Agreement will constitute a qualified stock purchase within the
meaning of Section 338(d)(3) of the Code, it agrees that neither it nor any
of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing Date, the Morton Entities)
shall make any election under Section 338 of the Code with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or in respect of the Morton
Entities other than as provided by Section 7.08(j).

 

 

(j) The Seller shall, if so directed by the Purchaser, (i) sell all but not
some of the shares of either or both of Canadian Salt Finance Company and
Morton Bahamas Limited to the Purchaser or an Affiliate of the Purchaser
provided that such sale can be effected without delaying the Closing or any
other adverse impact to or on the Seller or its Affiliates that is not fully
compensated for by the Purchaser at the time of such sale, if any, (ii) take
reasonable efforts to effect any other restructuring of the Morton Entities,
included but not limited to selling, or internal restructuring to permit the
sale of, any Morton Entity other than Company, or any asset of any Morton
Entity, to the Purchaser or an Affiliate of the Purchaser, provided that such
restructuring can be effected without delaying the Closing and without any
other adverse impact, present or future, on the Seller or its Affiliates that
is not fully compensated for by the Purchaser at the time of the
restructuring, and (iii) join the Purchaser in making an election under
Section 338(h)(10) of the Code, with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; provided, however, that the Purchase Price or other
consideration shall be adjusted to the extent necessary, in each case but
without duplication, to compensate the Seller for any additional Taxes, costs
and other expenses (including any Tax liability of the Morton Entities for
which Seller or its Affiliates is liable under this Agreement, and determined
without regard to any Tax losses, Tax credits or other Tax attributes of
Seller or its Affiliates other than Tax losses, Tax credits or other Tax
attributes that otherwise would have been available for use by the Morton
Entities, the Purchaser or its Affiliates for any tax year beginning after
the Closing Date) that it and its Affiliates would not have incurred but for
such direction or other election, and provided, further, that any
direction must be made within 45 days of signing this Agreement and any
action requested pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) must be able to be completed
within 60 days of signing this Agreement. In the event that the amount of any
payment required to be made under clause (i) or (ii) above is not known at
the time of the restructuring or sale, the Purchaser shall pay the Seller an
amount equal to a reasonable estimate of the payment, and the difference
between the amount of any initial payment and the amount of the actual
payment required by this Section 7.08(j) shall be paid or refunded, as the
case may be, within five days of the amount of the payment becoming known.

nor any Affiliate of the Purchaser shall have any claim or recourse against
the Seller or its directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, controlling
Persons, agents, advisors or representatives with respect to such breach,
under Article VII, this Article IX or otherwise, to the extent the Seller was
required to take any action or not to take any action pursuant to the terms

requested the Seller to take or not take action that gave rise to such
breach; provided, that (A) the limitations in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii)

none of the parties hereto shall have any liability under any provision of
this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreements for any punitive, consequential or

or any Ancillary Agreements; provided, however, that such limitations shall
not limit the Seller's right to recover contract damages in connection with
the Purchaser's failure to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in violation of this Agreement; and provided, further, that
the foregoing shall not apply to claims for indemnification with respect to
Third Party Claims.

 

 

(d) For all purposes of this Article IX, Losses shall be net of (i) any
insurance or other recoveries actually paid to the Indemnified Party or any
of its Affiliates in connection with the facts giving rise to the right of
indemnification (but increased by any increase in premium payable by an
Indemnified Party under any such insurance), and (ii) any Tax benefit
available to the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates arising in
connection with the accrual, incurrence or payment of any such Losses. Any
amount paid as Losses shall be refunded to the extent any Tax benefit becomes
available to the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates in a subsequent taxable
year arising in connection with the accrual, incurrence or payment of any
such Losses as and when such Tax benefit is realized.

 

 

SECTION 9.05. Notice of Loss; Third Party Claims. (a) An Indemnified Party

Party has determined has given rise to a right of indemnification under this
Agreement, within 30 days of such determination, stating the amount of the
Loss, if known, and method of computation thereof, and containing a reference
to the provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such right of
indemnification is claimed or arises; provided, that any failure to give such
notice shall

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

59  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations, except
and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced as
a result of such failure.

 

 

(b) If an Indemnified Party shall receive notice of any Action, audit, claim,
demand or assessment (each, a "Third Party Claim") against it which may give
rise to a claim for Loss under this Article IX, within 30 days of the receipt
of such notice (or within such shorter period as may be required at Law to
permit the Indemnifying Party to respond to any such claim), the Indemnified
Party shall give the Indemnifying Party notice of such Third Party Claim;
provided, that any failure to give such notice shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations, except and only to the
extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced as a result of such
failure. The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume and control the
defense of any Third Party Claim at its expense and through counsel of its
choice if it gives notice of its intention to do so to the Indemnified Party
within 30 days of the receipt of such notice from the Indemnified Party. If
the Indemnifying Party elects to undertake any such defense against a Third
Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may participate in such defense at its own
expense, provided, that if, in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the
Indemnified Party, (A) there are legal defenses available to an Indemnified
Party that are different from or additional to those available to the
Indemnifying Party or (B) there exists a conflict of interest between the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party that cannot be waived, the
Indemnifying Party shall be liable for (as "Losses" hereunder) the reasonable
fees and expenses of one counsel to the Indemnified Party. If the
Indemnifying Party elects to undertake such defense against a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in
such defense and make available to the Indemnifying Party, at the
Indemnifying Party's expense, all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and
information in the Indemnified Party's possession or under the
Indemnified Party's control relating thereto as is reasonably required by the
Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects to direct the defense of
any such claim or proceeding, the Indemnified Party shall not pay, or permit
to be paid, any part of such Third Party Claim unless the Indemnifying Party
consents in writing to such payment or unless the Indemnifying Party
withdraws from the defense of such Third Party Claim liability or unless a
final judgment from which no appeal may be taken by or on behalf of the
Indemnifying Party is entered against the Indemnified Party for such Third
Party Claim. If the Indemnified Party assumes the defense of any such claims
or proceeding pursuant to this Section 9.05 because the Indemnifying Party
elects not to defend such Third Party Claim, or fails to notify the
Indemnified Party in writing of its election to defend as provided for in
this Section 9.05, the Indemnified Party may, with the prior written consent
of the Indemnifying Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) pay, compromise, settle or defend such Third Party Claim, including
settling such claims or proceeding prior to a final judgment thereon or
forgoing any appeal with respect thereto, and the aggregate amount of all
Losses in connection therewith shall be indemnifiable by the Indemnifying
Party hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Seller is the
Indemnifying Party, the Seller shall not be entitled to assume the defense of
any Third Party Claim (but the fees and expenses of counsel incurred by the
Indemnified Party in defending such Third Party Claim shall nonetheless be
considered Losses for purposes of this Agreement) if the Third Party Claim:
(i) seeks an order, injunction, equitable relief or other relief other than
money damages against any Purchaser Indemnified Party that cannot reasonably
be separated from any related claim for money damages or (ii) seeks money
damages which, together with any other Losses reasonably

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

60  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expected in connection therewith, are reasonably likely to exceed by a
material amount the aggregate amount remaining from indemnification with
respect thereto.

 

 

(c) Whether or not the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third
Party Claim, an Indemnified Party shall not admit any liability with respect
to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such Third Party Claim, without the
Indemnifying Party's consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the
defense of a Third Party Claim, the consent of the Indemnified Party shall be
required prior to any admission of liability with respect to, or settlement,
compromise or discharge of, such Third Party Claim which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned in the event that (i) the
admission, settlement, compromise or discharge relates to a claim or Action
for monetary damages and (ii) the terms of any such admission, settlement,
compromise or discharge obligate the Indemnifying Party to pay the full
amount of the liability in connection with such Third Party Claim, and which
releases the Indemnified Party completely (including for claims under this
Agreement) in connection with such Third Party Claim.

 

 

SECTION 9.06. Remedies. The Purchaser and the Seller acknowledge and agree
that following the Closing, except with respect to matters covered by Section
2.06 and other than as provided in Section 11.10, the indemnification
provisions of Article VII and Sections 9.02, 9.03, 9.07 and 9.08 shall be the
sole and exclusive remedies of the Purchaser and the Seller, as applicable,
for any breach by the other party of the representations and warranties in
this Agreement and for any failure by the other party to perform and comply
with any covenants and agreements in this Agreement; provided, that nothing
in this Section 9.06 shall (or shall be deemed to) limit, modify or otherwise
affect, any Action based on fraud. No breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained herein shall give rise to any right on the
part of the Purchaser or the Seller, after the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to rescind this Agreement or any
of the transactions contemplated hereby. After the Closing, each party hereto
shall take all reasonable steps to mitigate its Losses upon and after
becoming aware of any event which could reasonably be expected to give rise
to any Losses, provided, however, that costs and expenses of such mitigation
shall be deemed to be Losses to the extent arising out of such event. No
party shall be entitled to any payment, adjustment or indemnification more
than once with respect to the same matter. To the extent that an adjustment
has been made to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.06 of this
Agreement or any item is included in the Company Indebtedness or any payments
are made hereunder in respect of any matter relating to or arising out of
this Agreement, an Indemnified Party will not be entitled to any
indemnification with respect to such matter to the extent of such adjustment,
inclusion or payment.

 

 

SECTION 9.07. Environmental Matters. (a) With respect to any Remedial
Action conducted or to be conducted at or from an Owned Real Property or a
Leased Real Property that gives rise to an indemnification obligation of the
Seller under Section 9.02(c), to the extent such Remedial Action relates to
the Business:

 

 

(i) The Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to conduct and
control the Remedial Action, provided, however, that if the Seller opts to
conduct such Remedial Action the Seller shall do so without unreasonably
interfering with the Purchaser's or a Morton Entity's operations thereon.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

61  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) The Purchaser will, and will cause the applicable Morton Entity to,
cooperate with the Seller, including providing reasonable access to the
subject real property, including reasonable access to install, maintain,
replace and operate wells and remove impacted soil and/or groundwater.

 

 

(iii) The Seller shall only be liable for its share of the costs incurred to
the extent such Remedial Action is conducted in a cost-effective and
commercially reasonable manner ("Cost-Effective Manner"). The Cost-Effective
Manner shall incorporate the least stringent clean-up standards that, based
upon the use classification (industrial, commercial or residential) of a
subject real property as of the Closing Date, are allowed under applicable
Environmental Law and, so long as commercially reasonable, the least costly
methods that are allowed under applicable Environmental Law and that are
approved by or otherwise acceptable to applicable Governmental Authorities to
achieve such standards, including the use of engineering and institutional
controls to eliminate or minimize exposure pathways. The Purchaser shall be
responsible for any operation and maintenance with respect to any such
institutional or engineering controls, including any deed restriction or cap,
subsequent to the completion of their initial installation and such post-
installation costs shall not be subject to indemnification; provided,
however, that Purchaser shall remain responsible for any groundwater
monitoring or pumping, or pump and treat system, or other system providing
on-going treatment or removal of Hazardous Materials from the environment
until such is no longer required by the relevant Governmental Authority.

 

 

(iv) The Seller shall not be responsible for Losses to the extent they are
caused, triggered, increased or have their timing accelerated by (A) any act
or omission of the Purchaser or a Morton Entity subsequent to the Closing
(except to the extent required to remedy a violation of Law existing prior to
the Closing), (B) any changes in Environmental Law coming into effect
subsequent to the Closing, (C) the change in use classification of a subject
real property subsequent to the Closing from industrial to commercial or
residential or from commercial to residential, (D) any voluntary disclosure
to a Governmental Authority subsequent to the Closing by or on behalf of the
Purchaser or any Morton Entity of any information, (E) any decommissioning,
closure or shutdown of a facility unless ordered or required by a
Governmental Authority, and (F) any sampling and analysis of any
environmental media conducted subsequent to the Closing by or on behalf of,
or at the request or solicitation of, the Purchaser or any Morton Entity
unless such sampling and analysis is (v) conducted as part of the ordinary
course of environmental and safety management procedures of the relevant
Morton Entity that accords and is consistent with the pre-Closing practices
of the relevant Morton Entity, (w) for the purposes of a geotechnical probe
conducted in connection with the expansion of a building or other
facility improvement or repair where such probe is required by Environmental
Law or accords with industry practice, (x) required by Environmental Law or
by a Governmental Authority, (y) conducted in response to a Third Party
Claim alleging that Hazardous Materials have migrated offsite from a subject
Owned Real Property or Leased Real Property or (z) expressly and
affirmatively required: (i) at any Leased Real Property pursuant to any
lease to which a Morton Entity is a party prior to Closing, (ii) by any
prospective buyer of any Owned Real Property or Leased Real Property, or
(iii) by a lender or prospective lender.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

62  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) With respect to any Remedial Action conducted or to be conducted at or
from an Owned Real Property or a Leased Real Property that gives rise to an
indemnification obligation of the Seller under Section 9.02(c) to the extent
such Remedial Action does not relate to the Business:

 

 

(i) the Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to conduct and
control the Remedial Action; provided, however, that, if the Seller opts to
conduct such Remedial Action the Seller shall do so without unreasonably
interfering with the Purchaser's or a Morton Entity's operations thereon;

 

 

(ii) the Purchaser will, and will cause the applicable Morton Entity to,
cooperate with the Seller, including providing reasonable access to the
subject real property, including reasonable access to install, maintain,
replace and operate wells and remove impacted soil and/or groundwater;

 

 

(iii) the Seller shall only be liable for its share of the costs incurred to
the extent such Remedial Action is conducted in the Cost-Effective Manner;
and

 

 

(iv) the Seller shall not be responsible for Losses to the extent they are
caused, triggered, increased or have their timing accelerated by: (A) any act
or omission of the Purchaser or a Morton Entity subsequent to the Closing
(except to the extent required to remedy a violation of Law existing prior to
the Closing), (B) the change in use classification of a subject real
property subsequent to the Closing from industrial to commercial or
residential or from commercial to residential, (C) any sampling and analysis
of any environmental media conducted subsequent to the Closing by or on
behalf of, or at the request or solicitation of, the Purchaser or any Morton
Entity unless such sampling and analysis is (v) conducted as part of the
ordinary course of environmental and safety management procedures of the
relevant Morton Entity that accords and is consistent with the pre-Closing
practices of the relevant Morton Entity, (w) for the purposes of a
geotechnical probe conducted in connection with the expansion of a building
or other facility improvement or repair where such probe is required by
Environmental Law or accords with industry practice, (x) required by
Environmental Law or by a Governmental Authority, (y) conducted in response
to a Third Party Claim alleging that Hazardous Materials have migrated
offsite from a subject Owned Real Property or Leased Real Property or (z)
expressly and affirmatively required: (i) at any Leased Real Property
pursuant to any lease to which a Morton Entity is a party prior to Closing,
(ii) by any prospective buyer of any Owned Real Property or Leased Real
Property, or (iii) by a lender or prospective lender.

 

 

(c) The Purchaser acknowledges that its sole and exclusive remedy against the
Seller for any Losses relating to any Environmental Law or Environmental
Permit or with respect to any environmental, health or safety matter related
in any way to this Agreement or its subject matter, or to any Pre-Closing
Environmental Liability, is under Section 9.02(c), and Section 9.02(d) and
9.02(e) and Purchaser hereby waives, on its behalf and on behalf of its
parents, subsidiaries (including the Morton Entities), divisions and
affiliates, their predecessors, successors and assigns, and their officers,
directors, employees, agents and partners, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law, any other claim or remedy against Seller now or

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

63  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hereafter available under any applicable Environmental Law related in any way
to any Morton Entity prior to Closing or to any Pre-Closing
Environmental Liability.

 

 

(d) To the extent that any environmental matter relates to Remedial Action
related to the Business (it being agreed and understood that all other Pre-
Closing Environmental Liabilities shall not be subject to this clause (d))
and it cannot clearly be demonstrated to be a Pre-Closing Environmental
Liability, and Purchaser and Seller are not able to resolve in good faith
within a reasonable period of time which portion of the matter is such a Pre-
Closing Environmental Liability (and therefore subject to Seller's
indemnification obligations hereunder) and which portion is a post-Closing
matter (and therefore not subject to Seller's indemnification obligations
hereunder), the Seller and Purchaser shall be responsible for the Losses
associated with any part of such matter for which there is no such agreed
attribution in the following proportions:

Purchaser and Seller acknowledge that, with respect to any Release of any
Hazardous Material that constitutes a Pre-Closing Environmental Liability
Seller shall be responsible for Losses attributable to any post-Closing
migration or leaching of any such Hazardous Material; provided, that, to the
extent such Pre-Closing Environmental Liability relates to the Business
the Seller shall be responsible for Losses attributable to any such migration
or leaching to the extent such migration or leaching is not caused by any
action or negligent omission of Purchaser, and to the extent such Pre-
Closing Environmental Liability does not relate to the Business the Seller
shall be responsible for Losses attributable to any such migration or
leaching to the extent such migration or leaching is not caused by any
negligence of the Purchaser.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

64  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
with respect to any Pre-Closing Environmental Liability to the extent
relating to the Business, the Seller shall not be liable for any claim for
indemnification that is made after the tenth anniversary of the Closing Date,
provided, however, that any such claim made with reasonable specificity by
the Purchaser prior to the tenth anniversary of the Closing Date shall
survive until such claim is finally and fully resolved. With respect to Pre-
Closing Environmental Liabilities to the extent relating to the Business, the
maximum amount of indemnifiable Losses which may be recovered from the Seller
shall be an amount equal to 25% of the Purchase Price, it being agreed and
understood that all Pre-Closing Environmental Liabilities to the extent not
related to the Business shall be subject to the maximum amount and survival
period set forth in Section 9.04(b)(C).

 

 

SECTION 9.08. Post-Retirement Welfare Obligations. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless
each Purchaser Indemnified Party against all Losses arising out of or
resulting from any obligation to pay or provide any post-retirement welfare
benefits to any US-located employees of the Morton Entities who retired prior
to the Closing Date. Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless each
Purchaser Indemnified Party against any liability relating to post-retirement
welfare obligations connected to the litigation in the matter of Moses Moore,
et. al., US District Court of the Northern District of Ohio, Western Division
for only those employees of the Morton Entities who retired prior to the
Closing Date.

 

 

SECTION 9.09. Status as Purchaser Indemnified Party. The parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that, for purposes of this Agreement, (i) prior to the
consummation of the Post-Closing Legal Entity Transfer Right, the Company
shall be a "Purchaser Indemnified Party" for purposes of this Agreement and
(ii) following the consummation of the Post-Closing Legal Entity
Transfer Right, the Company shall not be a "Purchaser Indemnified Party".
The Seller covenants and agrees with the Purchaser that following the
transfer of the MII Legal Entity (as defined in the MII Legal Entity
Agreement) to the Seller pursuant to the MII Legal Entity Agreement and for a
period thereafter ending not earlier than the tenth anniversary of the
Closing Date, it shall take all reasonable action to ensure that the MII
Legal Entity is able to satisfy on a timely basis all of its obligations. The
parties hereto agree that the MII Legal Entity shall have full power and
authority to enforce the obligations of the Seller set forth in the second
sentence of this Section 9.09 as if the MII Legal Entity were a party hereto.

TERMINATION

 

 

SECTION 10.01. Termination. This Agreement and the transactions contemplated
herein may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing:

 

 

(a) by either the Seller or the Purchaser if the Closing shall not have
occurred by the first Business Day following the date that falls 9 months
after the date of this Agreement (the "Termination Date"); provided,
however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
10.01(a) shall not be available to any party hereto whose failure to fulfill
any obligation under this Agreement shall have been the cause of, or shall

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

65  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or prior to such
date, including the Purchaser's failure to fulfill its obligations
under Section 5.04(b);

 

 

(b) by either the Purchaser or the Seller in the event that (i) there shall
be any Law that makes consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement illegal or (ii) any Governmental Order restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall
have become final and nonappealable; provided, however, that the Purchaser's
right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 10.01(b) shall not be
available to the Purchaser if the Purchaser has failed to fulfill any of its
obligations under Section 5.04(b);

 

 

(c) by the Seller if there has been a breach in any representation or
warranty or a failure to perform any covenant or agreement on the part of the
Purchaser set forth in this Agreement (including an obligation to consummate
the Closing) that would, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date,
cause the condition set forth in Section 8.01(a) not to be satisfied, and
such condition is not cured, or is incapable of being cured, by the
Termination Date; provided, that the Seller is not then in breach of this
Agreement so as to cause any of the conditions set forth in Section 8.02 not
to be satisfied;

 

 

(d) by the Purchaser if there has been a breach in any representation or
warranty or a failure to perform any covenant or agreement on the part of the
Seller set forth in this Agreement (including an obligation to consummate the
Closing) that would, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, cause
the condition set forth in Section 8.02(a) not to be satisfied, and such
condition is not cured, or is incapable of being cured, by the Termination
Date; provided, that the Purchaser is not then in breach of this Agreement so
as to cause any of the conditions set forth in Section 8.01 not to be
satisfied; or

 

 

(e) by the mutual written consent of the Seller and the Purchaser.

 

 

SECTION 10.02. Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this
Agreement as provided in Section 10.01, this Agreement shall forthwith become
void and there shall be no liability on the part of any party hereto except
that (a) Section 5.03, this Section 10.02 and Article XI shall survive any
termination and (b) nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for
any breach of this Agreement occurring prior to such termination.

SECTION 11.03. Public Announcements. None of the parties to this Agreement
shall make, or cause to be made, any press release or public announcement in
respect of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or otherwise communicate with any news media in respect of this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written
consent of the other party unless such press release or public announcement
is required by Law or applicable stock exchange regulation, in which case the
parties to this Agreement shall, to the extent practicable, consult with each
other as to the timing and contents of any such press release, public
announcement or communication; provided, that neither party shall be required
to consult with the other prior to making any communications substantially
similar to communications previously issued after consultation with such
other party.

 

 

SECTION 11.04. Severability. If any term or other provision (or portion
thereof) of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced
by any Law or public policy, all other terms and provisions (or remaining
portions thereof) of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force
and effect for so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to either party hereto. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as
to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a
mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest
extent possible.

 

 

SECTION 11.05. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements,
the Confidentiality Agreement and the Disclosure Schedule constitute the
entire agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter
hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both
written and oral, among the Seller and the Purchaser with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof.

 

 

SECTION 11.06. Assignment. This Agreement and the rights and obligations
hereunder may not be assigned by operation of Law or otherwise without the
express written consent of the Seller and the Purchaser (which consent may be
granted or withheld in the sole discretion of the Seller or the Purchaser, as
the case may be), and any such purported assignment shall be void; provided,
however, that prior to the Closing Date, either party hereto may, without the
prior written consent of the other party, assign all or any portion of its
rights under this Agreement to one or more of its direct or indirect wholly-
owned subsidiaries (including, in the case of the Purchaser, any Designated
Purchaser) for so long as such assignee remains a wholly-owned subsidiary of
such party. Any attempted assignment in violation of this Section
11.06 shall be null and void and of no effect. No assignment shall
relieve the assigning party of its obligations hereunder.

 

 

SECTION 11.07. Amendment. This Agreement may not be amended or modified
except (a) by an instrument in writing signed by, or on behalf of, the Seller
and the

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

68  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Purchaser that expressly references the Section(s) of this Agreement to be
amended or (b) by a waiver in accordance with Section 11.08.

 

 

SECTION 11.08. Waiver. Any party to this Agreement may (a) extend the time
for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other
party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of
the other party contained herein or in any document delivered by the other
party pursuant hereto or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements of
the other party or conditions to such party's obligations contained herein.
Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed by the party to be bound thereby. Any waiver of
any term or condition shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent
breach or a subsequent waiver of the same term or condition, or a waiver of
any other term or condition of this Agreement. The failure of any party
hereto to assert any of its rights hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of
any of such rights.

 

 

SECTION 11.09. No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. The Indemnified Parties shall be
express third party beneficiaries of the provisions of this Agreement in
Article IX and the Company shall be an express third party beneficiary of
Section 9.09. Except for the prior sentence, nothing herein, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any legal or
equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever, including any
rights of employment for any specified period, under or by reason of this
Agreement. Furthermore, nothing contained herein shall (i) be treated as an
amendment to any particular Plan or (ii) prevent any Morton Entity, Purchaser
or its Affiliates from amending or terminating any benefit arrangement.

 

 

SECTION 11.10. Specific Performance. The parties hereto acknowledge and
agree that the parties would be irreparably damaged if any of the provisions
of this Agreement (including, without limitation, the covenants of Dow set
forth in the signature page hereto) are not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or are otherwise breached and that any non-performance
or breach of this Agreement by any party hereto could not be adequately
compensated by monetary damages alone and that the parties hereto would not
have any adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, in addition to any other right
or remedy to which the Purchaser or the Seller, as the case may be, may be
entitled, at law or in equity (including monetary damages), such party shall
be entitled to enforce any provision of this Agreement by a decree of
specific performance and to temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive
relief to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of any of the provisions of
this Agreement without posting any bond or other undertaking.

 

 

SECTION 11.11. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York. All Actions
arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard and determined
exclusively in any New York federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan
of The City of New York; provided, however, that if such federal court does
not have jurisdiction over such Action, such Action shall be heard and
determined exclusively in any New York state court sitting in the Borough of
Manhattan of The City of New York. Consistent with the preceding sentence,
the parties hereto hereby (a) submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of any
federal or state court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan of The City of New
York for the purpose of any Action arising out of or relating to this
Agreement

brought by either party hereto and (b) irrevocably waive, and agree not to
assert by way of motion, defense, or otherwise, in any such Action, any claim
that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named
courts, that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution,
that the Action is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the
Action is improper, or that this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement may not be enforced in or by any of the above-named courts.

 

 

SECTION 11.12. Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY ACTION OR LIABILITY DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO
HEREBY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER
PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY SUCH ACTION OR LIABILITY, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, AS
APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS SECTION 11.12.

 

 

SECTION 11.13. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile or electronic transmission) in one or more
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all of
which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
