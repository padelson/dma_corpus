WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Yadkin, Vantage and Piedmont have
determined that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and
their shareholders or stockholders, as applicable, to consummate the strategic
business combination transactions provided for in this Agreement in which (i)
Vantage will, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this

surviving corporation to be Yadkin Financial Corporation (sometimes referred
to in such capacity as the "Surviving Corporation"); and (ii) Piedmont will,
on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, merge
with and into Yadkin (the "Piedmont Merger," and, together with the Vantage
Merger, the "Mergers"), so that Yadkin is the surviving corporation in the
Piedmont Merger, with the name of the surviving corporation to be Yadkin
Financial Corporation (sometimes referred to in such capacity as the
"Surviving Corporation");

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Yadkin, Vantage and Piedmont (the "Yadkin
Board", the "Vantage Board" and the "Piedmont Board", respectively) have
unanimously adopted this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including, respectively, the Vantage Merger and the Piedmont Merger, as
applicable, and have resolved to recommend that, respectively, the
shareholders of Yadkin and the stockholders of each of Vantage and Piedmont
approve this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including,
respectively, the Vantage Merger and the Piedmont Merger;

WHEREAS, it is intended that, immediately following the Vantage Merger, or as
soon as is practicable thereafter, VantageSouth Bank, a North Carolina banking
corporation ("Vantage Bank"), will be merged with and into Yadkin Bank, a
North Carolina banking corporation ("Yadkin Bank") so that Yadkin Bank is the
surviving bank in the Merger ("Surviving Bank");

WHEREAS, for federal income Tax purposes, it is intended that the Vantage

and

WHEREAS, the Parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the Vantage Merger and the Piedmont Merger and

corporate existence of Vantage Bank shall cease. The parties agree that the
Bank Merger shall become effective immediately after the Effective Time. The
Bank Merger shall be implemented pursuant to a subsidiary plan of merger, in
the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Subsidiary Plan of Merger"), with

become effective as set forth in the certificates of merger (the "Certificates
of Merger") that shall be filed with the Delaware Secretary of State and the
North Carolina Secretary of State, respectively, on the Closing Date. The term
"Effective Time" shall be the date and time when the Vantage Merger and the
Piedmont Merger become effective as set forth in the Certificates of Merger.



1.3 Effects of the Mergers. At and after the Effective Time, the Vantage
Merger and the Piedmont Merger shall have the effects set forth in this
Agreement and in the relevant provisions of the DGCL and the NCBCA. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of
Vantage and Piedmont shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts,
liabilities and duties of Vantage and Piedmont shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.



1.4 Conversion of Shares. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Vantage, Yadkin, Piedmont or the holder of
any of the following securities:



(a)Each share of voting common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Yadkin
(the "Yadkin Common Stock") and each share of non-voting common stock, par
value $1.00 per share, of Yadkin issued and outstanding immediately before the
Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding and shall not be affected
by either the Vantage Merger or the Piedmont Merger. 

(b)All shares of voting common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Vantage
issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time (the "Vantage
Common Stock") that are owned, directly or indirectly, by Yadkin or Vantage
(other than shares of Vantage Common Stock held in trust accounts (including
grantor or rabbi trust accounts), managed accounts and the like, or otherwise
held in a fiduciary or agency capacity, that are beneficially owned by third
parties, any such shares, "Trust Account Common Shares") shall no longer be
outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no
stock of Yadkin or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.



(c)Subject to Sections 1.4(f), each share of Vantage Common Stock, except for
shares of Vantage Common Stock owned by Piedmont, Vantage or Yadkin or any of
their respective wholly owned Subsidiaries (other than Trust Account Common
Shares), shall be converted into the right to receive 0.3125 shares (the
"Vantage Exchange Ratio") of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
voting shares of Yadkin Common Stock (together, with any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Yadkin Common Stock to be paid pursuant to Section 2.1,
the "Vantage Common Stock Merger Consideration").



(d)Subject to Section 1.4(f), each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of Piedmont issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective
Time (the "Piedmont Common Stock"), except for shares of Piedmont Common Stock
that are owned by shareholders properly exercising their dissenters' rights
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (the "Dissenter Shares") or shares of
Piedmont Common Stock owned by Piedmont, Vantage or Yadkin or any of their
respective wholly owned Subsidiaries, shall be converted into the right to
receive (i) 6.28597 shares (the "Piedmont Exchange Ratio") of validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable shares of Yadkin Common Stock (together, with any
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Yadkin Common Stock to be paid pursuant
to Section 2.1, the "Piedmont Common Stock Merger Consideration"); and (ii)
cash per share in an amount equal to $4.0 million/number of outstanding
Piedmont Common Stock (the "Piedmont Cash Merger Consideration"); provided,
however, an independent accounting firm shall perform an analysis of
Piedmont's deferred tax assets that (x) is in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the Code and GAAP and (y) gives priority usage to Piedmont's
deferred tax assets while not sacrificing utilization of other competing
deferred tax assets of the Surviving Corporation over time, which shall be
reviewed by Yadkin and its advisors; provided, further, that if such analysis
results in the expected utilization of more or less than $4.8 million of
Piedmont's deferred tax assets then the Piedmont Cash Merger Consideration
shall be increased or decreased, as applicable, to equal the quotient of the
net present value (assuming a 4.0% discount rate) of Piedmont's deferred tax
assets divided by the number of outstanding shares of Piedmont Common Stock;
(iii) cash per share equal to the aggregate amount of any cash held by
Piedmont and VantageSouth Holdings, LLC, on the Closing Date divided by the
number of shares of Piedmont Common Stock outstanding (the "VantageSouth
Holdings Cash Merger Consideration"), and (iv) a right to receive a pro rata
share of the "Contingent Shares" (as defined below) (together with any cash in
lieu of fractional shares) (the "Piedmont Contingent Shares Merger
Consideration"), and together with the VantageSouth Holdings Cash Merger
Consideration, the Piedmont Cash Merger Consideration and Piedmont Common
Stock Merger Consideration, the "Piedmont Merger Consideration");



(e)All of the shares of Vantage Common Stock and Piedmont Common Stock
converted into the right to receive the Vantage Common Stock Merger
Consideration and the Piedmont Merger Consideration, respectively, pursuant to
this Article I shall no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and each
certificate previously representing any such shares of Vantage Common Stock or
Piedmont Common Stock (each, a "Certificate") shall thereafter represent only
the right to receive the Vantage Common Stock Merger Consideration or the
Piedmont Merger Consideration, as applicable, into which the shares of Vantage
Common Stock or Piedmont Common Stock represented by such Certificate have
been converted pursuant to this Section 1.4, as well as any dividends to which
holders of Vantage Common Stock or Piedmont Common Stock become entitled in
accordance with Section 2.2, as well as the Piedmont Cash Consideration as
provided in Section 1.4(d).



(f)If, between the date hereof and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares
of Yadkin Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or
exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities as a result
of a reorganization, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or other
similar 

change in capitalization, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be
made to the Vantage Exchange Ratio, the Piedmont Exchange Ratio and the number
of Holdback Shares.



(g)Yadkin and Piedmont agree that 856,447 shares of Yadkin Common Stock (the
"Holdback Shares") shall be deposited in an irrevocable "Rabbi Trust" (within
the meaning of Revenue Procedure 92-64, the "Trust") to be established by
Yadkin pursuant to the terms and conditions of a trust agreement (the "Trust
Agreement"), reasonably acceptable to Yadkin and Piedmont and substantially in
the form attached hereto as Exhibit E, to be entered into by Yadkin and the
trustee under the Trust on or prior to the Closing Date. The Holdback Shares
issued to the trustee of the Trust shall be fully paid and nonassessable
voting shares of Yadkin Common Stock and shall have all rights appurtenant
thereto, including, without limitation, the right to any dividends or
distributions. Yadkin hereby acknowledges and agrees that the Holdback Shares
shall, after the Closing Date, be used by it and the Surviving Corporation (i)
to make all payments due (and at the time payable) under the Piedmont
Community Bank Holdings, Inc. Phantom Equity Plan ("Phantom Plan") that was
assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the Piedmont Merger, and (ii) to
distribute all remaining shares of Yadkin Common Stock held by the Trust
immediately after satisfying all of its obligations under clause (i) above
(such remaining shares the "Contingent Shares") to the holders of Piedmont
Common Stock (other than holders of Dissenter Shares). The Holdback Shares
shall not be used for any purpose except as expressly provided in this
Agreement and the Trust Agreement.



1.5 Stock Options, Other Stock-Based Awards and Warrants.



(a)Unless otherwise noted, the provisions of this Section 1.5 pertain to all
plans sponsored by Vantage under which options and other stock-based awards
are granted, including Vantage's 2006 Omnibus Stock Ownership and Long Term
Incentive Plan, as amended, and the award agreements thereunder (collectively,
the "Vantage Stock Plans"); provided, however, that any accelerated vesting
performed pursuant to this Section 1.5 shall only be performed if required by
the terms of the Vantage Stock Plans as in effect on the date hereof without
any further action by Vantage.



(b)As of the Effective Time, Yadkin shall have the right, with the consent of
Vantage not to be unreasonably withheld, to (i) either assume any options or
other stock-based awards ("Vantage Options") substantially in accordance with
the terms of the Vantage Stock Plans and the option grants or other award
agreements by which they are evidenced in accordance with the terms of the
Vantage Stock Plans or (ii) substitute the Vantage Options for substantially
identical awards under any Yadkin Stock Plans, such that after the Vantage
Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any Vantage
Options, the Vantage Options shall be converted into and become rights with
respect to Yadkin Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, (i) each
Vantage Option assumed or substituted by Yadkin may be exercised solely for
shares of Yadkin Common Stock, (ii) the number of shares of Yadkin Common
Stock subject to such Vantage Option shall be equal to the number of shares of
Vantage Common Stock subject to such Vantage Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by the Vantage Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the
nearest whole share), and (iii) the per share exercise price under each such
Vantage Option shall be adjusted to reflect the Vantage Exchange Ratio
(rounded up to the nearest whole cent). It is intended that the foregoing
assumption shall be undertaken in a manner that will not constitute a
"modification" as defined in Section 424 of the Internal Revenue Code, as to
any stock option which is an "incentive stock option." Yadkin and Vantage
agree to take all necessary steps to effect the provisions of this Section
1.5.



(c)At or prior to the Effective Time, Vantage, the Vantage Board and the
compensation committee of such board, as applicable, shall adopt any
resolutions and take any actions (including obtaining any Vantage or Vantage
Bank employee or other participant consents) that may be necessary to
effectuate the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 1.5.



(d)Except as specifically provided in Section 1.4(g) and Section 7.5(f) of
this Agreement, at or prior to the Effective Time, any and all options,
warrants or other stock-based awards of Piedmont shall 

automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist. Piedmont shall adopt any
resolutions and take any other actions (including obtaining any Piedmont
employee or other participant consents) that may be necessary to effectuate
the provision of this Section 1.5(d).



1.6 Articles of Incorporation of Yadkin. At the Effective Time, the Yadkin
Articles shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law.



1.7 Bylaws of Yadkin. At the Effective Time, the Yadkin Bylaws, as amended in
accordance with Section 6.11, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law.



1.8 Tax Consequences. It is intended that each of the Vantage Merger and the
Piedmont Merger shall constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code, and that this Agreement shall constitute a "plan
of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.



1.9 Headquarters Locations. From and after the Effective Time, until
determined otherwise by the Boards of Directors of the Surviving Corporation
and Surviving Bank, respectively, in accordance with the terms of their
amended bylaws, (i) the location of the headquarters and principal executive
offices of the Surviving Corporation shall be at Vantage's current
headquarters location in Raleigh, North Carolina, and (ii) the location of the
headquarters and principal executive offices of the Surviving Bank shall be in
Statesville, North Carolina.





ARTICLE II

DELIVERY OF MERGER CONSIDERATION



2.1 Exchange Procedures. Within three business days after the Effective Time,
Yadkin shall cause the exchange agent selected by Yadkin, and reasonably
acceptable to Vantage and Piedmont (the "Exchange Agent") to mail to the
former holders of Vantage Common Stock and Piedmont Common Stock appropriate
transmittal materials which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the certificates theretofore representing the
Vantage Common Stock and Piedmont Common Stock, as applicable, shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of such certificates to the Exchange Agent. After
the Effective Time, each holder of Vantage Common Stock and Piedmont Common
Stock, as applicable, issued and outstanding at the Effective Time shall
surrender the certificate or certificates representing such shares to the
Exchange Agent and shall promptly upon surrender thereof receive in exchange
therefor the Vantage Common Stock Merger Consideration or the Piedmont Merger
Consideration, as applicable, together with all undelivered dividends or
distributions in respect of such shares (without interest thereon) pursuant to
Section 2.2 of this Agreement. The Exchange Agent shall not be obligated to
deliver the consideration to which any former holder of Vantage Common Stock
or Piedmont Common Stock is entitled as a result of the Vantage Merger or the
Piedmont Merger until such holder surrenders his or her certificate or
certificates representing the Vantage Common Stock and Piedmont Common Stock,
as applicable, for exchange as provided in this Section 2.1. The certificate
or certificates of Vantage Common Stock and Piedmont Common Stock, as
applicable, so surrendered shall be duly endorsed as the Exchange Agent may
require. Any other provision of this Agreement notwithstanding, neither the
Surviving Corporation nor the Exchange Agent shall be liable to a holder of
the Vantage Common Stock and Piedmont Common Stock, as applicable, for any
amounts paid or property delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property law. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, no certificates representing fractional
shares of Yadkin Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange
of the Vantage Common Stock and Piedmont Common Stock, as applicable, and such
fractional Yadkin Common Stock interests will not entitle the owner thereof to
vote or to any rights of a shareholder of the Surviving Corporation. Each
holder of Vantage Common Stock and Piedmont Common Stock, as applicable, who
would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share of Yadkin Common
Stock shall instead receive an amount of cash, without interest, equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (a) the fractional share of Yadkin Common
Stock to which such holder (after taking into account all Vantage Common Stock
and Piedmont Common Stock, as applicable, held at the Effective Time by such
holder) would otherwise be entitled by (b) the closing price of Yadkin Common
Stock on the date 

immediately prior to the Effective Time. A holder of Vantage Common Stock and
Piedmont Common Stock, as applicable, whose certificate or certificates have
been lost, destroyed, stolen or are otherwise missing shall be entitled to
receive the Vantage Common Stock Merger Consideration or the Piedmont Merger
Consideration, as applicable, and dividends or distributions, and cash in lieu
of fractional shares to which such shareholder shall be entitled upon
compliance with reasonable conditions imposed by the Surviving Corporation and
the Exchange Agent pursuant to applicable law and as required in accordance
with the Surviving Corporation's standard policy (including the requirement
that the shareholder furnish a surety bond or other customary indemnity).



2.2 Rights of Former Vantage and Piedmont Stockholders. At the Effective Time,
the stock transfer books of Vantage and Piedmont shall be closed as to holders
of Vantage Common Stock and Piedmont Common Stock, as applicable, and no
transfer of Vantage Common Stock and Piedmont Common Stock, as applicable, by
any such holder shall thereafter be made or recognized. Until surrendered for
exchange in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.1 of this Agreement,
each certificate theretofore representing shares of Vantage Common Stock and
Piedmont Common Stock (other than certificates representing Dissenter Shares),
as applicable, shall from and after the Effective Time represent for all
purposes only the right to receive the Vantage Common Stock Merger
Consideration or the Piedmont Merger Consideration, as applicable, in exchange
therefor. To the extent permitted by law, former holders of record of Vantage
Common Stock and Piedmont Common Stock (other than holders of Dissenter
Shares) shall be entitled to vote after the Effective Time at any meeting of
Yadkin shareholders the number of whole shares of Yadkin Common Stock into
which their respective shares of Vantage Common Stock and Piedmont Common
Stock, as applicable, are converted, regardless of whether such holders have
exchanged their certificates representing Vantage Common Stock and Piedmont
Common Stock, as applicable, for certificates representing Yadkin Common Stock
in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. Whenever a dividend or
other distribution is declared by Yadkin on the Yadkin Common Stock, the
record date for which is at or after the Effective Time, the declaration shall
include dividends or other distributions on all shares issuable pursuant to
this Agreement, but no dividend or other distribution payable to the holders
of record of Vantage Common Stock or Piedmont Common Stock as of any time
subsequent to the Effective Time shall be delivered to the holder of any
certificate representing shares of Vantage Common Stock and Piedmont Common
Stock (other than certificates representing Dissenter Shares), as applicable,
issued and outstanding at the Effective Time until such holder surrenders such
certificate for exchange as provided in Section 2.1 of this Agreement.
However, upon surrender of such certificate of Vantage Common Stock and
Piedmont Common Stock, as applicable, the Yadkin Common Stock certificate,
together with all such undelivered dividends or other distributions without
interest, shall be delivered and paid with respect to each share represented
by such certificate.



2.3 Piedmont Contingent Shares Merger Consideration. Any Piedmont Contingent
Shares Merger Consideration paid hereunder shall be treated as comprised of
two components, a principal component and an interest component, the amounts
of which shall be determined as provided in Treasury Reg. § 1.483-4(b) example
(2) using the 3-month test rate of interest provided for in Reg. §
1.1274-4(a)(1)(ii) employing the semi-annual compounding period. As to each
such contingent stock payment made to each Piedmont Stockholder, shares
representing the principal component (with a value equal to the principal
component) and shares representing the interest component (with a value equal
to the interest component) shall be represented by separate share
certificates.



2.4 Dissenting Shareholders. Any holder of shares of Piedmont Common Stock who
perfects such holder's dissenters' rights in accordance with and as
contemplated by Section 262 of the DGCL shall be entitled to receive from
Yadkin, in lieu of the Piedmont Merger Consideration, the value of such shares
as to which dissenters' rights have been perfected in cash as determined
pursuant to such provision of Law; provided, that no such payment shall be
made to any dissenting shareholder unless and until such dissenting
shareholder has complied with all applicable provisions of such Law, and
surrendered to Yadkin the certificate or certificates representing the shares
for which payment is being made. In the event that, after the Effective Time,
a dissenting shareholder of Piedmont fails to perfect, or effectively
withdraws or loses such holder's right to appraisal of and payment for such
holder's Dissenter Shares, the Surviving Corporation shall deliver to such
holder of shares of Piedmont Common Stock the Piedmont Merger Consideration in
respect of such shares upon surrender by such holder of the certificate or
certificates representing such shares of Piedmont Common Stock held by such
holder.





ARTICLE III

those liabilities that are reflected or reserved against on the consolidated
balance sheet of Yadkin included in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
quarterly period ended September 30, 2013 (including any notes thereto) and

engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney
or auditor representing Yadkin or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not
employed by Yadkin or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a

of "internal controls over financial reporting" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that is sufficient to provide reasonable
assurance (i) regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
GAAP, (ii) that receipts and expenditures of Yadkin and its Subsidiaries are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the board
of directors of Yadkin, and (iii) regarding prevention or timely detection of
the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Yadkin's and its
Subsidiaries' assets that could have a material effect on Yadkin's financial
statements.



(e)Yadkin's "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) are designed to ensure that all
information (both financial and non-financial) required to be disclosed by
Yadkin in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information is
accumulated and communicated to Yadkin's management as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Yadkin required
under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports. Yadkin has disclosed,
based on its most recent evaluation of its disclosure controls and procedures
prior to the date of this Agreement, to Yadkin's auditors and the audit
committee of the board of directors of Yadkin and on Section 3.6(e) of the
Yadkin Disclosure Schedule (i) any significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial
reporting that could adversely affect in any material respect Yadkin's ability
to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (ii) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in Yadkin's internal controls over financial
reporting. For purposes of this Agreement, the terms "significant deficiency"
and "material weakness" shall have the meaning assigned to them in Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board Auditing Standard 2, as in effect on the
date of this Agreement.



(f)Each of Yadkin\'s principal executive officer and principal financial
officer (or each former principal executive officer and each former principal
financial officer, as applicable) has made all certifications required by Rule
13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect to its SEC Reports, and the statements
contained in such certifications are true and accurate in all material
respects. For purposes of this Agreement, "principal executive officer" and
"principal financial officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Yadkin is in compliance with all applicable provisions
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, except for any non-compliance that would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect.

respective officers or directors has employed any broker or finder or incurred
any liability for any broker's fees, commissions or finder's

any Yadkin Benefit Plan that is not intended to be subject to Section 409A

insurance policies applicable and available to Yadkin and each of its
Subsidiaries with respect to its business or that are otherwise maintained by

provided true and complete copies of all such Yadkin Policies to Vantage.
Except as set forth in Section 3.18 of the Yadkin Disclosure Schedule, there
is no claim for coverage by Yadkin or any of its Subsidiaries pending under
any of such Yadkin Policies as to which coverage has been questioned, denied
or disputed by the underwriters of such Yadkin Policies or in respect of which
such underwriters have reserved their rights. Each Yadkin Policy is in full
force and effect and all premiums payable by Yadkin or any of its Subsidiaries
have been timely paid, by Yadkin or its Subsidiaries, as applicable. To the
knowledge of the Yadkin, neither Yadkin nor any of its Subsidiaries have
received written notice of any threatened termination of, material premium
increase with respect to, lapse of coverage under, or material alteration of

licensed to use (in each case, free and clear of any Liens), all Intellectual
Property used in or necessary for the conduct of its business as currently
conducted, and all license fees in connection with Yadkin's Intellectual
Property have been paid. The use of any Intellectual Property by Yadkin and
its Subsidiaries does not, to the knowledge of Yadkin, infringe on or
otherwise violate the rights of any person and is in accordance with any
applicable license pursuant to which Yadkin or any Subsidiary acquired the
right to use any Intellectual Property. To Yadkin's knowledge, no person is
challenging, infringing on or otherwise violating any right of Yadkin or any
of its Subsidiaries with respect to any Intellectual Property owned by and/or
licensed to Yadkin or its Subsidiaries. Neither Yadkin nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any written notice of any pending claim with respect
to any Intellectual Property used by Yadkin and its Subsidiaries and, to
Yadkin's knowledge, no Intellectual Property owned and/or licensed by Yadkin
or its Subsidiaries is being used or enforced in a manner that would result in
the abandonment, cancellation or unenforceability of such Intellectual
Property. For purposes of this Agreement, "Intellectual Property" means

environmental, health or safety matters or any private or governmental
environmental, health or safety investigations or remediation activities of
any nature seeking to impose, or that are reasonably likely to result in, any
material liability or obligation of Yadkin or any of its Subsidiaries arising
under common law or under any local, state or federal environmental, health or
safety statute, regulation or ordinance, including the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended,
pending or, to Yadkin's knowledge, threatened against Yadkin or any of its
Subsidiaries. To the knowledge of Yadkin, there is no reasonable basis for, or
circumstances that are reasonably likely to give rise to, any such proceeding,
claim, action, investigation or remediation by any Governmental Entity or any
third party that would give rise to any material liability or obligation on
the part of Yadkin or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither Yadkin nor any of its
Subsidiaries is subject to any agreement, order, judgment, decree, letter or
memorandum by or with any Governmental Entity or third party imposing any
liability or obligation with respect to any of the foregoing. Each of Yadkin
and its Subsidiaries, and, to Yadkin's knowledge (except as set forth in
written third-party environmental reports included in the relevant loan
documentation regarding real property securing a Loan made in the ordinary
course of business to a third party that is not an affiliate of Yadkin), any
property in which Yadkin or any of its Subsidiaries holds a security interest,
is in material compliance with all local, state or federal environmental,
health or safety Laws, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended.



3.21 Leases. Section 3.21 of the Yadkin Disclosure Schedule sets forth (a) a
list of each personal property lease involving annual payments in excess of
$25,000 to which Yadkin or any Subsidiary is a party and (b) a list of each
parcel of real property leased by Yadkin or any of its Subsidiaries together
with the current annual rent (each, a "Yadkin Property Lease"). Each Yadkin
Property Lease is valid and binding on Yadkin or its applicable Subsidiary and
is in full force and effect. Yadkin and each of its Subsidiaries has
performed, in all material respects, all obligations required to be performed
by it to date under each Yadkin Property Lease. Neither Yadkin nor any of its
Subsidiaries is in material default under any Yadkin Property Lease.



3.22 Privacy of Customer Information. Yadkin is the sole owner or, in the case
of participated loans, a co-owner with the other participant(s), of all
individually identifiable personal information ("IIPI") relating to customers,
former customers and prospective customers that will be transferred to Vantage
pursuant to this Agreement and the other transactions contemplated hereby. For
purposes of this Section 3.22, "IIPI" shall include any information relating
to an identified or identifiable natural person. Neither Yadkin nor the Yadkin
Subsidiaries have any reason to believe that any facts or circumstances exist,
which would cause the collection and use of such IIPI by Yadkin, the transfer
of such IIPI to Vantage, and the use of such IIPI by Vantage as contemplated
by this Agreement not to comply with all applicable privacy policies, the Fair
Credit Reporting Act of 1970, as amended (the "Fair Credit Reporting Act"),
the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (the "Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act") and all
other applicable state, federal and foreign privacy laws, and any contract or
industry standard relating to privacy. In accordance with the requirements of
the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, Yadkin
and Yadkin Bank (i) maintain the security and confidentiality of customer
records and information; (ii) protect against any anticipated threats or
hazards to the security or integrity of such records; and (iii) protect
against unauthorized access to or use of such records or information, which
could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer.



3.23 Bank Secrecy Act; Patriot Act; Money Laundering. Neither Yadkin nor any
Yadkin Subsidiary has any reason to believe that any facts or circumstances
exist, which would cause Yadkin or the Yadkin Subsidiaries to be deemed to be
operating in violation in any material respect of the Bank Secrecy Act of
1970, as amended and its implementing regulations (31 C.F.R. Part 103) (the
"Bank Secrecy Act"), the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing
Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, as
amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Patriot Act"), any
order issued with respect to anti-money laundering by the United States
Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, or any other
applicable anti-money laundering law. Furthermore, the Board of Directors of
Yadkin and its Subsidiaries has adopted and implemented an anti-money
laundering program that contains adequate and appropriate customer
identification 

verification procedures, that has not been deemed ineffective by any
Governmental Authority and that meets the requirements of Sections 352 and 326
of the Patriot Act.



3.24 CRA Compliance. Neither Yadkin nor any Yadkin Subsidiary has received any
notice of non-compliance with the applicable provisions of the Community
Reinvestment Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. As of the date
hereof, Yadkin and Yadkin Bank are "well-capitalized" (as that term is defined
at 12 C.F.R. 225.2(r) or the relevant regulation of Yadkin\'s or Yadkin
Bank\'s primary federal regulator), "well managed" (as that term is defined at
12 C.F.R. 225.2(s) or the relevant regulation of Yadkin's or Yadkin Bank's
primary federal bank regulator) and its and each Yadkin Subsidiary's most
recent examination rating under the CRA was "satisfactory" or better. Yadkin
knows of no fact or circumstance or set of facts or circumstances which would
be reasonably likely to cause Yadkin or any Yadkin Subsidiary to receive any
notice of non-compliance with such provisions of the CRA or cause the CRA
rating of Yadkin or any Yadkin Subsidiary to decrease below the "satisfactory"
level.



3.25 State Takeover Laws. The Yadkin Board has rendered inapplicable to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby any "moratorium," "control
share," "fair price," "takeover" or "interested shareholder" law.



3.26 Reorganization; Approvals. Except as set forth on Section 3.26 of the
Yadkin Disclosure Schedule, as of the date of this Agreement, Yadkin (a) is
not aware of any fact or circumstance that could reasonably be expected to
prevent the Mergers from qualifying as "reorganizations" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code and (b) knows of no reason why all regulatory
approvals from any Governmental Entity required for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement should not be obtained on a timely
basis.



3.27 Transactions with Affiliates. All "covered transactions" between Yadkin
and an "affiliate," within the meaning of Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal
Reserve Act and regulations promulgated thereunder, have been in compliance
with such provisions.



3.28 Opinion of Financial Advisor. Before the execution of this Agreement, the
Yadkin Board has received an opinion from Keefe, Bruyette and Woods, Inc. to the
effect that, as of the date thereof and based upon and subject to the matters
set forth therein, the effective exchange ratio of 0.3125 shares of Yadkin
Common Stock for each share of Vantage Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time is fair to Yadkin from a financial
point of view. Such opinion has not been amended or rescinded as of the date
of this Agreement.



3.29 Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity. Yadkin has developed and
implemented a contingency planning program to evaluate the impact of
significant events that may adversely affect Yadkin's customers, assets, or
employees. To the best of Yadkin's knowledge, such program ensures that Yadkin
and Yadkin Bank can recover its mission critical functions, and complying with
the requirements of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council
("FFIEC"), the SEC, and the FDIC.



3.30 Yadkin Information. The information relating to Yadkin and its
Subsidiaries that is provided by Yadkin or its representatives for inclusion
in the Joint Proxy Statements, or in any application, notification or other
document filed with any other Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, will not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
in which they are made, not misleading.

being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the board
of directors of Vantage, and (iii) regarding prevention or timely detection of
the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Vantage's and its
Subsidiaries' assets that could have a material effect on Vantage's financial
statements. 



(e)Vantage's "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) are designed to ensure that all
information (both financial and non-financial) required to be disclosed by
Vantage in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information is
accumulated and communicated to Vantage's management as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Vantage required
under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports. Vantage has disclosed,
based on its most recent evaluation of its disclosure controls and procedures
prior to the date of this Agreement, to Vantage's auditors and the audit
committee of the board of directors of Vantage and on Section 4.6(e) of the
Vantage Disclosure Schedule (i) any significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial
reporting that could adversely affect in any material respect Vantage's
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and
(ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in Vantage's internal controls over
financial reporting. For purposes of this Agreement, the terms "significant
deficiency" and "material weakness" shall have the meaning assigned to them in

nature whatsoever, except (i) statutory Liens securing payments not yet due,

tear and casualty excepted. There are no pending or, to the knowledge of
Vantage, threatened condemnation proceedings against the Vantage Real

reputable insurers against such risks and in such amounts as constitute
reasonably adequate coverage against all risks customarily insured against by
banking institutions and their subsidiaries of comparable size and operations
to Vantage and its Subsidiaries. Vantage has a true and complete list of all
insurance policies applicable and available to Vantage and each of its
Subsidiaries with respect to its business or that are otherwise maintained by
or for Vantage or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Vantage Policies") and has
provided true and complete copies of all such Vantage Policies to Yadkin.
Except as set forth in Section 4.18 of the Vantage Disclosure Schedule, there
is no claim for coverage by Vantage or any of its Subsidiaries pending under
any of such Vantage Policies as to which coverage has been questioned, denied
or disputed by the underwriters of such Vantage Policies or in respect of
which such underwriters have reserved their rights. Each Vantage Policy is in
full force and effect and all premiums payable by Vantage or any of its
Subsidiaries have been timely paid, by Vantage or its Subsidiaries, as
applicable. To the knowledge of Vantage, neither Vantage nor any of its
Subsidiaries have received written notice of any threatened termination of,
material premium increase with respect to, lapse of coverage under, or

its Subsidiaries does not, to the knowledge of Vantage, infringe on or
otherwise violate the rights of any person and is in accordance with any

right to use any Intellectual Property. To Vantage's knowledge, no person is
challenging, infringing on or otherwise violating any right of Vantage or any

licensed to Vantage or its Subsidiaries. Neither Vantage nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any written notice of any pending claim with respect
to any Intellectual Property used by Vantage and its Subsidiaries and, to

or its Subsidiaries is being used or enforced in a manner that would result in
the abandonment, cancellation or unenforceability of such Intellectual
Property.



4.20 Environmental Liability. There are no legal, administrative, arbitral or
other proceedings, claims, actions, causes of action, orders, assessments
(including penalty assessments) or notices of any kind with respect to any
environmental, health or safety matters or any private or governmental
environmental, health or safety investigations or remediation activities of
any nature seeking to impose, or that are reasonably likely to result in, any
material liability or obligation of Vantage or any of its Subsidiaries arising
under common law or under any local, state or federal environmental, health or
safety statute, regulation or ordinance, including the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended,

set forth in written third-party environmental reports included in the
relevant loan documentation regarding real property securing a Vantage Loan

affiliate of Vantage), any property in which Vantage or any of its
Subsidiaries holds a security interest, is in material compliance with all

by it to date under each Vantage Property Lease. Neither Vantage nor any of
its Subsidiaries is in material default under any Vantage Property Lease.

case of participated loans, a co-owner with the other participant(s), of all
IIPI relating to customers, former customers and prospective customers. For
purposes of this Section 4.22, "IIPI" shall include any information relating
to an identified or identifiable natural person. Neither Vantage nor the
Vantage Subsidiaries have any reason to believe that any facts or
circumstances exist, which would cause the collection and use of such IIPI by
Vantage and the use of such IIPI by Vantage as contemplated by this Agreement
not to comply with all applicable privacy policies, the Fair Credit Reporting
Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and all other applicable state, federal and
foreign privacy laws, and any contract or industry standard relating to
privacy. In accordance with the requirements of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act,
and the regulations promulgated thereunder, Vantage and its Subsidiaries (i)
maintain the security and confidentiality of customer records and information;
(ii) protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or
integrity of such records; and (iii) protect against unauthorized access to or
use of such records or information, which could result in substantial harm or
inconvenience to any customer. 



4.23 Bank Secrecy Act; Patriot Act; Money Laundering. Neither Vantage nor any
Vantage Subsidiary has any reason to believe that any facts or circumstances
exist, which would cause Vantage or the Vantage Subsidiaries to be deemed to
be operating in violation in any material respect of the Bank Secrecy Act, the
Patriot Act, any order issued with respect to anti-money laundering by the
United States Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control,
or any other applicable anti-money laundering law. Furthermore, the Board of
Directors of Vantage and its Subsidiaries has adopted and implemented an anti-
money laundering program that contains adequate and appropriate customer
identification verification procedures, that has not been deemed ineffective
by any Governmental Authority and that meets the requirements of Sections 352
and 326 of the Patriot Act.



4.24 CRA Compliance. Neither Vantage nor any Vantage Subsidiary has received
any notice of non-compliance with the applicable provisions of the Community
Reinvestment Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. As of the date
hereof, Vantage and Vantage Bank are "well-capitalized" (as that term is
defined at 12 C.F.R. 225.2(r) or the relevant regulation of Vantage\'s or
Vantage Bank\'s primary federal regulator), "well managed" (as that term is
defined at 12 C.F.R. 225.2(s) or the relevant regulation of Vantage's or
Vantage Bank's primary federal bank regulator) and its and each Vantage
Subsidiary's most recent examination rating under the CRA was "satisfactory"
or better. Vantage knows of no fact or circumstance or set of facts or
circumstances which would be reasonably likely to cause Vantage or any Vantage
Subsidiary to receive any notice of non-compliance with such provisions of the
CRA or cause the CRA rating of Vantage or any Vantage Subsidiary to decrease
below the "satisfactory" level.



4.25 State Takeover Laws. The Vantage Board has rendered inapplicable to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby any "moratorium," "control
share," "fair price," "takeover" or "interested stockholder" law.



4.26 Reorganization; Approvals. As of the date of this Agreement, Vantage (a)
is not aware of any fact or circumstance that could reasonably be expected to
prevent the Vantage Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and (b) knows of no reason why all
regulatory approvals from any Governmental Entity required for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement should not be
obtained on a timely basis.



4.27 Transactions with Affiliates. All "covered transactions" between Vantage
and an "affiliate," within the meaning of Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal
Reserve Act and regulations promulgated thereunder, have been in compliance
with such provisions.



4.28 Opinion of Financial Advisor. Before the execution of this Agreement, the
Vantage Board has received an opinion from Sandler O' Neill and Partners, L.P.
to the effect that as of the date thereof and based upon and subject to the
matters set forth therein, the Vantage Merger is fair to the stockholders of
Vantage from a financial point of view. Such opinion has not been amended or
rescinded as of the date of this Agreement.



4.29 Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity. Vantage has developed and
implemented a contingency planning program to evaluate the impact of
significant events that may adversely affect Vantage's customers, assets, or
employees. To the best of Vantage's knowledge, such program ensures that
Vantage and its Subsidiaries can recover its mission critical functions, and
complies with the requirements of the FFIEC, the SEC, and the FDIC.



4.30 Vantage Information. The information relating to Vantage and its
Subsidiaries that is provided by Vantage or their representatives for
inclusion in the Joint Proxy Statements, the Form S-4, or in any application,
notification or other document filed with any other Regulatory Agency or other
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances in which they are 

made, not misleading. The Form S-4 will comply in all material respects with
the provisions of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.

ARTICLE VII

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS



7.1 Regulatory Matters.



(a)The Parties shall cooperate with each other and use their respective
reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary
documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to
obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities that are
necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Vantage Merger, the Piedmont Merger, and the Bank
Merger), and to comply with the terms and conditions of all such permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations of all such third parties or
Governmental Entities. Piedmont, Yadkin and Vantage shall have the right to
review in advance and each will consult the other on, in each case subject to
applicable laws relating to the confidentiality of information, all the
information relating to Yadkin, Vantage and Piedmont, as the case may be, and
any of their respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made with, or
written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising
the foregoing right, each of the Parties shall act reasonably and as promptly
as practicable. Each party shall consult with the other Parties in advance of
any meeting or conference with any Governmental Entity in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to the extent permitted by
such Governmental Entity, give the other Parties and/or their counsel the
opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences. The
Parties shall consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and
Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and each Party will keep the other apprised of
the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein
shall be deemed to require any Party to take any action, or commit to take any
action, or agree to any condition or restriction, in connection with obtaining
the foregoing permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of third parties
or Governmental Entities, that the Parties agree would have a Material Adverse
Effect (measured on a scale relative to Yadkin) on either Vantage, Yadkin or
Piedmont (a "Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition").



(b)Each Party shall, upon request, furnish to the other all information
concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and shareholders or
stockholders, as applicable, and such other matters as may be reasonably
necessary or advisable in connection with the proxy statements, the Form S-4
or any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of
Piedmont, Vantage, Yadkin or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.



(c)Each Party shall promptly advise the other Parties upon receiving any
communication from any Governmental Entity the consent or approval of which is
required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
that causes such Party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that
any Piedmont Requisite Regulatory Approval, Vantage Requisite Regulatory
Approval or Yadkin Requisite Regulatory Approval, respectively, will not be
obtained or that the receipt of any such approval may be materially delayed or
subject to a Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition.













7.2 Access to Information; Confidentiality.



(a)Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws relating to the
confidentiality of information, each Party shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel,
advisors, agents and other representatives of the other Parties, reasonable
access, during normal business hours during the period before the Effective
Time, to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments and records, and,
during such period, such Party shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
make available to the other Parties (i) a copy of each report, schedule,
registration statement and other document filed or received by it during such
period pursuant to the requirements of federal securities laws or federal or
state banking or insurance laws (other than reports or documents that such
Party is not permitted to disclose under applicable law) and (ii) all other
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as the other
Party may reasonably request. None of Piedmont, Yadkin or Vantage or any of
their respective Subsidiaries, shall be required to provide access to or to
disclose information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the
attorney-client privilege of such Party or its Subsidiaries or contravene any
law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding
agreement entered into before the date of this Agreement. The Parties shall
make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in
which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.



(b)Each Party shall, and shall cause its respective agents and representatives
to, maintain in confidence all information received from the other Parties
(other than disclosure to that Party's agents and representatives in
connection with the evaluation and consummation of the Mergers) in connection
with this Agreement or the Mergers (including the existence and terms of this
Agreement) and use such information solely to evaluate the Mergers, unless (i)
such information is already known to the receiving Party or its agents and
representatives, (ii) such information is subsequently disclosed to the
receiving Party or its agents and representatives by a third party that, to
the knowledge of the receiving Party, is not bound by a duty of
confidentiality, (iii) such information becomes publicly available through no
fault of the receiving Party, (iv) the receiving Parties in good faith
believes that the use of such information is necessary or appropriate in
making any filing or obtaining any consent required for the Mergers (in which
case the receiving Party shall advise the other Parties before making the
disclosure) or (v) the receiving Party in good faith believes that the
furnishing or use of such information is required by or necessary or
appropriate in connection with any applicable laws or any listing or trading
agreement concerning its publicly traded securities (in which case the
receiving Party shall advise the other Parties before making the disclosure).



All information and materials provided by Yadkin and Vantage pursuant to this
Agreement shall be subject to the provisions of the Joint Confidentiality
Letter entered into between Vantage and Yadkin dated September 24, 2013.

(c)No investigation by a Party or its representatives shall affect the
representations and warranties of the other Parties set forth in this
Agreement.

comment thereon. Each of Vantage, Yadkin and Piedmont shall furnish all
information concerning itself and its Affiliates to the other Parties, and
provide such other assistance, as may be reasonably requested in connection
with the preparation, filing and distribution of the Joint Proxy Statement and
the Registration Statement, and the Joint Proxy Statement and the Registration

making of a Yadkin Adverse Recommendation Change relieve Yadkin of any

the Yadkin Shareholder Meeting, in each case to the extent generally
consistent with past practice for Yadkin shareholder meetings.

Directors shall have made a Vantage Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted
by Section 7.10, solicit the Vantage Stockholder Approval. Vantage shall,
through the Vantage Board of Directors, recommend to the Vantage Stockholders
that they vote for the Vantage Stockholder Approval and shall include such
recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement, except to the extent that the
Vantage Board of Directors shall have made a Vantage Adverse Recommendation
Change as permitted by Section 7.10. Except as expressly contemplated by the

proposal, public disclosure or communication to Vantage of any Vantage

7.5 Employee Matters.



(a)All individuals employed by, or on an authorized leave of absence from,
Yadkin or Vantage or any of their respective Subsidiaries immediately before
the Effective Time (collectively, the "Covered Employees") shall automatically
become employees of the Surviving Corporation and its affiliates as of the
Effective Time. Immediately following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall, or shall cause its applicable Subsidiaries to, provide to
those Covered Employees employee benefits, rates of base salary or hourly wage
and annual bonus opportunities that are substantially similar, in the
aggregate, to the aggregate rates of base salary or hourly wage and the
aggregate employee benefits and annual bonus opportunities provided to such
Covered Employees under the Yadkin Benefit Plans or Vantage Benefit Plans, as
applicable, as in effect immediately before the Effective Time; provided,
however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall
(i) be treated as an amendment of any particular Yadkin Benefit Plan or
Vantage Benefit Plan, (ii) give any third party any right to enforce the
provisions of this Section 7.5, (iii) limit the right of the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any
Covered Employee at any time or require the Surviving Corporation or any of
its Subsidiaries to provide any such employee benefits, rates of base salary
or hourly wage or annual bonus opportunities for any period following any such
termination, or (iv) obligate Yadkin, Vantage or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to (A) maintain any particular Yadkin Benefit Plan or Vantage
Benefit Plans, as applicable, or (B) retain the employment of any particular
Covered Employee.



(b)If a Covered Employee who does not have an employment, change-of-control or
severance agreement with Yadkin, Vantage or any of their Subsidiaries (i) is
terminated by the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries due to a
permanent or indefinite reduction in staff resulting in job elimination,
reduction of a position (including a position that had been held at Yadkin or
any of its Subsidiaries) as the result of an organizational or business
restructuring or the integration of Yadkin or any of its Subsidiaries with
Vantage or any of its Subsidiaries, discontinuance of an operation, relocation
of all or a part of Vantage's or its Subsidiaries' business, sale of an
operation to another company, or sale or other change in ownership of all or a
part of Vantage's or its Subsidiaries' business or (ii) voluntarily resigns
after being notified that, as a condition of employment, such Covered
Employee's base salary will be materially decreased, in any case or both
cases, during the period beginning at the Effective Time and ending six months
following the Effective Time, such Covered Employee shall be entitled to
receive severance payments equal to (after providing customary releases) two
weeks of severance pay for every year of employment with Yadkin or Vantage, as
applicable, with a minimum severance payment of one month and a maximum of one
year, regardless of employee classification; provided that any such decision
to terminate or materially decrease the salary of a Covered Employee shall be
mutually agreed upon by the Executive Chairman, or his designee, and the Chief
Executive Officer, or his designee, of the Surviving Corporation, such
agreement not to be unreasonably withheld.



Yadkin and Vantage shall, and shall each cause their Subsidiaries to, take
whatever action is necessary to terminate any and all other severance
arrangements and to ensure that Yadkin and Vantage have no other liability for
any other severance payments (other than as set forth in this Section 7.5(b)
of the Yadkin Disclosure Schedule and Section 7.5(b) of the Vantage Disclosure
Schedule). The Parties shall cooperate to effectuate the foregoing, including
compliance with the Worker Adjustment Retraining and Notification Act or any
similar state or local law.

Nothing contained in this Section7.5(b) shall be construed or interpreted to
limit or modify in any way Yadkin's at-will employment policy. In addition, in
no event shall severance pay payable under this Section 7.5(b) to any Covered
Employee who does not have an employment, change-in-control or severance
agreement with Vantage or Yadkin be taken into account in determining the
amount of any other benefit (including an individual's benefit under any
retirement plan, SERP or agreement). If, by reason of the controlling plan
document, controlling law or otherwise, severance pay is taken into account in
determining any other benefit, the severance pay otherwise payable shall be
reduced by the present value of the additional benefit determined under other
benefit plans attributable to the severance pay.

(c)If Yadkin so requests (which request shall be made no less than 15 days
before the Effective Time), Vantage shall take any and all actions required
(including the adoption of resolutions by its Board of Directors) to amend,
freeze and/or terminate any or all Vantage Benefit Plans (excluding the
Vantage Stock Plans) immediately before the Effective Time, and, if requested
by Yadkin, to implement any such actions.



(d)Vantage shall provide to Yadkin at least 15 days before the Effective Time,
documentation that shows that the requirements of ERISA, the Code or other
applicable laws are met by or with respect to each Vantage Benefit Plan
subject to such requirements as to the plan's latest three plan years that
have ended before the date of this Agreement.



(e)Prior to the Effective Time, each of Joseph H. Towell, who shall be the
Executive Chairman; Scott M. Custer, who shall be the Chief Executive Officer;
and Terry S. Earley, who shall be the Chief Financial Officer; Wm. Mark
DeMarcus, who shall be the Chief Operating Officer; Steven W. Jones, who shall
be the Chief Banking Officer; and Edwin H. Shuford, who shall be the Chief
Credit Officer, shall have entered into an employment agreement in a form
mutually agreed to by Yadkin and Vantage with the Surviving Corporation and
the Surviving Bank, which shall become effective only upon consummation of the
Mergers at the Effective Time.



(f)In the Piedmont Merger, the Surviving Corporation shall assume, and
following the Closing the Surviving Corporation shall continue to honor, the
obligations set forth in the Phantom Plan and shall not, at any time following
Closing, terminate and liquidate the Phantom Plan prior to the time all
amounts due thereunder have been paid in full. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Surviving Corporation may cause distributions to be made in accordance
with the terms of the Phantom Plan from the Trust to be established pursuant
to Section 1.4(g) hereof.



7.6 Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance.



(a)In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative (a "Claim"),
including any such Claim in which any individual who is now, or has been at
any time before the date of this Agreement, or who becomes before the
Effective Time, a director, officer or employee of Vantage, Piedmont or any of
their Subsidiaries or who is or was serving at the request of Vantage,
Piedmont or any of their Subsidiaries as a director, officer or employee of
another person (the "Indemnified Parties"), is, or is threatened to be, made a
party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or
pertaining to (i) the fact that he is or was a director, officer or employee
of Vantage, Piedmont or any of their Subsidiaries before the Effective Time or
(ii) this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
whether asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time, the Parties
shall cooperate and use their best efforts to defend against and respond
thereto. All rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for
acts or omissions occurring at or before the Effective Time now existing in
favor of any Indemnified Party as provided in their respective articles of
incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational documents), and any
existing indemnification agreements set forth on Section 7.6(a) of the Vantage
Disclosure Schedule or the Piedmont 

Disclosure Schedule, shall survive the Mergers and shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms, and shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified after the Effective Time in any manner that
would adversely affect the rights thereunder of such individuals for acts or
omissions occurring at or before the Effective Time or taken at the request of
Yadkin pursuant to Section 7.7, it being understood that nothing in this
sentence shall require any amendment to the certificate of incorporation or
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.



(b)From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, indemnify, defend and hold
harmless, and provide advancement of reasonable expenses to, each Indemnified
Party against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses, liabilities or
judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement of or in connection with any
Claim based in whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out of the
fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of Vantage,
Piedmont or any Subsidiary of Vantage or Piedmont, and pertaining to any
matter existing or occurring, or any acts or omissions occurring, at or before
the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed before, or at or after, the
Effective Time (including matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection
with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby) or taken at the request of Yadkin pursuant to Section
7.7.



(c)Yadkin shall cause the individuals serving as officers and directors of
Vantage and Piedmont or any of their Subsidiaries immediately before the
Effective Time to be covered for a period of six years from the Effective Time
by the directors' and officers' liability insurance policy maintained by
Vantage (provided that Yadkin may substitute therefor policies of at least the
same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are not less
advantageous to such officers and directors than such policy) with respect to
acts or omissions occurring before the Effective Time that were committed by
such officers and directors in their capacity as such.



(d)The provisions of this Section 7.6 shall survive the Effective Time and are
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives.



7.7 Additional Agreements. In case at any time after the Effective Time any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement (including any merger between a Subsidiary of Vantage or Piedmont,
on the one hand, and a Subsidiary of Yadkin, on the other) or to vest the
Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights,
approvals, immunities and franchises of the Parties to the Mergers, the proper
officers and directors of each Party and their respective Subsidiaries shall
take all such necessary action as may be reasonably requested by Yadkin.



7.8 Advice of Changes. Each of Piedmont, Vantage and Yadkin shall promptly
advise the other Parties of any change or event (a) having or reasonably
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on it or (b) that it believes would
or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any
of its representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement;
provided, however, that no such notification shall affect the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the Parties (or remedies with respect
thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the Parties under this
Agreement; provided, further, that a failure to comply with this Section 7.8
shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement or the failure of any
condition set forth in Article VII to be satisfied unless the underlying
Material Adverse Effect or material breach would independently result in the
failure of a condition set forth in Article VII to be satisfied.



7.9 No Solicitation by Yadkin.



(a)Except as specifically permitted by this Section 7.9 , Yadkin shall not and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and Representatives not to, during the
period from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time
and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 9.1, directly
or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, facilitate or encourage (including by
way of furnishing non-public information) any inquiries regarding, or the
making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be
expected to lead to, a Yadkin Takeover Proposal, or (ii) engage or enter into,
continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any other Person material non-public information in
connection with any 

Yadkin Takeover Proposal, or otherwise cooperate with or assist or participate
in, or encourage or knowingly facilitate any such inquiries, proposals,
discussions or negotiations or any effort or attempt to make a Yadkin Takeover
Proposal. Yadkin shall, and shall cause each of the Yadkin Subsidiaries and
each of its and the Yadkin Subsidiaries' Representatives to (1) immediately
upon execution of this Agreement, cease any solicitation, encouragement,
discussions or negotiations with any Person that may be ongoing with respect
to a Yadkin Takeover Proposal as of the date of this Agreement, (2) request
promptly thereafter that such Person promptly return or destroy all
confidential information concerning Yadkin and the Yadkin Subsidiaries
delivered or made available to such Person or its Representatives by Yadkin,
the Yadkin Subsidiaries or any Representatives thereof, in connection with its
consideration of a Yadkin Takeover Proposal and any summaries, analyses or
extracts thereof or based thereon, and any files, copies or records containing
such information in any computer or electronic media, and (3) immediately upon
execution of this Agreement terminate all physical and electronic dataroom
access previously granted to any such Person or its Representatives.



(b)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if at any time
prior to obtaining the Yadkin Shareholder Approval, Yadkin or any of its
Representatives receives a bona fide written Yadkin Takeover Proposal from any
Person or group of Persons, which Yadkin Takeover Proposal did not result from
any breach of this Section 7.9, then Yadkin and its Representatives may, if
the Yadkin Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation
with its independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such
Yadkin Takeover Proposal constitutes a Yadkin Superior Proposal (i) furnish,
pursuant to an Acceptable Yadkin Confidentiality Agreement, information
(including non-public information) with respect to Yadkin and its Subsidiaries
to the Person or group of Persons who has made such Yadkin Takeover Proposal
and their respective Representatives; provided that Yadkin shall (subject to
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement) promptly make available to Vantage
(through an electronic dataroom or otherwise), and concurrently provide
express written notification, via electronic mail notification to Vantage in
accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 10.4, of the availability
of, any written material non-public information that is provided to any such
Person or group of Persons or their respective Representatives, if such
information was not previously provided to Vantage or its Representatives, and
(ii) engage in or otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with
the Person or group of Persons making such Yadkin Takeover Proposal and their
respective Representatives; provided, further that Yadkin shall promptly
provide to Vantage (1) a copy of any Yadkin Takeover Proposal made in writing
by any such Person or group of Persons to Yadkin, any of its Subsidiaries, or
any of their respective Representatives, and the identity of the Person making
the Yadkin Takeover Proposal, and (2) a written summary of the material terms
of any such Yadkin Takeover Proposal not made in writing. For the purposes of
this Agreement, "Acceptable Yadkin Confidentiality Agreement " means any
confidentiality agreement and standstill agreement that contains provisions
with respect to confidentiality matters that are no less favorable to Yadkin
than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement.



(c)Yadkin shall keep Vantage reasonably informed of any material developments,
discussions or negotiations regarding any Yadkin Takeover Proposal, including
any such proposal first made or discussed with Yadkin prior to the date of
this Agreement (including forwarding to Vantage any written materials provided
to Yadkin or its Representatives in connection with any such Yadkin Takeover
Proposal) on a current basis, and shall notify Vantage of the status of such
Yadkin Takeover Proposal. Yadkin agrees that it and its Subsidiaries will not
enter into any confidentiality or other agreements with any Person subsequent
to the date of this Agreement which prohibits Yadkin from providing any
information to Vantage in accordance with this Section 7.9.



(d)Except as permitted by Section 7.9(e), the Yadkin Board of Directors shall
not (i) (A) fail to recommend to the Yadkin Shareholders that the Yadkin
Shareholder Approval be given or fail to include the Yadkin Board
Recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement, (B) change, qualify, withhold,
withdraw or modify, or publicly propose to change, qualify, withhold, withdraw
or modify, in a manner adverse to Vantage, the Yadkin Board Recommendation,
(C) take any formal action or make any recommendation or public statement in

of rejection of such offer or a temporary "stop, look and listen"
communication by the Yadkin Board of Directors pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of
the Exchange Act, or (D) adopt, approve or recommend, or publicly propose to
approve or recommend to the Yadkin Shareholders, a Yadkin Takeover Proposal
(actions described in this clause (i) being referred to as a "Yadkin Adverse

Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, agreement or agreement in
principle with respect to any Yadkin Takeover Proposal (other than an
Acceptable Yadkin Confidentiality Agreement) (each, a "Yadkin Acquisition
Agreement").



(e)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, prior to the time the
Yadkin Shareholder Approval is obtained, the Yadkin Board of Directors may, in
connection with a bona fide written Yadkin Takeover Proposal, which Yadkin
Takeover Proposal was made after the date of this Agreement (or that was made
prior to the date of this Agreement and remade after the date of this
Agreement) and that did not result from any breach of this Section 7.9, make a
Yadkin Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Plan of Merger pursuant
to Section 9.1(e) to enter into a definitive merger agreement or other
definitive purchase or acquisition agreement with respect to such Yadkin
Takeover Proposal, if and only if, prior to taking such action, Yadkin has
complied with its obligations under this Section 7.9 and the Yadkin Board of
Directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with its
independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Yadkin
Takeover Proposal constitutes a Yadkin Superior Proposal; provided , however ,
that prior to taking any such action (i) Yadkin has given Vantage at least
five Business Days prior written notice of its intention to take such action
(which notice shall specify the material terms and conditions of any such
Yadkin Superior Proposal, including the identity of the party making such
Yadkin Superior Proposal) and has contemporaneously provided a copy to Vantage
of all written materials (including all transaction agreements and related
documents) with or from the party making such Yadkin Superior Proposal, (ii)
Yadkin has negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to negotiate, in
good faith with Vantage during such notice period to the extent Vantage wishes
to negotiate, to enable Vantage to revise the terms of this Agreement such
that it would cause such Yadkin Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a
Yadkin Superior Proposal and (iii) following the end of such notice period,
the Yadkin Board of Directors shall have considered in good faith any changes
to this Agreement proposed in writing by Vantage, and shall have determined
that the Yadkin Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a Yadkin
Superior Proposal if such revisions were to be given effect. In the event of
any material revisions to a Yadkin Takeover Proposal that could have an
impact, influence or other effect on the Yadkin Board of Directors' decision
or discussion with respect to whether such proposal is a Yadkin Superior
Proposal, Yadkin shall deliver a new written notice to Vantage pursuant to the
foregoing clause (i) and again comply with the requirements of this Section
7.9(e) with respect to such new written notice; provided, however, that
references herein to the five Business Day period shall be deemed to be
references to a three Business Day period with respect thereto.



(f)Provided that Yadkin and the Yadkin Board of Directors comply with their
applicable obligations under Section 7.9(e), nothing in this Section 7.9 shall
prohibit the Yadkin Board of Directors from (i) taking and disclosing to the
Yadkin Shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or
Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act, or (ii)
making any "stop-look-and-listen" communications to Yadkin Shareholders
pursuant to Section 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any
similar communications to the Yadkin Shareholders); provided, however, that
the taking of any action pursuant to either of the preceding clauses (i) or
(ii) shall in no way limit or modify the effect of this Agreement with respect
to any such action taken.



(g)As used in this Agreement, "Yadkin Takeover Proposal" shall mean any
inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person (other than Vantage and its
Subsidiaries) or "group", within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange
Act, relating to, in a single transaction or series of related transactions,
any (i) acquisition of assets of Yadkin and its Subsidiaries equal to more
than 10% of Yadkin's consolidated assets or to which more than 10% of Yadkin's
net income on a consolidated basis are attributable, (ii) acquisition of more
than 10% of the outstanding Yadkin Common Stock or the capital stock of any
Subsidiary of Yadkin, (iii) tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated
would result in any Person beneficially owning more than 10% of the
outstanding Yadkin Common Stock, (iv) merger, consolidation, share exchange,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving Yadkin or any of its Subsidiaries or (v) any combination
of the foregoing types of transactions if the sum of the percentage of
consolidated assets, consolidated net income and Yadkin Common Stock involved
is more than 10%; in each case, other than the Merger.



(h)As used in this Agreement, "Yadkin Superior Proposal " shall mean any bona
fide written Yadkin Takeover Proposal that the Yadkin Board of Directors has
determined in its good faith judgment, after consultation with its independent
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, is reasonably likely to be
consummated in accordance with its terms and that is reasonably likely to
result in the consummation of a transaction more favorable to the Yadkin
Shareholders from a financial point of view than the Merger, taking into
account (a) all legal, regulatory and financial aspects of the proposal
(including availability of financing and certainty of closing) and the Person
making the proposal; and (b) any changes to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by Vantage in response to such proposal or otherwise.

negotiations regarding, or furnish to any other Person material non-public

Agreement, information (including non-public information) with respect to
Vantage and its Subsidiaries to the Person or group of Persons who has made

Vantage Stockholder Approval is obtained, the Vantage Board of Directors may,
in connection with a bona fide written Vantage Takeover Proposal, which
Vantage Takeover Proposal was made after the date of this Agreement (or that
was made prior to the date of this Agreement and remade after the date of this
Agreement) and that did not result from any breach of this Section 7.10, make
a Vantage Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Section 9.1(f) to enter into a definitive merger agreement or other
definitive purchase or acquisition agreement with respect to such Vantage
Takeover Proposal, if and only if, prior to taking such action, Vantage has
complied with its obligations under this Section 7.10 and the Vantage Board of
Directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with its
independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Vantage
Takeover Proposal constitutes a Vantage Superior Proposal; provided , however,
that prior to taking any such action (i) Vantage has given Yadkin at least
five Business Days prior written notice of its intention to take such action
(which notice shall specify the material terms and conditions of any such
Vantage Superior Proposal, including the identity of the party making such
Vantage Superior Proposal) and has contemporaneously provided a copy to Yadkin
of all written materials (including all transaction agreements and related
documents) with or from the party making such Vantage Superior Proposal, (ii)
Vantage has negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to negotiate, in
good faith with Yadkin during such notice period to the extent Yadkin wishes
to negotiate, to enable Yadkin to revise the terms of this Agreement such that
it would cause such Vantage Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a
Vantage Superior Proposal and (iii) following the end of such notice period,
the Vantage Board of Directors shall have considered in good faith any changes
to this Plan of Merger proposed in writing by Yadkin, and shall have
determined that the Vantage Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a
Vantage Superior Proposal if such revisions were to be given effect. In the
event of any material revisions to a Vantage Takeover Proposal that could have
an impact, influence or other effect on the Vantage Board of Directors'
decision or discussion with respect to whether such proposal is a Vantage
Superior Proposal, Vantage shall deliver a new written notice to Yadkin
pursuant to the foregoing clause (i) and again comply with the requirements of
this Section 7.10(e) with respect to such new written notice; provided,
however, that references herein to the five Business Day period shall be

(f)Provided that Vantage and the Vantage Board of Directors comply with their
applicable obligations under Section 7.10(e), nothing in this Section 7.10
shall prohibit the Vantage Board of Directors from (i) taking and disclosing
to the Vantage Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule
14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act, or
(ii) making any "stop-look-and-listen" 

communications to Vantage Stockholders pursuant to Section 14d-9(f)
promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communications to the
Vantage Stockholders); provided, however, that the taking of any action
pursuant to either of the preceding clauses (i) or (ii) shall in no way limit
or modify the effect of this Agreement with respect to any such action taken.



(g)As used in this Agreement, "Vantage Takeover Proposal" shall mean any
inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person (other than Yadkin and its
Subsidiaries) or "group", within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange
Act, relating to, in a single transaction or series of related transactions,
any (i) acquisition of assets of Vantage and its Subsidiaries equal to more
than 10% of Vantage's consolidated assets or to which more than 10% of
Vantage's net income on a consolidated basis are attributable, (ii)
acquisition of more than 10% of the outstanding Vantage Common Stock or the
capital stock of any Subsidiary of Vantage, (iii) tender offer or exchange
offer that if consummated would result in any Person beneficially owning more
than 10% of the outstanding Vantage Common Stock, (iv) merger, consolidation,
share exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or similar transaction involving Vantage or any of its
Subsidiaries, or (v) any combination of the foregoing types of transactions if
the sum of the percentage of consolidated assets, consolidated net income and
Vantage Common Stock involved is more than 10%; in each case, other than the
Merger.



(h)As used in this Plan of Merger, "Vantage Superior Proposal" shall mean any
bona fide written Vantage Takeover Proposal that the Vantage Board of
Directors has determined in its good faith judgment, after consultation with
its independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel, is reasonably
likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms and that is reasonably
likely to result in the consummation of a transaction more favorable to the
Vantage Stockholders from a financial point of view than the Merger, taking
into account (i) all legal, regulatory and financial aspects of the proposal
(including availability of financing and certainty of closing) and the Person
making the proposal; and (ii) any changes to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by Yadkin in response to such proposal or otherwise.

9.3 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the Parties, by action taken
or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or
after approval of the matters presented in connection with the Mergers by the
shareholders of Yadkin; provided, however, that after any approval of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the shareholders of Yadkin,
there may not be, without further approval of such shareholders, any amendment

waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on
behalf of such Party, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on
strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall
not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or
other failure.

10.7 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the Disclosure Schedules and
Exhibits hereto and the other documents and the instruments referred to in
this Agreement), together with the Confidentiality Agreement, constitutes the
entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, between the Parties with respect to the subject matter of
this Agreement, other than the Confidentiality Agreement.

construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware
applicable to contracts made and wholly performed within such state,

proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising

explicitly states that the provision "amends" or "creates" that Benefit Plan,
and no third party shall be entitled to enforce any provision of this
Agreement on the grounds that it is an amendment to, or a creation of, a
Benefit Plan, unless that provision explicitly states that such enforcement
rights are being conferred. This provision shall not prevent the Parties to
this Agreement from enforcing any provision of this Agreement. If a person not
entitled to enforce this Agreement brings a lawsuit or other action to enforce
any provision in this Agreement as an amendment to, or creation of a Benefit
Plan, and that provision is construed to be such an amendment or creation
despite not being explicitly designated as one in this Agreement, that

_____________________________

Ladies and Gentlemen:

The undersigned is a beneficial holder of shares of common stock (the

common stock of VantageSouth Bancshares, Inc. (the "Vantage Common Stock").

Yadkin Financial Corporation, a North Carolina corporation ("Yadkin"),
VantageSouth Bancshares, Inc. ("Vantage"), have entered into an Agreement and
Plan of Merger (the "Agreement") contemplating the acquisition of Vantage
through the merger of Vantage with and into Yadkin and the acquisition of
Piedmont through the merger of Piedmont with and into Yadkin (the "Mergers").
The consummation of the Mergers pursuant to the execution of the Agreement by
Yadkin is subject to the execution and delivery of this letter agreement.

In consideration of the substantial expenses that Yadkin will incur in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the Agreement and to induce
Yadkin to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Agreement and to
proceed to incur such expenses, the undersigned agrees and undertakes, in its
capacity as a shareholder of Piedmont, as follows:

1\. While this letter agreement is in effect, the undersigned shall not,
directly or indirectly, except with the prior approval of Yadkin, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, (a) sell or otherwise dispose of
or encumber (other than in connection with an ordinary bank loan) before the
record date of the meeting of Piedmont shareholders to approve the Merger (the
"Piedmont Shareholders Meeting") any or all of its shares of Piedmont Common
Stock, (b) vote its shares of Piedmont Common Stock in favor of the sale or
other disposition, or encumbrance (other than in connection with an ordinary
bank loan), by Piedmont, before the record date of the meeting of Vantage
shareholders (the "Vantage Shareholders Meeting"), of any or all of
Piedmont\'s shares of Vantage Common Stock, (c) deposit any shares of Piedmont
Common Stock into a voting trust or enter into a voting agreement or
arrangement with respect to any shares of Piedmont Common Stock, or grant any
proxy with respect thereto, other than for the purpose of voting to approve
the Agreement and the Mergers and matters related thereto or (d) vote its
shares of Piedmont Common Stock in favor of the deposit by Piedmont of any
shares of its Vantage Common Stock into a voting trust or the entry by
Piedmont into a voting agreement or arrangement with respect to any shares of
Vantage Common Stock, or the granting by Piedmont of any proxy with respect
thereto, other than for the purpose of voting to approve the Agreement and the
Mergers and matters related thereto.

2\. While this letter agreement is in effect, the undersigned shall vote all
of the shares of Piedmont Common Stock for which the undersigned has sole
voting authority, if any, and shall use its best efforts to cause to be voted
all of the shares of Piedmont Common Stock and Vantage Common Stock, if any,
for which the undersigned has shared voting authority, in either case whether
such shares are beneficially owned by the undersigned on the date of this
letter agreement or are subsequently acquired: (a) for the approval of the
Agreement and the Mergers at the Piedmont Shareholders Meeting and Vantage
Shareholders Meeting; and (b) against any Alternative Transaction (as defined
in the Agreement) (other than the Mergers). 

3\. The undersigned hereby waives any rights of appraisal, or rights to
dissent from the Mergers, that the undersigned may have.

4\. The undersigned acknowledges and agrees that any remedy at law for breach
of the foregoing provisions shall be inadequate and that, in addition to any
other relief which may be available, Yadkin shall be entitled to temporary and
permanent injunctive relief without having to prove actual damages in respect
of the foregoing provisions.

5\. The foregoing restrictions shall not apply to shares with respect to
which the undersigned may have voting power as a fiduciary for others. In
addition, this letter agreement shall only apply to actions taken by the
undersigned in its capacity as a shareholder of Piedmont.

6\. This letter agreement, and all rights and obligations of the parties
hereunder, shall terminate upon the first to occur of (a) the Effective Time
(as defined in the Agreement) of the Mergers or (b) the date upon which the
Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, in which event
the provisions of this Agreement shall terminate.

"Registrable Security(ies)" means any shares of Common Stock acquired on the

sale of such securities shall have become effective under the Securities Act
and such securities shall have been disposed of thereunder; or (ii) when and
to the extent such securities are permitted to be publicly sold without
limitation as to amount pursuant to Rule 144 (or any successor provision to

Company's independent accountants in connection with the registration under
the Securities Act of Registrable Securities (including the expenses of any
regular or special reviews or audits or "comfort" letters incident to or

the relevant time.

"WKSI" means a well-known seasoned issuer, as defined in the SEC's Rule 405.

ARTICLE II DEMAND REGISTRATION.



2.1 (a) Subject to the limitations contained in Section 2(b), at any time
after the date that is three months after the Closing Date (the "Rights
Effective Date"), Primary Holders may request by written notice delivered to
the Company (a "Demand Notice") that the Company register under the Securities
Act all or any 

portion of the Registrable Securities then held by such Primary Holders, for
sale in the manner specified in such notice (including, but not limited to, an
underwritten public offering) (a "Demand Registration"). In each such case,
the Demand Notice shall specify the number of Registrable Securities for which
registration is requested and the proposed manner of disposition of such
securities.



(b)The Company shall use its best efforts to file with the SEC within thirty
(30) days after the Company's receipt of a Demand Notice a registration
statement for the public offering and sale, in accordance with the method of
disposition specified by Primary Holders, of the number of Registrable
Securities specified in such notice, and thereafter use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective
within sixty (60) days after its filing. Such registration statement may be on
Form S-3 or another appropriate form that the Company is eligible to use and
that is reasonably acceptable to the managing underwriter, if any; provided
that if the Company is a WKSI, an automatic shelf registration on Form S-3
will, at the request of Primary Holders, cover an unspecified number of shares
of Common Stock to be sold by the Company and Holders and the Company shall
file such a shelf registration statement within fifteen (15) days after
receipt of a request by the Primary Holders therefor; provided further that if
requested at least fifteen (15) days prior to the Rights Effective Date, the
Company shall file such a shelf registration statement on the Rights Effective
Date.



(c)The Company shall not have any obligation hereunder to register any
Registrable Securities under Section 2(a)(ii) unless it shall have received a
request from Primary Holders to register at least ten percent (10%) of the
aggregate amount of Registrable Securities held by all of the Primary Holders
as of the date of such request.



(d)If the Company is required to use its best efforts to register Registrable
Securities in a registration initiated upon the demand of Primary Holders
pursuant to Section 2(a)(ii) of this Agreement and the Approved Underwriters,
if any, for such offering advise that the inclusion of all securities sought
to be registered pursuant to Section 2 hereof may interfere with an orderly
sale and distribution of or may materially adversely affect the price of such
offering, then the Company will include in such offering, first, the aggregate
number of Registrable Securities that are participating in such offering
pursuant to Sections 2(a)(ii) or 3(a), allocated pro rata among the
Registrable Securities based on the number of shares of Common Stock
beneficially owned by each such Holder on the date that the Demand Notice is
received by the Company which the Approved Underwriters, if any, advise will
not likely have such effect, and second, all other securities requested or
proposed to be included in such registration (including shares of Common Stock
to be sold for the account of the Company).



(e)Upon the demand of Primary Holders pursuant to Section 2(a)(ii) made at any
time and from time to time, the Company will facilitate in the manner
described in this Agreement a "takedown" of shares of Common Stock off of an
effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 pursuant to Rule 415 of the
Securities Act (a "Shelf Takedown"), including, subject to the limitations set
forth in Section 2(b), an underwritten Shelf Takedown. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, such Primary Holders may not demand a Shelf Takedown for an
offering that will result in the imposition of a lockup on the Company and the
Primary Holders unless the shares requested to be sold by the Primary Holders
in such takedown have an aggregate market value (based on the most recent
closing price of the Common Stock at the time of the demand) of at least $10
million.



(f)If any Demand Registration of Registrable Securities is in the form of an
underwritten public offering, the Primary Holders shall select and obtain one
or more investment banking firms of national or regional reputation to act as
the managing underwriter or underwriters of the offering; provided, however,
that such firm or firms shall, in any case, also be approved by the Company,
such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. An
investment banking firm or firms selected pursuant to this Section 2(a)(vi)
shall be referred to as the "Approved Underwriter" herein.



(g)Upon the demand of Holders, the Company will file and seek the
effectiveness of a post-effective amendment to an existing shelf registration
statement on Form S-3 in order to register up to the number of shares
previously taken down off of such shelf by such Holders and not yet "reloaded"
onto such shelf registration 

statement. The Holders and the Company will consult and coordinate with each
other in order to accomplish such replenishments from time to time in a
sensible manner.



2.2 The obligations of the Company to effect, or to take any action to effect,
a Demand Registration or an underwritten Shelf Takedown shall be limited as
follows:



(a)In connection with the provisions of this Section 2, the Primary Holders
may require the Company to effect no more than three (3) Demand Registrations
or underwritten Shelf Takedowns in the aggregate in any 365 day period during
the six (6) year period commencing on the Rights Effective Date. After the
expiration of the such period, the Company shall no longer have any obligation
to file Demand Registrations at the request of the Primary Holders.



(b)For the avoidance of doubt, until the six (6) year anniversary of the
Rights Effective Date, there shall be no limit on the number of non-
underwritten Shelf Takedowns that Primary Holders may request (but after such
date, Primary Holders shall no longer have the right to make any such
requests), and, to the extent that Registrable Securities are not covered by
an effective shelf registration on Form S-3, the Primary Holders shall be
entitled to demand that the Company effect such a shelf-registration,
notwithstanding the limits set forth in this Section 2(b) and no such demand
for a shelf registration statement shall count against the limits set forth in
this Section 2(b).



2.3 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Company shall
have the right to defer or suspend the filing or effectiveness of a
registration statement relating to any registration requested under Section
2(a) for a reasonable period of time not to exceed 90 days if a prior
registration statement of the Company for an underwritten, public offering by
the Company of its securities was declared effective by the SEC less than 120
days prior to the anticipated effective date of the requested registration.



2.4 No registration of Registrable Securities under this Section 2 shall
relieve the Company of its obligation (if any) to effect registrations of
Registrable Securities pursuant to Section 3.



ARTICLE III INCIDENTAL REGISTRATION.



3.1 After the three (3) month anniversary of the Rights Effective Date, and
until the date that is the fifth anniversary of the Rights Effective Date,
subject to the other restrictions contained in this Section 3, if the Company
proposes, other than pursuant to Section 2, to register any equity securities
of the Company (collectively, "Other Securities") for public sale under the
Securities Act (whether proposed to be offered for sale by the Company or by
any other Person) on a form and in a manner which would permit registration of
Registrable Securities for sale to the public under the Securities Act, it
will give prompt written notice (which notice shall specify the intended
Registration and distribution) to Holders of its intention to do so (such
notice, an "Incidental Notice"), and upon the written request of Holders
delivered to the Company within five (5) Business Days after the giving of any
such notice (which request shall specify the number of Registrable Securities
intended to be disposed of by Holders) the Company will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to effect, in connection with the registration of the Other
Securities, the registration under the Securities Act of all Registrable
Securities which the Company has been so requested to register by the Holders
(a "Piggyback Registration"); provided, however, that:



(a)if, at any time after giving such written notice of its intention to
register Other Securities and prior to the effective date of the registration
statement filed in connection with such registration, the Company shall
determine for any reason not to register such Other Securities, the Company
may, at its election, give written notice of such determination to Holders, if
they requested registration, and thereupon the Company shall be relieved of
its obligation to register such Registrable Securities in connection with the
registration of such Other Securities (but not from its obligation to pay
Registration Expenses to the extent incurred in connection therewith as
provided in Section 11), without prejudice, however, to the rights (if any) of
Holders to request that such registration be effected as a registration under
Section 2;



(b)the Company will not be required to effect any registration of Registrable
Securities pursuant to this Section 3 if the Company shall have been advised
by the managing underwriter for the offering selected by the Company that, in
such firm's opinion, a registration of Registrable Securities and other
securities of the Company at that time may interfere with an orderly sale and
distribution of the securities being sold in such offering or materially and
adversely affect the price of such securities; provided, however, that if an
offering of some but not all of the Registrable Securities requested to be
registered by the Holders and securities of all other Persons having rights to
include securities held by them in such registration would not adversely
affect the distribution or price of the securities to be sold in the offering
in the opinion of such firm, then the Company will include in such offering:
first, the Other Securities to be registered for the Company's account,
second, the Registrable Securities requested to be registered pursuant to
Section 3, allocated pro rata among the Registrable Securities based on the
number of shares of Common Stock that the Holders beneficially own as of the
date of the Incidental Notice, and third, all Other Securities requested to be
included in such registration; and



(c)the Company shall not be required to give notice of, or effect any
registration of Registrable Securities under this Section 3 incidental to, the
registration of any of its securities in connection with mergers,
consolidations, acquisitions, exchange offers, subscription offers, dividend
reinvestment plans or stock options or other employee benefit or compensation
plans.



3.2 No registration of Registrable Securities effected under this Section 3
shall relieve the Company of its obligations (if any) to effect registrations
of Registrable Securities pursuant to Section 2.



ARTICLE IV HOLDBACKS; OTHER RESTRICTIONS AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.



4.1 Each Holder agrees with all other Holders and the Company in connection
with any underwritten offering made pursuant to a registration statement filed
pursuant to Section 2 or 3(a), (whether or not such Holder elected to include
Registrable Securities in such registration statement), if requested (pursuant
to a written notice) by the managing underwriter or underwriters in such
offering, not to effect any public sale or distribution of any of the
Company's securities (except as part of such underwritten offering), including
a sale pursuant to Rule 144 or any swap or other economic arrangement that
transfers to another any of the economic consequences of owning the Common
Stock, or to give any Demand Notice during the period commencing on the date
of the Prospectus and continuing for not more than 90 days after the date of
the Prospectus (or, in either case, Prospectus supplement if the offering is
made pursuant to a "shelf" registration), pursuant to which such public
offering shall be made, plus, a then customary "booster shot" extension
required to permit research analysts to publish research reports compliant
with Rule 139 under the Securities Act pursuant to FINRA Rule 2711 (or a
successor thereto). In connection with any underwritten offering made pursuant
to a registration statement filed pursuant to Section 2 or 3, the Company
shall be responsible for negotiating all "lock-up" agreements with the
underwriters and, in addition to the foregoing provisions of this Section 4,
the Holders agree to execute the form so negotiated; provided that the form so
negotiated is reasonably acceptable to the Holders and consistent with the
agreement set forth in this Section 5 and that, in the case of a Marketed
Offering, the Company's executive officers and directors shall also have
executed such form of agreement so negotiated.



4.2 If any registration pursuant to Section 2 of this Agreement shall be in
connection with any: (i) Marketed Offering, the Company will cause each of its
executive officers and directors to sign a "lock-up" agreement consistent with
that contemplated in the immediately preceding paragraph and (ii) underwritten
offering, the Company will also not affect any public sale or distribution of
any Common Stock (or securities convertible into or exchangeable or
exercisable for common equity) (other than a Registrations on Form S-4, Form
S-8 or any successor form for the registration of securities issued or to be
issued in connection with a merger, acquisition or employee benefit plan or
dividend reinvestment plan) for its own account, within 90 days (plus, a then
customary "booster shot" extension required to permit research analysts to
publish research reports compliant with Rule 139 under the Securities Act
pursuant to FINRA Rule 2711 (or a successor thereto)) after the date of the
Prospectus for such offering except as may otherwise be agreed with the
Holders in such offering.



4.3 The Company covenants and agrees not to enter into any Other Registration
Rights Agreement after the date hereof and prior to the fifth anniversary of
the Rights Effective Date that (i) contains registration rights in favor of a
third party that would have priority to the rights of the Primary Holders
contained in this Agreement or (ii) grants any third party with a right to
cause the Company to effect a registration similar to the Demand Registration
during such period.

ARTICLE V REGISTRATION PROCEDURES.



If and whenever the Company is required by the provisions of this Agreement to
use its best efforts to effect or cause a registration as provided in this
Agreement and at such times as customarily occur in registered offerings or
Shelf Takedowns, as applicable, the Company will:

5.1 Use its best efforts to prepare and file with the SEC, a registration
statement within the time periods specified herein, and use its best efforts
to cause such registration statement to become effective as promptly as

years from the effective date of the registration statement if such
registration statement is filed pursuant to Rule 415 promulgated under the
Securities Act) and (y) such shorter period which will terminate when all
Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement have been sold

Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by
such registration statement during such period in accordance with the intended

statement, any Prospectus, any amendment to a registration statement,

if applicable, and to underwriter's counsel; fairly consider such reasonable
changes in any such documents prior to or after the filing thereof as Holders
or the underwriter or the underwriters may request;



5.4 Within a reasonable time prior to the filing of any document which is to
be incorporated by reference into a registration statement or a Prospectus,

reasonably requested by Holders or such underwriter to consummate the offering
and disposition of Registrable Securities in such jurisdictions; provided,
however, that the Company shall not be required to qualify generally to do
business as a foreign corporation or as a dealer in securities, subject itself
to taxation, or consent to general service of process in any jurisdiction
wherein it is not then so qualified or subject;



5.8 Reasonably cooperate with Holders and the sole underwriter or managing
underwriter of an underwritten offering of shares, if any, to facilitate the
timely preparation and delivery of certificates representing the shares to be
sold and not bearing any restrictive legends; and enable such shares to be in
such denominations (consistent with the provisions of the governing documents
thereof) and registered in such names as the Holders or the sole underwriter
or managing underwriter of an underwritten offering of shares, if any, may
reasonably request at least five days prior to any sale of such shares;



5.9 Use, as soon as practicable after the effectiveness of the registration
statement, best efforts to cause the Registrable Securities covered by such

United States public, governmental or regulatory authorities, if any, as may
be required in connection with the disposition of such Registrable Securities;

writing, (i) when a Prospectus or any Prospectus supplement or post-effective
amendment has been filed, and, with respect to a registration statement or any
post-effective amendment, when the same has become effective, (ii) of any
request by the SEC or any other federal or state governmental authority for
amendments or supplements to a registration statement or related Prospectus or
for additional information, (iii) of the issuance by the SEC of any stop order
suspending the effectiveness of a registration statement or the initiation of
any proceedings for that purpose, (iv) if at any time the Company has reason
to believe that the representations and warranties of the Company contained in
any agreement (including any underwriting agreement) contemplated by Section
5(o) below cease to be true and correct, (v) of the receipt by the Company of
any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification or
exemption from qualification of any of the Registrable Securities for sale in
any jurisdiction, or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such
purpose, and (vi) if the Company has knowledge of the happening of any event
that makes any statement made in such registration statement or related
Prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein
by reference untrue in any material respect or that requires the making of any
changes in such registration statement, Prospectus or documents so that, in
the case of the registration statement, it will not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, not misleading,
and that in the case of the Prospectus, it will not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading (which notice shall notify the selling
holders only of the occurrence of such an event and shall provide no
additional information regarding such event to the extent such information
would constitute material non-public information);



5.14 upon the occurrence of, and its knowledge of, any event contemplated by
Section 5(m)(vi) above, prepare a supplement or post-effective amendment to
the registration statement or a supplement to the related 

Prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein
by reference, or file any other required document so that, as thereafter
delivered to the purchasers of the Registrable Securities being sold
thereunder, such that the registration statement will not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, not misleading,
and the Prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading;



5.15 enter into such agreements and take such other appropriate actions as are
customary and reasonably necessary to expedite or facilitate the disposition
of such Registrable Securities (including, in the case of an underwritten
offering, underwriting agreements in customary form, and including provisions
with respect to indemnification and contribution in customary form and
consistent with the provisions relating to indemnification and contribution
contained herein), and in that regard, deliver to the Holders such documents
and certificates as may be reasonably requested by any Holder of the
Registrable Securities being sold or, as applicable, the managing
underwriters, to evidence the Company's compliance with this Agreement
including, without limitation, using its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause its independent accountants to deliver to the Company (and to the
Holders of Registrable Securities being sold in any registration) an
accountants' comfort letter substantially similar to that in scope delivered
in an underwritten public offering and covering audited and interim financial
statements included in the registration statement or, if such letter can not
be obtained through the exercise of the Company's commercially reasonable
efforts, cause its independent accountants to deliver to the Company (and to
the Holders of Registrable Securities being sold in any registration) a
comfort letter based on negotiated procedures providing comfort with respect
to the Company's financial statements included or incorporated by reference in
the registration statement at the highest level permitted to be given by such
accountants under the then applicable standards of the Association of
Independent Certified Accountants with respect to such registration statement.
In addition, the Company shall furnish to the Holders of Registrable
Securities being included in any registration hereunder an opinion of counsel
in substance and scope to that customarily delivered to underwriters in public
offerings; and



5.16 if such sale is pursuant to an underwritten public offering, obtain a
"cold comfort" letter dated the effective date of the registration statement
and the date of the closing under the underwriting agreement from the
Company's independent registered public accounting firm in customary form and
covering such matters of the type customarily covered by "cold comfort"
letters as the managing underwriter reasonably requests.



Each Holder agrees if such Holder has Registrable Securities covered by such
registration statement that, upon receipt of any written notice from the
Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in Section
5(m)(vi) or the existence of a Blackout Period, such holder will forthwith
discontinue disposition of such Registrable Securities covered by such
registration statement or Prospectus until such holder's receipt of the copies
of the supplemented or amended Prospectus contemplated by Section 5(n), or
until it is advised in writing by the Company that the use of the applicable
Prospectus may be resumed, and has received copies of any additional or
supplemental filings that are incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by
reference in such Prospectus; provided, however, that the time periods under
Section 5(a) with respect to the length of time that the effectiveness of a
registration statement must be maintained shall automatically be extended by
the amount of time the holder is required to discontinue disposition of such
securities.



ARTICLE VI UNDERWRITING.



6.1 If requested by the underwriters for any underwritten offering of
Registrable Securities pursuant to a registration hereunder, the Company will
enter into and perform its obligations under an underwriting agreement with
the underwriters for such offering, such agreement to contain such
representations and warranties by the Company and such other terms and
provisions as are customarily contained in underwriting agreements with
respect to secondary distributions, including, without limitation, customary
provisions relating to indemnities and contribution and the provision of
opinions of counsel and accountants' letters.





6.2 If any registration pursuant to Section 3 hereof shall involve, in whole
or in part, an underwritten offering, the Company may require Registrable
Securities requested to be registered pursuant to Section 3 to be included in
such underwriting on the same terms and conditions as shall be applicable to
the securities being sold through underwriters under such registration. In
such case, Holders, if requesting registration, shall be a party to any such
underwriting agreement. Such agreement shall contain such representations and
warranties by the Holders requesting registration and such other terms and
provisions as are customarily contained in underwriting agreements with
respect to secondary distributions, including, without limitation, provisions
relating to indemnities and contribution.

6.3 In any offering of Registrable Securities pursuant to a registration
hereunder, Holders shall also enter into such additional or other agreements
as may be customary in such transactions, which agreements may contain, among
other provisions, such representations and warranties as the Company or the
underwriters of such offering may reasonably request (including, without
limitation, those concerning Holders their Registrable Securities, Holders'
intended plan of distribution and any other information supplied by it to the
Company for use in such registration statement), and customary provisions
relating to indemnities and contribution.



ARTICLE VII INFORMATION BLACKOUT.

7.1 Upon written notice from the Company to Holders that the Company has
determined in good faith that sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to the
registration statement would require disclosure of non-public material
information not otherwise required to be disclosed under applicable law (A)
which disclosure would have a material adverse effect on the Company or (B)
relating to a material business transaction involving the Company (an
"Information Blackout"), the Company may postpone the filing of effectiveness
of any registration statement required hereunder and, if such registration
statement has become effective, the Company shall not be required to maintain
the effectiveness of such registration statement and Holders shall suspend
sales of Registrable Securities pursuant to such registration statement, in
each case, until the earlier of (i) forty-five (45) days after the Company
makes such good faith determination, which may, upon advanced written notice
to Holders, be renewed for a second forty-five day period if deemed necessary
in the good faith judgment of the Company, and (ii) such time as the Company
notifies the Holders that such material information has been disclosed to the
public or has ceased to be material or that sales pursuant to such
registration statement may otherwise be resumed (the number of days from such
notice from the Company until the day when the Information Blackout terminates
hereunder is hereinafter called a "Blackout Period").



7.2 Any delivery by the Company of notice of an Information Blackout during
the forty-five (45) days immediately following effectiveness of any
registration statement effected pursuant to Section 2(a) hereof shall give the
Holders the right, by written notice to the Company within twenty (20)
Business Days after the end of such Blackout Period, to cancel such
registration; in which event, such registration shall not count towards the
limits on registrations under Section 2(b).



7.3 If one or more Information Blackouts should occur, then the periods of
time that Holders may require the Company to effect the number of Demand
Registrations or Shelf Takedowns set forth in each of Sections 2(b)(i) and
2(b)(ii) shall be extended by an aggregate number of days equal to the total
number of days in the Blackout Period(s).



ARTICLE VIII RULE 144.

The Company shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to take all actions
necessary to comply with the filing requirements described in Rule 144(c)(1)
or any successor thereto so as to enable the Holders to sell Registrable
Securities without registration under the Securities Act. Upon the written
request of Holders, the Company will deliver a written statement as to whether
it has complied with the filing requirements under Rule 144(c)(1) or any
successor thereto and will cooperate in all reasonable respects with the
Holders to remove any restrictive legends contained on any certificates so as
to facilitate a sale by the Holders of such shares under Rule 144. 

ARTICLE IX PREPARATION; REASONABLE INVESTIGATION; INFORMATION



(a) In connection with the preparation and filing of each registration
statement registering Registrable Securities under the Securities Act, (i) the
Company will give the Holders and underwriters, if any, and their respective
counsel and accountants, drafts of such registration statement for their
review and comment prior to filing, (ii) during normal business hours and
subject to such reasonable limitations as the Company may impose to prevent
disruption of its business, the Company will provide the underwriters, its
counsel and accountants, as well as counsel and accountants to Holders,
reasonable and customary access to the Company's books and records and such
opportunities to discuss the business of the Company with its officers and the
independent public accountants who have certified its financial statements as
shall be necessary, in the reasonable opinion of such underwriters, its
counsel and Holder's counsel, to conduct a reasonable investigation within the
meaning of the Securities Act and (iii) as a condition precedent to including
any Registrable Securities in any such registration, the Company may require
Holders to furnish the Company such information regarding Holders and the
distribution of such securities as the Company may from time to time
reasonably request in writing or as shall be required by law or the SEC in
connection with any registration.

(b) In connection with each registration and offering of Registrable
Securities to be sold by Holders, the Company will, in accordance with
customary practice, make available for inspection by representatives of the
underwriters and any counsel or accountant retained by such Holders or
underwriters all relevant financial and other records, pertinent corporate
documents and properties of the Company and cause appropriate officers,
managers and employees of the Company to supply all information reasonably
requested by any such representative, underwriter, counsel or accountant in
connection with their due diligence exercise.

ARTICLE X INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION.



10.1 In the case of each offering of Registrable Securities made pursuant to
this Agreement, the Company shall, to the extent permitted by law, indemnify
and hold harmless Holders, their officers, directors and Affiliates, each
underwriter of Registrable Securities so offered and each Person, if any, who
controls any of the foregoing Persons within the meaning of the Securities Act
("Holders Indemnitees"), from and against any and all claims, liabilities,
losses, damages, expenses and judgments, joint or several, to which they or
any of them may become subject, under the Securities Act arising out of or
based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
contained in the registration statement (or in any preliminary or final
Prospectus included therein) relating to the offering and sale of such
Registrable Securities, or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or in
any document incorporated by reference therein, or any omission or alleged
omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; provided that the
Company shall not be liable to any Holders Indemnitee in any such case to the
extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of,
or is based upon, any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement, or any
omission, if such statement or omission shall have been made in reliance upon
and in conformity with information furnished to the Company in writing by or
on behalf of Holders specifically for use in the preparation of the
registration statement (or in any preliminary or final Prospectus included
therein), or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto. Such indemnity shall
remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on
behalf of Holders and shall survive the transfer of such securities. The
foregoing indemnity is in addition to any liability which the Company may
otherwise have to any Holders Indemnitee.



10.2 In the case of each offering of Registrable Securities made pursuant to
this Agreement, each Holder shall, severally, and not jointly, to the extent
permitted by law, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its officers and
Affiliates, and each Person, if any, who controls any of the foregoing within
the meaning of the Securities Act and (if requested by the underwriters) each
underwriter who participates in the offering and each Person, if any, who
controls any such underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act (the
"Company Indemnitees"), from and against any and all claims, liabilities,
losses, damages, expenses and judgments, joint or several, to which they or
any of them may become subject, under the Securities Act arising out of or
based upon, any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material
fact contained in the registration statement (or in any preliminary or final
Prospectus included therein) relating to the offering and sale of such
Registrable Securities or 

any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or any omission or alleged
omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but in each case only
to the extent that such untrue statement is contained in, or such fact is
omitted from, information furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf
of such Holder specifically for use in the preparation of such registration
statement (or in any preliminary or final Prospectus included therein). The
aggregate liability of each Holder under such indemnity provision shall be
limited to an amount equal to the total net proceeds received by such Holder
from such offering. Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect
regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Company and shall
survive the transfer of such securities. The foregoing indemnity is in
addition to any liability which a Holder may otherwise have to any Company
Indemnitee.



10.3 In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall
be instituted involving any Person in respect of which indemnity may be sought
pursuant to this Section 10, such Person (the "indemnified party") shall
promptly notify the Person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the
"indemnifying party") in writing; provided that the failure of any indemnified
party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the indemnifying
party of its obligations provided for in Section 10(a) or (b), except to the
extent that the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced by such failure to
give notice. In case any such proceeding shall be brought against any
indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the
commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate
therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other
indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with
counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party and shall pay as
incurred the reasonable fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such
proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right
to retain its own counsel at its own expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the indemnifying party shall pay as incurred the fees and expenses of one
specified counsel retained by the indemnified party in the event (i) the
indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the
retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding
(including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the
indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel, in
the written opinion of such counsel, would be inappropriate due to actual or
potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the
indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related
proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees and
expenses of more than one separate firm for all such indemnified parties. The
indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding
effected without its written consent but if settled with such consent or if
there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to
indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by
reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party will consent to
entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which (A) does not include
as an unconditional term the giving by the claimant or plaintiff, to the
indemnified party, of a release from all liability in respect of such claim or
litigation or (B) involves the imposition of equitable remedies or the
imposition of any non-financial obligations on the indemnified party.



10.4 If the indemnification provided for in this Section 10 is held by a court
of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable in respect of any losses, claims,
damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) referred
to herein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such
indemnified party hereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by
the indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or
liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) in proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative fault of all parties in connection with
the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or
liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof), as well as any
other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault shall be
determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to
state a material fact relates to information supplied by the party and the
parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to
correct or prevent such statement or omission.



The parties agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions
pursuant to this Section 10(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by
any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable
considerations referred to above in this Section 10(d). The amount paid or
payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or
liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) referred to above
shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by
such indemnified party in connection 

with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the
provisions of this subsection (d), no person guilty of fraudulent
misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act)
shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such
fraudulent misrepresentation and no indemnifying party shall be required to
contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at
which the securities were offered to the public by the indemnifying party
exceeds the amount of any damages which the indemnifying party has otherwise
been required to pay by reason of an untrue statement or omission.

10.5 The indemnity provided for hereunder shall not inure to the benefit of
any indemnified party to the extent that such indemnified party failed to
comply with the applicable Prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities
Act as then applicable to the person asserting the loss, claim, damage or
liability for which indemnity is sought.



ARTICLE XI EXPENSES.



In connection with any registration under this Agreement, the Company shall
pay all Registration Expenses. Holders shall be responsible for all other
expenses incurred in connection with such registration.

ARTICLE XII IN-KIND DISTRIBUTIONS.



If a Holder seeks to effectuate an in-kind distribution of all or part of its
shares to its direct or indirect equityholders, the Company will, subject to
applicable lockups, work with such Holder and the Company's transfer agent to
facilitate such in-kind distribution in the manner reasonably requested by
such Holder.

ARTICLE XIII MERGER OR CONSOLIDATION.



In the event the Company engages in a merger or consolidation in which the
shares of Common Stock are converted into securities of another company,
appropriate arrangements will be made so that the registration rights provided
under this Agreement continue to be provided to Holders by the issuer of such
securities. To the extent such new issuer, or any other company acquired by
the Company in a merger or consolidation, was bound by registration rights
obligations that would conflict with the provisions of this Agreement, the
Company will use its reasonable best efforts to modify any such "inherited"
registration rights obligations so as not to interfere in any material
respects with the rights provided under this Agreement.

ARTICLE XIV NOTICES.



Except as otherwise provided below, whenever it is provided in this Agreement
that any notice, demand, request, consent, approval, declaration or other
communication shall or may be given to or served upon any of the parties
hereto, or whenever any of the parties hereto desires to provide to or serve
upon the other party any other communication with respect to this Agreement,
each such notice, demand, request, consent, approval, declaration or other

of the Company.



The furnishing of any notice required hereunder may be waived in writing by
the party entitled to receive such notice. Every notice, demand, request,
consent, approval, declaration or other communication hereunder shall be
deemed to have been duly furnished or served on the party to which it is
addressed, in the case of delivery in person or by facsimile, on the date when
sent, in the case of overnight mail, on the day after it is sent and in all
other cases, five Business Days after it is sent. Failure or delay in
delivering copies of any notice, demand, request, consent, approval,
declaration or other communication to the persons designated above to receive
copies shall in no way adversely affect the effectiveness of such notice,
demand, request, consent, approval, declaration or other communication.

ARTICLE XV ENTIRE AGREEMENT; AMENDMENT.



This Agreement represents the entire agreement and understanding among the
parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any
and all prior oral and written agreements, arrangements and understandings
among the parties hereto with respect to such subject matter, and this
Agreement can be amended, supplemented or changed, and any provision hereof
can be waived or a departure from any provision hereof can be consented to,
only by a written instrument making specific reference to this Agreement
signed by the Company and the Holders; provided that any waiver must be signed
by the party entitled to the benefit of the term or matter being waived.

ARTICLE XVI PARAGRAPH HEADINGS.



The paragraph headings contained in this Agreement are for general reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any manner the meaning, interpretation
or construction of the terms or other provisions of this Agreement.

ARTICLE XVII APPLICABLE LAW.



This Agreement shall be governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with
the laws of the State of North Carolina applicable to contracts to be made,
executed, delivered and performed wholly within such state and, in any case,
without regard to the conflicts of law principles of such state.

ARTICLE XVIII CONSENT TO JURISDICTION; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.



18.1 The parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the non-exclusive
jurisdiction of the courts of the State of North Carolina and the federal
courts of the United States of America located in the State of North Carolina,
and appropriate appellate courts therefrom, over any dispute arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, and
each party hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of such
dispute or proceeding may be heard and determined in such courts. The parties
hereby irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
any objection which they may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of
any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby brought in such court or any defense of
inconvenient forum for the maintenance of such dispute. Each of the parties
hereto agrees that a judgment in any such dispute may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.
This consent to jurisdiction is being given solely for purposes of this
Agreement and is not intended to, and shall not, confer consent to
jurisdiction with respect to any other dispute in which a party to this
Agreement may become involved.



18.2 EACH PARTY, ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND ITS RESPECTIVE SUCCESSORS AND
ASSIGNS, HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY RIGHTS THEY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY
IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION BASED UPON, OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE

ARTICLE XIX SEVERABILITY.



If at any time subsequent to the date hereof, any provision of this Agreement
shall be held by any court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or
unenforceable, such provision shall be of no force and effect, but the
illegality or unenforceability of such provision shall have no effect upon and
shall not impair the enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement.

ARTICLE XX EQUITABLE REMEDIES.



The parties hereto agree that irreparable harm would occur in the event that
any of the agreements and provisions of this Agreement were not performed
fully by the parties hereto in accordance with their specific terms or
conditions or were otherwise breached, and that money damages are an
inadequate remedy for breach of this Agreement because of the difficulty of
ascertaining and quantifying the amount of damage that will be suffered by the
parties hereto in the event that this Agreement is not performed in accordance
with its terms or conditions or is otherwise breached. It is accordingly
hereby agreed that the parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to restrain, enjoin and prevent breaches of this Agreement by the
other parties and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in
any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, such remedy
being in addition to and not in lieu of, any other rights and remedies to
which the other parties are entitled to at law or in equity.

ARTICLE XXI NO WAIVER.



The failure of any party at any time or times to require performance of any
provision hereof shall not affect the right at a later time to enforce the
same. No waiver by any party of any condition, and no breach of any provision,
term, covenant, representation or warranty contained in this Agreement,
whether by conduct or otherwise, in any one or more instances, shall be deemed
to be construed as a further or continuing waiver of any such condition or of
the breach of any other provision, term, covenant, representation or warranty
of this Agreement.

ARTICLE XXII COUNTERPARTS.



This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute but
one and the same original instrument.

ARTICLE XXIII SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.



Any and all rights, duties and obligations hereunder shall not be assigned,
transferred or delegated by any party hereto without the prior written consent
of the other party hereto, except that without the prior written consent of
the Company, a Holder may assign, transfer or delegate any of its rights,
duties and obligations hereunder to one or more of its Affiliates who receives
Registrable Securities. Any transfer or assignment made other than as provided
in the first sentence of this Section 23 shall be null and void. Subject to
the foregoing and except as otherwise provided herein, the provisions of this
Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon, the successors,
permitted assigns, heirs, executors and administrators of the parties hereto.

PHANTOM EQUITY PLAN

This agreement made this __ day of __, by and between Yadkin Financial

Agreement and Plan of Merger by and among Yadkin Financial Corporation,
VantageSouth Bancshares, Inc., and Piedmont Community Bank Holdings, Inc.

WHEREAS, in connection with the Merger, Company assumed all obligations and
liabilities under the Piedmont Community Bank Holdings, Inc. Phantom Equity
Plan dated effective as of January 24, 2014 (the "Plan") attached hereto as
Exhibit A;



WHEREAS, Company wishes to establish a trust (hereinafter called "Trust") and
to contribute to the Trust assets that shall be held therein, subject to the
claims of Company\'s creditors in the event of Company\'s Insolvency, as
herein defined, until paid to Plan participants and their beneficiaries in
such manner and at such times as specified in the Plan;



WHEREAS, it is the intention of the parties that this Trust shall constitute
an unfunded arrangement and shall not affect the status of the Plan as an
unfunded plan maintained for the purpose of providing deferred compensation
for a select group of management or highly compensated employees;



WHEREAS, as part of the Merger, Company is obligated to distribute to the
stockholders of Piedmont who participated in the Merger ("Participating
Stockholders") contingent consideration consisting of the "Contingent Shares"
as that term is defined in the Merger Agreement;



WHEREAS, this Trust is being established to serve as a source of payment of
both (i) amounts payable under the Plan to Plan participants, and (ii) amounts
distributable as Contingent Shares to Participating Stockholders under the
Merger Agreement;



WHEREAS, it is the intention of Company to make contributions to the Trust to
provide itself with a source of shares of common stock of the Company to

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties do hereby establish the Trust and agree that the

ARTICLE I

ESTABLISHMENT OF TRUST



1.1 For purposes of this Trust agreement, the term Company shall refer to the
Company and its successors and assigns.



1.2 Company hereby deposits with Trustee in trust [856,447] shares of Common
Stock of the Company (the "Shares"), which shall become the principal of the
Trust to be held, administered and disposed of by Trustee as 

provided in this Trust Agreement.



1.3 The Trust hereby established shall be irrevocable.

instructions acceptable to Trustee for determining the amounts so payable, the
form in which such amount is to be paid (as provided for or available under
the Plan), and the time of commencement for payment of such amounts. Except as
otherwise provided herein, Trustee shall make payments to the Plan
participants and their beneficiaries in accordance with such Payment Schedule.
The Trustee shall make provision for the reporting and withholding of any
federal, state or local taxes that may be required to be withheld with respect
to the payment of benefits pursuant to the terms of the Plan and shall pay
amounts withheld to the appropriate taxing authorities or determine that such
amounts have been reported, withheld and paid by Company.

benefits under the Plan shall be determined by the Plan Administrator or such
party as it shall designate under the Plan.

2.3 Trustee shall make payment of benefits directly to Plan participants or
their beneficiaries as they become due under the terms of the Plan, with

Company or the Trustee, as applicable, (in the amounts determined by the Plan
Administrator) or otherwise provided for in a manner acceptable to the Company
or the Trustee, as applicable, for remittance to the appropriate taxing
authority. In addition, if the principal of the Trust, and any earnings
thereon, are not sufficient to make payments of benefits in accordance with
the terms of the Plan, Company shall make the balance of each such payment as
it falls due.



2.4 Each Plan participant who would otherwise be entitled to receive a
fractional share of Company common stock shall instead receive an amount of
cash, without interest, equal to such fraction of the then fair market value

Share into cash.

TRUSTEE RESPONSIBILITY REGARDING PAYMENTS TO TRUST BENEFICIARY WHEN COMPANY IS
INSOLVENT



4.1 Trustee shall cease payment of benefits to Plan participants and their
beneficiaries if the Company is Insolvent. Company shall be considered
"Insolvent" for purposes of this Trust Agreement if (i) Company is unable to
pay its debts as they become due, (ii) Company is subject to a pending
proceeding as a debtor under the United States Bankruptcy Code, or (iii)
Company is determined to be insolvent by any applicable federal or state bank
regulator.



4.2 At all times during the continuance of this Trust, the principal and
income of the Trust shall be subject to claims of general creditors of Company
under federal and state law as set forth below.

have the duty to inform Trustee in writing of Company\'s Insolvency. If a
person claiming to be a creditor of Company alleges in writing to Trustee that
Company has become Insolvent, Trustee shall determine whether Company is
Insolvent and, pending such determination, Trustee shall discontinue payment
of benefits to Plan participants or their beneficiaries.

(b)Unless Trustee has actual knowledge of Company\'s Insolvency, or has
received notice from Company or a person claiming to be a creditor alleging
that Company is Insolvent, Trustee shall have no duty to inquire whether
Company is Insolvent. Trustee may in all events rely on such evidence
concerning Company\'s solvency as may be furnished to Trustee and that
provides Trustee with a reasonable basis for making a determination concerning
Company\'s solvency.



(c)If at any time Trustee has determined that Company is Insolvent, Trustee
shall discontinue payments to Plan participants, Participating Stockholders or
their beneficiaries and shall hold the assets of the Trust for the benefit of
Company\'s general creditors. Nothing in this Trust Agreement shall in any way
diminish any rights of Plan participants, Participating Stockholders or their
beneficiaries to pursue their rights as general creditors of Company with
respect to benefits due under the Plan or otherwise.



(d)Trustee shall resume the payment of benefits to Plan participants,
Participating Stockholders or their beneficiaries in accordance with Articles
2 and 3 of this Trust Agreement only after Trustee has determined that Company
is not Insolvent (or is no longer Insolvent).



(e)Provided that there are sufficient assets, if Trustee discontinues the
payment of benefits from the Trust pursuant to this Article 4 hereof and
subsequently resumes such payments, the first payment following such
discontinuance shall include the aggregate amount of all payments due to Plan
participants, Participating Stockholders or their beneficiaries under the
terms of the Plan for the period of such discontinuance, less the aggregate
amount of any payments made to Plan participants, Participating Stockholders
or their beneficiaries by Company in lieu of the payments provided for
hereunder during any such period of discontinuance.

Trust) will be exercised by the Trustee or the person designated by the
Trustee. The Trustee hereby appoints [insert names of individuals selected by

rights. No change shall be made to the foregoing appointments without the
consent of the Plan Administrator.



6.3 In connection with the payment to a Plan participant or Participating
Stockholder of cash in lieu of the receipt of a fractional share pursuant to
Section 2.4 or Section 3.2 hereof, the Trustee shall have the power to
aggregate all fractional shares that Plan participants and Participating
Stockholders would then be otherwise entitled to receive, and sell them as
soon as practicable on or after the date that the fractional shares would
otherwise be issuable at the then prevailing prices on the open market, on
behalf of those Plan participants and Participating Stockholders who would
otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share. After the completion of

rata share of the total net proceeds of that sale, less a proportionate amount
of any costs incurred in connection with such sale.
