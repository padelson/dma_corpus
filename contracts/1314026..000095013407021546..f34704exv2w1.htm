integral part of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement and that, without those
agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement. Each party acknowledges that all of
the payment amounts set out in Section&nbsp;7.5 are payments of liquidated damages which are a genuine
pre-estimate of the damages which the party entitled to such damages will suffer or incur as a
result of the event giving rise to such payment and the resultant termination of this Agreement and
are not penalties. Each party irrevocably waives any right that it may have to raise as a defence
that any such liquidated damages are excessive or punitive. For greater certainty, the parties
agree that the payment of an amount pursuant to Section&nbsp;7.5 is the sole monetary remedy of Parent
and Acquisitionco. Nothing contained herein will preclude a party from seeking injunctive relief
to restrain any breach or threatened breach of the covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement or otherwise to obtain specific performance of any such
covenants or agreements.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Dear Sirs:

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undersigned shareholder of Aspreva Pharmaceuticals Corporation (the &#147;Aspreva Shareholder&#148;)
understands that Galenica Canada Ltd. (&#147;Galenica&#148;) proposes to enter into an agreement (the
&#147;Combination Agreement&#148;) with Aspreva Pharmaceuticals Corporation (&#147;Aspreva&#148;) pursuant to which
Galenica will acquire all of the outstanding Common Shares in the capital of Aspreva (the &#147;Aspreva
Common Shares&#148;), and all of the outstanding options to purchase Aspreva Common Shares (&#147;Aspreva
Options&#148;) will be terminated and cancelled in exchange for a cash payment, under the plan of
arrangement (the &#147;Arrangement&#148;), a draft of which is attached as Schedule&nbsp;D to the Combination
Agreement. Pursuant to the Arrangement, holders of Aspreva Common Shares will receive, in exchange
for Aspreva Common Shares, cash consideration per Aspreva Common Share in the amount set forth in
the Combination Agreement and holders of Aspreva Options will receive a cash payment in exchange
for their Aspreva Options on the terms set out therein.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Agreement sets out the terms and conditions of the agreement of the Aspreva Shareholder
to take certain actions and to do certain things, including to vote or cause to be voted the
Aspreva Common Shares and Aspreva Options, if any, owned by the Aspreva Shareholder, and the
Aspreva Common Shares over which the Aspreva Shareholder has control or direction, in favour of the
Arrangement Resolution approving the Arrangement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement have the meaning given to such
terms in the Combination Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Aspreva Shareholder acknowledges that Galenica would not enter into the Combination
Agreement but for the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Aspreva Shareholders.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As used herein, the term &#147;Securities&#148; means any securities of Aspreva that may be voted at the
Aspreva Meeting (as hereinafter defined) including any Aspreva Options or securities that result
from any reclassification, conversion, consolidation, subdivision or exchange of, or distribution
or dividend on, the Aspreva Common Shares.
