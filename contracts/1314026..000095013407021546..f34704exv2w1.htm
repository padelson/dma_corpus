desirable to cause Acquisitionco to comply with all covenants and agreements
of Acquisitionco contained herein and, upon the Arrangement becoming
effective, under the Plan of Arrangement, in accordance with the terms
and conditions hereof and thereof. The agreements,  
   

  ##### 

  

   

     

  

       |   |   | covenants, representations and warranties and other
obligations herein (including the representations and warranties in Article
4) which are expressed to be made by Acquisitionco and Parent or by
Acquisitionco or Parent are joint and several agreements, covenants,
representations and warranties and obligations.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (d)  |   | Acquisitionco and Parent shall, and Parent shall cause
Acquisitionco to, make arrangements to borrow or otherwise be in possession
of, prior to the Effective Date, all funds required to be provided by
Acquisitionco to the Depositary (as defined in the Plan of Arrangement). In
connection therewith:  
   

  

       | (i)  |   | Acquisitionco and Parent shall, and Parent shall
cause Acquisitionco to, use its best efforts to negotiate and enter into
the Definitive Financing Agreements with such third parties (it being
understood that such Definitive Financing Agreements shall contain no funding
or financing conditions that are broader or more onerous than the conditions
set forth in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 and shall otherwise be fully consistent
with this Agreement);  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | without limiting the effect of the last two sentences
of this Section 5.3, Acquisitionco and Parent shall, and Parent shall
cause Acquisitionco to, use best efforts to satisfy all conditions in such
Definitive Financing Agreements;  
      
    | (iii)  |   | neither Acquisitionco nor Parent shall enter into, or
permit the entering into, of any material amendment to any Commitment Letter
or Definitive Financing Agreement, nor shall Acquisitionco or Parent waive

interests of Acquisitionco, Parent, the Company or any of the
Securityholders;  
      
    | (iv)  |   | in the event any portion of the financing referred to
in clause (i) becomes unavailable, Acquisitionco and Parent shall, and Parent
shall cause Acquisitionco to, use its best efforts to arrange to obtain any
such portion from alternative sources as promptly as practicable;  
      
    | (v)  |   | Parent will agree to guarantee Acquisitioncos
obligations under the financing referred to in clause (i) and shall use its

2007, request in writing in accordance with Section 3.2 of the Mandate Letter
that the parties to the Mandate Letter enter into the "Facility

Acquisitionco and Parent shall give the Company prompt notice of any breach by
any party to any Commitment Letter or any Definitive Financing Agreement, or
any actual or purported termination or repudiation of any such Commitment
Letter or Definitive Financing Agreement, 

  ##### 

  

   

and shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis in
reasonable detail of the status of the arrangements to obtain such financing.
For the avoidance of doubt, if such financing is not obtained, Acquisitionco
shall continue to be obligated to consummate the Arrangement, and Parent
shall continue to be obligated to cause Acquisitionco to consummate the
Arrangement, subject to and on the terms contemplated by this Agreement. Any
failure to consummate the Arrangement as a result of the failure by
Acquisitionco and Parent to obtain the financing referred to in this section
shall constitute a breach by Acquisitionco and Parent hereunder. 

   

5.4 _Access to Information_  

   

 Upon reasonable notice and subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, the Company agrees to provide Parent and Acquisitionco and their respective representatives, officers, directors, employees and agents and other authorized representatives and advisors (including financial advisors, counsel and accountants) (collectively, the "Representatives") with reasonable access (in a manner that minimizes disruption to the conduct of the Companys business) during normal business hours to the Companys books and records and selected employees (determined jointly by the Company and Parent), and during such period, the Company shall furnish promptly to Parent all readily available information concerning its business (including regularly prepared monthly financial reports) as Parent may reasonably request; _provided, however_ , that the Company shall not be required to permit any inspection, or to disclose any information, if in the reasonable judgment of the Company such inspection or disclosure could (a) result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties, (b) violate any obligation of the Company with respect to confidentiality, (c) jeopardize protections afforded the Company under the attorney-client privilege or the attorney work product doctrine, (d) violate any Laws, or (e) materially interfere with the conduct of the Companys business. All information obtained by Acquisitionco or Parent and their Representatives pursuant to this Section 5.4 shall be treated as "Confidential Information" for purposes of the Confidentiality Agreement. 

  

5.5 _Indemnification and Insurance_  

   

       | (a)  |   | Acquisitionco and Parent and the Company agree
that all rights to indemnification for acts or omissions occurring prior to
or at the Effective Time existing as of the date of this Agreement in favour
of the present and former directors and officers of the Company or of any of
the Subsidiaries and present and former directors and officers of the Company
or of any of the Subsidiaries serving or who have served at the request of
the Company or any Subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee, agent or
representative of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust,
employee benefit plan or other entity or enterprise (each such present or
former director or officer of the Company or of any Subsidiary being herein
referred to as an "Indemnified Party" and such persons collectively being
referred to as the "Indemnified Parties") as provided in its constating
documents or in written contracts in effect on the date of this Agreement and
required to be set forth in the Disclosure Schedule (including all provisions
relating to advances for the funding of costs and expenses in connection with
indemnification arrangements) shall survive the completion of the Arrangement
and shall continue in full force and  
---|---|---|--- 
   

    ##### 

 

   

       |   |   | effect and without modification until the sixth
anniversary of the date of this Agreement, and Parent and Acquisitionco will
cause the Company and any successor to the Company, and the Subsidiaries
(including any successors thereto), to honour such rights of indemnification
and indemnify the Indemnified Parties pursuant thereto, with respect to
actions or omissions of the Indemnified Parties occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | Provided the Arrangement becomes effective, for a
period of not less than six years after the Effective Date the Company will,
and Parent and Acquisitionco will cause the Company and any successor to the
Company to, continue and maintain in effect policies of directors and
officers liability insurance, without any gaps, lapses or reduction in scope
or coverage, for the benefit of the Indemnified Parties in such amounts, and
with such deductibles, retained amounts, coverages and exclusions
and otherwise on terms and conditions no less advantageous or favourable to
the Indemnified Parties than such insurance maintained by the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time and providing protection in respect
of claims arising from or related to facts or events which occurred on or
prior to the Effective Date, provided that in no event shall the Company be
required to spend in one year as premiums for such insurance more than 250%
of the annual amount currently paid by the Company. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, prior to the Effective Time the Company may, in
the alternative, at its option, purchase prepaid non-cancellable run-off
directors and officers liability insurance providing coverage (on terms and
conditions as or more favourable to the Indemnified Parties) for a period of
up to six years from the Effective Date with respect to claims arising from
or related to facts or events which occur on or prior to the Effective Date.
The cost of purchasing such directors and officers liability insurance will
not exceed 350% of the total amount paid in annual premiums by the Company
for all director and officers liability insurance at the last renewal of the
directors and officers liability insurance that occurred before
the Effective Date.  
      
    | (c)  |   | In the event the Company or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any person, then, and in such case, proper provision shall be made
so that such successors and assigns of the Company or, at Acquisitioncos
option, Acquisitionco, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section
5.5.  
      
    | (d)  |   | Acquisitionco will ensure that the constating documents
of the Company and any successor to the Company and the constating documents
of the Subsidiaries (or any successor to any such subsidiary), will contain
provisions with respect to indemnification now set forth in the constating
documents of the Company and the subsidiaries of the Company (or equivalent
provisions), as the case may be, such that all rights to indemnification
existing in favour of the Indemnified Parties as provided in the constating
documents of the Company and of the subsidiaries of the Company,
or equivalent provisions, will survive and continue in full force  
   

  ##### 

  

   

     

  

       |   |   | and effect and without modification, with respect
to actions or omissions of the Indemnified Parties occurring prior to the
Effective Time in accordance with the terms of such constating documents, or
equivalent provisions, as at the Effective Time.  
---|---|---|---

terms of all existing employment, retention, deferred compensation,
incentive, termination, severance and change of control agreements
and arrangements of the Company and all arrangements for the benefit of the
officers or Employees of the Company party thereto, and will make available
to the Company or any successor to the Company any financing required in
order to make payment of amounts payable under any employment retention,
deferred compensation, incentive, termination, severance and change of
control agreements and arrangements. Parent and Acquisitionco also covenant
and agree, and after the Effective Time Parent and Acquisitionco will cause
the Company and any successor to the Company, for a period of not less than
two years after the Effective Date, to deal with any Continuing Employees
whose employment may be terminated after the Effective Date, in a fair and
equitable manner consistent with applicable Laws and the existing termination
policies of the Company and the Subsidiaries as of the date of this
Agreement.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | Parent and Acquisitionco covenant and agree, and after
the Effective Time Parent and Acquisitionco will cause the Company and any
successor to the Company (including any successor company) to honour and
comply with all obligations of the Company under the Plans, as the same may
be amended or modified as permitted hereunder (it being acknowledged by
Parent and Acquisitionco that the Arrangement shall constitute a "Change in
Control" under the agreements set out in Section 3.4 of the Disclosure
Letter), and that following the Arrangement becoming effective,
in circumstances specified in the Plans (for example a director of the
Company ceasing to be a director, or a key executive of the Company ceasing
to be an Employee of the Company or a Subsidiary) the Company will be
required to pay amounts calculated under these Plans and, to the extent
necessary, following the Effective Time, Acquisitionco and Parent shall make
available to the Company or any successor to the Company (including any
successor company) any financing required in order to make payment of amounts
payable under these Plans.  
      
    | (c)  |   | From and after the Effective Time, Parent and
Acquisitionco shall cause the Company to permit all Continuing Employees to
participate in the benefit plans, programs, and arrangements of Parent or its
subsidiaries (the "Parent Plans") to the same extent as similarly situated
employees of Parent or its subsidiaries. Continuing Employees shall be given
credit under the Parent Plans for all years of service with the Company prior
to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility,  
   

  ##### 

  

   

     

  

       |   |   | vesting in respect of matching contributions under
Parent Plans and the determination of rate of vacation accrual.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (d)  |   | From and after the Effective Time, Acquisitionco shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause any pre-existing conditions
or limitations and eligibility waiting periods under any Parent Plan that is
a group health plan to be waived with respect to the Continuing Employees and
their eligible dependents to the same extent waived under comparable employee
plans as of the date of this Agreement, and (ii) under the Parent Plans give
each of the Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents credit for the
plan year in which the Effective Time occurs toward applicable deductibles
and annual out of pocket limits for expenses incurred prior to the Effective
Time for which payment has been made to the same extent credited
under comparable employee plans.  
      
    | (e)  |   | Parent and Acquisitionco covenant and agree, and after
the Effective Time they will cause the Company and any successor to the
Company, to establish a retention plan for the benefit of Continuing
Employees (the "Retention Plan") pursuant to which the Company will make
aggregate payments to Continuing Employees of not less than $4 million over
the 24 month period after the Effective Date. Parent and Acquisitionco will
make available to the Company or any successor to the Company any
financing required in order to make payment of amounts payable pursuant to
the Retention Plan. The amounts payable under the Retention Plan will be in
addition to any other amounts otherwise payable to Continuing Employees,
including pursuant to any existing retention plans.  
   

  

5.7 _Covenants Regarding Non-Solicitation_  

   

       | (a)  |   | The Company shall, and shall direct and cause its
Representatives and the Subsidiaries and their Representatives to immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any existing solicitation of or negotiations
with any person (other than Parent and Acquisitionco and their respective
Representatives) that may be ongoing as of the date of this Agreement with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal, whether or not initiated by the Company.
The Company shall immediately eliminate access to all data rooms, electronic
or otherwise, in connection with the possible sale of the Company or
its assets or the assets of any Subsidiary. The Company shall request, and
exercise its rights to require, the return or destruction of all confidential
information of the Company and the Subsidiaries that was provided to third
parties by the Company after May 1, 2007 in connection with the possible sale
of the Company.

    | (b)  |   | The Company agrees that, except as contemplated in
Section 5.8(b) or with the consent in writing of Parent or Acquisitionco,
prior to the date the Arrangement Resolution is approved by the
Securityholders as required by this Agreement, the Company will not, and will
not authorize or permit its Representatives, the Subsidiaries and the
Subsidiaries Representatives to: (i) solicit or knowingly encourage the
making of an Acquisition Proposal by any person (other than Parent
and Acquisitionco), including by way of furnishing non-public information

       |   |   | regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries to such
person, (ii) participate in any negotiations or discussions with any person
(other than Parent and Acquisitionco) regarding any Acquisition Proposal made
by such person, (iii) approve or recommend any Acquisition Proposal, (iv)
enter into any agreement in respect of any Acquisition Proposal with the
person making such Acquisition Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 5.8(b) or (v) withdraw or
modify in a manner adverse to Acquisitionco, or adopt a resolution
withdrawing or modifying in a manner adverse to Acquisitionco, the
recommendation of the board of directors of the Company that
the Securityholders vote in favour of the Arrangement Resolution it being
understood and agreed that a failure by the board of directors to affirm the
approval or recommendation of the board of directors of the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby within ten Business Days after an
Acquisition Proposal has been publicly announced will be deemed to be an
adverse modification; _provided, however_ , that prior to the date the
Arrangement Resolution is approved by the Securityholders as required by this
Agreement, nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent (A) the board of
directors of the Company from approving or recommending an
Acquisition Proposal or (B) the Company from entering into an agreement
(subject to compliance with Sections 5.7(c) and 7.2(c)) or engaging in
negotiations or discussions with any person who has made a bona fide
Acquisition Proposal that was not solicited or knowingly encouraged in breach
of this Section 5.7(b), or with any Representative of any such person, where
the board of directors of the Company determines in good faith
after consultation with the Companys financial advisors and outside legal
counsel that the Acquisition Proposal constitutes (or would constitute, if
consummated in accordance with its terms), or could reasonably be expected to
result in, a Superior Proposal.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (c)  |   | Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.7(b) above
or any other provision of this Agreement, the Company may accept, approve,
recommend or enter into any agreement with any person providing for or to
facilitate any Acquisition Proposal (a "Proposed Agreement") if (i) such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes (or would constitute, if consummated in
accordance with its terms) a Superior Proposal, and (ii) the Company provides
Acquisitionco with a copy of such Proposed Agreement not less than five
Business Days prior to its proposed execution by the Company. During such
five Business Day period, the Company acknowledges and agrees that
Acquisitionco shall have the opportunity, but not the obligation, to deliver
to the Company a binding offer to amend the terms of this Agreement (an
"Amended Offer") and the Company shall negotiate in good faith with
Acquisitionco during such five Business Day period with respect to any
Amended Offer. Any such Amended Offer must be accompanied by a form of
amendment to this Agreement duly executed on behalf of Parent and
Acquisitionco, and with evidence satisfactory to the Company acting
reasonably that the Parent and Acquisitionco have made adequate arrangements
to ensure that required funds will be available to the Parent for the
consummation of the transaction reflected in the Amended Offer. The board of
directors of the Company shall review any Amended Offer submitted by
Acquisitionco within such five Business Day  
   

   ##### 

  

  

       |   |   | period. If the board of directors of the Company
determines in light of the Amended Offer that the Proposed Agreement no
longer constitutes a Superior Proposal when compared to the Amended Offer:  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (i)  |   | the Company shall not enter into the Proposed
Agreement or support in any way the Acquisition Proposal reflected in the
Proposed Agreement;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | the Companys board of directors shall not withdraw,
modify or change its recommendation of the Arrangement on account of the
Proposed Agreement; and  
      
    | (iii)  |   | the Company, Parent and Acquisitionco shall enter
into an amendment to this Agreement in the form accompanying the Amended
Offer.  
   

   

If the board of directors of the Company continues to believe, acting in good
faith and in the proper discharge of its fiduciary duties (after consultation
with its financial advisor and its outside legal counsel) that the
Acquisition Proposal provided for in the Proposed Agreement continues to be a
Superior Proposal when compared to the Amended Offer, and therefore rejects
the Amended Offer, or if Acquisitionco fails to submit an Amended Offer
during such five Business Day period, the Company shall be entitled to enter
into the Proposed Agreement upon payment to Acquisitionco of the Termination
Fee. The Company acknowledges and agrees that each successive modification of
any Acquisition Proposal that changes the proposed purchase price payable
under or that materially changes the non-price terms of such Acquisition
Proposal shall initiate an additional notice period of three Business Days.
If the Company provides Acquisitionco with a notice under this section on
a date that is less than five Business Days prior to the Meeting, the Company
shall adjourn the Meeting to a date that is not less than five Business Days
and not more than ten Business Days after the date of such notice. 

  

       | (d)  |   | The Company shall ensure that its Representatives
are aware of the provisions of this Section 5.7, and the Company shall be
responsible for any breach of this Section 5.7 by such Representatives.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

5.8 _Notification of Acquisition Proposal_  

   

       | (a)  |   | The Company will promptly (and in any event
within two Business Days) notify Acquisitionco first orally and then in
writing of any proposal or offer constituting an Acquisition Proposal, or any
request for non-public information that would reasonably be expected to lead
to an Acquisition Proposal, of which any of its officers or directors become
aware, received by the Company after the date of this Agreement. Such written
notice will include a copy of any written Acquisition Proposal (and
any amendment thereof) which has been received by the Company or, if no
written Acquisition Proposal has been received, a description of the material
terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, the identity of the person
making such Acquisition Proposal and such other material details of such  
---|---|---|--- 
   

   ##### 

  

  

       |   |   | Acquisition Proposal as Acquisitionco may
reasonably request. The Company shall promptly advise Acquisitionco of any
material change to the status or terms of such Acquisition Proposal.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | If (i) the board of directors of the Company determines
in good faith after consultation with the Companys financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes (or would
constitute, if consummated in accordance with its terms), or could reasonably
be expected to result in, a Superior Proposal, and (ii) such Acquisition
Proposal does not by its terms contemplate a due diligence investigation
lasting more than five Business Days to be undertaken by the person making
such Acquisition Proposal, then, and only in such case, the Company may,
subject to the execution of a confidentiality agreement by the person who
made such Acquisition Proposal containing confidentiality restrictions, taken
as a whole, not materially less favourable to the Company than the
confidentiality restrictions in the Confidentiality Agreement (or in reliance
on a confidentiality agreement that was entered into prior to the date of
this Agreement), provide such person or any Representative, affiliate, lender
or other actual or prospective financing source of such person with, or
access to, non-public information regarding the Company and the Subsidiaries,
provided that:  
   

  

       | (iii)  |   | a confidentiality agreement entered into prior
to the date of this Agreement may be amended by the Company to expressly
permit such other party to make an Acquisition Proposal; and  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (iv)  |   | the Company will promptly provide Acquisitionco with,
or access to, all non-public information provided by the Company to such
other person after receipt of such Acquisition Proposal and not previously
provided to Acquisitionco or Parent and provide Acquisitionco with access to
all further non-public information regarding the Company provided to such
other person not previously provided to Acquisitionco or Parent.  
   

  

5.9 _Permitted Activities_  

   

 Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit or prevent the Company or its board of directors or officers from: (a) making any disclosure of or in relation to an Acquisition Proposal prior to the Effective Time if, in the good faith judgment of the board of directors, after consultation with outside legal counsel, such disclosure is necessary for the directors or officers of the Company to act in a manner consistent with their duties or is otherwise required under applicable Laws, including obligations under Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act, if applicable; (b) responding, within the time and in the manner required by applicable Laws, to any take-over bid or tender or exchange offer made for Common Shares or any other securities of the Company; or (c) taking any other action in relation to an Acquisition Proposal to the extent required under applicable securities Laws or orders or otherwise mandated by any Governmental Entity.

5.10 _Pre-Acquisition Reorganizations_  

   

       | (a)  |   | The Company agrees that, upon request by
Acquisitionco, the Company shall, and shall cause the Subsidiaries to, in
each case, at the expense of Acquisitionco, use its commercially reasonable
efforts to:  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (i)  |   | effect such reorganization of its business,
operations and assets and the integration of other affiliated businesses of
the Company or the Subsidiaries as Acquisitionco may request, acting
reasonably (each a "Pre-Acquisition Reorganization"); and  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | cooperate with Parent and its advisors to determine
the nature of the Pre-Acquisition Reorganizations that might be undertaken
and the manner in which they would most effectively be undertaken.  
   

  

       | (b)  |   | Parent and Acquisitionco acknowledge and agree,
and shall ensure, that the Pre-Acquisition Reorganization shall (i) not
impede, delay or prevent consummation of the Arrangement (including by giving
rise to litigation by third parties), (ii) be such that, in the opinion of
the Company, acting reasonably, would not prejudice the Securityholders,
(iii) not require the Company to obtain the approval of any holders of Common
Shares, (iv) not unreasonably interfere with the business, operations
or contracts of the Company or the Subsidiaries, (v) not reasonably be
expected to result in any Taxes being imposed on the Company or its
Subsidiaries incrementally greater than the Taxes which would be imposed in
the absence of such Pre-Closing Reorganization and (vi) not be considered in
determining whether a representation, warranty or covenant of the Company
hereunder has been breached. Parent and Acquisitionco acknowledge that the
Pre-Acquisition Reorganization could require the consent of third parties
under applicable contracts.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (c)  |   | Acquisitionco shall provide written notice to the
Company of any proposed Pre-Acquisition Reorganization at least ten Business
Days prior to the Effective Date. Upon receipt of such notice, Acquisitionco
and the Company shall, at the expense of Acquisitionco, work cooperatively
and use commercially reasonable efforts to prepare prior to the Effective
Time all documentation necessary and do such other acts and things as are
necessary to give effect to such Pre-Acquisition Reorganizations. The parties
shall seek to have any such Pre-Acquisition Reorganization made
effective immediately prior to or contemporaneously with the Effective Time
or failing that as of the last moment of the day ending immediately prior to
the Effective Date, or such other time as Acquisitionco reasonably requests
(but after Acquisitionco shall have waived (subject to applicable Laws) all
conditions referred to in Sections 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3 or confirmed that all
conditions referred to in Sections 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3 have been satisfied).  
      
    | (d)  |   | No such Pre-Acquisition Reorganization will be made
effective unless (i) Acquisitionco shall have waived (subject to applicable
Laws) or confirmed that  
   

  ##### 

  

   

     

  

       |   |   | all conditions referred to in Sections 6.1, 6.2 and
6.3 have been satisfied and the Company is reasonably certain that the
Arrangement will become effective; and (ii) such Pre-Acquisition
Reorganization can be made effective immediately prior to
or contemporaneously with the Effective Time or such Pre-Acquisition
Reorganization can be reversed or unwound without adversely affecting the
Company, the Subsidiaries, or its Securityholders in the event the
Arrangement does not become effective and this Agreement is terminated and
(iii) the Company, the Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors,
employees, agents, advisors and representatives shall be indemnified (jointly
and severally) by Parent and Acquisitionco from and against any and all
liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs (including Taxes),
expenses (including legal fees, professional fees, and disbursements),
interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by any of them
in connection with, in respect of, or as a result of any Pre-Acquisition
Reorganization or (iv) the Company otherwise agrees.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (e)  |   | If the Arrangement is not completed,
Acquisitionco will forthwith reimburse the Company for all reasonable fees
and expenses (including any professional fees and expenses) incurred by the
Company and the Subsidiaries in considering and effecting a Pre-Acquisition
Reorganization and shall be responsible for any costs of the Company and the
Subsidiaries in reversing or unwinding any Pre-Acquisition Reorganization
that was effected at Acquisitioncos request prior to termination of this
Agreement. The obligation of Acquisitionco to reimburse the Company for fees
and expenses and be responsible for costs as set out in this Section 5.10 and
the indemnity described in clause 5.10(d)(iii) will be in addition to any
other obligation hereunder and will survive termination of this Agreement
indefinitely.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

5.11 _Proxies Received_  

   

 The Company shall advise Acquisitionco as Acquisitionco may reasonably request, as to the aggregate tally of the proxies received by the Company in respect of the Arrangement Resolution and Rights Plan Waiver Resolution. 

  

5.12 _Cooperation with Financing_  

   

 Following the date of this Agreement and until the earlier of the Effective Time or the date on which this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide any cooperation reasonably requested by Parent (provided that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and the Subsidiaries) in connection with obtaining the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other liability in connection with the financing prior to the Effective Time.

       | (a)  |   | the Arrangement Resolution shall have been
approved by the Securityholders at the Meeting in accordance with the Interim
Order and applicable Laws;  
---|---|---|---

and no judgment, injunction, order or decree shall have been entered since
the date of this Agreement and shall be in effect, that makes the Arrangement
illegal or otherwise restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits the
consummation of the Arrangement, except where the violation of such Law,
judgment, injunction, order or decree that would occur if the Arrangement
were consummated would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or a

expired or been terminated) and be in full force and effect (and shall not be
subject to any stop-order or proceeding seeking a stop-order or revocation)
except where the failure to obtain such Appropriate Regulatory Approval
results from or is attributable to Parents or Acquisitioncos failure to
comply or consent to the compliance with any condition that does
not constitute a Materially Burdensome Condition. For purposes of this
Agreement, except as otherwise agreed to by the parties, a condition shall be
deemed to be a "Materially Burdensome Condition" if (i) such condition is
imposed by the Minister under the Investment Canada Act as a prerequisite to
the granting of the Investment Canada Act Approval and (ii) compliance with
such condition would impose significant material burdens on the Company or
Parent.

representations and warranties shall have been true and correct as of that
date) except (i) as affected by transactions, changes, conditions, events
or circumstances contemplated or permitted by this Agreement or (ii) for
breaches of representations and warranties which in the aggregate do not have
a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, provided however that for the
purposes of determining the truth and correctness of any such representations
and warranties, all qualifications using the term Material Adverse Effect and
"in all material respects" (or any similar phrase) shall be disregarded;  
      
    | (c)  |   | since the date of this Agreement, there has not
occurred any event that has resulted in a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company;

Acquisitionco in Article 4 shall be true and correct as of the Effective Date
as if made on and as of such date (except for such representations and
warranties which refer to or are made as of another specified date, in which
case such representations and warranties shall have been true and correct as
of that date) except (i) as affected by transactions, changes, conditions,
events or circumstances contemplated or permitted by this Agreement or
(ii) for breaches of representations and warranties which in the aggregate do
not have a material adverse effect on the ability of Parent or Acquisitionco
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided,
however, that for purposes of determining the truth and correctness of

pursuant to an agreement among Acquisitionco, Acquisitioncos lenders and the
Depositary, in a form satisfactory to the Company, acting

6.4 _Satisfaction of Conditions_  

   

 The conditions precedent set out in Sections 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3 shall be conclusively deemed to have been satisfied, waived or released at the Effective Time. Notwithstanding anything in this Article 6, Article 7 or any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, at any time after the date that is two Business Days following the Satisfaction Date: (a) the obligations of Acquisitionco and Parent to consummate the Arrangement shall not be subject to the satisfaction of any of the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 or Section 6.2 (or any other conditions or contingencies whatsoever), all such conditions being deemed to have been fully satisfied or waived; and (b) in no event shall Acquisitionco or Parent be entitled to terminate this Agreement for any reason whatsoever, including pursuant to any provision of Section 7.2.

applicable Laws for the approval of the Arrangement as may be required by the
Court. 

   

7.2 _Termination_

a United States or Canadian court having jurisdiction has been entered and

7.4 _Notice of Unfulfilled Conditions_  

   

 If Parent or Acquisitionco determines at any time prior to the Effective Date that it intends to refuse to complete the transactions contemplated hereby because of any unfulfilled or unperformed condition contained in this Agreement, it will notify the Company forthwith upon making such determination in order that the Company will have the right and opportunity to take such steps, at its own expense, as may be necessary for the purpose of fulfilling or performing such condition within a reasonable period of time, but in no event later than the Termination Date. Neither Parent nor Acquisitionco may exercise the termination right arising therefrom unless forthwith and in any event prior to the Effective Time, it has given a written notice to the Company specifying in reasonable detail all breaches of covenants, representations and warranties or other matters which it is asserting as the basis for the nonfulfillment of the applicable condition precedent or the exercise of the termination right, as the case may be. If any such notice is given, provided that the Company is proceeding diligently to cure such matter, if such matter is susceptible to being cured, Parent or Acquisitionco may not terminate this Agreement as a result thereof until the later of the Termination Date and the expiration of a period of 30 days from such notice. If such notice has been given prior to the date of the Meeting, the Meeting will at the election of the Company be postponed or adjourned and will not be held until such time as is reasonably practicable after the earlier of (a) the matter to which the notice relates being cured and (b) the expiry of such period. If such notice has been given prior to the making of application for the Final Order, such application will be postponed and will not be made until such time as is reasonably practicable after the earlier of (a) the matter to which the notice relates being cured and (b) the expiry of such period. For greater certainty, in the event that such matter is cured within the time period referred to herein, this Agreement may not be terminated as a result thereof. 

  

7.5 _Termination Fee_  

   

 If: 

  

       | (a)  |   | Acquisitionco shall terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.2(b); or  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | the Company shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.2(c); or  
      
    | (c)  |   | either the Company or Acquisitionco shall terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.2(d)(ii) in circumstances where the
Arrangement Resolution or the Rights Plan Waiver Resolution have not received
the required approval at the Meeting and: (i) a  _bona fide_ Acquisition
Proposal has been publicly announced by any person other than Acquisitionco
or Parent prior to the Meeting and not withdrawn, and (ii) either (x)
a transaction contemplated by an Acquisition Proposal is consummated after
such termination of this Agreement and prior to the expiration of 12 months
following the date of such termination of this Agreement or (y) the Company
enters into a definitive agreement with respect to a transaction contemplated
by an Acquisition Proposal, after such termination of this Agreement and
prior to the expiration of 12 months following the date of such termination
of this Agreement, and thereafter consummates such transaction; _provided,
however_ , that for purposes of this Section 7.5(c), all references to   
  

  ##### 

  

  

    

  

       |   |   | "20%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal
shall be deemed to refer to "50%";  
---|---|---|--- 
   

 

then in any such case the Company shall pay to Acquisitionco the Termination
Fee in immediately available funds, net of any applicable Taxes, by wire
transfer to an account designated by Acquisitionco. Such payment shall be due
(A) in the case of a termination specified in Section 7.5(a), within two
Business Days after written notice of termination by Acquisitionco, (B) in
case of a termination specified in Section 7.5(b), on or prior to
the termination of this Agreement, or (C) in the case of a termination
specified in Section 7.5(c), on the day of the consummation of the
transaction referred to therein. The Company shall not be obligated to make
more than one payment pursuant to this Section 7.5. 

   

7.6 _Effect of Termination Fee Payment_  

   

 Each of the parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in Sections 7.4 and 7.5 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement and that, without those agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement. Each party acknowledges that all of the payment amounts set out in Section 7.5 are payments of liquidated damages which are a genuine pre-estimate of the damages which the party entitled to such damages will suffer or incur as a result of the event giving rise to such payment and the resultant termination of this Agreement and are not penalties. Each party irrevocably waives any right that it may have to raise as a defence that any such liquidated damages are excessive or punitive. For greater certainty, the parties agree that the payment of an amount pursuant to Section 7.5 is the sole monetary remedy of Parent and Acquisitionco. Nothing contained herein will preclude a party from seeking injunctive relief to restrain any breach or threatened breach of the covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement or otherwise to obtain specific performance of any such covenants or agreements.

 The representations and warranties of the parties contained in this Agreement or in any certificate or other document delivered in connection herewith will not survive the completion of the Arrangement and will expire and be terminated on the earlier of the Effective Time and the date on which this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms. This Section 8.2 will not limit any covenant or agreement of any of the parties which, by its terms, contemplates performance after the Effective Time or the date on which this Agreement is terminated, as the case may be.

 Except for the rights of the holders of Common Shares and holders of Options to receive the consideration for their Common Shares or Options following the Effective Time pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement, this Agreement is not intended to confer any rights or remedies upon any other person provided however that Section 5.6 is intended for the benefit of the employees of the Company or the Subsidiaries that are or will be party to the agreements referred to in Section 5.6 or entitled to benefits under the Plans referred to in Section 5.6, and Section 5.5 is intended for the benefit of the directors and officers of the Company or the Subsidiaries and Section 8.8(b) is intended for the benefit of the directors, officers and employees of the Company and such sections shall be enforceable by each of such persons and his or her heirs, executors, administrators and other legal representatives (collectively, the "Beneficiaries") and the Company and any successors to the Company shall hold the rights and benefits of Sections 5.5, 5.6 and 8.8(b) and this Section 8.6 in trust for and on behalf of the Beneficiaries and the Company hereby accepts such trust and agrees to hold the benefit of and enforce performances of such covenants on behalf of the Beneficiaries and such rights are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that any Beneficiary may have by contract or otherwise; provided however, that no approval of any beneficiary will be required in connection with any amendment or variation of Section 5.5, 5.6 or 8.8(b) or this Section 8.6 prior to the Effective Date. 

  

8.7 _Waiver and Modification_

No delay or omission by any party to this Agreement in exercising any right, power or remedy provided by Law or under this Agreement, or failure of any party to assent to any of the rights provided by Law or under this Agreement shall affect that right, power or remedy or constitute or operate as a waiver thereof. The single or partial exercise of any right, power or remedy provided by Law or under this Agreement shall not preclude any further exercise of such right, power or remedy or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy. No waiver or partial waiver of any nature, in any one or more instances, will be deemed or construed a continued waiver of any condition or breach of any other term, representation or warranty in this Agreement.

    | (b)  |   | No director or officer or employee of the Company or

8.10 _Public Announcements_  

   

 The Company and Parent will consult with one another regarding their respective initial news releases with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, which will be in a form acceptable to both parties and will be issued and filed as soon as practicable following execution of this Agreement. Parent and the Company will consult with each other as to the general nature of any news release, public announcement or public statement with respect to this Agreement or the Arrangement and, subject to applicable Laws, will not issue any news release, public announcement or public statement inconsistent with the results of such consultation. Subject to applicable Laws, each of Parent or the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to enable the other to review and comment upon any news release, public announcement or public statement about this Agreement, the Arrangement and the transactions contemplated hereby (other than with respect to any confidential information contained in such disclosure) except (a) filing of a copy of this Agreement as required pursuant to applicable Laws, (b) as may be required under applicable Laws, or the rules, regulations, policies or other requirements of, or listing agreement with either the TSX or Nasdaq and (c) that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 8.10 or elsewhere in this Agreement, but subject to the Companys obligations under Sections 5.7 and 5.8, the Company will have no obligation to consult with Parent prior to, or permit Parent to review or comment upon, any disclosure by the Company with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.

8.12 _Remedies and Waivers_  

   

       | (a)  |   | Except as expressly provided herein, the rights,
powers and remedies provided in this Agreement are cumulative and not
exclusive of any rights, powers and remedies (express or implied) provided by
common law, statute, custom or otherwise.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | The parties acknowledge and agree that an award of
money damages would be inadequate for any breach of this Agreement by any
party or its representatives and any such breach would cause the non-
breaching party irreparable harm. Accordingly, the parties hereto agree that,
in the event of any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement by one of
the parties, the parties will also be entitled, without the requirement of
posting a bond or other security, to equitable relief, including injunctive
relief and specific performance. Such remedies will not be the
exclusive remedies for any breach of this Agreement but will be in addition
to all other remedies available at Law or equity to each of the parties.  
   

  

8.13 _Time of Essence_  

   

 Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, time is of the essence in this Agreement, both in respect of dates and periods mentioned and in respect of any dates and periods which may be substituted for them in accordance with this Agreement or by agreement in writing between the parties. 

  

8.14 _Entire Agreement_  

   

 This Agreement and the Schedules and Exhibits hereto (qualified by and subject to, to the extent applicable as provided herein, the disclosures made in the Disclosure Letter), together with the Confidentiality Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties hereto pertaining to the subject matter hereof and cancels and supersedes all other prior agreements, arrangements, understandings, undertakings, negotiations and discussions of any nature, whether oral or written, between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof. There are no representations, warranties, covenants, terms, conditions, undertakings or collateral agreements, expressed, implied or statutory, between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof except as expressly set forth in this Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Acquisitionco and Parent acknowledge and agree that no representation, warranty or other assurance has been given by the Company in respect of any projection, forecast or other forward-looking information. 

  

8.15 _Severability_  

   

 If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party hereto. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a 

   ##### 

  

    

mutually acceptable manner in order that the Arrangement is consummated as
originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible. 

  

8.16 _Counterparts_  

   

 This Agreement may be executed and delivered (including by facsimile transmission) in one or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement. 

   ##### 

  

  

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF the parties hereto have executed this Agreement on October 17, 2007 effective as of the date first written above.

ARTICLE 3 
 ARRANGEMENT 

   

3.1 The Arrangement 

   

 Commencing at the Effective Time, each of the events set out below shall occur and be deemed to occur at the times set out below, in each case without any further authorization, act or formality of the Company, any Holder, Acquisitionco or any other person. 

  

       | (a)  |   | At the Effective Time:  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (i)  |   | all of the Options granted and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time will be transferred by the holders
thereof to the Company in exchange for a cash payment equal to the Option
Consideration, payable to each Optionholder in respect of each Option
transferred by such Optionholder;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | with respect to each Option, the holder thereof will
cease to be the holder of such Option, will cease to have any rights as a
holder in respect of such Option or under the Stock Option Plan, and such
holders name will be removed from the registers of Options with respect to
such Options;  
      
    | (iii)  |   | the Stock Option Plan will be cancelled;  
   

  

       | (b)  |   | Immediately after the steps in Section 3.1(a)
occur:  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (i)  |   | all Common Shares outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (including Dissenting Shares and any Common Shares
issued pursuant to the exercise of any Option duly exercised prior to the
Effective Time in accordance with the provisions of the Stock Option Plan and
the option agreement evidencing any such Option), will be and be deemed to be
transferred by the Common Shareholders to Acquisitionco (free and clear of
any Liens) in exchange for a cash payment equal to (A) the Purchase Price for
each Common Share other than Dissenting Shares, (B) the fair value as set out
in Section 4.1(a) for each Dissenting Share to which Section 4.1(a) applies,
and (C) in respect of any Common Shareholder who exercises Dissent Rights and
who is ultimately not entitled to be paid fair value for the Common Shares
in respect of which they have exercised Dissent Rights, the Purchase Price
for each such Common Share; and  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  ##### 

  

   

     

  

       | (ii)  |   | with respect to each Common Share:  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (A)  |   | the holder thereof will cease to be the
holder of such Common Share;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (B)  |   | the holders name will be removed from the central
securities register with respect to such Common Shares; and  
      
    | (C)  |   | legal and beneficial title to such Common Share will
vest in Acquisitionco and Acquisitionco will be and be deemed to be the
transferee and legal and beneficial owner of all Common Shares (free and

the sole holder thereof and the former holder and beneficial owner of such
Common Share will cease to have any rights as a shareholder in respect of
such Common Share.  
   

  

3.2 Adjustments to Consideration 

   

 The consideration payable with respect to each Common Share transferred pursuant to Section 3.1(b)(i)(A) or (C) and each Option terminated and cancelled pursuant to Section 3.1(a) will be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Common Shares other than stock dividends paid in lieu of ordinary course dividends), consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect to Common Shares effected in accordance with the terms of the Combination Agreement occurring after the date of the Combination Agreement and prior to the Effective Time. 

  

ARTICLE 4 
 DISSENT RIGHTS 

   

4.1 Rights of Dissent 

   

 Pursuant to the Interim Order, each Common Shareholder may exercise rights of dissent ("Dissent Rights") under Division 2 of Part 8 of the BCBCA as modified by this Article 4 as the same may be modified by the Interim Order or the Final Order in respect of the Arrangement. Common Shareholders who duly exercise such rights of dissent and who: 

  

       | (a)  |   | are ultimately determined to be entitled to be
paid fair value for the Common Shares in respect of which they have exercised
Dissent Rights will be deemed to have irrevocably transferred such Common
Shares to Acquisitionco pursuant to Section 3.1(b)(i)(B) in consideration of
such fair value; or  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | are ultimately not entitled, for any reason, to be paid
fair value for the Common Shares in respect of which they have exercised
Dissent Rights will be deemed to have participated in the Arrangement on the
same basis as a Common Shareholder that has not exercised Dissent Rights, as
at and from the time specified in Section 3.1(b) for the consideration set
forth in Section 3.1(b)(i)(C);   
  

  ##### 

  

  

    

 

but in no case will Parent, Acquisitionco, the Company or any other person be
required to recognize such holders as Common Shareholders after the
completion of the step set forth in Section 3.1(a) and each Dissenting
Shareholder will cease to be entitled to the rights of a Common Shareholder
in respect of the Common Shares in relation to which such Dissenting
Shareholder has exercised Dissent Rights and the central securities register
will be amended to reflect that such former holder is no longer the holder of
such Common Shares as and from the Effective Time. 

   

ARTICLE 5 
 CERTIFICATES AND PAYMENTS 

   

5.1 Payments of Consideration 

   

       | (a)  |   | At or before the Effective Time, Acquisitionco
will deposit, and Parent will cause Acquisitionco to deposit, with the
Depositary in escrow for the benefit of the Common Shareholders, cash in the
aggregate amount equal to the payments contemplated by Section 3.1(b)(i)
(calculated without reference to whether any Common Shareholders
have exercised or may exercise Dissent Rights). As soon as practicable
following the later of the Effective Date and the surrender to the Depositary
for cancellation of a certificate which immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented outstanding Common Shares that were exchanged under the
Arrangement, together with a duly completed and executed Letter of
Transmittal and such additional documents and instruments as the Depositary
may reasonably require, the Common Shareholder of such
surrendered certificate will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, the
cash which such Common Shareholder has the right to receive under the
Arrangement for such Common Shares, less any amounts withheld pursuant to
Section 5.4 and any certificate so surrendered will forthwith be cancelled.
The cash deposited with the Depositary will be held in an interest-bearing
account and any interest earned on such funds will be for the account of
Acquisitionco.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | At or before the Effective Time, Acquisitionco will
deposit with the Depositary in escrow for the benefit of the Optionholders,
cash in the aggregate amount equal to the payments contemplated by Section
3.1(a). As soon as practicable following the later of the Effective Date and
the delivery to the Depositary by or on behalf of a former holder of any
Option of a duly completed Letter of Transmittal and such
additional documents and instruments as the Depositary may reasonably
require, the former holder of such Option, as reflected on the registers
maintained by or on behalf of the Company in respect of Options will be
entitled to receive the cash payment which such former holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to Section 3.1(a) less any amounts withheld pursuant to
Section 5.4.  
      
    | (c)  |   | Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
5.1, each certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented Common Shares will be deemed after the time described in Section
3.1(b)(i) to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender a cash
payment in lieu of such certificate as   
  

  ##### 

  

  

    

  

       |   |   | contemplated in this Section 5.1, less any amounts
withheld pursuant to Section 5.4.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (d)  |   | Subject to Section 5.3, the Company, Acquisitionco
and Parent will cause the Depositary, (i) in the case of a former holder of
Common Shares, as soon as practicable following the time the former holder
becomes entitled to a cash payment in accordance with Section 5.1(a), and
(ii) in the case of a former holder of Options, as soon as practicable
following the time the former option holder becomes entitled to a net
cash payment in accordance with Section 5.1(b), to:  
   

  

       | (A)  |   | forward or cause to be forwarded by first
class mail (postage paid) to such former holder at the address specified
in the Letter of Transmittal; or  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (B)  |   | if requested by such former holder in the Letter of
Transmittal, make available at the offices of the Depositary specified in the
Letter of Transmittal for pick-up by such former holder; or  
      
    | (C)  |   | if the Letter of Transmittal neither specifies an
address nor contains a request as described in Sections 5.1(d)(B) and
5.1(d)(A), forward or cause to be forwarded by first class mail (postage
paid) to such former holder at the address of such former holder as shown on
registers of Options or the central securities register maintained by or on
behalf of the Company in respect of Common shares, or the registers of Options
maintained by or on behalf of the Company in respect of the Options, as
applicable, immediately prior to the Effective Time:  
   

  

       |   |   | a cheque representing the net cash payment, if any,
payable to such former holder in accordance with the provisions hereof.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (e)  |   | No former holder of Common Shares that were acquired
by Acquisitionco pursuant to Section 3.1(b)(i) will be entitled to receive
any consideration with respect to such Common Shares, other than the net cash
payment, if any, which they are entitled to receive in accordance with
Section 3.1(b)(i) and, for greater certainty, no such former holder will be
entitled to receive any interest, dividends, premium or other payment
in connection therewith.  
   

  

5.2 Loss of Certificates 

   

 In the event any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any outstanding Common Shares that were acquired by Acquisitionco pursuant to Section 3.1(b)(i) has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Depositary will pay in relation to for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the net cash payment which the former holder of such Common Shares is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 3.1(b)(i). When authorizing such payment in relation to any lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the person to 

   ##### 

  

 

whom the payment is made will, as a condition precedent to the delivery
thereof, give a bond satisfactory to Acquisitionco, the Company and the
Depositary in such sum as Acquisitionco may direct or otherwise
indemnify Acquisitionco and the Company in a manner satisfactory to
Acquisitionco and the Company against any claim that may be made against
Acquisitionco and the Company with respect to the certificate alleged to have
been lost, stolen or destroyed. 

   

5.3 Extinction of Rights 

   

 If (i) any former holder of Common Shares that are acquired by Acquisitionco pursuant to Section 3.1(b)(i) fails for any reason to deliver to the Depositary for cancellation the certificates formerly representing Common Shares (or an affidavit of loss and bond or other indemnity pursuant to Section 5.2), together with such other documents or instruments required for such former holder to receive the cash payment which such former holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 3.1(b)(i), or (ii) any former holder of any Option fails for any reason to deliver to the Depositary the documents or instruments required for such former holder to receive the cash payment which such former holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 3.1(a), in each case on or before the sixth anniversary of the Effective Date, on such sixth anniversary such former holder will be deemed to have donated and forfeited to Acquisitionco (or its successor), in the case of the Common Shares, and to the Company (or its successor), in the case of the Options, any cash, net of any applicable withholding or other taxes, held by the Depositary in trust for such former holder to which such former holder is entitled. Any certificate formerly representing Common Shares will, on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Date, cease to represent a claim of any nature whatsoever and will be deemed to have been surrendered to Acquisitionco and will be cancelled. Neither the Company nor Acquisitionco (or any of their respective successors) will be liable to any person in respect of any cash (including any cash previously held by the Depositary in trust for any such former holder) which is forfeited to Acquisitionco or delivered to any public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 

  

5.4 Withholding Rights 

   

 The Company, Parent, Acquisitionco and the Depositary will be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration otherwise payable to any Securityholder under this Plan of Arrangement (including any payment to Dissenting Shareholders), such amounts as the Company, Acquisitionco or the Depositary is required to deduct and withhold with respect to such payment under the Tax Act, the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of provincial, state, local or foreign tax law as counsel may advise is required to be so deducted and withheld by the Company, Acquisitionco or the Depositary, as the case may be. For the purposes hereof all such withheld amounts shall be treated as having been paid to the Securityholder in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made on account of the obligation to make payment to such Securityholder hereunder, provided that such deducted or withheld amounts are actually remitted to the appropriate Governmental Authority by or on behalf of the Company, Acquisitionco or the Depositary, as the case may be.

Pursuant to the Arrangement, holders of Aspreva Common Shares will receive, in exchange for Aspreva Common Shares, cash consideration per Aspreva Common Share in the amount set forth in the Combination Agreement and holders of Aspreva Options will receive a cash payment in exchange for their Aspreva Options on the terms set out therein. 

  

 This Agreement sets out the terms and conditions of the agreement of the Aspreva Shareholder to take certain actions and to do certain things, including to vote or cause to be voted the Aspreva Common Shares and Aspreva Options, if any, owned by the Aspreva Shareholder, and the Aspreva Common Shares over which the Aspreva Shareholder has control or direction, in favour of the Arrangement Resolution approving the Arrangement. 

  

 All capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement have the meaning given to such terms in the Combination Agreement.

 As used herein, the term "Securities" means any securities of Aspreva that may be voted at the Aspreva Meeting (as hereinafter defined) including any Aspreva Options or securities that result from any reclassification, conversion, consolidation, subdivision or exchange of, or distribution or dividend on, the Aspreva Common Shares.

consent of the holders of Securities, including, in each case, in connection
with any separate vote of any sub-group of holders of Securities that may be
required to be taken and of which sub-group the Aspreva Shareholder forms a
part. In furtherance of the Aspreva Shareholders voting agreement in this
section, the Aspreva Shareholder hereby revokes any and all previous proxies
with respect to any of the Subject Securities and grants to Galenica and such
individuals or corporations as Galenica may designate an irrevocable proxy to
vote all of the Subject Securities in accordance with this section 1.2.  
      
  1.3  |   | _Change in Nature of Transaction_. Subject to the provisions
of section 1.7, the Aspreva Shareholder covenants and agrees in favour of
Galenica that if Galenica and Aspreva mutually agree that it is necessary or
desirable to proceed with another form of transaction whereby Galenica or any
of its affiliates would effectively acquire 100% of the Securities
on economic terms and other terms and conditions (including, without
limitation, any tax consequences to the Aspreva Shareholder) which, in
relation to Aspreva and the Aspreva Shareholder, are no less favourable from
a financial point of view and otherwise substantially equivalent to or better
than those contemplated by the Combination Agreement (an
"Alternative Transaction"), the Aspreva Shareholder will support the
completion of such Alternative Transaction in the manner described in section
1.4.  
      
  1.4  |   | _Meeting of Holders of Securities of Aspreva_. Subject to the
provisions of section 1.7, (a) if an Alternative Transaction involves a
meeting or meetings of holders of Securities of Aspreva, the Aspreva
Shareholder covenants and agrees in favour of Galenica to vote in favour of
any matters necessary or ancillary to the completion of the
transactions contemplated by the Alternative Transaction in the same manner,
_mutatis mutandis,_ as that  
   

  ##### 

  

   

       |   | referred to in section 1.2, and (b) if an Alternative
Transaction includes the making of an offer by Galenica or any of its
affiliates to acquire the outstanding Securities, the Aspreva Shareholder
covenants and agrees in favour of Galenica to deposit or cause to be deposited
the Subject Securities to such offer.  
---|---|--- 
   

  

     1.5  |   | _Change of References_. In the event Galenica and
Aspreva mutually agree to proceed with any Alternative Transaction, the
references in section 2.1 of this Agreement to "Arrangement" shall be deemed
to refer to such Alternative Transaction and the representations, warranties
and covenants in section 2.1 of this Agreement shall be and shall be deemed
to have been made in the context of the Alternative Transaction and all
references to the "Effective Date" herein shall also refer to the date of
closing of the transactions contemplated by the Alternative Transaction.  
---|---|--- 
      
  1.6  |   | _Transfer of Shares_. Subject to the provisions of section
1.7:  
   

  

       | (a)  |   | the Aspreva Shareholder covenants and agrees in
favour of Galenica that, during the term of this Agreement, it will not,
directly or indirectly sell, transfer or assign or agree to sell, transfer or
assign or grant to any person any right or option to buy any of the Subject
Securities or the voting rights attached thereto, without the prior written
consent of Galenica, provided that such consent to transfer shall not
be necessary if the transfer is to an affiliate of the Aspreva Shareholder
where such affiliate executes an agreement on substantially the same terms as
this Agreement, agreeing to be bound by the provisions of this Agreement,
and  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Aspreva Shareholder agrees not to tender or otherwise deposit the Subject
Securities to any tender offer or take-over bid made by any person other than
Galenica.  
   

  

     1.7  |   | _Limits to Obligations of Aspreva Shareholder_. For
greater certainty, the obligations of the Aspreva Shareholder pursuant to
this Agreement shall terminate at the time which is the earliest of:  
---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (a)  |   | the Effective Time; or  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | the time at which the Combination Agreement is
terminated in accordance with its terms.  
   

  

     1.8  |   | _Exception_. If the Aspreva Shareholder is a director
or officer of Aspreva, nothing contained in this Agreement will prevent the
Aspreva Shareholder from acting in his or her capacity as a director or
officer of Aspreva in accordance with the exercise of his or her fiduciary
duties or other legal obligation to act in the best interests of Aspreva.
The foregoing shall not release any Aspreva Shareholder from acting in
accordance with this Agreement in his or her capacity as a shareholder of
Aspreva.  
---|---|--- 
   

  

     1.9  |   | _Exception_. Notwithstanding any other provisions
hereof, the Aspreva Shareholder shall not be obliged, and the holder of any
proxy granted on behalf of the Aspreva Shareholder shall  
---|---|--- 
   

  ##### 

  

   

       |   | not be entitled, to vote the Subject Securities in the
manner provided herein if at the time of such vote there shall be in force
any order or decree of a Governmental Authority restraining or enjoining the
Aspreva Shareholder or the holder of any proxy granted on behalf of the
Aspreva Shareholder from voting the Subject Securities; provided that, such
order or decree is not the result of any breach of representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement of the Aspreva Shareholder in this Agreement, and
provided further that the Aspreva Shareholder has notified Galenica of such
order or decree, to the extent it is aware of same.  
---|---|---

     2.1  |   | _Representations, Warranties and Covenants_. By

all necessary action on the part of each of the Aspreva Shareholder;  
      
    | (e)  |   | assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery of this Agreement by Galenica, this Agreement constitutes a valid
and binding obligation of the Aspreva Shareholder enforceable against the
Aspreva Shareholder in accordance with its terms, subject to the usual
exceptions as to bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws of general
application and the availability of equitable remedies; and  
      
    | (f)  |   | neither the entering into of this Agreement nor
the performance by the Aspreva Shareholder of his, her, or its obligations
under this Agreement will contravene, breach or result in any default under
any agreement, arrangement, understanding or other legally binding
commitments to which the Aspreva Shareholder is a party or by which the
Aspreva Shareholder may be bound or, if the Aspreva Shareholder is
a corporation, under its articles, by-laws, constating documents or other

  ##### 

  

   

     

  

       | The representations, warranties and covenants of the
Aspreva Shareholder set forth in this section 2.1 will be true and correct on

     2.5  |   | _Specific Performance and Other Equitable Rights_. The
Aspreva Shareholder recognizes and acknowledges that a breach by it of any of
its covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement will cause Galenica
to sustain injury for which Galenica would not have an adequate remedy at law
for money damages. Therefore, the Aspreva Shareholder agrees that in the
event of such breach, Galenica shall be entitled to the remedy of specific
performance of such covenant or agreement and to preliminary and permanent
injunctive and other equitable relief, in addition to any other remedy to
which it may be entitled, at law or in equity, and the parties further agree
to waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond
in connection with the obtaining of any such injunctive or other equitable
relief.
