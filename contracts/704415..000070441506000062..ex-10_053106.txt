Surviving Corporation, each to hold office until their respective successors are
duly appointed, in accordance with the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

1.5 Effect on Company Securities. In the Merger, at the Effective Time, (A) the
Company's Series E Preferred Stock shall be converted into the right to receive,
in the aggregate, the Series E Liquidation Payments as set forth herein, and (B)
the Company Stock (excluding the Company's Series E Preferred Stock), the
Options and the Warrants shall be converted into the right to receive, in the
aggregate and as set forth herein (the "Merger Consideration"), cash in the
amount of Three Hundred Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars
($307,500,000) (u) plus/less the Working Capital Adjustment Amount, (v) plus the
Excess Amount or minus the Working Capital Shortfall, as applicable, (w) plus
the Closing Cash Amount, (x) minus Company Indebtedness, (y) minus Transaction
Expenses, and (z) minus the Series E Liquidation Payments (the sum of (u), (v),
(w), (x), (y) and (z) shall be referred to as the "Adjustment Amount"). The
Merger Consideration shall be paid as follows: (i) Two Hundred Eighty Three
Million Three Hundred and Seventy-Five Thousand Dollars ($283,375,000) plus/less
the Adjustment Amount as estimated pursuant to Section 1.11, shall be payable in
cash at the Effective Time in accordance with Sections 1.5(a), (b), (c) and (d)
hereof, (ii) any Excess Amount shall be payable in cash at the time and in the
manner set forth in Section 1.11(f) hereof (the sum of clauses (i) and (ii) the
"Cash Consideration") and (iii) Twenty-Four Million One Hundred Twenty-Five
Thousand Dollars ($24,125,000) (the "Escrow Deposit") shall be payable in cash
at the Effective Time by the Parent into the Escrow Fund (as defined below) (the
Escrow Deposit, together with any net profit from, or interest or income
produced by, any Permitted Investments pursuant to this Agreement, as such
amounts may be reduced pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, collectively the
"Escrow Consideration") in accordance with Section 1.8(b) hereof.

                  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, by
virtue of and in connection with the Merger and without any action on the part
of the Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any of the following
securities, the following shall occur:

(a) Conversion of Company Preferred Stock. Under and in accordance with Article
III, Section 2(g) of the Company's Articles of Incorporation as in effect on the
date hereof, (i) each share of the Company's Series A, B, C, F and G Preferred
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, with
the Company's Series D and Series E Preferred Stock, the "Company Preferred
Stock") shall be converted into one share of Company Common Stock (as defined
below) immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) each share of the
Company's Series D Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into 1.4409 shares of Company Common Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time, in each case other than shares owned by
the Parent, the Merger Sub, the Company or any of their respective direct or
indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries. At the Effective Time, each share of the
Company's Series E Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than shares of the Company's Series E Preferred Stock held
by the Parent, the Merger Sub, the Company or any of their respective
wholly-owned subsidiaries) will be canceled, extinguished and automatically
converted into the right to receive, under and in accordance with Article III,
Section 2(b) of the Company's Articles of Incorporation as in effect on the date
hereof, the per share payment payable thereon pursuant to such Article III,
Section 2(b) (the "Per-Share Series E Consideration," and collectively, the
"Series E Liquidation Payments"). The Series E Liquidation Payments shall be
made prior and in preference to any payments of Merger Consideration to holders
of any other class or series of Company equity securities outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt, none of the
Series E Liquidation Payments shall be included as Escrow Consideration.

(b) Conversion of Company Common Stock. At the Effective Time, each share of
common stock (including any fractions thereof) of the Company (the "Company
Common Stock") (including those shares of Company Common Stock resulting from
the conversion of Company Preferred Stock as set forth in Section 1.5(a) hereof)
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, but excluding any
Dissenting Shares and shares held by the Parent, the Merger Sub, the Company or
any of their respective wholly-owned subsidiaries, will be canceled,
extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive (A) an amount
in cash, without interest, equal to the amount obtained by dividing (x) the sum
of (1) the Cash Consideration plus (2) the aggregate amount of the exercise
price with respect to all Options (excluding any Out-of-the-Money Options) and
Warrants (excluding any Out-of-the-Money Warrants) as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time by (y) the Fully Diluted Shares Outstanding (the "Common
Per-Share Cash Consideration"), and (B) an interest in the Escrow Consideration
equal to the amount obtained by dividing (x) the Escrow Consideration, by (y)
the total number of Fully Diluted Shares Outstanding (the "Per-Share Escrow
Consideration", and together with the Common Per-Share Cash Consideration, the
"Common Per-Share Merger Consideration"). For purposes of this Agreement, "Fully
Diluted Shares Outstanding" shall mean the sum of (A) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, plus (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of the Company Preferred Stock (excluding the shares of Company
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Company's Series E Preferred Stock)
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, plus (C) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of all Options
(excluding any Out-of-the-Money Options) and Warrants (excluding any
Out-of-the-Money Warrants) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(including Warrants to purchase Preferred Stock on an as-converted to Company
Common Stock basis). Each share of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred
Stock (collectively, the "Company Stock") held in the Company's treasury at the
Effective Time will be cancelled and retired and all rights in respect thereof
will cease to exist, without any conversion thereof or payment of any
consideration in respect thereof.

(c) Treatment of Stock Options.

(i) At the Effective Time, each option to purchase Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested
(each an "Option"), shall be automatically converted into and thereafter shall
solely represent the right to receive in settlement and cancellation thereof for
each share of Company Common Stock issuable under such Option (A) an amount in
cash (the "Option Cash Amount") equal to the difference between (i) and (ii),
where (i) equals the Common Per-Share Cash Consideration and where (ii) equals
the exercise price of such Option, and (B) an interest in the Escrow
Consideration equal to the Per-Share Escrow Consideration (together with the
Option Cash Amount, the "Option Consideration"). All such payments made pursuant
to this Section 1.5(c) shall be less applicable Taxes (as defined below)
required to be withheld with respect thereto.

(ii) From and after the Effective Time, holders of Options shall have no rights
with respect to their Options other than as specifically provided in this
Section 1.5(c). At the Effective Time, the Company agrees to effect the
termination of its 2004 Stock Incentive Plan, and 1997 Stock Incentive Plan and
any other stock option plans, agreements and arrangements (together with the
1994 Stock Incentive Plan, collectively, the "Option Plans").

(iii) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall provide notice to each
holder of an outstanding Option describing the treatment of such Option in
accordance with this Section 1.5(c).

(iv) In the event the Option Consideration for any Option shall be equal to or
less than zero, such Option shall be cancelled at the Effective Time without any
consideration payable therefor (each an "Out-of-the-Money Option"). In the event
a holder of Options exercises any Options prior to the Effective Time, the
holder of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Options shall be
entitled to receive the Common Per-Share Merger Consideration as set forth in
Section 1.5(b) hereof in lieu of the Option Consideration.

(v) The Company shall take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate
the provisions of this Section 1.5(c), including such action as shall be
necessary to accelerate the vesting of any unvested Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time, and to ensure that, from and following the Effective Time,
no Person shall have any right under the Options Plans, the Options or any other
plan, program, agreement or arrangement with respect to equity securities of the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or any subsidiary thereof. The term "Person"
as used in this Agreement shall mean any individual, corporation, limited
liability corporation, joint venture, partnership, unincorporated association,
country, state or political subdivision thereof, trust or other entity.

(d) Treatment of Warrants. At the Effective Time, each warrant to purchase
Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time pursuant to any warrant agreement (the "Warrants") shall be
automatically converted into the right to receive in settlement and cancellation
thereof for each share of Company Common Stock (on an as-converted to Company
Common Stock basis) issuable under such Warrant (A) an amount in cash (the
"Warrant Cash Amount") equal to the difference between (i) and (ii), where (i)
equals the Common Per-Share Cash Consideration and where (ii) equals the
exercise price per share (on an as-converted to Company Common Stock basis) of
such Warrant, and (B) an interest in the Escrow Consideration equal to the
Per-Share Escrow Consideration (the "Warrant Consideration"). In the event the
Warrant Consideration for any Warrant shall be equal to or less than zero, such
Warrant shall be cancelled at the Effective Time without any consideration
payable therefor (each an "Out-of-the-Money Warrant"). In the event a holder of
Warrants exercises any Warrants prior to the Effective Time, the holder of
Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Warrants or Company Common
Stock issuable upon conversion of Preferred Stock received upon exercise of
Warrants, as applicable, shall be entitled to receive the Common Per-Share
Merger Consideration with respect thereto as set forth in Section 1.5(b) hereof
in lieu of the Warrant Consideration. From and after the Effective Time, holders
of Warrants shall have no rights with respect to their Warrants other than as
specifically provided in this Section 1.5(d).

1.6 Capital Stock of the Merger Sub. Each share of common stock of the Merger
Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. Each stock
certificate of the Merger Sub evidencing ownership of any such shares shall
continue to evidence ownership of such shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

1.7 Cancellation of Stock Owned by the Parent and the Merger Sub. At the
Effective Time, all shares of Company Stock that are owned by the Parent or the
Merger Sub, or by any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of either of
them, shall automatically be cancelled and cease to exist and no consideration
shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

1.8      Payment of Merger Consideration; Series E Liquidation Payments.


(a) At or before the Closing, the Parent shall deliver cash equal to the sum of
the Series E Liquidation Payments and the Cash Consideration (except for any
Excess Amount paid in cash at the time and in the manner set forth in Section
1.11(f) hereof), by wire transfer of immediately available funds, to a bank or
trust company designated as the exchange and paying agent in connection with the
Merger by the Company and reasonably satisfactory to the Parent (the "Payment
Agent"), and such funds shall be held in escrow by the Payment Agent for the
benefit of the Parent until the Effective Time. From and after the Effective
Time, all funds deposited by the Parent with the Payment Agent shall be for the
sole benefit of the holders of Company Stock, Options and Warrants immediately
prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the "Company Securities") for payment
pursuant to the terms hereof and may not be withdrawn by or paid to the Parent
other than (i) as provided in Section 1.9(c) hereof, or (ii) in order to pay any
holders of Dissenting Shares (pursuant to which the Parent may withdraw up to an
amount equal to, but in no event exceeding, the Common Per-Share Cash
Consideration for each Dissenting Share). Subject to Section 1.9 hereof, the
Payment Agent shall, as directed by the Surviving Corporation and consistent
herewith, disburse all funds received pursuant to this Section 1.8 as soon as
reasonably practicable following the Effective Time to the holders of Company
Securities entitled to receive such funds pursuant hereto in accordance with
Section 1.5 hereof and as set forth on Schedule 1.8(a), which Schedule 1.8(a)
shall be delivered to the Parent no later than seven (7) days prior to the
Closing Date, and will be updated, as necessary, as of the Closing Date. The
Company shall be solely responsible for the fees and expenses of the Payment
Agent, and the fees and expenses paid to the Payment Agent for its services as
contemplated by this Agreement, shall be included in Transaction Expenses.

(b) To secure the indemnification obligations contained in Article VIII hereof,
to make any payments that are due pursuant to Section 1.11, and to provide for
payments of certain expenses of the Shareholder Representative under Section
8.10 hereof, at the Closing the Parent and the Shareholder Representative shall
enter into an escrow agreement with an escrow agent (the "Escrow Agent")
mutually acceptable to the Parent and the Shareholder Representative
substantially in the form of Exhibit F hereto (the "Escrow Agreement"). The
Escrow Agent may be the same Person as the Payment Agent; provided, however,
that each shall be an entity which meets the custodian requirements contained in
Section 17(f) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. At the Closing,
the Parent shall deposit the Escrow Deposit into an escrow fund (the "Escrow
Fund") maintained by the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall invest the amounts
in the Escrow Fund as the Parent directs; provided, however, that such
investments shall be solely in (i) obligations of or guaranteed by the United
States of America or any agency thereof with maturity dates of ninety (90) days
or less, (ii) commercial paper obligations receiving the highest rating from
either Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor's ratings group or
(iii) certificates of deposit with maturity dates of ninety (90) days or less
issued by commercial banks incorporated under the laws of the United States of
America or any states in the United States of America or any domestic branch of
a foreign commercial bank, subject to supervision and examination by federal or
state banking or depository institution authorities with combined capital,
surplus and undivided profits exceeding $1,000,000,000 (collectively, "Permitted
Investments") or in money market funds which are invested solely in Permitted
Investments; provided further, however, that the maturities of Permitted
Investments shall be such as to permit the Escrow Agent to make withdrawals from
the Escrow Fund on no more than two (2) Business Days' notice. Any net profit
from, or interest or income produced by, Permitted Investments in the Escrow
Fund shall remain in and be a part of such Escrow Fund. The Escrow Fund shall be
administered in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Escrow Agreement
for a term ending twelve (12) months following the Closing Date (the "Escrow
Termination Date"), subject to the resolution of any claims under Article VIII,
Sections 1.11 and 8.5(c) hereof and the terms of the Escrow Agreement. The
Shareholder Representative shall determine the Tax treatment of the earnings on
the Escrow Consideration, including any net profit from, or interest or income
produced by, Permitted Investments in the Escrow Fund, and the parties hereto
shall, for Tax reporting purposes, report in a manner consistent with the
Shareholder Representative's determination thereof. The Parent shall be solely
responsible for the fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent.

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, pursuant to the terms of
the Escrow Agreement, upon deposit of the Escrow Deposit into the Escrow Fund,
the Escrow Agent shall deduct and segregate Five Hundred Thousand Dollars
($500,000) from the Escrow Deposit and deposit such amount in a separate escrow
account (the "Shareholder Representative Escrow Fund"). Amounts in the
Shareholder Representative Escrow Fund shall be reserved solely for the payment
of any fees, costs or expenses incurred by or payable to the Shareholder
Representative in performing its obligations hereunder ("Shareholder
Representative Expenses") and shall not be available for any obligations under
Section 1.11 or any indemnification obligations contained in Article VIII. Any
amounts in the Shareholder Representative Escrow Fund that have not been
disbursed to the Shareholder Representative to pay or reimburse for Shareholder
Representative Expenses pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement prior to the expiration of the Escrow Period, or if later, the date on
which all outstanding claims under Article VIII have been discharged in full,
shall be deducted from the Shareholder Representative Escrow Fund and added back
to the Escrow Fund, for distribution to the holders of the Company Common Stock,
Options and Warrants in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement and
this Agreement.

(d) All amounts payable to the holders of the Company Securities from the Escrow
Fund shall be distributed, pursuant to Schedule 1.8(a), promptly following the
Escrow Termination Date, subject to the resolution of any claims under Article
VIII, Sections 1.11 and 8.5(c) hereof and the terms of the Escrow Agreement, and
in no event shall be distributed later than five (5) years after the Closing
Date in accordance with Proposed Regulation 1.409A-3(g)(5)(iv) issued under Code
Section 409A and any subsequent Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") guidance
relating thereto.

1.9      Exchange Procedure.

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall send to each Person who was a holder of Company
Securities immediately prior to the Effective Time a letter of transmittal
substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit H (the "Letter of
Transmittal") and any other appropriate materials for use in surrendering to the
Company certificates or agreements that immediately prior to the Effective Time
evidenced Company Securities. Except with respect to Dissenting Shares, until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.9(a), (i) each certificate
evidencing Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock (excluding the Series
E Preferred Stock) and each agreement evidencing an Option or Warrant shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the Common Per-Share Merger Consideration, Option
Consideration or Warrant Consideration that the holder thereof has the right to
receive in respect of such Company Securities pursuant to the provisions of this
Agreement, and (ii) each certificate evidencing the Company's Series E Preferred
Stock shall be deemed after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive the Per-Share Series E Consideration that the holder thereof has the
right to receive in respect to such Series E Preferred Stock pursuant to the
provisions of this Agreement. Other than with respect to Permitted Investments
of amounts in the Escrow Fund, no interest shall be paid or will accrue on any
cash payable to holders of Company Securities. Upon the proper surrender and
exchange of certificates or agreements, or, in the absence thereof, Affidavits
(as defined below), representing Company Securities and the delivery of an
executed Letter of Transmittal to the Company or the Payment Agent in accordance
herewith, each holder of such Company Securities shall be paid, without interest
thereon, an amount in cash from the Payment Agent determined in accordance with
Section 1.5 hereof and as otherwise set forth herein. The Payment Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold, at the direction of the Surviving Corporation,
from any Merger Consideration, Option Consideration, Warrant Consideration, or
the Series E Liquidation Payments otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any holder of Company Securities, such amounts as the Surviving Corporation
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any
provision of state, local or foreign tax law, and shall remit such withheld
amounts to the Surviving Corporation as soon as reasonably practicable and
consistent with applicable Legal Requirements. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the Company Securities. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, no payment shall be made to any holder of
Company Securities who does not present certificates or agreements for
cancellation representing shares of Company Common Stock, Company Preferred
Stock, Options or Warrants, or, in the alternative, an affidavit and indemnity,
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Parent, stating that any of
such certificates or agreements are lost, stolen or destroyed and that such
holder will indemnify and hold the Parent, the Surviving Corporation and each of
their respective officers, directors and agents harmless from any costs,
expenses and damages that may be incurred if such certificates or agreements are
later produced (an "Affidavit").

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed with respect to shares of Company Stock which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of such shares of Company Stock. If, after the Effective Time,
certificates representing Company Stock are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided
herein.

(c) Any portion of the Merger Consideration, Option Consideration, Warrant
Consideration and Series E Liquidation Payments deposited by the Parent with the
Payment Agent or the Escrow Agent pursuant to Section 1.8 hereof which remains
undistributed to holders of Company Securities twelve (12) months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the Parent, upon demand, and any such
holders who have not theretofore complied with this Section 1.9 shall look only
to the Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar laws) as
general creditors for payment of their claim for the applicable Merger
Consideration, Option Consideration, Warrant Consideration or Series E
Liquidation Payments, if any, to be received in accordance herewith. Neither the
Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any such holder for cash
representing any portion of the Merger Consideration, Option Consideration,
Warrant Consideration or Series E Liquidation Payments delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

1.10     Dissenting Shares and Dissenters' Rights.

(a) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, any Company
Common Stock held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or
otherwise consented thereto in writing and who has the right to demand, and
properly demands, an appraisal of any of such holder's shares of Company Common
Stock in accordance with Chapter 13 of the CGCL or any successor provisions
thereof (the "Dissenters' Provisions") (such shares being referred to herein as
"Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as set forth in Section 1.5, Section 1.8 and Section 1.9 hereof,
but shall be converted into the right to receive such consideration as may be
due such holder pursuant to Chapter 13 of the CGCL, unless and until such holder
fails to perfect or otherwise loses or withdraws any such right to appraisal.
With respect to any Dissenting Shares, the rights of a holder who complies with
the provisions of Chapter 13 of the CGCL shall be limited exclusively to the
appraisal rights provided under such Chapter 13. The Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be solely responsible for any settlement of claims with
respect to any Dissenting Shares and any judgment rendered against the Company
in connection with any Dissenting Shares pursuant to Chapter 13 of the CGCL. Any
such settlement of claims may be paid in cash, capital stock of the Parent or
such other consideration as the Parent may determine, and any such judgment
rendered against the Company in connection with any Dissenting Shares pursuant
to Chapter 13 of the CGCL shall be paid in accordance with the CGCL. Holders of
Dissenting Shares who fail to comply with the provisions of Chapter 13 of the
CGCL with respect to those shares shall have the rights set forth in Section
1.10(b) hereof.

(b) If any holder of Company Common Stock who demands payment of the fair market
value of its Dissenting Shares pursuant to the Dissenters' Provisions shall
effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) its right
to such payment at any time, such shares of Company Common Stock shall not
thereafter be Dissenting Shares hereunder and the shares of Company Common Stock
of such holder shall be converted into a right to receive, and shall receive
without any interest thereon, the Merger Consideration set forth in Section 1.5
hereof in exchange for such shares of Company Common Stock.

(c) The Company shall give prompt notice to the Parent of each demand received
by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company Stock, attempted withdrawals
of such demands and any other instruments and documents received or delivered in
connection therewith pursuant to the CGCL. The Parent shall have the right to
participate in negotiations and proceedings regarding each such demand. The
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of the Parent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), settle or
make any payment regarding any such demand.

(d) The Company shall send to any shareholder of the Company who did not consent
to the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby, the notice contemplated
in Section 1301 of the CGCL (the "Dissenters' Notice"). The Parent shall have
the right to participate in review and approve the Dissenters' Notice (such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), and shall
furnish such information to the Company as the Company may reasonably request.

1.11     Working Capital Adjustment.

.................. (a) Not later than two (2) Business Days prior to the
Closing, the Company shall prepare and deliver an estimated balance sheet as of
the Closing Date (the "Estimated Closing Balance Sheet"), together with a good
faith estimate of the Net Working Capital (as defined in subsection (b) below)
of the Company as of the Closing Date (the "Estimated Net Working Capital"). The
Estimated Closing Balance Sheet shall include line item estimates of (i) the
Company Indebtedness as of the Closing Date, (ii) the Company's Closing Cash
Amount and (iii) the Company's Transaction Expenses. The Estimated Closing
Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States, as in effect from time to time ("GAAP"),
consistent with the Company's past practice, and shall be certified by the
Company's chief financial officer as being a good faith estimate of the Net
Working Capital, Company Indebtedness, Closing Cash Amount and Transaction
Expenses of the Company as of the Closing. The Merger Consideration shall be (x)
increased on a dollar-for-dollar basis to the extent that the Estimated Net
Working Capital is a dollar amount that is greater than negative One Million
Seven Hundred and Fifty Thousand Dollars (<$1,750,000>) (the "Targeted Net
Working Capital") or (y) decreased on a dollar-for-dollar basis to the extent
that the Estimated Net Working Capital is a dollar amount that is less than the
Targeted Net Working Capital (such positive or negative adjustment being
referred to as the "Working Capital Adjustment Amount"). For the avoidance of
any doubt, the term "greater" in Section 1.11(a)(x) shall mean any dollar amount
that is positive, or equal to zero dollars ($0), or between zero dollars ($0)
and an amount up to, but not including, negative One Million Seven Hundred and
Fifty Thousand Dollars (<$1,750,000>).

.................. (b) "Net Working Capital" means the Company's (i) total
current assets, including without limitation, inventory (participant equipment),
accounts receivable (net of reserves for doubtful accounts), prepaid expenses,
Permitted Expenditures to the extent paid or accrued on or before Closing, but,
however, in order to avoid duplication, excluding those Permitted Expenditures
classified as current assets (i.e., prepaid rent) and other current assets (but
shall exclude all cash and deferred tax assets) minus (ii) total current
liabilities, including without limitation, accounts payable, accrued
compensation (excluding the employer portion of any state or federal employment
tax obligations arising out of the transactions contemplated by Sections 1.5(c)
and (d) hereof), current portion of capital leases, accrued expenses, deferred
revenue and fees reimbursable (but shall exclude contract billings in excess of
earned revenues, accrued interest to the extent included in Company Indebtedness
and liabilities resulting from Permitted Expenditures at Closing to the extent
included in Company Indebtedness), determined in all cases, as applicable, in
accordance with GAAP consistent with the Company's past practice; provided that
Final Net Working Capital shall include as current liabilities any Company
Indebtedness and any Transaction Expenses, to the extent such amounts were not
previously deducted from the Merger Consideration as part of the Adjustment
Amount. In addition, for purposes of calculating the Final Net Working Capital,
in the event the Closing Cash Amount set forth on the Final Balance Sheet is (x)
less than the Closing Cash Amount set forth on the Estimated Closing Balance
Sheet (such deficiency, the "Cash Deficiency"), the Final Net Working Capital
shall be reduced by such Cash Deficiency, or (y) greater than the Closing Cash
Amount set forth on the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet (such excess amount, the
"Cash Excess Amount"), the Final Net Working Capital shall be increased by such
Cash Excess Amount. The parties agree that the Net Working Capital shall be
calculated strictly in accordance with Schedule 1.11(b) and Section 1.11(b)
hereof.

         In addition, for the purposes of this Agreement:

(i)      "Company Indebtedness" shall mean any indebtedness of the Company or
         any of its Subsidiaries for borrowed money, and all other outstanding
         notes for indebtedness issued by the Company or any Subsidiary in
         connection with acquisitions by the Company or any Subsidiary, whether
         current or funded, or secured or unsecured, matured or unmatured, and
         without duplication, including all interest accrued thereon through
         the Closing Date and excluding all prepayment fees or premiums
         associated therewith (which are considered Transaction Expenses under
         Section 5.9 hereof), and including, in any case, Financing approved as
         a Permitted Expenditure to the extent such amount otherwise would
         constitute Indebtedness, as of the Closing Date, and including any
         Financing to the extent not approved as a Permitted Expenditure.

(ii)     "Closing Cash Amount" shall mean Company cash (excluding cash or
         investments held in the Company's accounts or by any Third-Party in
         connection with an escrow or similar arrangement or cash used to
         collateralize the long-term portion of obligations of the Company).

(iii)    "Permitted Expenditures" shall mean such costs, fees, or expenses
         (whether capital or operating and whether current or long-term) and any
         related Financing, requested to be incurred by the Company and approved
         by the Parent in its sole and absolute discretion within ten (10) days
         (or such shorter or longer period of time as may be mutually agreed to
         by the parties) of the Company's written request (the "Approval
         Period"), which the Company has determined in good faith is necessary
         to effectuate the associated New Business Opportunity; provided that,
         without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company
         acknowledges that the Parent may place reasonable conditions on its
         approval of any Permitted Expenditures.  The Company agrees that in
         requesting the approval of the Permitted Expenditures and any related
         Financing, the Company shall provide the Parent with prompt notice and
         reasonable detail of such expenditures, the New Business Opportunity
         and any related Financing.

(iv)     "Additional Expenditures" shall mean such costs, fees or expenses
         (whether capital or operating and whether current or long-term) and any
         related Financing, requested to be incurred by the Company and not
         approved by the Parent within the Approval Period, which the Company
         has determined in good faith is necessary to effectuate the associated
         New Business Opportunity. In the event that the Parent does not approve
         the Company's request to treat an Additional Expenditure or any
         Financing as a Permitted Expenditure, the Parent shall provide the
         Company, in reasonably detail, the basis for its objection.

(v)      "New Business Opportunity" shall mean (i) any new business opportunity
         of the Company, or (ii) any expansion of the Company's Business, that
         is, in each case (a) not included in the Company's Current Budget and
         (b) pursued in good faith, in furtherance of the Company's Business and
         in a manner that would not violate the provisions of Article IV (other
         than Sections 4.1(a), 4.3, 4.7(b)(i), 4.9(a), 4.10, 4.14, 4.19(b)
         (except for "most favored nation" clauses or other similar type
         restrictions) and 4.21).

(vi)     "Financing" shall mean any secured or unsecured financing entered into
         or utilized by the Company in good faith to finance any Permitted
         Expenditure or Additional Expenditure, as applicable, which financing
         shall (i) not exceed the aggregate amount of the subject Permitted
         Expenditure or Additional Expenditure, as applicable, and (ii) be upon
         commercially reasonable terms. Any Financing approved by Parent as a
         Permitted Expenditure, shall be treated as a Permitted Expenditure (and
         excluded from Company Indebtedness) and any Financing not approved by
         Parent as a Permitted Expenditure shall be included in Company
         Indebtedness.

(vii)    "Current Budget" shall mean the Company's current operating budget
         dated February 7, 2006, a true, correct and complete copy of which has
         been provided to Parent.

.................. (c) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date,
         but not later than sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, the Parent
         shall prepare and deliver to the Shareholder Representative (i) an
         unaudited schedule (the "Final Balance Sheet") setting forth the
         Company Indebtedness, Closing Cash Amount, Transaction Expenses,
         Permitted Expenditures and the Net Working Capital (the "Final Net
         Working Capital" and together with the Final Balance Sheet, the "Final
         Statements") of the Company as of the Closing Date calculated by the
         Parent in accordance with GAAP consistent with the Company's past
         practice, and (ii) a schedule (together with any appropriate back-up
         information) describing in reasonable detail the differences between
         the Estimated Net Working Capital and the Final Net Working Capital.

.................. (d) Within forty-five (45) days of delivery of the Final
         Statements, the Shareholder Representative may deliver written notice
         (the "Protest Notice") to the Parent of any objections that the
         Shareholder Representative may have to the Final Statements. Such
         Protest Notice shall set forth in reasonable detail (to the extent
         calculable) the basis of such objection together with the amount(s) in
         dispute and any determination not specifically objected to in the
         Protest Notice shall be deemed acceptable and shall be final and
         binding upon the parties upon delivery of the Protest Notice. The
         failure of the Shareholder Representative to deliver such Protest
         Notice within the prescribed time period will constitute the
         Shareholder Representative's acceptance of the Final Statements as
         determined by the Parent. Upon receipt of the Final Statements, the
         Shareholder Representative shall be given reasonable access, during
         normal business hours, to all of the Company's (including the Surviving
         Corporation's) books and records (including working papers, schedules
         and calculations) reasonably relating to the Final Statements for the
         purpose of verifying the Final Statements.

.................. (e) Upon receipt of a Protest Notice within such forty-five
         (45) day period, the Parent and the Shareholder Representative shall
         attempt in good faith to resolve any dispute regarding the calculation
         of the Final Statements. If the Parent and the Shareholder
         Representative are unable to resolve any disagreement with respect to
         the Final Statements within twenty (20) days following Parent's receipt
         of the Protest Notice, then such dispute shall be submitted to a
         nationally recognized accounting firm mutually agreed upon, in good
         faith, by the Parent and the Shareholder Representative (the
         "Arbitrating Accountant"). The Arbitrating Accountant will send to the
         Parent and the Shareholder Representative, within thirty (30) days of
         the date on which such dispute is referred to such Arbitrating
         Accountant, its determination on the specific matters in dispute which
         calculation shall be between the determinations prepared by the
         Shareholder Representative and Parent and shall be final and binding on
         all parties. The fees, costs and expenses of the Arbitrating Accountant
         shall be paid half by the Parent and half by the Shareholder
         Representative.

.................. (f) Within five (5) days of the determination of the Final
         Net Working Capital in accordance with Sections 1.11(c), (d) and (e),
         as applicable:

.................. (i) if the Final Net Working Capital is greater than the
         Estimated Net Working Capital, the Parent shall pay to the Shareholder
         Representative, for the benefit of the holders of the Company Stock,
         Options and Warrants, in immediately available funds, the amount of
         such excess (the "Excess Amount"); or

.................. (ii) if the Estimated Net Working Capital is greater than the
         Final Net Working Capital (such amount the "Working Capital
         Shortfall"), Parent shall be entitled to recover such amount from the
         Escrow Fund.

         Each of the parties acknowledge and agree that in the event of a
Working Capital Shortfall, the Parent shall be entitled to recover the full
amount of the Working Capital Shortfall from the Escrow Fund without regard to
the Deductible or any other limitations set forth in Section 8.3(a) hereof. The
Shareholder Representative shall distribute or cause to be distributed the
Excess Amount to the holders of Company Stock, Options and Warrants in
accordance with Schedule 1.8(c).

ARTICLE II........

                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

         As used in this Agreement, the term "Material Adverse Effect" means any

the Company to the Parent and the Merger Sub concurrently with the execution and
delivery hereof and updated, if applicable, pursuant to Section 5.7(a) hereof,
the Company hereby represents and warrants to the Parent and the Merger Sub, as

properties and to conduct the its business as currently conducted. The Company
and each Subsidiary is qualified as a foreign corporation or partnership in each
jurisdiction in which it is required to qualify to do business except to the

Company infringes on or misappropriates any third party's Proprietary Assets;
(ii) against the use by the Company of the Proprietary Assets used in the
business of the Company as currently conducted; or (iii) challenging the

misappropriation of any of the Proprietary Assets owned by the Company by any

Company has not received any written notice that any employees of the Company
that are obligated under any Contract (including licenses, covenants or
commitments of any nature) or other agreement, or subject to any judgment,
decree or order of any court or administrative agency, that would interfere with
their duties to the Company or that would conflict with the business of the
Company as presently conducted or proposed to be conducted, taken as a whole. It
will not be necessary for the Company to utilize any inventions, trade secrets
or proprietary information of any of its employees made prior to or outside of
their employment by the Company.

or services is subject to any outstanding decree, order, judgment, or
stipulation by a Governmental Authority restricting in any manner the licensing

Knowledge of the Company, no facts or circumstances exist that would cause the
Company or any Subsidiary to be unable to renew its existing insurance coverage
under the Policies as and when the same shall expire upon terms no less
favorable than those currently in effect, other than possible increases in
premiums that do not result from any act or omission of the Company or any

after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor (which shall be
a nationally recognized investment banking firm) is superior to the Company's
shareholders from a financial or strategic point of view and taking into account
the likelihood of consummation of the proposed transaction on the terms set
forth therein (as compared to, and with due regard for, the terms herein) and
all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and any other
relevant factors, than the transactions contemplated by and in this Agreement.

applicable law, (y) the Company has notified the Parent in writing of the
determination set forth in clause (x) above no later than the date of such
determination, and (z) at least five (5) calendar days following receipt by the

5.7      Notification.

(a) Updates by the Company.

(i) Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, the Company shall
give prompt notice in writing to the Parent of:

(A) the discovery by the Company of any event, condition, fact or circumstance
that occurred or existed on or prior to the Agreement Date and that caused or
constitutes or that is reasonably likely to cause or constitute a breach of any
representation or warranty made by the Company in this Agreement;

(B) any event, condition, fact or circumstance that first occurs, arises or
exists after the Agreement Date and that would cause or constitute or that is
reasonably likely to cause or constitute a breach of any representation or
warranty made by the Company in this Agreement (as to which the Company had no
Knowledge or notice as of the Agreement Date) if (1) such representation or
warranty had been made as of the time of the occurrence, existence or discovery
of such event, condition, fact or circumstance, or (2) such event, condition,
fact or circumstance had occurred, arisen or existed on or prior to the date of
this Agreement;

(C) any breach of any covenant or obligation of the Company under this

(ii) If any event, condition, fact or circumstance that is required to be
disclosed pursuant to Section 5.7(a)(i) hereof requires any material change in
the Company Schedule of Exceptions or if any such event, condition, fact or
circumstance would require such a change assuming the Company Schedule of
Exceptions was dated as of the date of the occurrence, existence or discovery of
such event, condition, fact or circumstance, then the Company shall promptly
deliver to the Parent an update to the Company Schedule of Exceptions specifying
such change (a "Company Schedule of Exceptions Update"). Any update specifying
an item to be disclosed solely pursuant to Section 5.7(a)(i)(B) hereof shall be
deemed to supplement and amend the Company Schedule of Exceptions for the
purpose of determining the accuracy of any representations and warranties made
by the Company for the purpose of Article VIII hereof, but shall not update the
Company Schedule of Exceptions for the purpose of determining whether any of the
conditions set forth in Section 6.3 hereof has been satisfied. Notwithstanding
anything therein to the contrary, no such update relating to Section
5.7(a)(i)(A), (C) or (D) hereof shall be deemed to supplement or amend the

reasonably likely to cause or constitute a breach of any representation or
warranty made by the Parent or the Merger Sub in this Agreement (as to which
neither the Parent nor the Merger Sub had Knowledge or notice as of the
Agreement Date) if (1) such representation or warranty had been made as of the
time of the occurrence, existence or discovery of such event, condition, fact or
circumstance, or (2) such event, condition, fact or circumstance had occurred,
arisen or existed on or prior to the date of this Agreement;

(C) any breach of any covenant or obligation of the Parent or the Merger Sub
under this Agreement; and

the Parent Schedule of Exceptions or if any such event, condition, fact or
circumstance would require such a change assuming the Parent Schedule of
Exceptions was dated as of the date of the occurrence, existence or discovery of
such event, condition, fact or circumstance, then the Parent shall promptly
deliver to the Company an update to the Parent Schedule of Exceptions specifying
such change (a "Parent Schedule of Exceptions Update"). Any update specifying an
item to be disclosed solely pursuant to Section 5.7(b)(i)(B) hereof shall be
deemed to supplement and amend the Parent Schedule of Exceptions for the purpose

or (ii) determining whether any of the conditions set forth in Section 6.2
hereof has been satisfied.

5.8      Further Assurances.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties
hereto will use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) perform, comply with and
fulfill all obligations, covenants and conditions required by this Agreement to
be performed, complied with or fulfilled by such party prior to or as of the
Closing Date, and (ii) take, or cause to be taken, all action, and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary or proper under applicable Legal
Requirements for it to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) If at any time after the Closing any further action is necessary to carry

as provided in Section 7.2(d) hereof or as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement. For the purposes of this Agreement, "Transaction Expenses" shall mean
such party's out-of-pocket costs, fees or expenses incurred and unpaid or to be
incurred on or before the Closing Date, payable by such party to its agents,
attorneys, accountants, investment bankers, lenders or other advisors in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including all prepayment fees or premiums associated therewith (as if the
related indebtedness was prepaid on the Closing Date) and such party's
proportion of filing fees payable under or pursuant to the HSR Act; provided,
however, that for the avoidance of doubt, Transaction Expenses as it relates to
the Company shall not include any costs, fees or expenses or other payments
incurred and paid on or before the Closing Date, or in connection with or

any similar matters including facility closures, mass or other layoffs or other
similar events.

5.10     Employee Benefits.

(a) For a period of at least one (1) year immediately following the Closing
Date, the Parent shall provide the employees of the Company hired or retained by
the Parent or the Surviving Corporation following the Closing ("Continuing
Employees") with base compensation, bonus opportunity and annual and long-term
incentive compensation that are in the aggregate, on an employee-by-employee
basis, no less favorable than those which the Continuing Employees were provided
by the Company immediately prior to the closing. Continuing Employees shall not
include any employees of the Company that are expressly hired or retained on a
short-term or limited basis by the Parent or the Surviving Corporation.

(b) For a period of at least one (1) year immediately following the Closing
Date, the Parent shall, pursuant to plans and arrangements established or
maintained by the Parent (the "Parent Benefit Plans") or Plans assumed by the
Parent in the Merger (the "Assumed Plans"), provide the Continuing Employees
with 401(k), health and welfare benefits (excluding any sabbatical or
sabbatical-like programs) which are no less favorable in the aggregate than
those which the Continuing Employees were provided under the Plans immediately
prior to the Closing (which new 401(k), health or welfare benefits may include
change in control or severance benefits which are less favorable in the
aggregate than those provided to the Continuing Employees immediately prior to
the Closing). The Parent shall ensure that the Parent Benefit Plans or Assumed
Plans treat employment of the Continuing Employees by any of the Company and its
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing the same as employment by any of the Parent,
Surviving Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries from and after the
Closing Date solely for purposes of eligibility and vesting, but not benefit
accrual under the Plans.

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, from and after the Closing
Date, except as agreed to by any Continuing Employee and the Parent, the Parent
will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary thereof to,
honor any change in control, severance payments or benefits accrued and payable
under the plans and agreements with respect to Continuing Employees as of the
date hereof and on the terms of such plans and agreements as in effect on the
Agreement Date. The Parent acknowledges and agrees that the consummation of the
Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will constitute a
"change in control," "change of control," "Corporate Transaction," and a
"Liquidity Event" or other similar provisions of the Company for purposes of
such plans and agreements and agrees to honor the provisions under such plans
and agreements relating thereto.

5.11     Indemnification of Former Directors and Officers.


(a) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
honor and fulfill in all material respects the obligations of the Company under
any and all indemnification agreements in effect as of the Agreement Date
between Company and any of its current or former directors, officers and key
employees (the "Indemnified D&O Parties"). In addition, for a period of six (6)
years following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the
Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to contain
provisions with respect to indemnification and exculpation that are at least as
favorable to the beneficiaries thereof as the indemnification and exculpation
provisions contained in the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company
as of the Agreement Date, and, during such six (6) year period, such provisions
shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any material respect,
except as required by applicable law.

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall, prior to
the Effective Time, purchase a "tail" or "runoff" insurance policy, to become
effective as of the Effective Time, covering the current and former officers and
directors of Company during the six (6) year period immediately following the
Effective Time with respect to acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (the "D&O Policy"), and during such period the Surviving
Corporation shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain such "tail" or
"runoff" policy in full force and effect for the term of such policy. In the
event that the full cost of the D&O Policy is not paid by the Company in full
prior to the Closing Date, the Parent will not be required to expend in any year
an amount in excess of one hundred and fifty percent (150%) of the annual
aggregate premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance; provided
that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the
Parent will be obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a
policy with best coverage available, in the reasonable judgment of the Parent,
for a cost not exceeding such amount. The current annual premium paid by the
Company for such insurance is set forth on Schedule 5.11(b) of the Company
Schedule of Exceptions.

(c) The obligations under this Section 5.11 shall not be terminated, amended or
otherwise modified by the Parent in such a manner as to materially and adversely
affect any Indemnified D&O Party (or any other person who is a beneficiary under
the D&O Policy (and their heirs and representatives)) without the prior written
consent of such affected Indemnified D&O Party or other person who is a
beneficiary under the D&O Policy (and their heirs and representatives). Each of
the Indemnified D&O Parties or other persons who are beneficiaries under the D&O
Policy (and their heirs and representatives) are intended to be third party
beneficiaries of this Section 5.11, with full rights of enforcement as if a
party hereto, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 8.9 hereof. The rights
of the Indemnified D&O Parties (and other persons who are beneficiaries under
the D&O Policy (and their heirs and representatives)) under this Section 5.11
shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that such
persons may have under the Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws, any and all
indemnification agreements of or entered into by the Company, or under
applicable law or in equity.

(d) In the event that the Surviving Corporation (or any of its successors) shall
consolidate or merge with any other person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger, or transfers at
least 50% of its properties and assets to any other person, then in each case
proper provision shall be made so that the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity (or its successors or assigns, if applicable), or transferee of such
assets, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 5.11.

terminate pursuant to this Section 7.1(f) with respect to such breach if such
breach is curable and shall have been cured within twenty (20) days following
notice by the other party of such breach, provided the breaching party continues
to use commercially reasonable efforts to cure such breach during such twenty

of one percent (1%) of the Merger Consideration.

executed by the Parent, the Merger Sub and the Company. Any amendment effected
pursuant to this Section 7.3 shall be binding upon all parties hereto.

7.4 Waiver. Any term or provision of this Agreement may be waived in writing at
any time by the party or parties entitled to the benefits thereof. Any waiver
effected pursuant to this Section 7.4 shall be binding upon all parties hereto.
No failure to exercise and no delay in exercising any right, power or privilege
shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of
any right, power or privilege preclude the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege. No waiver of any breach of any covenant or agreement hereunder shall

other covenant or agreement. The rights and remedies of each party under this
Agreement are in addition to all other rights and remedies, at law or in equity,

(a) any breach (as that term is understood within the meaning of Section 8.3(a)
hereof) of any representation or warranty (except as modified by any Company

Company in this Agreement or in any certificate that is required to be

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Deductible be reduced for

any representation or warranty contained in Article II has been breached, with
respect to any breach of a representation or warranty made by the Company
pursuant to Article II hereof that contains any "material" or "Material Adverse
Effect" qualifications, the representation or warranty shall be deemed breached
to the extent that it is untrue or incorrect without giving effect to such
qualifications (other than the qualifications contained in the representations
and warranties set forth in Section 2.7, Section 2.9(w) and Section 2.21(b),
which shall be given effect for all purposes under this Section 8.3(a)), in each
case, except as modified by any Company Schedule of Exceptions Update
contemplated by Section 5.7(a)(i)(B)). For the avoidance of doubt, in the event
of a Working Capital Shortfall, the Parent Indemnified Persons shall be entitled
to recover the full amount of the Working Capital Shortfall from the Escrow Fund
without regard to the Deductible or other limitations set forth in this Section
8.3(a), provided that any such Working Capital Shortfall shall not reduce the
Deductible.

(b) On and after the Closing, except for equitable claims, recovery from the
Escrow Fund shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parent Indemnified
Persons for any Damages arising out of, or in connection with, this Agreement,
in accordance with the terms of this Article VIII; provided, however, that in
the event of a breach of Section 8.1(c) by a holder of Company Stock (each, a
"Breaching Holder"), the Parent Indemnified Persons may recover Damages from the
Escrow Fund in an amount not to exceed the Damages incurred by the Parent caused
by such breach from the Breaching Holder's aggregate Per-Share Escrow
Consideration, and if the Damages exceed the Breaching Holder's aggregate
Per-Share Escrow Consideration, may further seek Damages from the Breaching
Holder in an amount up to, but not exceeding (when taken together with the
Breaching Holder's aggregate Per-Share Escrow Consideration) the Breaching
Holder's aggregate Common Per-Share Merger Consideration. Upon distribution of
any amounts in the Escrow Fund pursuant to this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall reduce only such Breaching Holder's aggregate
Per-Share Escrow Consideration (and no other holder's aggregate Per-Share Escrow
Consideration) in an amount equal to the Damages incurred by the Parent pursuant
to the Breaching Holder's breach of Section 8.1(c), up to the total amount of
such Breaching Holder's aggregate Per-Share Escrow Consideration. All claims for
Damages made by a Parent Indemnified Person against the Escrow Fund shall be
made in accordance with the terms of this Article VIII and the Escrow Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event that a Breaching
Holder's breach of Section 8.1(c) relates to such holder's ownership of shares
of the Company's Series E Preferred Stock, then the Parent Indemnified Persons
shall not recover Damages from the Escrow Fund, but shall instead seek to
recover Damages only from such Breaching Holder in an amount not to exceed the
Damages incurred by the Parent caused by such breach, but in no event exceeding
such Breaching Holder's aggregate Per-Share Series E Consideration.

(c) The amount of Damages incurred by the Parent Indemnified Persons hereunder
will be determined net of (i) any amounts recovered by the Parent Indemnified
Persons under applicable insurance policies with respect to such Damages, and
(ii) the amount of any reduction in Taxes payable by the Parent Indemnified
Persons resulting from the Damages sustained; provided, however, that any Tax
savings resulting from such a claim shall be determined only after applying all
other deductions and losses, including any net operating loss carryforwards,
available to the Indemnified Party, as if the Tax savings arising from such
claim did not exist (for example, all existing net operating loss carryforwards
would have to be exhausted before a "Tax savings" would be actually realized
from such a claim) and provided further that creating or increasing a net
operating loss carryforward shall be deemed not to create a Tax savings.

(d) In the event that any misrepresentation or breach of warranty, agreement or
covenant by the Company is known to or discovered by the Parent or the Merger
Sub at or prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement or at or prior
to the Closing (except to the extent of any Company Schedule of Exceptions
Update contemplated by Section 5.7(a)(i)(B)), and the Parent and the Merger Sub
nevertheless elect to close, the Parent Indemnified Persons will not be deemed
to have waived such misrepresentation or breach and will continue to have the
right to indemnification, payment of Damages or other remedy based on such
misrepresentation or breach.

8.4 Limitations on Indemnification by the Parent and the Merger Sub.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the obligation of the
Parent and the Merger Sub to indemnify the Company Indemnified Persons pursuant
to Section 8.2 hereof is subject to the following limitations and
qualifications:

(a) Except for equitable claims, the Parent and the Merger Sub will have no
indemnification liability under Section 8.2(a) hereof until the total amount of
Damages incurred by the Company Indemnified Persons hereunder exceeds the
Deductible, in which event the Parent shall be obligated to indemnify the
Company Indemnified Persons from and against all Damages in excess of such
Deductible. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Deductible be
reduced for any claims resulting in Damages of less than Fifteen Thousand
Dollars ($15,000), determined on an individual, not on an aggregate, basis. For
the purposes of determining (x) whether the Deductible has been satisfied, (y)
the amount of Damages that the Company Indemnified Parties may recover from the
Parent and the Merger Sub once the Deductible has been reduced to zero (0), and
(z) whether any representation or warranty contained in Article III has been
breached, with respect to any breach of a representation or warranty made by the
Parent or the Merger Sub pursuant to Article III hereof that contains any
"material" or "Material Adverse Effect" qualifications, the representation or
warranty shall be deemed breached to the extent that it is untrue or incorrect
without giving effect to such qualifications, in each case, except as modified
by any Parent Schedule of Exceptions Update contemplated by Section
5.7(b)(i)(B)).

(b) The Parent and the Merger Sub will have no indemnification liability under
Section 8.2 hereof to the extent that all Damages incurred by the Company
Indemnified Persons hereunder exceed Twenty-Four Million One Hundred Twenty-Five
Thousand Dollars ($24,125,000), except for equitable claims.

(c) The amount of Damages incurred by the Company Indemnified Persons hereunder
will be determined net of (i) any amounts recovered by the Company Indemnified
Persons under applicable insurance policies with respect to such Damages, and
(ii) the amount of any reduction in Taxes payable by the Company Indemnified
Persons resulting from the Damages sustained; provided, however, that any Tax
savings resulting from such a claim shall be determined only after applying all
other deductions and losses, including any net operating loss carryforwards,
available to the Indemnified Party, as if the Tax savings arising from such
claim did not exist (for example, all existing net operating loss carryforwards
would have to be exhausted before a "Tax savings" would be actually realized
from such a claim) and provided further that creating or increasing a net
operating loss carryforward shall be deemed not to create a Tax savings.

(d) In the event that any misrepresentation or breach of warranty, agreement or
covenant by the Parent or the Merger Sub is known to or discovered by the
Company at or prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement or at or
prior to the Closing (except to the extent of any Parent Schedule of Exceptions
Update contemplated by Section 5.7(b)(i)(B)), and the Company nevertheless
elects to close, the Company Indemnified Persons will not be deemed to have
waived such misrepresentation or breach and will continue to have the right to
indemnification, payment of Damages or other remedy based on such
misrepresentation or breach.

8.5      Time Limitations.

(a) If the Closing occurs, no amounts will be recoverable from the Escrow Fund
(excluding any amounts in the Shareholder Representative Escrow Fund by the
Shareholder Representative) under this Article VIII with respect to any Damages
arising out of, or in connection with, this Agreement, in accordance with the
terms of this Article VIII, unless on or before the Escrow Termination Date the
Parent notifies the Escrow Agent and the Shareholder Representative under the
Escrow Agreement of a claim (a "Parent Escrow Claim") specifying the factual
basis of that claim in reasonable detail to the extent then known by the Parent
in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

(b) If the Closing occurs, the Parent or the Merger Sub will have no
indemnification liability under this Article VIII with respect to any Damages
arising out of, or in connection with, this Agreement, in accordance with the
terms of this Article VIII, unless on or before the Escrow Termination Date the
Shareholder Representative notifies the Parent of a claim specifying the factual
basis of that claim in reasonable detail to the extent then known by the
Shareholder Representative.

(c) Subject to the requirements of this Article VIII, the Escrow Fund shall
remain in existence until the Escrow Termination Date (the "Escrow Period").
Upon the expiration of the Escrow Period, the remaining amount of the Escrow
Fund shall promptly be distributed to holders of the Company Stock, Options and
Warrants from the Escrow Agent in accordance herewith and with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement; provided, however, that the Escrow Period shall not terminate
with respect to any portion of the Escrow Fund or Shareholder Representative
Escrow Fund which is necessary to satisfy an unsatisfied Parent Escrow Claim, as
provided in the Escrow Agreement. Promptly following the resolution or
satisfaction of any Parent Escrow Claim, the Escrow Agent shall deliver to the
Shareholder Representative the remaining portion of the Escrow Fund not then
required to satisfy any other unsatisfied Parent Escrow Claims. The Shareholder
Representative shall promptly distribute such amounts to the holders of the
Company Stock, Options and Warrants in accordance herewith and with the terms of
the Escrow Agreement, which amounts will be distributed in proportion to such
holder's pro rata portion of the remaining Escrow Fund. In the event of any
inconsistencies between this Section 8.5(c) and the terms of the Escrow
Agreement, the terms of the Escrow Agreement shall govern.

8.6      Procedure for Indemnification - Third Party Claims.


(a) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified person under Section 8.1 or Section
8.2 hereof (an "Indemnified Person") of notice of the assertion of any
third-party claim against such Indemnified Person in respect of which the
Indemnified Person desires to seek indemnification from an indemnifying person
(an "Indemnifying Person") pursuant to the terms of this Article VIII, (i) in
the case of any claim brought against any Parent Indemnified Person, the Parent
shall give written notice of the assertion of such third-party claim to (A) the
Company, in the case such notice is delivered prior to the Closing or following
the termination of this Agreement, or (B) the Shareholder Representative, in the
case such notice is delivered on or after the Closing, and (ii) in the case of
any claim brought against any Company Indemnified Person, the Company (in the
event such notice is delivered prior to the Closing or following the termination
of this Agreement) or the Shareholder Representative (in the event such notice
is delivered on or after the Closing) shall give written notice to the Parent of
the assertion of such third-party claim (any such indemnification notice, an
"Indemnification Notice"; the recipient of such notice pursuant to clauses (i)
or (ii) above, the "Indemnifying Person Representative") of the assertion of
such third-party claim; provided, however, that the failure to notify the
Indemnifying Person Representative will not relieve any Indemnifying Person of
any liability that it may have to any Indemnified Person, except to the extent
that the defense of such third-party claim is actually and materially prejudiced
by the Indemnified Person's failure to give such notice.

(b) If an Indemnified Person provides an Indemnification Notice to the
Indemnifying Person Representative, the Indemnifying Person Representative will
be entitled to participate in the defense of such third-party claim and, to the
extent that the Indemnifying Person Representative wishes, by providing written
notice thereof to the Indemnified Person within ten (10) Business Days of the
delivery of the Indemnification Notice to the Indemnified Person Representative,
to assume the defense of such third-party claim with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; provided, however, that the Indemnifying
Person Representative will not have the right to assume the defense of such
third-party claim in the event (x) (i) the third-party claim relates to or
arises in connection with any alleged criminal liability of the Indemnified
Person, or (ii) the Indemnifying Person is also a Person against whom the
third-party claim is made and the Indemnified Person reasonably determines that
joint representation would be inappropriate, and (y) the Indemnified Person
notifies the Indemnifying Person Representative in the Indemnification Notice
that the facts described in clauses (i) or (ii) above are applicable and that
the Indemnified Person is electing to assume the defense of such third-party
claim.

(c) After notice from the Indemnifying Person Representative to the Indemnified
Person of its election to assume the defense of such third-party claim pursuant
to Section 8.6(b) hereof, the Indemnifying Person will not, so long as the
Indemnifying Person Representative diligently conducts such defense, be liable
to the Indemnified Person under this Article VIII for any fees of other counsel
or any other expenses of the Indemnified Persons with respect to the defense of
such third-party claim, in each case subsequently incurred by the Indemnified
Person in connection with the defense of such third-party claim. If the
Indemnifying Person Representative assumes the defense of a third-party claim,
no compromise or settlement of such third-party claims may be effected by the
Indemnifying Person Representative without the Indemnified Person's written
consent (which may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless
(x) there is no finding or admission of any violation of Legal Requirements or
the rights of any other Person by any Indemnified Person, (y) the sole relief
provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Person,
and the Indemnified Person will have no liability with respect to any compromise
or settlement of such third-party claims effected without its consent and (z)
the Indemnified Person is unconditionally released from any liability arising
from such third party claim.

(d) If (i) notice is given to the Indemnifying Person Representative of the
assertion of any third-party claim and the Indemnifying Person Representative
does not, within ten (10) Business Days after the Indemnified Person's notice is
given, give notice to the Indemnified Person of its election to assume the
defense of such third-party claim pursuant to Section 8.6(b) hereof, or (ii) the
Indemnified Person elects to assume the defense of such third-party claim in the
Indemnification Notice in accordance with Section 8.6(b) hereof, no compromise
or settlement of such third-party claim may be effected by the Indemnified
Person without the Indemnifying Person Representative's written consent (which
may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless (x) there is no
finding or admission of any violation of Legal Requirements or the rights of any
other Person by any Indemnifying Person, (y) the sole relief provided is
monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnified Person, and the
Indemnifying Persons will have no liability with respect to any compromise or
settlement of such third-party claims effected without its consent and (z) the
Indemnified Person is unconditionally released from any liability arising from
such third party claim.

(e) With respect to any third-party claim subject to indemnification under this
Article VIII: (i) both the Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying Person
Representative, as the case may be, shall keep the other Person fully informed
in all material respects of the status of such third-party claim and any related
claims, actions, suits proceedings (including, without limitation, arbitration
or alternative dispute resolution proceedings) or investigations by or before,
or otherwise involving, any Governmental Entity at all stages thereof where such
Person is not represented by its own counsel, and (ii) the parties agree (each
at its own expense) to render to each other such assistance as they may
reasonably require of each other and to cooperate in good faith with each other
in order to ensure the proper and adequate defense of any third-party claim.

(f) With respect to any third-party claim subject to indemnification under this
Article VIII, the parties shall cooperate in such a manner as to preserve in
full (to the extent possible) the confidentiality of all confidential
information and the attorney-client and work-product privileges. In connection
therewith, each party agrees that: (i) it will use commercially reasonable
efforts, in respect of any third-party claim in which it has assumed or has
participated in the defense, to avoid production of confidential information
(consistent with applicable law and rules of procedure), and (ii) all
communications between any parties hereto and counsel responsible for or
participating in the defense of any third-party claim will, to the extent
possible, be made so as to preserve any applicable attorney-client or
work-product privilege.

(g) Anything to the contrary in this Article VIII notwithstanding, the Company
Indemnified Persons shall be entitled to control the defense of any third-party
claim relating to or arising in connection with any Taxes of the Company or any
Subsidiary that are brought by a third-party prior to the termination of the
Escrow Agreement and for which the Company Indemnified Persons have an
obligation to indemnify the Parent Indemnified Persons pursuant to Section 8.1
hereof and shall be entitled to settle, compromise or otherwise resolve such
third-party claims, provided that such settlement, compromise or resolution
shall be subject to the written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld) of the Parent Indemnified Persons if such settlement, compromise or
resolution would reasonably be expected to increase the Taxes of the Company or
any Subsidiary for any period beginning after the Closing Date; provided,
however, that all third-party claims relating to arising in connection with
Taxes of the Company or any Subsidiary for a Straddle Period shall be governed
by Sections 8.6(a) - (f) hereof. For purposes of this Section 8.6(g), "Straddle
Period" shall mean any taxable period beginning on or prior to and ending after
the Closing Date.

8.7 Procedure For Indemnification - Other Claims. A claim for indemnification
for any matter not involving a third-party claim may be asserted by notice to
the party from whom indemnification is sought.

8.8 Treatment of Indemnity Payments. Any payment made by the Company to a Parent
Indemnified Person pursuant to this Article VIII will be treated as an
adjustment to the Merger Consideration for all Tax purposes.

8.9 Exclusive Remedy. The right to indemnification in this Article VIII will be
the exclusive remedy of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter
hereof; provided, however, that the foregoing restriction will not limit
equitable claims by any party.

8.10     Shareholder Representative.

(a) The parties hereto have agreed that it is desirable to designate Sightline
Partners LLC to serve, commencing as of the Effective Time, as the true and
lawful representative, agent and attorney-in-fact of each and all of the holders
of the Company Stock, Options and Warrants (the "Shareholder Representative")
for certain limited purposes as set forth herein. The adoption of this Agreement
by the holders of the Company Stock shall constitute ratification and approval
of such designation, and the irrevocable constitution and appointment of the
Shareholder Representative as set forth herein. The Shareholder Representative
shall have such power and authority necessary to carry out the functions
assigned to the Shareholder Representative under this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement, including but not limited to the power and authority:

(i) to execute and deliver the Escrow Agreement, and to enter into any
amendments, modifications and/or waivers in respect thereof;

(ii) to enforce, defend and protect the rights and interests of the holders of
the Company Stock following the Closing under this Article VIII and under the
Escrow Agreement, and to take any and all actions that the Shareholder
Representative believes are necessary or appropriate under this Article VIII and
under the Escrow Agreement for and on behalf of the holders of the Company
Stock, including, without limitation, asserting, pursuing or defending any claim
by or against the Parent or the Surviving Corporation, consenting to,
compromising or settling any such claim, and conducting negotiations with the
Parent or Surviving Corporation; and

(iii) to make, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such other agreements,
notices, requests, instructions and other writings, and, in general, to do any
and all things and to take any and all actions that the Shareholder
Representative may consider necessary or appropriate in connection with carrying
out its responsibilities under this Article VIII and the Escrow Agreement.

(b) The Shareholder Representative will be entitled to engage such counsel,
experts and other agents as the Shareholder Representative deems necessary or
proper in connection with performing its obligations hereunder and under the
Escrow Agreement, and will be promptly reimbursed by amounts in the Shareholder
Representative Escrow Fund for all reasonable Shareholder Representative
Expenses incurred by the Shareholder Representative in such capacity, up to an
amount equal to Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000). In addition, the
Shareholder Representative shall be entitled to receive a fee, in the amount of
Four Hundred Dollars ($400) per hour, for the performance of its services
hereunder and under the Escrow Agreement following the Closing Date (the
"Shareholder Representative Fee"). To the extent not paid out of the Shareholder
Representative Escrow Fund, the Shareholder Representative Fee shall be paid to
the Shareholder Representative from the Escrow Fund following the Escrow
Termination Date before any distributions therefrom are made to the holders of
Company Stock, Options and Warrants in accordance with Section 8.5(c). The
Shareholder Representative shall not be liable to any holder of Company Stock,
Options or Warrants, and each holder of the Company Stock, Options and Warrants
shall indemnify and hold harmless the Shareholder Representative, pro rata based
upon, and up to an amount not to exceed, the Merger Consideration paid to such
holder, from any and all Damages that are incurred by the Shareholder
Representative as a result of actions taken, or actions not taken, by the
Shareholder Representative herein, in each case except to the extent of any
gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Shareholder Representative. In
taking any action whatsoever hereunder, the Shareholder Representative shall be
entitled to and protected in relying upon any notice, paper or other document
believed by the Shareholder Representative in good faith to be genuine, or upon
evidence deemed by the Shareholder Representative in good faith to be
sufficient. With respect to its service as the Shareholder Representative, the
Shareholder Representative shall have no liability as such to the Parent, the
Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation hereunder.

(c) All amounts received by the Shareholder Representative on behalf of the
holders of the Company Stock (whether under this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement), will be promptly paid by (or promptly caused to be paid by) the
Shareholder Representative to the holders of the Company Stock, Options and
Warrants in accordance herewith and the Escrow Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Shareholder Representative will be entitled to reimbursement of
any amounts payable to the Shareholder Representative under Section 8.10(b)
hereof including Shareholder Representative Expenses and Shareholder
Representative Fees from the Shareholder Representative Escrow Amount.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Shareholder Representative,
at its option, may set off any amounts due under Section 8.10(b) including
Shareholder Representative Expenses and the Shareholder Representative Fees
against amounts otherwise payable to the holders of Company Stock, Options and
Warrants from the Escrow Fund pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement. In addition, in the event the Shareholder Representative
receives amounts from holders of Company Stock, Options or Warrants to reimburse
or contribute toward Shareholder Representative Expenses, the Shareholder
Representative may set off amounts otherwise payable to holders of Company
Stock, Options and Warrants from the Escrow Fund in order to refund to holders a
pro rata portion of such amounts that were reimbursed or contributed, in order
to ensure that all holders bear an equal pro rata portion of any such
Shareholder Representative Expenses.

(d) The Parent, Surviving Corporation and the Escrow Agent shall each have the
right to rely upon all actions taken or not taken by the Shareholder
Representative pursuant hereto and the Escrow Agreement, all of which actions or
omissions shall be legally binding upon the holders of the Company Stock or any
of them.

(e) The Shareholder Representative may resign upon thirty (30) days' prior
written notice to the Parent and the Escrow Agent. If the Shareholder
Representative resigns, the holders of a majority of the Company Stock as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall designate another Person to act as
the Shareholder Representative hereunder. All rights to indemnification,
exculpation and payment in favor of the Shareholder Representative hereunder
shall survive any such resignation and appointment of a successor Shareholder
Representative.

shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without limitation."
The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of

The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that this Agreement has been reviewed,
negotiated and accepted by all parties hereto (after due counsel from their
legal and other applicable representatives) and shall be construed and
interpreted according to the ordinary meaning of the words used so as to fairly
accomplish the purposes and intentions of the parties hereto. No provision of
this Agreement shall be interpreted or construed against any party hereto solely
because such party or its legal representative drafted such provision. The
parties hereto waive the application of any law, regulation, holding or rule of
construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will
be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document. Any
reference to any federal, state, local or foreign statute or law shall be deemed

9.3 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts,
all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties
and delivered to the other party, it being understood that all parties need not
sign the same counterpart.

9.4 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the documents and instruments and other
agreements among the parties hereto as contemplated by or referred to herein,
including the Exhibits and the Schedules, constitute the entire agreement among
the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof.

9.5 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction
to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will
continue in full force and effect and the application of such provision to other
Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the
intent of the parties hereto. The parties further agree to replace such void or
unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision
that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other
purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

9.6 Other Remedies; Specific Performance. Except as otherwise provided herein,
any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by
law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy
will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree
that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the
United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

9.7 Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial. This Agreement shall be governed by,
and interpreted in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware without
regard to any conflicts of laws principles that would require the application of
any other law (except to the extent that mandatory provisions of federal law are
applicable); provided, however, that the laws of the respective jurisdictions of
incorporation of each of the parties shall govern the relative rights,
obligations, powers, duties and other internal affairs of such party and its
Board of Directors. The parties hereto irrevocably submit to the non-exclusive
jurisdiction of (i) the Delaware State Courts and (ii) the United States Court
for the District of Delaware for the purposes of any action arising out of this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby. The parties hereto
further agree that service of any process, summons, notice or document hand
delivered or sent by U.S. registered mail to such party's respective address set
forth in Section 9.1 hereof shall be effective service of process for any action
in Delaware with respect to any matters to which it has submitted to
jurisdiction as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence. The parties
hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waive any objection to the laying of
venue of any action arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby in (i) the Delaware State Courts or (ii) the United States
District Court for the District of Delaware, and hereby further irrevocably and
unconditionally waive and agree not to plead or claim in any such court that any
such action brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.
Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives any and all right to trial
by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby or the actions of the Company, the Parent
or the Merger Sub in the negotiation, administration, performance and
enforcement hereof.

9.8 Entire Understanding; No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement
represents the entire understanding of the parties hereto with reference to the
transactions contemplated hereby and this Agreement supersedes any and all other
oral or written agreements heretofore made. Except as expressly provided in this
Agreement, nothing herein expressed or implied is intended to confer upon any
Person, other than the parties hereto or their respective successors, any
rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this
Agreement. Holders of Company Securities are third-party beneficiaries for the
purposes of Section 1.5, Section 1.8 and Section 1.9 hereof.

9.9 Assignment. No party may assign either this Agreement or any of its rights,
interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval of the
other parties hereto; provided, however, that the Parent may assign its rights
under this Agreement as collateral security to any lender. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns.

9.10 Incorporation of Exhibits and Schedules. The Exhibits and Schedules
identified in this Agreement are incorporated herein by this reference and are
made a part hereof.
